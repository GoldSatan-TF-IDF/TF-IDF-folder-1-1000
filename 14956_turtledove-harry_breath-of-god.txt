harry turtledove breath of god gap i the breath of god blew down hard from the north here in the bizogot country near the glacier the wind off the great ice sheet blew hard all winter long hamnet thyssens own breath smoked as if he were puffing on a pipe he wished he were though ulric skakki liked tobacco better than he did unless raumsdalian traders had brought a little up from the south there was none for hundreds of miles count hamnet was a raumsdalian himself he was large and dark and dour with a black beard that had a streak of white above a scar and some scatterings of gray elsewhere and that looked whiter now than it really was what with all the rime and snow caught in it he wore bizogotstyle furs and leather with the stout felt boots that were the best footgear ever made for fighting cold in spite of hooded jacket and furred trousers he felt the frigid weather like an icepick in his bones ulric was up from the south too though hamnet wasnt sure the foxyfaced adventurer had been born inside the borders of the raumsdalian empire whether he had or not he spoke raumsdalian perfectly these days pitching his voice to carry through the shrieking wind he said things could be worse how hamnet asked we could have frozen to death already oh you dont freeze to death up here not if youre careful you just wish you could ulric said which was true thats not what i meant a couple of thousand years ago we could have enjoyed this lovely weather down near nidaros sigvat ii the raumsdalian emperor ruled from nidaros these days two thousand years earlier the great city was no more than a hunting camp on the edge of hevring lake the meltwater filling the lake came from the glacier which in those days lay just to the north the glaciers had fallen back all this way in the years since nidaros was almost temperate these days barley grew there most years and wheat in the warmer ones hevring lake was long gone when the ice dam that corked it melted through it poured out to the west in a great flood that carved out the badlands still scarring that terrain despite the warming weather in the south or rather because of it hamnet thyssen bared his teeth in a mirthless grin better that some ways than this what ulric mocked without mercy i thought you always wanted to go beyond the glacier not always i didnt used to think there was anything beyond the glacier hamnet answered and even after i found out there was i didnt want what lived beyond the glacier coming here curse it life is full of surprises ulric skakki said which would have been funny if only it were funny for some time now the glacier had been melting back towards the northwest and northeast leaving a corridor of open land the gap between the two great frozen sheets now at last the gap had melted through allowing travelers from the south to discover what lay on the far side of the glacier up until that finally happened hamnet thyssen had always thought the northern glaciers went on forever so had most raumsdalians and most of the nomadic bizogots who lived north of them the golden shrine as far as count hamnet was concerned the golden shrine was only a myth he knew better now oh not about the golden shrine which might still be mythical for all he could prove but hed gone beyond the glacier himself hed seen the striped cats called tigers which preyed there in place of the lions and sabertooths he knew hed seen the great brown bears that scooped salmon from streams unfrozen in summer hed seen vast herds of deer with both stags and does bearing blunttined antlers and hed seen the folk who rode those deer as men on this side of the glacier rode horses the rulers they called themselves they not only herded woolly mammoths as the bizogots had for centuries uncounted but rode them to war with lancers and men with long long lances on the beasts shaggy backs the rulers seemed convinced any folk not of their blood were animals to be tamed like mammoths or hunted and killed like wolves and tigers they were not warriors to be despised and their sorcerers had strength neither raumsdalian wizards nor bizogot shamans could easily withstand trasamund rode up to hamnet and ulric he too looked north anything he asked doing his best not to sound worried he was a big burly man bigger than hamnet thyssen with piercing blue eyes and a thick curly redgold beard almost like a pelt hard to tell with this snow your ferocity but i dont think so hamnet gave the jarl of the three tusk clan his proper title of respect even if the rulers pouring down through the gap had shattered the clan and left him a jarl with only a remnant of a folk to rule trasamunds pride remained grand as ever grander maybe to help compensate for all hed lost a couple of men from the red dire wolves are right behind me trasamund said you southerners can ride for the tents now i know youre feeling the weather worse than a man born to it would it gets this cold down in the empire ulric skakki said it just doesnt stay this cold from fall through the start of spring well go in anyway warm yourselves get some food you need more when it does stay like this trasamund was right about that count hamnet had seen as much he ate like a dire wolf to keep from freezing and didnt gain an ounce the bizogot paused an anxious look flitting across his face you can find your way back to the tents by yourselves in this weather it wasnt an idle question with snow and wind wiping out tracks almost as fast as they were made with visibility short someone who didnt know how to make his way across the frozen steppe could wander till he froze to death all the same both hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki smiled they werent bizogots born to the northern plains but they could manage smiling still ulric said yes mother dear trasamunds snort birthed a young fogbank scoff all you please he said any bizogot clan will tell you about raumsdalian traders who ended up stiff clean through because they thought they knew more about this country than they really did well get there hamnet thyssen said he wheeled his horse the beast seemed glad to face away from the breath of god hamnet and ulric rode south towards the encampment housing the remnants of the three tusk clan and the red dire wolves who guested them and who reluctantly joined them in the war against the rulers one stretch of snowy windswept ground really did look a lot like another count hamnet was starting to wonder whether he and ulric had bragged too soon when the bizogots mammothhide tents appeared in the distance the mammoths thick skins and the long shaggy dark brown hair on them offered a barrier formidable even to the fiercest gales all the same entrances invariably faced south they did down in the empire too hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki tethered their horses behind a snowblock wall that shielded the animals from the worst of the wind theyd bought the horses in nidaros but the animals were of the small shaggy bizogot breed better suited to the harsh northern weather than other horses hamnet ducked into the tent belonging to totila the jarl of the red dire wolves he needed a moment to get used to the gloom inside a couple of bone lamps burning butter made from the milk of musk oxen and mammoths gave only a dim flickering light a brazier that burned dried dung added a little heat but not much the brazier and lamps did contribute to the pungency hamnet thyssen knew his nose would soon get used to it but it was fierce when hed just come in from the fresh if frigid steppe chamber pots of leather and wickerwork had tight lids and people emptied them often but their reek hung in the air so did that of unwashed bodies hamnets own among them bathing in winter in the bizogot country was asking for anything from chest fever to frostbite anything raumsdalian totila asked the red dire wolves jarl sounded worried for which count hamnet could hardly blame him now his clan along with what was left of trasamunds stood on the front line against the rulers any blow that fell would probably fall on him he relaxed a little when hamnet thyssen shook his head and said no hamnet let his hood drop down off his head and undid the top toggle on his fur jacket it was warmer inside the tent though more from the body heat of the people it sheltered than from the braziers feeble little fire i sense nothing amiss nothing close anyhow liv was the shaman from the three tusk clan she was close to thirty with golden hair short and greasy and dirty as the bizogots hair commonly was cheekbones as proud and sharp and angular as the glacier and eyes of the deepest blue count hamnet had ever seen hed studied those eyes from very close range indeed he and liv were lovers she was the only woman hed met since gudrid left him who made him oh not forget his former wife but remember she wasnt the only fish in the sea and if that wasnt a miracle hamnet thyssen had never met one totila went right on worrying would you he asked or could their magic mask their moves so you wouldnt know till they got right on top of us it could liv said seriously at which the jarl gnawed on his lower lip hamnet understood how he felt he himself had fretted over the way things went in his county down in the southeastern part of the empire and his domain never faced danger close to that which hovered above the red dire wolves like a teratorn soaring through the air in search of a fresh corpse to gnaw what good are your precious senses then totila snapped liv didnt rise to his anger and fear maybe no good she answered but i dont think so masking movement on that scale isnt easy for us or for the rulers and we have sentries out she nodded towards hamnet even if my spells do fail sharp eyes shouldnt theyd better not the jarl said he too nodded towards hamnet though his expression was gruff not fond feed yourself we have meat and you need to stoke your fire i know the raumsdalian took off his mittens the meat came from a mammoth liver hamnet thyssen impaled a chunk on a long bone skewer and started toasting it over the dungfueled brazier through most of the year the bizogots didnt have to worry about salting meat or smoking it to keep it edible they had the biggest ice chest in the world right outside their tents they also had peculiar tastes or so it seemed to a man from farther south listen to a bizogot and hed tell you meat cooked with wood lacked flavor they were used to what dung fires did and they liked it count hamnet was getting used to it too he had to or eat his meat raw or starve whether he would ever like it was a different question mammoth liver would have been strongflavored stuff no matter what it was cooked over hamnet stolidly ate he had to get used to being as carnivorous as a sabertooth too no grain up here no bread no porridge no potatoes or turnips or even onions in summer the bizogots varied their diet with the small sweet berries that quickly ripened and then were gone those in the southern part of the frozen steppe gathered honey from the few hardy bees that buzzed about when the weather warmed and flowers blossomed frantically they were fond of mushrooms but for that they ate meat and occasionally fish nothing wrong to the north youre sure liv said he shook his head theres plenty wrong to the north and we both know it but i didnt see any sign that the rulers were about to swoop down on the red dire wolves thats what i meant liv said but i dont think theyll wait much longer hamnet thyssen liked the flavor of that even less than he liked the flavor of dungcooked mammoth liver is that your feeling he asked or is it what your magic tells you not mine audun gillis the shaman answered his seems better at piercing the wards the rulers use than mine does she didnt sound jealous merely matteroffact where is audun anyway hamnet asked the raumsdalian wizard usually stayed in the jarls tent too hed never learned much of the bizogot tongue and needed another raumsdalian or liv or trasamund to translate for him hes with theudechild in the tent where she stays liv said oh hamnet left it there he wondered what the bizogot woman saw in audun gilli who was short and slight and unprepossessing and could hardly talk to her whatever it was she doted on him and audun seemed to like her well enough hed lost his family some years earlier and lived in a drunken stupor till ulric skakki plucked him from the gutter literally and made him dry out getting drunk among the bizogots took dedication except for beer and wine brought up from the south their only tipple was smetyn fermented muskox or mammoth milk it was sour and not very strong the mammothherders poured it down though something else occurred to hamnet hes with theudechild the lamps are still lit so what liv said people look the other way they pretend not to hear when you live in crowded tents most of the year you have to do things like that ive seen your houses with all their rooms she dropped in a couple of raumsdalian words for things the bizogots didnt have and didnt need to name you can get away from one another whenever you please all we have are blankets and the sense not to look when its none of our business not many raumsdalians had that kind of sense maybe they didnt need it so much on the other hand maybe they would have got along better if they had more of it hamnet said well its good to see audun happy too was it good to see himself happy he had to think about that he wasnt used to thinking of himself as happy after what gudrid did to him and after the way he spent years brooding and agonizing about what she did to him he was much more used to thinking of himself as miserable but he wasnt not any more so it is liv said did she know how happy she made him if she didnt it wasnt because he didnt try to show her and was that a twinkle in her eye or only a flicker from one of those odorous lamps whatever it was she asked are you bizogot enough to think blankets and the sense not to look are enough im not a bizogot at all and i never will be count hamnet paused but not for long i dont suppose that means i cant act like one though i am here after all not much later he did his very best to pretend he and liv had all the privacy in the world by the small sounds she made even when trying to keep discreetly silent his best seemed good enough musk oxen were made for the frozen plains the bizogots roamed their shaggy outer coats and the thick soft hair that grew closer to the hide warded them against the worst the breath of god could do they knew how to scrape snow away with their hooves to uncover plants frozen under the snow when danger threatened they formed protective circles with the formidably horned bulls and larger cows on the outside and the smaller females and calves within dire wolves and lions took stragglers now and again but they had to be desperately hungry to attack one of those circular formations the bizogots hadnt fully domesticated the musk oxen they herded but the beasts were used to having men around the herders helped protect them from predators and preyed on the musk oxen themselves despite the threat from the rulers the red dire wolf bizogots had to follow the herds if they lost them they would starve and the survivors from the three tusk clan and the raumsdalians up from the south took their turn tending the musk oxen too the three tusk bizogots knew just what to do all across the northern steppe the bizogots tended their animals in much the same way hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki did their best and seemed to pick up what they needed to know fast enough to suit the red dire wolves audun gilli also did his best not even the bizogots said anything else how good that best was careful audun count hamnet pitched his voice to carry through the howling wind if you get too close youll spook them if i stay this far away though i have trouble seeing the front part of the herd the wizard answered patiently hamnet said other riders are up there were not doing this by ourselves you know we worry about the beasts close to us they worry about the ones close to them and when we put everything together the job gets done i suppose so audun gilli sounded distinctly dubious better one person should be able to take care of everything that was a wizards way of looking at the world wizards had as much trouble cooperating as cats did and used weapons sharper and deadlier than fangs and talons working together meant sharing power and secrets and power and secrets didnt like to be shared audun and liv had teamed up a couple of times against sorcery from the rulers but it wasnt easy or natural for them one person would need to use magic to take care of a whole herd of musk oxen hamnet thyssen said do you want to try audun thought about that it didnt take a whole lot of thought well no he admitted shaking his head good hamnet said if youd told me yes i would have thought you were as arrogant as one of the rulers i hope not audun exclaimed the worst thing about them is they have the strength to back up their arrogance that makes them think they have some natural right to it the way they think they have the right to lord it over all the folk they can reach no count hamnet said the worst thing about the rulers is they can reach folk on this side of the glacier because of the gap i think we said the same thing audun gilli replied well maybe we did hamnet looked north towards the gap that had finally melted through the great glacier and towards the two enormous ice sheets that remained one to the northwest the other to the northeast he couldnt have seen the opening in the gap anyway it lay much too far north swirling clouds and blowing snow kept him from getting even a glimpse of the southern edge of the glacier now when the weather was clear those frozen cliffs bestrode the steppe like the edge of any other mountains but steeper and more abrupt hed had an odd thought not long before there were mountains in the west they ran north and north till the glacier swallowed them did any of their peaks stick out above the surface of the ice did life persist on those islands in the icebound sea were there even could there be men up there no one had ever seen fires burning on the glacier but no one had ever gone up there to look at close range either this time his shiver had nothing to do with the frigid weather trasamund had told him once that bizogots had tried to scale the glacier to see if they could reach the top it had to be at least a mile maybe two or three almost straight up the mammothherders hadnt managed it they were probably lucky they hadnt killed themselves one mistake on that unforgiving climb would likely be your last you might have too long to regret it as you fell though hamnet thyssen imagined men roaming from one unfrozen mountain refuge to another he imagined them trying to come down to the bizogot country stepping off the edge of the glacier as if off the edge of the world descending might be even harder than reaching the top of the glacier down near the bottom you had at least some margin for error up above the tiniest mischance would kill you sure as sure he suddenly realized audun gilli had said something to him im sorry what was that he said you caught me woolgathering above the woven wool that muffled his mouth and nose the wizards eyes were amused i must have you seemed as far away as if someone had dropped you on top of the glacier that made hamnet shiver again wizards knew things sometimes they didnt know how they knew or even that they knew but know they did well ask me again hamnet said im here now how lucky for you audun still seemed to think it was funny i said what do we do when the rulers strike the red dire wolves the best we can what else is there hamnet answered bleakly how good is the red dire wolves shaman how much help can he give you and liv old odovacar audun gilli rolled his eyes livs got more brains in her little finger than he does in his head he turned them all into beard audun wasnt far wrong about the shamans beard it reached almost to his crotch even so count hamnet said are you sure you can talk with liv now shes learned raumsdalian and why havent you learned more of the bizogots tongue but that was an argument for another day hamnet went on odovacar might be clever enough with spells in his own language yes he might be but he isnt audun said ive talked with him through liv he has one spell down solid he can take the shape of a dire wolf but even when hes in mans form he hasnt got any more sense than a dire wolf im surprised nobodys caught him sitting on his haunches licking his ballocks that started a laugh out of hamnet even so he said odovacar must be able to do more than that shamans cant be shamans on so little whoever he learned from surely taught him other things too oh i suppose he can find lost needles and read the weather and do some other little tricks that wont help us against the rulers at all audun said but the one thing the shaman of the red dire wolves has to do is commune with dire wolves and by god odovacar can do that and since he can they forgive him for all the things he cursed well cant do starting with learning anything he didnt get from his teacher a thousand years ago dont exaggerate mock severity filled hamnet thyssens voice odovacar cant be a day over eight hundred ha the raumsdalian wizard laughed for politeness sake alone because he plainly didnt find it funny however old he is hes outlived his usefulness if you dont believe me talk to your lady love shes as fed up with him as i am talk to your lady love audun gilli had lost his wife too in circumstances more harrowing than hamnet s but he didnt seem jealous that the other raumsdalian had won livs love hamnet was glad he wasnt audun might have made a rival since he and liv had sorcery in common if i thought she cheated on me the way gudrid used to id worry about audun now hamnet shook his head if you let thoughts like that grow they would poison whatever good youd found in your life when he pulled his mind away from that notion it lit on a different one odovacar communes with real dire wolves you say well he doesnt smoke a pipe with them or anything like that but he goes out wandering when he wears wolf shape audun gilli answered he must meet real dire wolves when he does and they havent eaten his scrawny old carcass yet thats what im driving at hamnet thyssen said do you suppose he could go out as a dire wolf and rally the real ones against the rulers audun started to shake his head but then caught himself i dont know he said slowly it might be worth a try the rulers wouldnt like packs harrying their riding deer would they harrying them too come to that if odovacar can bring it off and if he goes out in a wolfskin and doesnt come back the red dire wolves might be better off are you sure you re not wearing ulric skakkis skin hamnet asked the adventurer was more likely to come out with something that cynically frank audun pulled off a mitten and lifted his cuff nothing up my sleeve but me he said and thought for a little while you know your grace that could work the rulers wouldnt like dire wolves worrying at their animals or at them who would count hamnet said the other nice thing about this is they may have a harder time returning the favor why audun gilli frowned then his face cleared oh i see what you mean no dire wolves on the far side of the glacier just those smaller skinnier beasts thats what i meant hamnet thyssen agreed maybe the dire wolves would be friendly to a wizard in the hide of one of those other wolves but maybe theyd have him for supper instead thats how id bet well well see what odovacar thinks audun frowned again for that matter well see if odovacar thinks like every other bizogot shaman count hamnet had seen odovacar wore a ceremonial costume full of fringes and tufts his were all made from the hides and furs of dire wolves some were dyed red with berry juice others left their natural brown and gray and cream even old and bent and thin he was a big man he must have been enormous and enormously strong when in his prime getting anything across to him wasnt easy for hed grown almost deaf as he aged he used a hearing trumpet made from a muskox horn but it didnt help much audun gilli with his problems with the bizogot language didnt try to talk to the shaman he left that to hamnet and to liv she bawled into the hearing trumpet while hamnet thyssen shouted into odovacars other ear the racket they made surely disturbed some of the other red dire wolf bizogots but it bothered odovacar very little because he heard very little of it a wolf yes of course i can shape myself into a wolf he said many old mens teeth were worn down almost flat against their gums not his they were still long and sharp and white suggesting his ties to the red dire wolves fetish animal getting him to understand what to do after he went into dire wolfs shape took the best or maybe the worst part of an afternoon it wasnt that odovacar was stupid hamnet thyssen didnt think it was anyhow but he heard so little that getting anything across to him was an ordeal with audun gilli or another raumsdalian wizard count hamnet could have written down what he wanted nothing was wrong with odovacars eyes but writing didnt help him for the bizogots had no written language hamnet and liv had to keep shouting over and over again till one word at a time one thought at a time they tunneled through the wall deafness built between odovacar and the folk around him ah he said at last his own voice too loud because he wanted to have some chance of hearing himself you want me to lead the dire wolves against the invaders from the north yes hamnet thyssen hoped it was yes or did odovacar think he and liv meant they wanted him to take command of the red dire wolves human warriors by then nothing would have surprised hamnet overmuch but odovacar had it right i can do it he said in that loud cracked quavering old mans voice he began to sway back and forth chanting a song that sounded as if it was in the bizogot language but that hamnet couldnt follow livs nod said she could he slowly rose and started to dance there inside his tent at first the dance seemed little more than swaying back and forth while on his feet more or less in rhythm to the song he chanted but it got more vigorous as the song went on the chant grew more vigorous too hamnet still couldnt understand it but growls and snarls began replacing some of the sounds that seemed like bizogot words the tune though stayed the same odovacars fringes shook his long white beard whipped back and forth in the lamplight his eyes blazed yellow yellow hamnet thyssen rubbed at his own eyes like almost all bizogots odovacar had iceblue eyes but was this still odovacar the man hamnet shook his head no not wholly not any more liv was nodding in understanding and hamnet thought in admiration as she watched the change sweep over the other shaman she was used to seeing such things shed probably shifted shape herself though count hamnet didnt think shed done it since hed known her she might take it for granted but it raised the raumsdalians hackles odovacar dropped down onto all fours his wolfskin jacket and trousers and his own beard all seemed to turn into pelt his teeth already long and white grew whiter and much longer while his tongue lolled from his mouth his nose lengthened into a snout his ears grew pointed and stood away from his head he wore a wolfs tail attached to the seat of his trousers as the spell took hold it was still a wolfs tail it was his tail attached to him as any beast s tail was attached to it as if to prove as much it lashed back and forth can you hear me hamnet thyssen asked in a small voice odovacar the dire wolf was doubtless still old but seemed much less decrepit than odovacar the man and he swung his fierce head towards hamnet and nodded somewhat as a dog might nod but also somewhat as a man might shapeshifters kept some of their human intelligence in beast form how much hamnet wasnt sure even they could answer that question once they returned to human shape you know what you are to do liv sounded far more respectful of the shaman as a dire wolf than she had of him as a man odovacar nodded again a sound that wasnt a word but was agreement burst from his throat hamnet thyssen had heard an owl that was also a wizard use human speech but that was under the influence of the magic liv used to capture it not through the spell the wizard used to transform himself good liv said go then and god go with you one more nod from odovacar who bounded out through the southfacing tent flap he made another sound once he was out in the open air a canine cry of joy pure and unalloyed to a dire wolfs senses the inside of the tent had to be cramped and smelly unlike people wolves werent made to be confined in such places hamnet thyssen stuck his head out into the cold odovacar trotted purposefully off to the west wagging his tail as he went yes he was glad to get away he seems happier as a dire wolf hamnet said i suppose he is liv answered but he will die sooner if he keeps that hide and not the one he was born with he knows that even as a wolf he knows it he will do what needs doing what he can recall of it in beast shape and we will see how much good it does us quite a bit i hope hamnet thyssen stuck his head out into the cold again like odovacar he was sometimes glad to get free of the bizogot tents himself living through the long northern winters in the enforced close company of the mammothherders wasnt easy for a man of his basically solitary temperament if he werent in love with liv he wondered if he could have done it dont get frostbite she told him in this climate an even more serious warning than it would have been down in the empire i wont he wanted to twist around so he could look north towards the gap north towards the grazing grounds of the three tusk clan the grazing grounds the rulers had stolen in his minds eye he saw swarms of dire wolves raiding those grounds feasting on the rulers riding deer dragging down musk oxen that couldnt keep up with the herds maybe even killing mammoth calves if they wandered away from their mothers and he saw something else even if it wasnt so clear as he wished it were when he ducked back into the big black tent again some of what he imagined hed seen must have shown on his face for liv said what is it whats wrong i dont know he answered but weve thought a lot about how we can hit back at the rulers what have they been thinking about all this time i dont know that either and i wish i did whatever it is i dont think were going to like it the sun had turned in the sky days were still short shorter than they ever got in nidaros but they were getting longer each day the sun rose a little farther north and east of due south swinging away from the tiny arc it made in the southern sky around the solstice each day it set a little farther north and west of due south and each day became more of a day not just a brief splash of light punctuating the long hours of darkness hamnet thyssen would have hoped the longer daylight hours meant warmer weather in that he was disappointed but not much surprised down in the empire the worst blizzards usually came after the turning of the year but before longer days finally led to the spring thaw those blizzards started here when the breath of god howled down off the glacier spring would take longer to get here and would have a looser grip when it finally did odovacar returned to the red dire wolves tents hamnet thyssen saw him ambling in still in direwolf shape he was heavier than he had been when he set out but he walked with a limp a long halfhealed gash scored his left hind leg for a moment the shaman didnt seem to know count hamnet lips lifted away from those formidable fangs a growl sounded deep in the odovacarwolfs throat the bizogots told of shamans who turned beast so fully they couldnt come back to mans shape again but odovacar hadnt gone that far with a humansounding sigh he went into the tent that had been his a moment later totila joined him word must have spread like lightning for liv and audun gilli ducked in together inside of another couple of minutes by then odovacar the dire wolf was already swaying back and forth in a beasts version of the dance the shaman had used to change shape the growls and barks and whines that came from the animal had something of the same rhythm as the song odovacar had used when he was a man and he became a man again his muzzle shortened his beard grew out on his cheeks and chin he had a chin again his ears shrank the light of reason came back to his eyes the hair on his back and flanks was a pelt no more but fringed and tufted wolfskin jacket and trousers his dire wolfs tail now plainly had been taken from a wolf and was a part of him no more he let out a long weary sigh more regret than relief if hamnet thyssen was any judge well im back he said his voice as rusty as a sword blade left out in the rain im back he repeated as if he needed to convince himself after so long in beast shape chances were he did have you harried the foe totila asked can you do it again at need we have done what we could odovacar answered slowly speech still seemed to come hard for him it is less than i hoped better than nothing he shrugged stooped shoulders yes he was old such is life and the rulers the rulers are very strong and very fierce and they are gathering they are mustering the time is coming and coming soon his eyes blue again not wolfamber found first liv and then count hamnet well you were right the two of you i wish you were wrong but you were right they are a danger they are a deadly danger what did you do when you were a dire wolf hamnet asked in a low voice odovacar heard him without trouble maybe some of the dire wolfs sharper senses stayed with him for a little while hunted killed mated slept ran those are the things a dire wolf does he said harried the rulers herds fled when they hit back at us i told you they are strong and fierce i smelled watched too but scent matters more too many wolfbrothers die i was still man enough inside the dire wolfs head to sorrow not just to fear and i watched the foe gather and i smelled their muster and i came back and it might be better had i stayed a wolf a tear ran down his cheek ii by god i will do this thing or i will die trying trasamund said the mammoth from the red dire wolves herd pawed at the ground with a broad hairy forefoot looking for whatever forage it could find under the snow the hump on the mammoths back was far flatter than it would have been in warm weather the beast had burned through most of the fat reserve it carried from the good times it couldnt understand what the three tusk bizogots jarl was saying which was just as well hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki looked at each other hamnet had trouble putting what he wanted to say into words ulric as usual didnt do you have to do this thing right now your ferocity he asked and why not trasamund demanded because well need you for the fight against the rulers now count hamnet found the words he needed because if you kill yourself it will be the same as if they won a great battle they ride woolly mammoths to war trasamund said i swore i would do the same i will ride this beast you shall not stop me maybe hamnet and ulric could have tackled him and sat on him but even if he didnt try to draw his great twohanded sword and kill them both what good would that do he would only come out and try to ride a mammoth while they werent around if he fell if he was thrown clear they might be able to save him before the beast crushed the life out of him hamnet didnt believe it but it was possible now trasamund said and advanced on the mammoth its hairy ears flapped what was this manthing up to trasamund was a big man but seemed tiny beside the cow mammoth when he took hold of two big handfuls of mammoth hair and started scrambling up the beasts side hamnet thought he would die and about as unpleasantly as a man could the mammoths trunk flew up into the air and blared out a startled note the animal could have used the trunk to pluck off trasamund and throw him down to the snowcovered ground one of its great feet descending on his head or his chest and that would be that if i were mad enough to try to ride a mammoth i wouldnt be mad enough to try it that way ulric skakki said by god i hope i wouldnt anyhow i dont think theres enough gold in the world to get me up on a mammoths back count hamnet agreed not unless im up there with somebody who knows what hes doing i mean and since the rulers are the only ones who ride mammoths well there you are no there trasamund is ulric said im here where i belong on the ground and far enough away from that shaggy monster but in spite of trumpeting in surprise and alarm the mammoth didnt dash trasamund to the ground and trample him the red dire wolf bizogots said theyd chosen the gentlest animal in their herd and they seemed to mean it count hamnet wouldnt have let a cat climb him that had to be what it was like for the mammoth with a shout of triumph the jarl straddled the beasts broad back im here he roared i really am up here look at me he let out a loud wordless whoop almost as discordant as the mammoths trumpeting by god i dont think i got that excited the first time i went into a woman ulric said of course if youd seen the woman i did it with the first time you wouldnt have got very excited either hamnet thyssen had a hard time not laughing what did she think of you she thought id paid her and she was right ulric raised his voice to a shout now that youre up there your ferocity how do you make the mammoth go you think i havent got an answer trasamund yelled back shows what you know he pulled a stick from his belt the rulers use a goad to make the beasts obey and i can do the same he thwacked the mammoths right side get moving the rulers probably start training their mammoths when theyre calves hamnet said the animals know what the signals are supposed to mean this mammoths never run into them before what will it do you can see that and i can see that but do you really expect a bizogot to see that ulric skakki answered well the beasts hair is thick maybe it wont think hes hitting it hard enough to be really annoying hed better hope it doesnt because otherwise the last thing hell ever say is oops after trasamund belabored the mammoth for a bit it did start to walk he whooped again too soon the mammoth was going where it wanted to go not where he wanted it to go and it was going there faster and faster too first at a trot then at what had to be a boneshaking gallop trasamund had no saddle and no reins all he could do was hang on to handfuls of mammoth hair for dear life and he did ulric and hamnet mounted their horses and rode after the mammoth they made sure not to come too close spooking it might mean killing trasamund it might also mean getting killed themselves discretion seemed the better choice even now the woolly mammoth didnt try to pull the obstreperous human off its back it was a goodnatured beast the red dire wolves had chosen well and trasamund to hamnet thyssens surprise had the sense not to be too obstreperous after goading the mammoth into running he let it go till it wore itself out without trying to urge it on any more when it finally stopped breath smoking and great shaggy flanks heaving trasamund slid down and off over its tail nimble as one of the monkeys that sometimes came up in trade from lands in the distant south monkeys never lasted long in nidaros when the weather turned cold chest fever carried them away hamnet hadnt thought trasamund would last long on the mammoths back either he was glad to find himself wrong the bizogot trotted away from his enormous mount before it could decide to turn on him for revenge bravely done you idiot ulric skakki said call me whatever you please i dont care trasamunds grin was as wide and foolish and wondering as if he were just coming away from his first woman but you cant call me an oathbreaker by god i swore i would do this and i cursed well did and ill do it again too i have a question for you count hamnet said what was it like trasamund said ill tell you what it was like it but hamnet shook his head no that wasnt what i wanted to ask trasamund glowered at him it was what the bizogot jarl wanted to talk about pretending not to notice hamnet thyssen went on you might have done better smoother if youd asked one of our captives from the rulers how they ride their mammoths why didnt you thats what i want to know trasamund went from scowling to flabbergasted in the blink of an eye i never thought of it i wanted to find out for myself is that a bizogot or is that a bizogot ulric skakki said not loud enough for trasamund to hear hamnet thyssen nodded do you think the captives would give good advice or bad trasamund asked they might want to see anyone from this side of the glacier who gets on a mammoth die if we have mammothriders too that gives us a better chance against their brethren if we were talking about bizogots or raumsdalians id say you were right hamnet answered but if the rulers get captured theyre disgraced theyre cast out from their own folk they can never go back the sin or whatever they think it is clings to them thats why a lot of them try to kill themselves ulric added it is hamnet agreed but its also why i think you can rely on what they tell you in their eyes they arent of the rulers anymore because they know their own folk dont want them back and wont take them back if theyre going to live any kind of life at all they have to do it with us theyre queer birds all right trasamund said well maybe i will talk to them then if i like what they say ill try it and if i think they are lying to me theyll die but not so fast as theyd want to the cow mammoth lifted her trunk bugled once more and strode off with an air of affronted dignity you got away with that but if you think im happy about it youd better think again every line of her body told how she felt she might have been a frumpy matron down in nidaros offended because her soup was cold im just glad the rulers have held off from hitting us as long as they have ulric skakki said if theyd come after the red dire wolves right after they hit the three tusk bizogots i dont know how we could have stopped them my guess is my brave clan hurt them badly even in defeat trasamund said they havent pressed farther south because they cant it could be hamnet thyssen doubted it was but he was willing to let the three tusk jarl keep as much pride as he could but it could also be that theyre building strength up there bringing men and mammoths and riding deer down through the gap and getting ready for a big campaign if he were a chieftain of the rulers that was what he would have done makes sense to me ulric said i wish wed had more luck getting the bizogots to fight as one army and not by clans if theyre not careful theyll all go down separately one clan at a time getting bizogots to do anything together with other bizogots is like herding mosquitoes trasamund said they fly where they want they bite where they want and if they feel like biting the herder they do that too and the swifts and the swallows swoop down and eat them as they please hamnet said trasamund sent him a sour stare but couldnt very well claim he was wrong we need more spies up at the edge of the country the rulers hold hamnet went on i wish odovacars wolves could tell us more because its hard to get men up there without letting the rulers know maybe magic would serve where spies cant ulric said it had better by god trasamund said liv and audun gilli have been going on for a while now about how their toenails itch and that means the rulers have a hangover lets see what they can do when they set their minds to it and when old odovacar tosses in whatever he can if the rulers wizards catch them spying it may do us more harm than good hamnet thyssen said did he fear what the rulers wizards might do to liv if they caught her working magic against them he knew he did by the glint in ulric skakkis eye he knew the same thing a goldpiece is no good if it sits in your belt pouch youve got to spend it he said a soldier is no good if he sits in a tavern pinching the barmaids hes got to go out into the field and fight a wizards not worth much if he cant work magic thats all true every word of it trasamund said lets see what our shamans can do count hamnet wanted to hate both of them they aimed to send his beloved into danger but he found he couldnt for he knew they were right and he knew liv would say the same thing when anyone got around to putting the question to her and so he nodded heavily and hated himself instead audun gilli looked worried which would have alarmed hamnet thyssen more if audun didnt look worried so much of the time liv looked serious which again was nothing out of the ordinary odovacar looked like a man who wanted a skin of smetyn but as far as hamnet could tell the red dire wolves shaman was sober deciding what the three of them wanted to do hadnt been easy audun gilli still knew much less of the bizogot language than hamnet wished he did livs temper frayed with translating for him and for odovacar and the red dire wolves shamans deafness meant she had to shout the same thing over and over which did nothing to make her any happier after a lot of shouting not all of it having to do with odovacars bad ears by any means the three sorcerers decided to send a spirit animal to what had been the three tusk bizogots lands to see what the rulers were doing there livs spirit would make the spearhead of the magic audun gilli and odovacar would lend her strength and help ward her against anything the invaders tried what can go wrong hamnet thyssen asked liv the night before they tried the spell she shrugged all kinds of things shamanry is not a certain business especially when the enemys shamans fight against what you do that much the raumsdalian noble knew for himself whats the worst that can happen he asked maybe they can kill me liv answered maybe they can kill my spirit and leave my body alive without it which is worse do you think she sounded as if it were an interesting abstract question one with nothing to do with the rest of her life however long that turned out to be should you go on with this then yes hamnet feared for her warriors go into battle knowing they may not see the sun rise again liv said you have done this yourself you know it is so we need to find out what the rulers are doing im best suited to look out over the lands that were my clans that are my clans by god and see what the rulers are doing there it will be all right hamnet or if it isnt it will be the way it is it will be the way it is the hard life the bizogots led made them into fatalists most of the time hamnet thyssen admired that now it terrified him i dont want to lose you he exclaimed i dont want to lose you either liv said you asked for the worst and i told you i do not think it will come to that we are working on our home ground with spells we know i may not learn everything i want to but i should be able to get away again afterward does that make you feel better she sounded like a mother comforting a little boy whod had a nightmare the way they chose to comfort each other a little later had nothing to do with little boys though there was some small chance it might have made liv the mother of one afterward if the old jokes were true count hamnet should have rolled over and gone to sleep he didnt he lay awake a long time staring up at the darkness inside the mammothhide tent liv was the one who slipped quickly into slumber he supposed that was all to the good she would need to be fresh when morning came at last he did sleep he wished he hadnt his dreams were confused and troubled he hoped that didnt mean anything he was no wizard no foreteller all the same he wished they were better liv broke her fast on meat and marrow through the winter the bizogots ate little else she showed a good appetite hamnet thyssen had to force his food down it will be all right she said again of course it will he answered and hoped he wasnt lying the weather should have cheered him it was bright and sunny and not far below freezing after what theyd been through it felt like spring the equinox couldnt be far away the sun spent more time above the horizon every day but even after winter formally died the breath of god would go on blowing for another month maybe even six weeks only then would the snow melt the land turn to puddles mosquitoes and midges start breeding in mad and maddening profusion and the landscape go from white to flowersplashed green breathing didnt feel as if hamnet were inhaling knives getting out of the stuffy smelly tent was a relief to the nose too if any air was fresher and cleaner than that which came down off the glacier the raumsdalian couldnt imagine what it might be he looked north there stood the glacier tall as any other formidable mountains he wished the gap had never melted through then the rulers would still be walled off from the bizogot country and from the raumsdalian empire to the south but if the gap hadnt melted through trasamund wouldnt have come south to nidaros looking for help exploring the land beyond the glacier hamnet wouldnt have come north with him which meant he wouldnt have met liv he started to ask her if she thought the opening of the gap was worth it to her if their meeting made everything else worthwhile he started to yes but he wasnt fool enough to finish the question of course she would say no and she would have good reason to because the gap had melted through the rulers had crushed her clan her kinsfolk and friends the folk shed known all her life were dead or exiled or living under the heel of the invaders no she wouldnt think that was worth it she might have found love among her fellow bizogots even if she hadnt they would still roam their grazing grounds as free men and women nothing right now meant more to hamnet thyssen than she did as a raumsdalian he naturally thought nothing should mean more to her than he did but raumsdalians were and could afford to be more individualistic than bizogots to liv the clan mattered far more than the empire did to hamnet and he was by the standards of his folk a dutyfilled man here came audun gilli a somber look on his thin scragglybearded face and here came odovacar in his tufted and fringed shamans costume he carried a drum a frame made of mammoth bone with a muskoxhide drumhead tufts of direwolf fur and sparkling crystals attached with reddyed yarn dangled from it are we ready he asked if we arent what are we doing here liv replied audun gilli had picked up enough of the bizogot tongue to understand the simple question if not her reply he nodded to odovacar good good then let us begin the red dire wolves shaman tapped the drum once twice three times the tone was deeper and richer than hamnet thyssen had expected the rhythm to his surprise didnt put him in mind of a dire wolfs howl it was shorter and sharper it might have been bird tracks in the snow odovacar started to dance however old and stooped he was he moved with surprising grace and ease liv began dancing too her steps perfectly fit the beat of the drum count hamnet was almost taken aback that she left ordinary footprints in the snow not marks with three toes forward and one behind her arms flapped as if she were a bird audun gilli set semiprecious stones in a circle around the two bizogot shamans he murmured his chant so as not to interfere with the drum ward spell he told hamnet who nodded liv suddenly sat down in the snow her arms went on flapping i fly she said in the bizogot language like the snowy owl i fly her eyes seemed wider and more unwinking than they had any business being they didnt go yellow as odovacars had when he took wolf shape nor did she sprout feathers and fly in the flesh all the same she gave an overwhelming impression of owlishness fly north hunting owl odovacar sang in a loud unmelodious voice he thumped the drum fly north fly north spy out our foes he went on dancing as liv went on flapping if she was the arrow he was the bow that loosed her audun gilli stood ready just inside the ward circle he was still completely human and completely alert too if liv was arrow and odovacar bow he was the shield protecting them both the shield thats supposed to protect them anyhow hamnet thyssen thought uneasily audun had been the first to admit that the rulers magic was stronger than any known on this side of the glacier i fly liv said again like the snowy owl i fly fly north hunting owl spy out our foes odovacar sang to her what do you see hunting owl tell us what you see i see the lands of the three tusk clan the grandest grazing and hunting lands in all the bizogot country liv answered in calling them that owlliv saw with her heart not with her head the lands hard by the glacier were poor even by the sorry standards of the frozen steppe tell us more tell us more odovacar sang spy out our foes fly north fly north spy out our foes i see herds liv sounded dreamlike or perhaps owllike as her spirit soared far from her body i see herds of musk oxen i see herds of mammoths the herds seem large i see herds of deer all at once doubt came into her voice those riding deer had traveled down through the gap with the rulers they werent native to the bizogot country you begin to find the foe odovacar assured her tell us what you see before the foe finds you i see an encampment liv said it is wide it is broad all the tents are laid out in square array that surely marked it for a camp of the rulers the bizogots were not an orderly folk they scattered their tents every which way across the ground the rulers as count hamnet had seen beyond the glacier had far more discipline tell us more tell us more before the foe finds you even if they understood odovacar in a raumsdalian tavern they would have thrown things at him but he wasnt singing to entertain he worked with the charm to remind liv what to do i see men of the rulers tending to mammoths some of the mammoths must be theirs some are stolen from the bizogots though her spirit had flown far anger still fired her voice she went on i see women of the rulers they are ugly bitches that wasnt anger it was scorn does the foe ride to war does he mount mammoths and ride to war odovacar sounded more urgent now he probably couldnt hear her answers but he was bound to know others could i see i see i think i see for the first time liv hesitated were the rulers wizards working to thwart her her arms flapped faster as if she was flying away from the encampment her eyes widened i do see them by god i do they ready their host mammoths and deer without number soon they will sweep down on the red dire wolves how did they bring so much through the gap tell us more odovacar sang more we must hear more he thumped the drum harder as if to pull words from liv they are in a place we always called the four breasts because of the big frost heaves there she said that is a fine place to move south from the forage is always good there even horses have no trouble finding grass under the snow in winter it is easy for mammoths and musk oxen and i see it is easy for the riding deer the rulers use too then she gasped her body twisted she might have been banking in flight she let out an angry cry a cry that might have burst from a true owls throat her hands stretched into what were plainly meant for talons visible even through her mittens audun gilli gasped at the same time spirit hawks he said in raumsdalian and then drum her home odovacar quick the red dire wolves shaman spoke no raumsdalian even if he had he wouldnt have been able to hear audun but he too could sense what needed doing the rhythm of his drumming changed so did his chant back to safety he sang back to the tents of your folk evade all evil back to the tents you know so well how well did liv know the red dire wolves tents well enough to home on them hamnet thyssen watched in an agony of suspense that being the only thing he could do liv twisted again as if sliding away from something spirit hawks audun called whatever the rulers were mustering against her what did that mean no wizard himself hamnet didnt know then without warning liv reached out and grabbed with the claws that were really fingers ha she cried that one will trouble me no more audun gillis face twisted in pain whatever shed done he felt it they might as well slay that wizards carcass for his soul is dead he said somberly hamnet remembered what hed asked liv before her spirit flew one of the things shed feared most for herself shed just visited upon the rulers good hamnet thought do it again but by the way she moved she went back to trying to escape how many enemy sorcerers were flying against her riding the winds of the world and whatever equivalents the spirit world knew defeating one might be was bold and brave but a shaman flying alone surely couldnt hope to outfly and outfight a flock of foes here is the circle come back to the circle audun for once had the sense to speak the bizogot language not his own odovacars drumming also count hamnet hoped helped guide livs spirit back towards her body fly like the breath of god hamnet whispered harshly fly straight fly hard fly fast oh fly fast and then liv came back to her body once more no more than a couple of heartbeats after she sprang to her feet reason on her face once more and all owlishness banished from it two of the wardstones in auduns circle flared to brilliant life liv winced but stood steady odovacar lurched in his dance though he also stayed on his feet audun gilli grunted as if hed taken a punch in the belly but the circle held i saw enough liv said panting as if shed run or flown a long way can they strike you even with your spirit back in your body count hamnet asked still anxious for her i dont see how she answered i know we couldnt they were trying to hold my body and spirit apart now that ive returned to myself theyve failed no sooner were the words out of her mouth than she staggered odovacar cried out and dropped to one knee audun gilli shouted too in what seemed to hamnet mixed pain and surprise livs left hand shaped a bizogot gesture against evil audun pulled out an amulet he wore under his fur jacket and brandished it like a sword hamnet thyssen did draw his sword he slashed the air all around liv hoping to cut any influence lingering close by he had no idea whether that did any good he didnt see how it could hurt though begone liv said and her hand twisted into that sign again begone by god she sounded fierce and frightened at the same time hamnet had heard a lot of soldiers going into battle sound the same way odovacar barked and snarled and bared his teeth they always seemed long and sharp for a mere mans now they looked more than halfway wolfly hamnet thyssen didnt think he was imagining that he was sure he wasnt imagining things when the tension broke as quickly and cleanly as if he had severed it with his sword odovacar nodded and grinned and his teeth went back to normal again or as normal as they ever were audun gilli breathed a noisy sigh of relief he returned the amulet to its hiding place liv sighed too and shook her head every time i say what the rulers cant do i turn out to be wrong i wont say anything like that anymore they did strike you then the uh spirit hawks hamnet asked oh yes now she nodded shakily they chased me here and they struck me they struck me hard i dont know how they did but i do know i came off lucky to get away with nothing worse than scrapes and scratches on my spirit she paused visibly reconsidering that no not just lucky i had good friends and comrades who came to my aid she bowed to odovacar to audun and to hamnet i thank you all i dont think i did anything to be thanked for hamnet wished he knew more of magic loving a shaman made him feel foolish and ignorant but liv squeezed him hard enough to make the air leave his lungs in a startled oof you did you did she said and her eyes glowed couldnt you feel your blade cutting through the links between me and my pursuers what wise shaman taught you to do that i couldnt feel anything nobody taught me i didnt even know if i was helping he answered honestly i wanted to do something thats all she kissed him you were wonderful then she smiled at audun gilli and odovacar and so were you both of you you were wonderful had gudrid ever said anything like that to him in all the time they spent together if she had he couldnt remember it that made him wonder why hed loved her so fiercely and why hed felt so lost and damned when she played him false only one thing occurred to him i was a fool and i didnt know any better now what i saw liv said in tones that brooked no argument hamnet thyssen saluted her with clenched fist over his heart as if she were a raumsdalian general he wasnt sure she understood precisely the honor he was giving her but she did understand it was an honor with a smile aimed his way she went on the rulers muster for war they have a host of mammoths and those riding deer they used gathered together at the place we call the four breasts yes you said so as you uh flew hamnet reminded her he wondered how shed recognized it before the thaw set in and exposed the landscape beneath the blanket of snow he supposed bizogots marveled that raumsdalians could find their way through nidaros winding streets and alleys all what youre used to he thought the four breasts arent far north of the red dire wolves grazing grounds liv said to hamnet and audun she added we went almost that far before we found out the rulers had set on the three tusk clan so it seems likely they plan to come south and the red dire wolves stand in their way whats that odovacar asked liv repeated it louder then louder still at last the shaman nodded though count hamnet still wasnt sure he understood how many warriors do the rulers have hamnet asked a bizogot clans worth three ten could you tell liv frowned im not sure not when you put it like that they had many mammoths and many deer more i think than we could keep in one place for very long did they have men there too to move straight to the attack hamnet persisted some at least liv replied im not sure how many their magic tried to keep me from seeing anything at all but it failed it failed that is my land and it knew me pride filled her voice and with reason shed defied the enemy and got away with it what do we do now audun gilli asked talk to totila that wasnt liv it was odovacar somehow or other hed understood audun just fine and he seemed to have found the right answer too the jarl ofthe red dire wolves plucked at his graying beard they muster in great numbers you say totila asked liv they do your ferocity she said we have no great numbers here how could we totila said the red dire wolves are what we are one clan we also have some of your three tusk bizogots but not many and even those we have trouble feeding how can we hope to stand against a great host of foes with strong magic would we not be wiser to move aside and let these enemies pass through this is a cowards counsel trasamund cried totila eyed him you are in a poor position to tell me what is best for my clan when you think on what happened to yours trasamund turned red we were taken unawares we would not have been if i were with the clansfolk and not down in the empire and whose fault was that did someone steal you and drag you down to nidaros totila could be as sarcastic as a raumsdalian to hamnet thyssens mind though the red dire wolves jarl asked the wrong question the right one was even if you were there even if the three tusk bizogots were alert how much difference would it have made hamnet feared he knew the answer which wouldnt have gladdened trasamunds heart not much not much at all i was trying to get help for us trasamund said i did my best to bring the bizogots together and warn them there was danger coming down out of the north we stopped here on our way to the southlands by god did you want to listen he laughed not likely well who would have listened to a mad wild tale like the one you were spinning totila retorted i thought you were lying through your teeth anybody else in his right mind would have too and he would have been wrong and he would have paid for it trasamund said and you were wrong and you are wrong and you cursed well will pay for it so what the demon is being in your right mind worth they scowled at each other they both squared off into positions from which they could easily grab for their swords with bizogots quarrels often ended in blood not words a fight here though would throw the red dire wolves against what was left of the three tusk bizogots and the raumsdalians whod ridden north to help them neither trasamund nor totila seemed to care have they both gone crazy ulric skakki whispered to count hamnet crazier i mean they sure act like it they do hamnet agreed then he raised his voice to a shout hold both of you i can tell this is the rulers deviltry not your own will this is one of the things they try to do they pit our leaders against each other and then swarm through after our quarrels leave no one who can stand up against them by god hes right liv said despite all we can do their wizards must be working on you why else would you fight when danger to both of you and to all your folk builds just to the north ulric translated in a low voice for audun gilli the raumsdalian wizard said i feel no enemy magic ulric kicked him in the ankle for a wonder audun caught on hastily he continued that only proves how subtle the spell is will you let it seduce you trasamund and totila looked at each other then they both looked shamefaced and a shamefaced bizogot was as rare as a white woolly mammoth no they said loudly trasamund drew his sword but only to brandish it in the direction of the rulers totila shook his big hard fist towards the north we fight together he cried side by side till we slay them all trasamund roared they embraced each other like brothers all the watching bizogots cheered they too aimed weapons and clenched fists at the invaders from beyond the glacier in a low voice ulric skakki said youre sneakier than i gave you credit for thyssen nothing sneaky about it hamnet answered for all i know i was telling the truth even for bizogots that fight between trasamund and totila was stupid even for bizogots an ironic smile played across ulrics lips well you said it i didnt but dont expect me to tell you youre wrong im just glad liv and audun went along with me count hamnet said and thanks for giving audun a hand er a foot i saw even if neither jarl did sometimes hes too innocent for his own good i helped him along a little ulric said and now all we have to do is beat the rulers should be easy right he laughed so did hamnet thyssen a moment later he wondered why iii the sun shonewarm in a bright blue sky not merely above freezing but warm just as the breath of god could reach past nidaros in the wintertime southerly breezes came up onto the bizogot steppe even up to the edge of the glacier itself when days lengthened after only a few hours of such weather the snow started looking threadbare drips and puddles were everywhere mosquitoes any day now ulric skakki said mournfully we go straight from the scratching season to the slapping season isnt it grand maybe but maybe not hamnet thyssen said therell be another blizzard or two before winter says goodbye for the year and the birds are coming north to eat the bugs he was right about that even so early in the season the air was murmurous with the sound of fluttering wings birds of every size from larkspurs and flycatchers up to swans came to the bizogot plains to breed and to feast upon the brief bounty they offered when they thawed out ulric skakki only shrugged they dont eat all the bugs they dont even eat enough of them plenty of bloodsuckers left alive anybody who comes up here when the sun shines has reason to know about that he mimed smacking at himself count hamnet nodded not just bloodsuckers on the plains these days he said weve got bloodspillers too as usual his gaze turned to the north weve done everything we could ulric said weve got scouts out theyll warn us when the rulers move the red dire wolves are as ready to fight as they ever will be and weve sent messengers to the clans close by maybe well get reinforcements yes maybe we will hamnet didnt sound as if he believed it and he didnt we cant make the other bizogots join us since we cant chances are they wont well why should they as it often did acid rode ulric skakkis voice theyre free if you dont believe me just ask them they can do whatever they choose whatever they please no matter how idiotic it is they spoke raumsdalian which kept most of the mammothherders around them from following what they said trasamund though was an exception you dont understand my folk he told ulric by god your ferocity i hope i dont the adventurer answered you raumsdalians are a servile people you need people to tell you what to do said the jarl of the three tusk clan both ulric and hamnet thyssen burst out laughing trasamund scowled first at one then at the other then at both of them together oh yes your ferocity i obey orders like any other slave hamnet said when sigvat commanded me to come back to nidaros i turned around and went thats why im sleeping in silk sheets on a feather bed in the capital now instead of up here getting ready to fight the rulers and everyone down in raumsdalia told me how smart i was to come north again ulric skakki added everyone there knows how important this fight is everyone cheered me on trasamunds scowl darkened you make fun of me wouldnt you say thats the chance you take when you come out with something funny ulric said but you are not like most of your folk the bizogot said then why talk about us as if we were hamnet thyssen asked they might have gone on bickering but someone at the northern edge of the encampment raised a shout scout coming in hamnet thyssen tensed he could think of only one reason a scout would come back to the red dire wolves camp to warn that the rulers were on the move at last he hurried forward wondering what the man would say several bizogots waved to the scout is it war they cried its war the scout yelled back and hope and fear went to war inside count hamnet the rider went on where are the others havent you heard before me im the third one who set out with the news youre the first who got here totila said and hamnets fear jeered at his hope what had the rulers done to the other scouts reached out with their dark magic he couldnt think of anything else likely totila meanwhile continued you have seen the rulers facetoface what do you make of them what we heard before from the strangers and foreigners seems to be true your ferocity the scout replied they have lancers and archers on mammoths the rest of their warriors ride deer they keep in straight lines where we would ride in groups discipline hamnet thyssen thought not for the first time the rulers had it had perhaps even more of it than the empires soldiers the bizogots the bizogots didnt even have a word for it and had to talk around it when they saw it but the bizogots were fierce totila shook his fist straight lines is it well well put some kinks in them by god see if we dont his clansmen bawled their approval to horse he roared and they ran for their mounts liv asked the scout did you see anything of their magics did you feel as if something passed close to you but didnt strike no lady shaman the man touched his right fist to his forehead in token of respect but may the teratorns take me if i know what happened to the other two men who rode south with the news how lucky are we that even one got through ulric skakki murmured to count hamnet and what will we be riding into when we go against those devils we beat them once up in three tusk country hamnet said yes and so a raid and we caught them by surprise ulric said this time theyll know were coming and theyll be ready if you dont think we have a chance maybe youd better not come along hamnet said oh no i might be wrong i dont think so but i might ulric grinned a crooked grin and if admitting that doesnt prove im no bizogot demons take me if i know what would well well know pretty soon hamnet said sometimes finding out is better than waiting so it is and sometimes its worse too ulric said which unfortunately was also true instead of answering hamnet went to mount so did ulric skakki the smile on the adventurers face might have meant anything most of the red dire wolves and all the surviving men from the three tusk clan rode with totila and trasamund the rest of the red dire wolves were driving their musk oxen and mammoths off to the south and west to give them something to fall back on if they had to part of hamnet thyssen said that that was wrong that the bizogots should act as if they were sure of winning he soon decided that part was being stupid wasnt it the part that had clung to gudrid the part that had refused to see anything wrong wasnt it the blind part the brainless part he thought it was the red dire wolves were only being sensible but even as he nodded to himself he worried if you planned for the worst thing that could happen werent you more likely to bring it about wouldnt your warriors be more cautious thinking well even if we lose here it isnt the end of the world if you went into battle shouldnt you go into it thinking you had to win no matter what wasnt that in fact what made bizogots fiercer than raumsdalians most of the time raumsdalians with all the resources of the empire behind them could more easily afford to lose than the mammothherders could the empires soldiers could come back and win another day the bizogots lived and fought in the moment and the rulers what of them as far as hamnet could see they couldnt afford to lose here they had to go forward back back towards the gap and even beyond it would be nothing but disaster for them someone pointed shouts rang out there they are the bizogots yelled now well get them totilas men were brave enough no doubt of that revenge trasamund bellowed all his clansmen took up that cry livs voice rang clear and high among the deeper ones she was his woman but she was a three tusk bizogot too and always would be mammoths in the center riding deer on the outthrust wings if hamnet had commanded the rulers he would have deployed his forces the same way where were their wizards that was another worry hamnet glanced to liv to audun gilli to odovacar farther away theyd held off the spirit hawks whatever those were theyd barely done it but they had could they withstand the invaders once more theyd better hamnet thyssen thought we all go down if they fail he looked over at liv again if she failed she wouldnt just be in danger of losing a battle she risked dying a dreadful death by sorcery his mind shied from that thought like a horse shying from a snake while the mammoths were off in the distance they seemed like animals as they neared the bizogots and raumsdalians got a better notion of their size they seemed to swell and swell if they charged when they charged hamnet didnt know how the horsemen riding to either side of him could stand up to that they look funny a bizogot said they look wrong another one agreed why those sneaky sons of whores ulric skakki exclaimed in raumsdalian they put leather armor on their godcursed beasts he was right that armor wouldnt stop everything but it would turn some arrows and keep some of the woolly mammoths from running wild when they were wounded it also proved that the rulers paid attention to what their foes did trasamunds bizogots had harried the mammoths with arrows in their raid up into their own grazing lands they wouldnt have such an easy time of it now forward the three tusk clan trasamund shouted there are the murderers in front of us in a fair fight now we pay them back liv rode with the rest of trasamunds clansmen that meant hamnet thyssen also rode with the three tusk bizogots nothing would happen to her if he could possibly help it and if he couldnt help it he wanted whatever happened to her to happen to him too shaking his head ulric skakki stuck close to count hamnet the adventurer would never have charged into battle on his own hamnet was sure of that striking from ambush was much more ulrics style but he spoke not a word of complaint he just strung his bow nocked an arrow and peered ahead for a likely target audun gilli stayed with hamnet and ulric count hamnet was sure no strategy went into the wizards thoughts he just didnt want to be separated from the only other two raumsdalians for many many miles but his choice also pulled the red dire wolves forward faster than they might have gone otherwise with liv and audun speeding into the fight totila didnt want his clansmen warded by odovacar alone hamnet thyssen had a hard time blaming him for that if the red dire wolves stayed near the other two who knew magic they might stay under their protection if they have any protection to give hamnet thought well well find out totilas bizogots shouted their jarls name trasamunds followers kept roaring revenge and now hamnet thyssen could hear the rulers battle cries too they were deep and harsh and in his ears might as well have been the calls of some fierce animals no one on this side of the glacier understood a word of the rulers language one more thing we should have started pulling from our prisoners hamnet thought weve got to take care of that after the fight if we have the chance a warrior of the rulers on mammothback bent his hornstrengthened bow and let fly his arrow fell short and kicked up a little puff of snow ulric skakki grinned see he said they get buck fever too so they do count hamnet said in every battle in which hed fought archers opened up before they had any chance of hitting their foes it was only human if you could see the enemy you thought you could kill him some of the bizogots also started shooting too soon their hate burned hot and clean and pure and then well before hamnet thyssen would have loosed a shot a deer with one of the rulers aboard crumpled and crashed to the ground pinning the fighting man under its thrashing body that was a prodigious shot one hamnet would have had trouble believing if he hadnt seen it himself trasamund thumped his chest mine he bellowed and held his bow over his head in triumph first blood to the bizogots first blood to the three tusk clan revenge revenge his clansmen cried count hamnet yelled too to make the war cry sound louder and fiercer whether that would do any good he had no idea he was pretty sure it couldnt hurt then the rulers arrows also started to bite bizogots and horses tumbled wounded horses screamed high and shrill so did wounded men the horses sounded as if they suffered worse and they probably did the bizogots at least knew why they were wounded to the horses it was all a dreadful incomprehensible surprise suddenly the mammoths loomed up right ahead seeming as tall and vertical as the glacier archers shot down from them with wicked effect a lancer speared a bizogot out of the saddle the man shrieked as if demons had seized his soul the mammoth raised its trunk to trumpet could war mammoths feel triumph maybe they could if this one did its celebration proved premature ulric skakki shot it in the tender and seldom exposed underside of the trunk the spitfilled bugle call of victory turned to a squeal of pain one of the warriors of the rulers on the mammoths back whacked it with an irontipped goad when it started to rear however well the rulers trained their beasts they didnt train them well enough to stay reliable when wounded hamnet thyssen had seen that in an earlier skirmish it didnt surprise him horses were liable to run wild if they got hurt so were the camels the manches and other southwestern raiders rode he would have been surprised if the same didnt hold true for mammoths of course a mammoth wild with pain could do more than a horse or even a camel this one decided it didnt feel like being walloped it reached up with its bleeding trunk plucked the driver off its back and threw him to the ground he screamed just as any man born on this side of the glacier might have done then the mammoth stepped on him count hamnet heard his ribs crunch as his chest caved in the scream abruptly cut off still trumpeting in pain the mammoth lumbered off careless of the other men on its back theres one of the big cows out of the fight ulric said cheerfully so there is hamnet answered but how many mammoths were still in it too many too cursed many an arrow hissed past his head like an angry serpent did the rulers know about snakes or were they as ignorant of them as the bizogots liv hadnt wanted to believe there were such creatures no snake could survive winters like these the rulers might get some horrible surprises as they moved farther south if they moved farther south hamnet hoped they didnt get the chance he shot at a heavily bearded man on a deer his arrow missed the enemy warrior but struck the deer in the haunch it bounded away with the warrior still trying to fight it under control he didnt have much luck at its riders command another deer lowered its head and charged hamnets horse the rider brandished a heavy curved sword even though the tines of those antlers werent pointed hamnet knew they could hurt or frighten his horse he guided the animal to one side and slashed at the enemy fighting man with his own blade yammering something hamnet couldnt understand the warrior turned the stroke he cut at hamnet too the raumsdalian noble beat aside the curved blade he was taller in the saddle than the man from beyond the glacier as his horse stood several hands higher than the deer he chopped down and laid open the deers shoulder the enemy warrior couldnt give all his attention to his swordplay after that and combat was too serious for anything less hamnet thyssen hacked him out of the saddle mounted on horses the bizogots also had the advantage of height on the deerriding rulers wherever horses confronted deer the bizogots surged forward but the enemys mammoths were another story they dominated their part of the field the bizogots could not stand against them hold fast hold fast trasamund and totila shouted both separately and together hamnet admired the bizogots for not giving way to panic it was as if they were fighting a swarm of fortresses that moved as fast as any horse hamnet looked around for liv he did that as often as he could getting into the battle meant he couldnt stay as close to her as he would have liked but when he saw her with her arms upraised and a furious look on her face as she cried out to the heavens he spurred towards her as fast as he could no she shouted by god no she looked as if she had the weight of the world on her shoulders as if she were trying to bear up under more than anyone was supposed to carry hamnet thyssen slashed the air with his sword hoping to help as he had when her spirit flew north to see what the rulers were doing if that did any good he couldnt see it or sense it where was audun gilli could he come to livs aid count hamnet heard his angry cry he too sounded like a man in over his head what were the rulers wizards doing whatever it was they were putting a lot of strength into it hamnet looked around for odovacar if that wasnt a measure of his desperation he couldnt imagine what would be he didnt see the red dire wolves shaman a moment later he did hear a howl that sounded as desolate as the shouts that came from livs throat and from auduns no ordinary dire wolf would come so close to a battlefield till it could feed on corpses so that had to be odovacar and then despite everything the bizogot shamans and the raumsdalian wizard could do the sorcerous storm broke on the army trasamund and totila led hamnet thyssen thought his eyes were playing tricks on him making him see enemies where there were none where there could be none but then a warrior of the rulers almost killed him not all the foes he thought he saw came from his imagination alone he watched bizogots fall because they could not tell false foes from true and he suspected though he could not prove that some of the false foes turned true because the bizogots thought them true liv cried out again her hands twisted in furious passes for a moment hamnet s vision cleared but only for a moment and the effects of livs spell didnt reach very far bizogots more than a bowshot from her seemed as bedeviled as they ever had no trasamunds deep roar reached across the battlefield these lying mammoth turds cant get away with that but the rulers could they did and with their enemies reeling in confusion their wizards threw another spell at them from what seemed every direction at once icicles flew at the bizogots like arrows shields turned some thick leather clothes stopped others but some struck home wounding men and horses alike the spell probably would have been more dangerous more deadly in the heart of winter than at the tag end of the season but it was bad enough as things were stop them a bizogot screamed at liv blood running down his face dont let them do that im trying she screamed back none of the darting plunging icicles had struck or even struck at her she seemed able to protect herself hamnet had shattered one with his sword but only one she could ward him too to some degree she lacked the strength to extend her reach to the whole bizogot host so did audun gilli and odovacar if they could have they would have hamnet thyssen was sure of that coping with wizardry and war mammoths both all but unstoppable how long could the bizogot army hold together ulric skakki shot a fellow who was plainly a leading officer among the rulers off his mammoth the man had been yelling orders and pointing this way and that directing his men as a band leader might direct his musicians hamnet thyssen hoped his fall and he did fall bleeding into the snow would throw the enemy into disarray and buy the bizogots time to regroup losing their commander did discomfit the rulers for a minute or two then another of their officers noting or learning that the commander was down took over for him he shouted orders he pointed this way and that and the enemy army pulled itself together and went back to the business of crushing its opponents theyre good god curse them ulric skakki said theyre better than good theyre smoother than we are let alone the bizogots count hamnet said we couldnt lose a captain and shrug it off like that he didnt even talk about what would happen if trasamund or totila were badly wounded here he knew and so did ulric the bizogots would fall to pieces even without losing their chieftains they fell to pieces anyhow it didnt happen all at once the way it might have if a jarl fell no one could deny the bizogots courage but when courage without much direction ran up against courage with discipline and against war mammoths and superior sorcery it came up short at first by ones and twos then in small groups then in clusters the red dire wolves those who could broke free of the press and rode off to the southwest they knew where their herds roamed if they were to survive as a clan they had to protect the beasts men from the three tusk clan rode with them fierce and desperate as trasamunds bizogots were they were made of flesh and blood they had limits the rulers inflicted enough punishment on them to push them to those limits and beyond cowards trasamund roared watching his own clansmen retreat with the red dire wolves where are your ballocks your ferocity what more can we do here but get killed to no purpose hamnet thyssen asked can we beat the rulers in this fight trasamund sent him a look full of hate not you too well run away if you want to i came here to fight by god hed done plenty of that his great twohanded sword was smeared and splashed with blood all along the blade did you come here to throw yourself away that wasnt count hamnet it was liv weve lost this battle were beaten if we try again when we try again it will have to be somewhere else we still must have our revenge but cant you see we wont win it here plainly trasamund didnt want to heed her just as plainly she was right totila called weve got to get away save what we can seeing his fellow jarl flee the field seemed to bring trasamund to his senses away then he said bitterly away will we spend the rest of our lives running away from the accursed rulers its possible count hamnet thought if the invaders could bring in enough men and mammoths through the gap they would be very dangerous indeed hamnet had feared they would fight well they turned out to fight even better than hed expected how hard would they pursue if they pressed the chase with everything they had in them they might shatter the red dire wolves forever but they didnt seem willing or more likely able to do that theyd won yes but not easily and so the bizogots escaped them and broke off the fight hamnet thyssen wondered how much difference it would make not many thingsin the world were grimmer than the camp of an army that had just lost a battle the wounded were sullen feeling they suffered pointlessly the men whod got away safe were angry and embarrassed having done their best to no purpose and everyone was apprehensive fearing the enemy would fall on them while their spirits were at a low ebb the warm weather around the camp made the snow melt and the drips reminded hamnet thyssen of tears shed for the cause that was more fanciful than he usually got but he couldnt help it several bizogots screamed at trasamund and totila when their chieftains tried to get them to go on sentry duty trasamund had to knock one of the nomads down and kick him before he would are we still warriors the jarl roared furiously or are we made into voles and lemmings sport for any weasel that would bite our throats do you feel squeaky ulric skakki asked count hamnet somehow the adventurer made his whiskers seem remarkably like a voles hamnet knew he should have smiled he couldnt make himself do it try as he would they beat us he said gloomily so they did ulric agreed did you really look for anything different the bizogots havent figured out this is no game yet what will it take before they do hamnet asked war mammoths trampling the lot of them maybe ulric skakki didnt sound as worried or as wearied as most of the men around him that would bring the rulers down to the empires northern border and sigvat ii hasnt realized this is no game either marvelous hamnet thyssen said by your logic almost everyone ought to be almost ready to fight just when its too late to do any good yes that sounds about right ulric agreed or dont you think so the trouble was hamnet did think so even if he didnt want to we have to find some way to beat them if we dont were ruined no one has to do anything havent you noticed that yet ulric skakki said it would be nice if we did but theres no guarantee he gestured at the misery all around you can see for yourself there isnt hamnet thyssen winced you know what i mean so what ulric said wheres the connection between what you mean and what is if you cant find one what does what you mean have to do with the price of peas were in trouble wishing we werent wont get us anywhere am i right or wrong oh youre right sure enough hamnet said do you suppose wishing youd shut up anyway would get me anywhere ulric skakki laughed for all the world as if he were joking any sort of cheery sound made most of the people who heard it stare at him plainly wondering if hed lost his wits totila came up to count hamnet and ulric is it true that you raumsdalians know more about curing wounds than we do to hamnets way of thinking it was hard to know less about curing wounds than the bizogots did all the same his nod and ulrics were both cautious battlefield surgery was a risky business for anybody what do you want us to try to do hamnet asked come see the wound judge for yourself the red dire wolves jarl answered a bizogot warrior writhed and groaned he had an arrow embedded in his calf when hamnet made as if to touch it the big burly man said dont the point is barbed you cant pull it out push it through hamnet wondered aloud the bizogot groaned again count hamnet understood why that would add fresh torment and make the wound worse but they couldnt leave the arrow where it was either you see the jarl said i see hamnet said glumly i see but i dont know what i can do how about you ulric ulric skakki took from a belt pouch a bronze contraption with a long flat handle and a curved tip with a small hole in the center whats that totila asked arrowdrawing spoon the adventurer answered i slide it down the shaft get hold of the point with the hole and pull up it lets me bring out the point but keeps the barbs from doing too much more tearing when they leave the wound try it the injured bizogot said that godcursed thing has to come out hamnet thyssen and totila held his leg to make sure he couldnt twist away have you ever used this thing before hamnet asked in raumsdalian ive seen it done ulric answered in the imperial tongue that wasnt the same thing he switched back to the bizogot language to speak to the wounded man im going to start do your best to hold still ill try the mammothherder braced himself despite that he gasped and tried to jerk free when ulric skakki pushed the arrowdrawing spoon into the wound the injured warrior groaned and cursed none of which did him any good he gasped again when ulric tried to slide the very tip of the arrowhead into the hole in the spoon im sorry ulric said remember im doing this by feel im not hurting you on purpose i know the bizogot got out but that doesnt mean youre not hurting me im close curse it it should be right about ulric moved the spoon a little the bizogot groaned on a different note there ulric exclaimed ive got it i can feel it so can i by god the wounded man said im going to bring it out now ulric told him ill go slow as slow as i can try to hold still it will help are you ready no the bizogot said honestly but go ahead waiting wont make it any better hold him tight ulric warned hamnet and totila he wont like this but ive got to do it here we go the wounded bizogot bit down hard to keep from screaming he spat red into the slushy snow so he was chewing on his lips or tongue his bunched fists pounded the snow again and again hamnet had taken battle wounds he knew what the younger man was going through the less he thought about that the better its out ulric said not much flesh clung to the barbs on the point the drawing spoon really had shielded the wound from most of the damage it would have taken otherwise thank you the wounded bizogot said easier to bear now that that cursed thing isnt sticking into me anymore thats what she said ulric answered which made the wounded man laugh let me see that spoon totila said could we make it from bone or horn i dont see why not here keep this one if you want to ulric cleaned it in snow and slush before handing it to the bizogot totila studied it and nodded thoughtfully count hamnet meanwhile bandaged the wounded mans leg down in the empire bandages would have been made of linen here the bizogots used muskox wool and dried moss to close wounds and soak up blood if anything those worked better than their raumsdalian equivalents i thank you the wounded man said do you think it will heal clean thats in gods hands not mine hamnet answered but i dont see any reason why it shouldnt those strangers really do fight from mammothback the bizogot said in wondering tones who would have believed it weve been telling you about it all winter hamnet thyssen pointed out with more than a touch of asperity and so the wounded nomad seemed glad to have something to talk about besides the darkening bandage on his leg i can tell you about a skyblue mammoth with pink horns that honks like a goose but will you expect to see one if i do it depends count hamnet said judiciously if i know youre a reliable man i might why would we lie to you by god why would whats left of the three tusk clan lie to you they fought the rulers they saw them using war mammoths to his surprise the man from the red dire wolves had an answer for him we all thought you were making them out to be worse than they really are so wed join you and do what you wanted we thought it was nothing but a trick to scare us to make us fall in line behind you were bizogots were free men we didnt aim to do that and so you had to get crushed before you decided we might know what we were talking about after all that sounded like something a bizogot would do hamnet thyssen counted himself to be lucky in a country where the closest walls those of the stone houses the leaping lynx clans summer homes by sudertorp lake were many miles away otherwise he would have been sorely tempted to pound his head against one the wounded man nodded sure except we didnt expect to get crushed we thought wed do the crushing after rubbing snow on his hands to get the blood off them hamnet thyssen walked away he put on his mittens to warm himself up again ulric skakki came after him this is what we came north for ulric said this is what we came north for hamnet answered stolidly the bizogots are fools but at least theyre fighting fools down in nidaros sigvat ii is a blind fool if you ask me thats worse well maybe ulric skakki said but where are we going to find some people who arent fools thats what we really need we really need to beat the rulers fighting fools can do that may be able to do that anyhow hamnet said blind fools wont they were both using raumsdalian again it let them speak their minds without worrying that the bizogots would overhear and get angry ulric skakki rolled his eyes all the bizogots in the world couldnt stop the army that beat us today god knows the bizogots are brave but god knows theyre stupid too and the more i see of the rulers the more i see that they arent theyre cruel bastards but they arent dumb bastards and that sorcery count hamnet let the words hang in the air that was pretty bad ulric agreed some of those flying icicles almost skewered me and some of them did skewer bizogots or else distracted them so the rulers had an easy time killing them do you suppose our best wizards could have stopped the spell hamnet asked i dont know the adventurer said one day before too long chances are well find out god help the empire if its wizards dont have better luck than the bizogot shamans up here hamnet said god help the empire thatll do ulric skakki said somebodyd better and its not as if sigvats up to the job god should help the bizogots too and if he doesnt we should lend a hand count hamnet said do you know whether totila and trasamund aim to send messengers to the other clans and tell them whats happened to the red dire wolves i know they havent done it yet i know i havent heard them talk about doing it ulric answered whether the thought has trickled through their beady little minds that i cant tell you beady little minds hamnet echoed sourly the phrase fit much too well all right then wed better make sure they do think of it and wed better make sure they dont just think of it too wed better make sure they do it you dont have much faith in them do you ulric said hamnet thyssen shook his head now that you mention it no iv spring down inthe empire it was a time of renewal return rebirth in the bizogot country it was all of that and more jammed into a few frantic weeks when the snow up on the northern plains melted everything turned to mud and marshes and ponds getting from here to there became a challenge getting from here to there in a hurry became a joke bare mud and shallow water didnt last long there was no deep water on the frozen steppe which stayed frozen a few feet down regardless of the season plants came to mad life coating the ground with green and bursting into bloom and in the marshes and puddles the eggs mosquitoes and flies and midges had laid the year before thawed out and hatched and gave birth to a new generation of buzzing biters hamnet thyssen squelched and slapped and swore the air was thick not only with bugs but also with the birds that battened on them the birds grew fat and nested and laid eggs so their succeeding generation could feast off bugs yet unborn but far too many bugs remained uneaten cant you do anything about it hamnet asked liv not for the first time bear grease on your face and hands helps some she answered she was bitten too so were all the bizogots so were their dogs and musk oxen and mammoths all of which shed their winter coats just in time to give the mosquitoes tempting targets you should have a magic to keep the bugs away he said she looked at him you raumsdalians like to think youre stronger than the world around you up here shamans know better god lets us live on the plains as long as we dont push our luck too hard how could one shaman hold off all the bugs that spawn every spring put that way it was a different kind of question count hamnet said cant you hold off some of the bugs that only made liv smile what if we did dont you think the rest would be plenty to drive men and beasts wild umm probably hamnet thyssen managed a smile of his own a crooked one youre telling me to give up and leave this alone arent you as a matter of fact yes except for the bear grease liv said that helps as much as anything anyhow with a sigh hamnet smeared some on maybe it helped a little on the other hand maybe it didnt the rulers didnt try to drive the red dire wolves to destruction not right away anyhow they could have pursued much harder than they did maybe the spring thaw slowed them down maybe they awaited reinforcements from beyond the glacier maybe they just didnt care what the beaten bizogots did hamnet had no way of knowing he welcomed the respite whatever the reason for it it also gave the red dire wolves messengers the chance to warn other clans it gave them the chance yes how seriously the rest of the bizogots took those messengers one of the horsemen came back to the red dire wolves camp that evening days got long faster in springtime up here in the north than they did in the empire already the suns setting point had swung far to the northwest and twilight lingered late the slowly gathering gloom descending on the camp didnt come close to matching the gloom on the messengers face he bit into a leg from a roasted partridge and swigged from a skin of smetyn but neither the food nor the fermented mammoths milk did much to lighten his mood they wouldnt believe me he told totila and anyone else who would listen by god your ferocity they wouldnt they laughed at me they asked me if i was chewing mystic mushrooms they have their nerve odovacar said indignantly somehow the deaf old shaman heard that fine mystic mushrooms are shamans food the visions they send drive ordinary men mad liv smiled behind her hand that doesnt stop ordinary men from eating them now and then she whispered to count hamnet im not surprised he answered if smetyn were against the law people would still drink it she nodded totila scowled at the messenger did you manage to persuade em you had all your wits about you i showed em this the messenger pulled up his sleeve and showed off a long cut on his arm which was still held closed by several muskoxsinew stitches even then they had the nerve to ask me if i did it to myself when the mushrooms made me crazy i told em id fight the next fool who asked me a question like that they heard me out after that anyhow but even when they listened they wouldnt believe why not totilas face was a study in helpless rage almost makes you wonder if the rulers have a spell in the air to turn bizogots wits to horse manure ulric skakki said his usual view was that bizogots wits werent far removed from horse manure anyhow but nothing in his tone or attitude suggested that now could it be so trasamund asked not likely your ferocity ulric said people can be plenty stupid all by themselves they mostly dont need magic to help em along i wasnt asking you the three tusk jarl said i was asking the shamans here he looked from liv to odovacar to audun gilli i dont think its likely either your ferocity liv said audun nodded hed finally picked up enough of the bizogot language to get by in it though he still butchered the grammar and threw in raumsdalian words when he spoke it himself as for odovacar he didnt seem to have heard trasamund this time trasamund looked dissatisfied hed seldom looked any other way since learning of the disaster that had overwhelmed his clan but he seemed even less happy than usual now i dont want to know what you think he rumbled i want to know what your magic tells you dont take me seriously here for heavens sake ulric skakki said i was only joking you raumsdalians have a saying dont you about true words spoken in jest trasamund said i think you did that here you are a clever raumsdalian sometimes you are too clever for your own good i know you think bizogots are nothing but a pack of fools i never said that ulric protested i dont care what you said i wasnt talking about what you said i know what you think here trasamund said ulric skakki looked innocent it wasnt easy not when he was bound to be guilty as charged but he brought it off hamnet thyssen thought the bizogots could be fools too and he knew his opinion of them was higher than ulrics trasamund went on you think we are fools yes but without magic could we be fools enough to ignore an enemy already beating our clans and stealing our grazing grounds by the look on ulrics face he saw nothing too improbable in that even if he didnt come right out and say so but the way trasamund put the question made hamnet thyssen wonder yes the bizogots could be fools especially from a raumsdalian point of view were they likely to be idiots maybe we ought to find out if we can he said audun gilli blinked liv said not you too even odovacar looked at count hamnet in surprise and hamnet was convinced the red dire wolves shaman had no idea what was going on its possible ulrics right without meaning to be hamnet said stubbornly if the bizogots farther south would rather believe in mystic mushrooms than in the rulers dont you think that says somethings wrong with them liv looked exasperated odovacar went on looking blank but audun gilli looked thoughtful it could be so he said i dont say it is but it could be he turned to liv do you know a spell for seeing if someone is using magic oh yes she answered we need a charm like that for we often have claims that someone is bewitching someone else we need to find out where the truth lies if the truth lies how do you find it ulric skakki inquired audun gilli didnt get the pun liv did and winced trasamund muttered something under his breath we use that kind of spell in nidaros too audun said taking no notice of what he couldnt follow maybe we ought to try it here liv sighed i think its a waste of time but if it makes you happy happy trasamund spoke before hamnet ulric or audun could wise lady nothing that has passed here since we traveled south into the empire makes me happy but if we find here a tool to use against our foes or a way to keep them from using a tool against us then i say we have done something worthwhile is this so or is it not so if we find something your ferocity it is so liv answered otherwise we do nothing but waste time and strength this last strikes me as more likely sometimes finding out the enemy isnt doing something counts for as much as finding out he is would hamnet thyssen said if he isnt spreading confusion then our neighbors truly are as idiotic as you raumsdalians make them out to be trasamund broke in you said it i didnt hamnet said but if the rulers are fuddling the rest of the bizogots we need to know that and if they are we need to stop them if we can i said i would make the spell i will liv said but i wouldnt bother if trasamund hadnt decided ulric skakki meant what he said when he was only making one of his jokes she sent the adventurer a severe stare ulric looked embarrassed a startling and unnatural expression on his face whose normal bland expression could conceal anything i said i was joking he protested no one wanted to believe me see what happens when you tell so many lies trasamund said nobody wants to hear the truth from you ill find the truth whatever it is liv nodded to audun gilli tell me about your magicsniffing spells when he did in a mixture of her tongue and raumsdalian she frowned for a moment considering then she nodded to herself those are not bad but i think ill use one i already know its simpler and i wont have to worry about slipping with something new and unfamiliar that makes sense audun agreed shell do it anyhow ulric skakki said as if to prove he didnt intend all his words to be taken seriously then liv explained to odovacar what she intended to do that took so much shouting she might almost have told the rulers what she had in mind too at last the red dire wolves shaman said anybody would think you figured the rulers were using magic to make us stupid liv sighed yes anyone would think that she took from a pouch on her belt an agate dark brown banded with white audun gilli suddenly grinned when he saw the stone oh very nice he said agate overcomes perils strengthens the heart and helps against adversities we have them sure enough trasamund said her face a mask of concentration liv took no notice of either of them she drew forth the dried foot of a snowshoe hare bound it to the agate with a length of sinew and tied them both to her left upper arm this to help me go where i will in our world or that of the spirit and to return without peril she said may it be so hamnet thyssen murmured he worried whenever she worked magic for he knew the danger it put her in that it was needful only made him worry more since that meant he couldnt stop her she began to chant some of the strange little tune was in the bizogot language the rest might have been in the speech mammoths used among themselves if mammoths used any speech among themselves as magic had a way of doing the spell seemed to reach odovacar he pricked up his ears and followed her charm with all the attention he had in him that his ears pricked was literally true even in human shape they were unusually large unusually pointed and unusually mobile a bit later he began to chant his tune was much like the one liv used though not identical some of what he sang was in the bizogot tongue the rest might have been the speech dire wolves used among themselves if dire wolves used any speech among themselves the truth liv and odovacar sang the same thing at the same time perhaps by chance perhaps not we must have the truth then their songs went different ways again into mammoth maunderings for liv and direwolf woolgathering for odovacar both shamans began to dance liv plodding after the truth and odovacar chasing with lolling tongue and hungry eyes hamnet thyssen watched audun gilli watching them in fascination the raumsdalian wizard seemed altogether absorbed in the workings of a sorcery from a tradition different from the empires if liv was a mammoth and odovacar a dire wolf he might have been a brighteyed mouse taking everything in we must have the truth odovacar called again do lies and deceit stalk the bizogots liv sang and then something muffled and mammothy that hamnet felt somehow meant the same thing quite a show isnt it ulric skakki whispered to hamnet i never thought a bad joke could go so far that should teach you to think before you let your tongue flap hamnet whispered back it probably wont but it should ulric sent him an aggrieved look he took no notice of it the two raumsdalians might have quarreled then even though the bizogot shamans were still busy with their magic but then odovacar let out a sudden startled yip liv gasped in surprise hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki stared at them their own disagreement forgotten audun gilli s eyes got wider yet they do liv said by god they do she sounded astonished she also sounded outraged this must not be banish the lies odovacar bayed banish the deception begone liv cried begone let them be trampled let them be eaten odovacar bared his teeth they were uncommonly long and sharp as if he was beginning to take animal shape the howl he let out argued that he was hamnet felt something that had hovered over the bizogot encampment that had for all he knew hung over the whole of the frozen steppe lift and pull back he hadnt known it was there it manifested itself more by its absence than it had by its presence was he smarter now that it started to withdraw maybe he was or maybe he was imagining that he was how could he tell he was no wizard and never would be audun gilli gasped no he said in raumsdalian and began incanting frantically two or three heartbeats later liv and odovacar also gasped the red dire wolves shaman staggered and pitched forward on his face he lay unmoving whether dead or smitten with something like an apoplexy hamnet thyssen could not have said hamnet had more urgent things to worry about than the state of odovacar s health liv stronger or perhaps just younger than the other shaman still stood swaying as if in a breeze but there was no breeze the force of the rulers counterspell was what rocked her her lips skinned back from her teeth in a ghastly grimace as she gathered all her strength to resist the magic audun gilli clutched an amulet of seagreen beryl hamnet knew that was a stone sorcerers used to overcome their enemies and make them meek audun gabbled out a spell as fast as he could was he trying to save himself alone or did he also include liv and even odovacar in his magic count hamnet couldnt ask not without distracting him and perhaps ruining everything he was trying to do hamnet wondered what he could do by himself but not for long he drew his sword and began slashing the air around liv as hed done a couple of times before once it had seemed to help once not he hoped it would do some good now hoping he called do the same for audun to ulric skakki it cant hurt im sure of that right ulric wasted no words but drew his own blade the adventurer loved to quibble when he found the chance but he knew there was a time and a place for everything this was the time for action trasamund freed his great twohanded sword from its scabbard and passed it through the air above the fallen odovacar the red dire wolves shaman groaned and stirred he wasnt dead then but only trasamunds powerful wrists let him jerk the blade higher in the nick of time so he didnt slay the man he was trying to save odovacar howled like a wolf hamnet thyssen wondered whether he had anything more than a wolfs wits in him liveried no again this time rage filled her voice not fear we broke their cursed snare they wont set it again she clutched the hares foot and agate with her right hand i throw back your curses she shouted may they come down on the head of the shamans who sent them forth and may they fill their witless heads with coals of fire so may it be audun gilli said hamnet wouldnt have bet he could follow livs words but he did maybe the magic she was working helped him understand and odovacar also called so may it be his voice seemed scarcely human it held as much of the dire wolfs howl as of words but hamnet thyssen understood him even so and liv and audun also seemed to coals of fire liveried again gesturing with her left hand was it coincidence that audun gilli and odovacar also made the same pass at the same time hamnet thyssen didnt think so and he didnt think it was coincidence that the two bizogots and audun cried out again a moment later this time in triumph now audun shouted coals of fire hamnet didnt think he was conjuring with the phrase but was using it to describe what was happening to the enemy wizards let them see how they like that by god liv said let them see theyve found foes who can strike back odovacar howled like a hungry dire wolf is it over hamnet asked for now liv answered there will be other meetings they are bound to come and we will have to do our best in them but this one has gone as we might have wished most she looked over to ulric skakki you see what happens when you joke im afraid i do he said i guess that ought to teach me to keep my mouth shut from here on out the way hamnet says i should but it probably wont no it wont trasamund agreed raumsdalians never know when to shut up which makes us different from bizogots how ulric asked politely the jarl glared at him ulric smiled back but two bizogot shamans and a raumsdalian wizard had found and beaten back the spell the rulers laid over the frozen plains instead of quarreling both men started to laugh they too were liable to have other runins but no trouble would spring from this one totila and trasamundsent out messengers again now that the cloud of foolishness that had hung over the bizogots was gone the two jarls hoped their comrades would have second thoughts about what theyd heard before maybe totila said hopefully well even have people riding into our camp to tell us theyve decided to take us seriously after all but they didnt hamnet thyssen kept looking north not for once towards the glacier but towards the rulers they hadnt tried to restore the spell liv and audun and odovacar had shattered hamnet wondered what that meant maybe their wizards had taken a serious defeat and lacked the strength to fight back or maybe theyd simply decided the spell was worthless now that the bizogots knew it was there who could guess how the rulers thought even the captives the bizogots held werent sure who knows how a shaman thinks one of them said when hamnet asked him they know what they know and it is not for the likes of us to learn maybe they tell the chieftains but i am i was only an ordinary warrior i rode i fought and i failed for you hold me now do your folk have writing hamnet thyssen needed to use the raumsdalian word for the bizogots didnt use letters naturally the prisoner failed to follow him he explained as best he could in the bizogot language this is another kind of magic you speak of the captive said his name was rankarag i told you i know nothing of what shamans do no not magic anyone can do it i can do it and ill never be a shaman in a thousand years count hamnet said look he took a sharp length of bone and wrote rankarag in the mud there is your name rankarag promptly reached out with his booted foot and smudged the characters beyond legibility no one will make magic with a picture of my name he declared hamnet thyssen started to write his own name in the dirt to show the captive it was only a name not magic at all he started to yes but then he didnt who could say what a sorcerer might do with his name and who could say whether rankarag knew as little of wizardry as he claimed better maybe not to take chances instead hamnet wrote mammoth these are the signs we use for the name of the great beast he said one of them is the same as one in my name rankarag said suspiciously he had a quick eye rankarag and mammoth have the same sound in them hamnet answered he said the name and the word again stressing the first syllable each time the same character shows that sound rankarag plucked at his thick curly beard with enough characters you call them you could set down anything you can say couldnt you he was no fool nodding hamnet said we have a character for each sound in my language we can set down anything we say this is a strong magic the warrior of the rulers said this is a stronger magic than i looked for folk of the herd to have by that he meant any human beings not of the rulers his folk looked at all other people as animals to be herded like mammoths and riding deer it is not magic at all hamnet thyssen insisted it is a craft like making a bow or fletching an arrow anyone can learn it so you say rankarag replied you are not part of the bizogot herd do these bizogots know this socalled craft no hamnet said so your herd keeps it for itself then the warrior from the rulers said one day you will use it against the bizogot herd you will slaughter them all except for the pretty women and you will take their land he had a very basic notion of what went into diplomacy so did the rest of his folk count hamnet wanted to laugh in his face instead he just shook his head we dont want the bizogots land we have better land of our own but you still keep these these characters secret from the bizogots rankarag said no hamnet replied as patiently as he could they can learn to write if they want to a few of them have most see no use for it though then this bizogot herd is full of fools rankarag said a view not too different from the one many raumsdalians held he pointed a finger at hamnet thyssen i can prove that you are lying i can make you prove it in fact if it is only a craft he laughed at the very idea you will not mind showing me all of these characters after writing rankarags name again hamnet showed him the sound that each character in it made finishing you see the r sound and the a sound are there together twice these are the characters that make them and they are also there twice we have thirtyseven characters in all here they are he wrote them out in order saying the sound for each one as he did rankarag stared at him at the raumsdalian characters at him again you are not making this up he said slowly by god no hamnet said that would be more trouble than its worth like a lot of bizogots rankarag proved to have an excellent memory for what he saw and heard he took the bit of bone from count hamnet and wrote in the muddy ground muttering to himself as he did so this would say tent in the tongue of the bizogot herd then almost not quite what you wrote is tint which means a color here is the character for the e sound hamnet pointed it out then wrote tent himself in spite of himself he was impressed that rankarag had come so close after hearing the sound of each character only once tent rankarag wrote it again this time correctly thats right hamnet said rankarag eyed him i could put your name in the mud the same as you put mine i could work magic on it if i were a shaman suddenly count hamnet wondered whether showing him the way raumsdalians wrote was such a good idea rankarag didnt see writing as a tool he saw it as a weapon the minds of the rulers seemed to run in that direction as casually as hamnet could he said you could try because we use characters all the time of course we are warded against them that sounded good he wished it were true and it impressed the captive less than he hoped it would you folk of the herds what are your wards worth rankarag said our shamans should have no trouble beating them down your magic is not always as strong as you think it is hamnet thyssen replied trying to fight down his unease besides what do you care what the rulers do you dont belong to them anymore you are a prisoner a prisoner of the bizogots rankarag flinched as if hamnet had threatened to hit him the real threat probably wouldnt have scared him he was a warrior to the core i wish you hadnt reminded me he said in a low sullen voice you need to remember it you failed you were captured the rulers dont want you back if you have any future at all its with us not with them count hamnet hoped he was right if rankarag escaped and brought writing and the idea of writing back to the rulers wizards would that make him valuable enough to earn his way into the ranks of his folk once more hamnet couldnt be sure he simply didnt know the enemy well enough to judge one thing he could do and he did it he warned the guards to keep an extra close watch on the prisoners well do it one of them said hamnet asked trasamund and totila to tell the guards to be careful too they would take an order from a jarl more seriously than a warning from a foreigner he hoped they would anyhow he had the feeling hed put a sword into the rulers hands he hadnt intended to but what did that have to do with the price of meat name magic yousay ulric skakki looked at count hamnet as if hed found half of him in his apple name magic with letters well theres one more thing to have nightmares about thank you so much i didnt mean to hamnet said sheepishly yes and so ulric said probably the best thing we could do now would be to kill this rankarag whoreson or do you suppose hes already passed on the news to the rest of the prisoners i hope not hamnet said but i wouldnt be surprised no neither would i ulric said you and your big mouth and you talk about me if the rulers were freezing would you have told them to start a fire i didnt think they would think to use writing for sorcery hamnet said unhappily why the demon not ulric skakki rolled his eyes thats probably what we used it for first too after awhile some people figured out you could do other things with it too but they had to pry it out of the wizards hands before they could you can bet on that how do you know were you there hamnet asked of course ulric said easily this was in the days when mammoths werent woolly and musk oxen were green you understand i wonder what audun would say about that hamnet thyssen remarked well you can ask him if you want to ulrics voice was dismissive i didnt see him around then though ill tell you that he often took his whimsy more seriously than things any sensible person would have known were worth taking seriously as much to annoy the adventurer as for any other reason count hamnet did hunt up audun gilli what do you know about how writing started he asked out of a clear blue sky something the frozen steppe didnt see all that often but something it enjoyed now the wizard blinked what on earth brought that on he asked hamnet thyssen explained his unfortunate introduction of the idea to rankarag and also his fruitless at least from his point of view discussion with ulric skakki so if you know anything about the days when the musk oxen were green lets hear it he finished green musk oxen audun gilli murmured i wasnt there for that i will say but ulrics right i think wizards likely did come up with writing first we needed it more than other people would have how much trouble can the rulers cause if they start using it hamnet asked how should i know audun answered which was hamnet had to admit a sensible response the wizard went on my best guess is theyll cause more trouble than we expect them to they seem to be like that they do dont they hamnet thyssen said unhappily weve got to make sure none of our captives flees north then ive talked to the bizogots about it but sometimes talking to them is like talking to the glacier you can do it but you wonder why you bother they follow their own bent dont they audun said hamnet laughed not that he found it very funny thats the kindest way i ever heard to say they do whatever they cursed well please they sure do audun said they ought to be able to see that this is important except they dont write themselves and so they dont understand why it would matter whether or not the rulers do if the rulers start using name magic against them theyll understand soon enough count hamnet said of course thatll be too late he spat into the mud between his feet amazing how many things we understand too stinking late he wasnt thinking of sorcery at least not of the usual sort he was thinking of gudrid as usual when he thought of his faithless former wife he wished he didnt luckily audun gilli couldnt read his mind even if we do have escapes the wizard said it stays light so much longer now they cant get a long start in the night we have a much better chance of hunting them down so we do hamnet said sourly it would still be better if they didnt get away at all can you do anything magical to make sure they stay here i doubt it you need a willing subject for sorcery like that audun said oh wonderful count hamnet said his tone more sour still if youve got willing subjects you dont need to magic em to get em to stay where theyre supposed to well yes there is that the wizard admitted as if he badly wanted to change the subject he pointed up into the sky look the teratorns have come back from the south so they have hamnet said the great birds scavengers big enough to dwarf vultures and even condors stayed longer around nidaros than up here in the bizogot country but when winter clamped down there most of them flew south corpses got too thin on the ground to let them stay as if thinking along with count hamnet audun gilli said theyre liable to have plenty to eat up here this summer yes arent they hamnet said i hope they dont sick up the bodies of the rulers they feed on and i hope there are plenty of those may it be so may god hear your prayer the wizard said hamnet hadnt been praying or not exactly but he wouldnt be sorry if god listened to him god hadnt done much of that lately but when he said as much audun gilli cocked his head to one side and studied him like a brighteyed bird no eh so you dont thank god for liv then i do hamnet said at once i do and youre right i was thinking of the worlds affairs not my own your own count for more most of the time audun observed most of the time but not here hamnet thyssen said if the worlds affairs go to ruin mine will too down in the empire i could live in my castle and tell the world to go hang i cant do that here the world is more likely to hang me can we stop the rulers can we even slow them down would we be up here if we didnt think we could audun gilli answered we thought we could when we came north hamnet said that was before we knew theyd crushed the three tusk clan it was before they beat the red dire wolves too he looked uneasily towards the north how much of a fight could the bizogots put up when the rulers decided to strike again enough any at all the wizards eyes went in the same direction they are strong audun murmured as much to himself as to hamnet thyssen they are strong yes but we can stop them how hamnet asked bluntly i dont know yet audun gilli replied but i think well find out the very strong have weaknesses in proportion to their strength is that so hamnet thyssen said tell me of a lions weaknesses then if a lion doesnt have lots of big animals to kill it will starve audun said at once foxes or weasels can live well and get fat on land that wont support a lion he was right hamnet couldnt deny it even so i dont see what that has to do with the rulers neither do i the sorcerer said you were the one who mentioned the lion though well so i was count hamnet said gruffly what weaknesses do the rulers have we havent seen many yet no we havent audun gilli agreed the way they discard captives may be one if they didnt we wouldnt have learned so much from our prisoners at the moment hamnet thyssen worried more about what rankarag and the other prisoners had learned from him no one had tried to escape yet maybe the captives thought the rulers wouldnt take them back no matter what maybe they were right if they did that did seem to be a weakness to hamnet but was it a weakness the bizogots could use to beat the rulers if it was he couldnt see how had the bizogots found any weaknesses like that if they had he knew he had no idea what they were v fear made thescouts voice wobble when he rode into the camp theyre moving he called the godcursed rulers are moving and like a spark setting kindling alight the fear in the bizogot riders voice sent fear racing through the encampment where the red dire wolves and the remnants of the three tusk clan dwelt theyre moving became theyre coming became theyll attack us became theyll kill us all became we have to flee before they can kill us all trasamund kept his wits about him at least enough to hear what the scout truly said what do you mean theyre moving he shouted through the rising chaos hamnet thyssen couldnt have found a better question if he tried for a week finding out what was really going on came ahead of everything else well your ferocity theyre moving south the bizogot rider answered he pointed east theyre heading down into our country into red dire wolf country over that way theyre not coming straight at the camp then trasamund demanded no your ferocity or not when i saw em the scout said but their war mammoths and riding deer are on the move and the herds of mammoths and musk oxen theyve stolen here he had more diplomacy than most bizogots he didnt remind trasamund that those stolen mammoths and musk oxen came from the three tusk clan totila said this is bad enough they move into the heart of our grazing grounds may god afflict them with boils we cant take our herds that way now not without fighting were not ready for another fight yet ulric skakki said in a low voice now tell me something i didnt know hamnet thyssen answered do you think the bizogots ever will be well if the answer turns out to be no we both rode a demon of a long way for nothing ulric said which seemed like another obvious truth what are we going to do liv found one more important question will we go over to the attack will we run from the rulers or will we stay here and wait till they strike us lets hit them trasamund boomed he might have been a male grouse booming where no females could hear him the bizogots didnt take up the cry they werent eager to strike at the rulers one fight with the foe from beyond the glacier had taught them how misplaced eagerness was they might fight bravely against the invaders but few of them would swarm forward to do it trasamund didnt seem to see that lets hit them he cried again fear had kindled among the red dire wolves ferocity wouldnt again trasamunds bellow fell into a deep dark pool of silence it raised no echoes the jarl of the three tusk clan turned red with rage when he saw it wouldnt are you afraid trasamund shouted now in disbelief no one told him no he clapped a hand to his forehead count hamnet wondered if he would have a stroke but he didnt we know which direction the rulers will come from now totila said we can work out how best to beat them back when they do but trasamund looked around he sent totila a withering glance but realized standing fast was as much as he could hope to get from the other bizogots he had not a chance in the world of making them go forward shaking his head he said we should be able to do more than this sometimes doing anything at all is as much as you can ask for hamnet thyssen told him maybe trasamund didnt sound as if he believed it but if were standing still and theyre still coming forward the chin stands still the fist comes forward and sometimes the fist breaks knuckles when it hits the chin hamnet said sometimes the bizogot jarl echoed gloomily hed broken knuckles on both hands but he went on most of the time the fist strikes home and the fellow with the chin goes down he looked at the clansmen all around by god raumsdalian what do we do if they smash us again where do we run where can we run the thing to do your ferocity is make sure they dont smash us count hamnet hoped the bizogots could do that trasamund wasnt wrong another defeat would ruin the red dire wolves another defeat might also persuade a lot of other clans to roll on their backs for the rulers easier and safer to yield than to go up against an overwhelmingly strong foe in hopeless battle so the nomads might believe anyhow or they might not hamnet thyssen knew he was thinking like a civilized man like a raumsdalian himself the bizogots were a proud and touchy folk they might decide they would rather die than admit the invaders from beyond the glacier were their superiors he had no way to know ahead of time he would have to see for himself when he said as much to ulric skakki the adventurer said heres hoping we dont have to find out your grace he turned count hamnet s title of nobility into one of faint reproach how do you mean hamnet asked if we can beat the rulers we dont have to worry that theyll panic the rest of the clans into going bellyup oh yes there is that hamnet sounded as dubious as trasamund had a little while before if you dont think we can what are you doing here ulric spoke in a low voice he took count hamnet by the elbow and steered him away from trasamund and the other bizogots the steppe squelched under their boots the bizogot country which had been white for so long was green now the green of grass and rocks and tiny shrubs all splashed with red and yellow and blue flowers the brief beauty effectively disguised what a harsh land it was what am i doing here hamnet echoed the best i can dont make yourself out to be that big a hero ulric said you would have stayed down in the empire if liv stayed with you yes i like her company hamnet said so what im entitled to a little happiness if i can find it nobody is entitled to happiness youll lose it if you think you are ulric spoke with unusual conviction you may stumble over it now and again but thats not because youre entitled to it he was likely to be right no as far as hamnet could see he was bound to be right recognizing as much the noble changed the subject even if id gone down to my castle instead of coming up here i would have met the rulers sooner or later or will you tell me im wrong about that i wish i could ulric skakki sighed well you dont always get what you want sometimes youre stuck with things were stuck with the bizogots now and with the slim chances they have see you think so too hamnet said theyre doing something anyhow ulric sighed again even more mournfully than before i wish they were doing more i wish they knew how to do more i wish they had some tiny notion of how to work together and i wish sigvat would have taken his head out of his he sighed one more time i said it myself a minute ago you dont always get what you want how about what you dont want count hamnet asked ulric skakki made a questioning noise hamnet explained i dont want to get beaten again oh that ulric said airily well find out fighting among hisown countrymen hamnet thyssen wouldnt have ridden out as a scout to keep an eye on what the enemy was up to the raumsdalians had soldiers who specialized in such things as they had specialists who had dealt with catapults sharpshooting archers and others who could do one thing very well and the others not so well up in the bizogot country shamans were the only specialists everyone else had to be able to do all the things people needed to do to live on the frozen steppe there wasnt enough surplus to let the nomads be able to specialize in bad years there was no surplus at all there wasnt enough starvation was an uncommon misfortune down in the empire but a fact of life here motion drew hamnet s eye it wasnt a riding deer or a war mammoth in the distance but a vole or lemming scurrying from one tussock to another almost under his horses hooves a moment later a weasel streaked after the other little animal most of the weasels coat had gone brown with only a few small white patches left the beasts needed no calendar to know spring was here birds of all sizes from larkspurs to teratorns crowded the bizogot country most of them fed on the bounty of bugs the springtime ponds brought others ate the birds that ate the bugs hawks and owls lived here too more waterfowl bred on the edges of sudertorp lake south of the red dire wolves grazing grounds than anywhere else but others found smaller ponds and puddles good enough a goose rose from a pond and flew away as hamnet came near the bird couldnt know he wasnt hunting it if he were hungry he might have been he kept staring east he was getting close to where the bizogot had spotted the rulers the invaders scouts would probably be prowling out this way they would want to know how alert the bizogots were ulric skakki rode somewhere not too far away though hamnet couldnt see him right now the frozen steppe looked perfectly flat and well it might since the glacier had lain on it so long and left so recently but it wasnt or not quite it had its gentle swells and dips some of those hid the adventurer from sight what do i do if four or five enemies come at me but hamnet thyssen knew the answer to that if he was outnumbered he would run away he wasnt out to be a hero or even a fierce warrior all he wanted to do was make sure the rulers werent heading for the red dire wolves encampment along this line something out there on the horizon hamnets eyes narrowed he shaded them with his left hand trying to see better animals he muttered aloud he urged his horse forward were those some of the rulers herds or perhaps beasts theyd stolen from the bizogots or was that their army on the move he had to find out as he rode forward he wondered how the rulers treated enemies they captured not very well was his best guess he hadnt been a captured enemy the last time he stayed at one of their encampments hed been what a curiosity perhaps along with the other raumsdalians and bizogots who traveled beyond the glacier but what hed seen and heard made it clear the rulers didnt think men and women of other folk were really human beings they were hard enough on their own kind casting them out if taken prisoner and expecting them to kill themselves if defeated on others hamnet thyssen didnt want to find out the hard way he hadnt gone very far before a couple of small shapes separated themselves from the larger mass there on the horizon and came his way he nodded to himself the rulers were alert he might despise them he did despise them but they made monstrously good warriors he kept going a while longer long enough to satisfy himself that he was just seeing a herd not the vanguard of the rulers army that didnt let those riding deer he could plainly make out that they were riding deer now get within bowshot of his horse but it did let them come closer than hed intended no he didnt want to find out how the rulers treated prisoners he wheeled his horse and rode back more or less in the direction from which hed come hoarse shouts rang out behind him faint in the distance had the enemy warriors thought he would oblige them by riding straight into their hands too bad for them if they had when he looked over his shoulder they were coming after him as fast as their riding deer would go he booted his horse up from a trot to a gallop he kept zigzagging a bit not wanting to show the rulers exactly in which direction the red dire wolves camp lay they kept after him if they ran their antlered mounts into the ground in the pursuit they didnt seem to care he had more trouble pulling away from them than hed thought he would he began looking around for ulric skakki he didnt want to be rescued or not exactly but he wouldnt have minded knowing where the adventurer was then he found out he chanced to be looking back again when one of the rulers threw up his hands and slid off over his riding deers tail a moment later an arrow struck the other ones mount the deer crashed to the ground pinning the warrior beneath it ulric skakki galloped up sprang down from his horse and finished the man with a swordthrust by the time hamnet rode back to him he was already mounted again that was nicely done hamnet said reflecting that ulric made a monstrously good warrior too even if he wasnt showy about it the way the rulers were thanks ulric answered now you made it easy they didnt pay any attention to me till much too late the foxes chased the hare and didnt notice the dire wolf hamnet wasnt sure he liked the idea of being nothing more than someone who distracted the foe from a real danger he wanted the rulers to think he was dangerous himself ulric winked at him disconcertingly sharp youve got the cutest whiskers im so glad you think so hamnet thyssen batting his eyes made ulric laugh out loud count hamnet couldnt keep his mood light for long he asked did you get a good look at the herd up ahead he pointed east how many of the rulers were there with it at least these two the adventurer pointed to one of the corpses i didnt see that many more did you i didnt think so hamnet answered id say weve proved the main thrust against the red dire wolves wont come along this path id say youre right ulric nodded and id also say wed better get back to them anyhow that thrust is coming whether its coming this way or not i dont want to ride into camp and find out theres no camp left if you know what i mean hamnet thyssen understood him much too well he didnt want to think of getting back there and finding the rulers had broken the bizogots if anything happened to liv he especially didnt want anything to happen to her if he wasnt there to do all he could to keep it from happening that probably didnt make much sense but he didnt care lets ride he said harshly again he had the feeling ulric skakki knew exactly what he was thinking he didnt care as long as the adventurer kept his mouth shut about liv they would get along fine if ulric didnt if ulric didnt hamnet would try to hurt him he wasnt sure he could the last time he tried he flew through the air with the greatest of ease and ended up suddenly and painfully on his back on a hard stone floor he was bigger than ulric skakki and thought he was stronger ulric was faster and trickier more often than not that gave him the edge we shouldnt quarrel among ourselves ulric said not quite out of nowhere we should save it for the rulers well youre right hamnet thyssen wasnt about to let ulric know hed been thinking about fighting him a shorteared fox trotted across their path like the weasels its pelt was going from white to brown the hares up here were also shorteared and stocky next to the ones that bounded across the raumsdalian prairie while northern lynxes were more compact than bobcats what about the bizogots ulric skakki asked when count hamnet remarked on that why arent they built like balls they wear clothes they build fires hamnet answered and take a look at the rulers they are broader and thicker than most folk from this side of the glacier ulric grunted if i never had to look at the rulers again it wouldnt break my heart youd best believe that nor mine count hamnet agreed i wonder what their women are like though ulric said all at once thoughtful we havent seen them theyre here now liv saw them in her spirit flight she called them ugly bitches hamnet thyssen said so the rulers arent just coming to raid theyre coming to settle i want to see their women myself in the flesh not just in spirit ulric skakki said they would mean weve beaten them so badly were coming up to their camps or it could mean theyve captured us and put us to work there count hamnet said ulric made a horrible face besides hamnet went on you dont mean you want to see them you mean you want to swive them well yes ulric admitted but if you say that to a bizogot girl named arnora i wont be very happy with you count hamnet had noticed that ulric had taken up with one bizogot in particular instead of spreading himself through the mammothherders women as opportunity among other things arose hamnet had a horror of infidelity all the same he said i wont blab sooner or later though youll give yourself away let me worry about that ulric could have said a good many other things he left them unspoken hamnet appreciated his tact such as it was they spotted smoke an hour or so later hamnet feared at first it was the smoke of a sack but soon realized there wasnt enough for that it was only the normal smoke that rose above any bizogot encampment he breathed a loud long sigh of relief ulric skakki sent him a crooked smile now that you mention it yes when they rode into the camp the bizogots cheered to learn theyd slain a couple of warriors from the rulers two more we wont have to worry about at the next big battle totila said sounding a lot like trasamund arnora embraced ulric after he got down from his horse her blue eyes shone she was as tall as he was and almost as wide through the shoulders kill more of them she said with bizogot directness kill many more ill make you glad you do she led him off to a tent to attend to that on the spot we only gave them a fleabite hamnet said scratching as if reminded before long theyll try to do worse to us let them come trasamund shouted let them do their worst do they think we fear them by god well teach them a thing or two let them come hamnet thyssen looked at liv she said what was in his mind too be careful what you ask for your ferocity or god may decide to give it to you the rulers cametwo days later driving in the scouts patrolling to the east and sending them headlong back into the red dire wolves encampment in fear for their lives arm yourselves the scouts shouted as they rode in we have to fight to me three tusk clan trasamund bellowed to me another chance for vengeance is here totila shouted for his warriors too hamnet thyssen wished other clans had ridden in that would have given the bizogots a better chance against their foes or maybe he thought glumly it would have given the rulers the chance to get rid of more bizogots at once he knew too well that the bizogots had had little luck against the invaders in battle can we stop them he asked liv do you mean can our fighters stop theirs man for man we can match them she said when it comes to shamanry though well audun and odovacar and i will do our best i have to hope it will be good enough he gave her a quick kiss he had to hope whatever magic the shamans and audun gilli could muster would be good enough too if you can spook their war mammoths that would be good wouldnt it liv said well try well try everything we can think of this is our land totila was shouting these are our herds are we going to let these flyblown mammoth turds steal them from us no the bizogots yelled back their spirits still seemed high hamnet thyssen admired them for that at the same time wondering where theyd left their memories the rulers already held the heart of the red dire wolves grazing lands the invaders had already beaten the clan once why did totila think his countrymen could beat the rulers now maybe he didnt maybe he just thought they had to make the fight if they didnt if they fled they would be invaders themselves trying to take land from other bizogots and they would have a brand new war on their hands if they did sometimes you needed to fight even when the odds were bad well well ulric skakki looked up from the methodical examination he was giving the arrows in his quiver doesnt this sound like fun his bright cheery voice matched the wide smile on his foxy features count hamnet just shook his head no what do you suppose the bizogots will do if things go wrong again ulric spoke raumsdalian so most of the mammothherders wouldnt understand what do you suppose well do if things go wrong try to stay alive hamnet said also in raumsdalian what else can we do what can anybody do when things go wrong a point yes a distinct point the adventurer tapped one of the points sticking up from the quiver not too sharp a point i hope the bizogots and the raumsdalians whod come north rode out behind the scouts a little later women and old men stayed behind to tend the herds though some women carried bows to battle arnora rode beside ulric skakki and seemed as ready to fight as any of the men howling out battle songs if the rulers broke the red dire wolves again would the herd guards be able to keep the bizogots animals out of the invaders hands nobody could know something like that ahead of time but hamnet had his doubts there the shout rose from up ahead there they are the godcursed rogues are you ready hamnet asked liv id better be but how much difference would it make if i werent she said he had no good answer for that can you do anything about their mammoths he asked she smiled at him the way a mother might smile at a fussy child we can do things she replied i dont know whether theyll work the way we hope but we can do them he had to be content or not so content with that he worried as he rode forward with the bizogots if liv and audun and odovacar couldnt stop or slow down the mammoths this battle was lost before it began they had to see that didnt they liv did audun probably did odovacar hamnet thyssen wasnt sure how much odovacar saw or how much it mattered closer now the mammoths loomed up ahead like perambulating mountains the riding deer out to the flanks werent nearly so formidable where were the rulers wizards what new deviltry were they planning the bizogots shouted totilas name and trasamunds they shouted for vengeance they roared out their hatred of the rulers they shook their fists they yelled curses that probably wouldnt bite and the rulers yelled back hamnet thyssen still knew next to nothing of their harsh guttural speech all the same he doubted that the invaders were praising the bizogots or passing the time of day arrows started to fly do you see ulric skakki said theyve put more armor on their mammoths hamnet hadnt noticed but ulric was right the thick leather sheets did cover more of the enormous beasts i dont care how much they put on hamnet said leather wont turn a square hit as if to try to prove the point he nocked an arrow and let fly ulric skakki also began shooting i dont think they can armor their deer or not very much he said those have all they can do to carry men they dont have any weight left over for armor too down in the empire heavy cavalry horses would carry a trooper his coat of mail and iron armor of their own charges of such knights were irresistible except perhaps by mammoths but the bizogots had neither such big horses nor such armor their warriors wore cuirasses of leather boiled in oil when they wore armor at all their horses had no more protection than the rulers riding deer deer and horses then made larger easier targets than warriors wounded animals shrilled out cries of pain that reminded hamnet thyssen of women in torment listening he wanted to stuff his fingers in his ears to block out the horrid sounds but his hands had other things to do he methodically drew and shot drew and shot his bowstring didnt break as it had in the last fight against the rulers liv had set a spell on it and on many others to ward against the enemys sorcerous mischief audun and odovacar had also seen to the bizogots bows so far their charms seemed to be working bizogot horsemen were at least a match for the warriors of the rulers on riding deer but horsemen could not withstand the rulers war mammoths fight as the bizogots would the mammoths drove a great wedge into the center of their line threatening to split their force in two if you can do anything at all about those godcursed beasts this would be a mighty good time hamnet shouted to liv ill try she answered and said something to audun gilli who rode close by the raumsdalian wizard nodded he began what hamnet recognized as a protective spell to keep liv from having to guard herself while she made a different kind of magic count hamnet wouldnt have wanted to cast a spell while riding a bucketing horse and hoping no enemy arrow struck home that was what liv had to do though and she did it as if she had years of practice her voice never wavered and her passes were or at least seemed quick and reliable hamnet admired her at least as much for her unflustered competence as for her courage and suddenly the ground in front of and under the rulers war mammoths began to boil with with what with voles hamnet realized and with lemmings and with all the other mousy little creatures that lived on the northern steppe some of them started running up the mammoths legs others squeaked and died as great feet squashed them still others started up the mammoths trunks instead of their legs the mammoths liked that no better than hamnet would have enjoyed a sending of cockroaches they did odd ridiculouslooking dance steps trying to shake free of the voles and lemmings if they also shook free of some of the warriors on their backs they didnt care at all the rulers might but the mammoths didnt and those mammoths particularly didnt like the little animals on their trunks they shook them again and again sending lemmings flying they didnt pay any attention to the battle they were supposed to be fighting where the war mammoths had forced their way into the center of the bizogots line now they suddenly halted more worried about vermin than violence the bizogots whooped and cheered and fought back hard had the confusion in the enemy ranks lasted longer and had they met with no confusion of their own hamnet thyssen often thought about that afterwards much too late to do anything about it then of course in the battle he shouted ha see how you like it he shot an enemy warrior whod fallen from his mammoth and then another one they would have done the same to him theyd tried to do the same to him but hed succeeded against them and liv and audun and odovacar had succeeded against their wizards no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than he discovered it did not do to count the rulers wizards out too soon the air suddenly darkened around the bizogots hamnet had thought he knew everything there was to know about bugs in the north when the steppe unfroze he quickly found out how naive hed been as liv and her comrades called voles and lemmings to the rulers mammoths so the enemy wizards called insects to the bizogots and their horses some always buzzed about all you could do was slap and swear but now the mosquitoes and gnats and flies descended in a cloud as thick and choking as if woven from the long hairs of the woolly mammoth horses bucked and thrashed in torment lashing their tails against the overwhelming onslaught fighting was next to impossible with so many bugs assailing every unclothed inch of skin even breathing wasnt easy hamnet thyssen coughed and choked something nasty that wiggled and tasted of blood crunched between his teeth gnats kept getting in his eyes he rubbed frantically the bugs didnt seem to bother the rulers or their animals or no worse than usual why am i not surprised hamnet thought bitterly the enemys war mammoths were still distracted but the warriors on riding deer seemed unaffected by either sides sorcery not far from hamnet liv was slapping and scratching and spitting as desperately as he was make it stop he shouted to her by god you have to if we do well have to let go of the spell that calls the little animals to their mammoths she answered he might have guessed that i think youd better do it anyhow he said theyre hurting us worse than were hurting them saying that tasted bad but not so bad as the insects that filled his mouth and furred his teeth liv said something that should have made every insect in the world burst into flames it should have but it didnt she shouted to odovacar who didnt hear her then to audun gilli who did audun nodded indistinctly through the curtain of bugs a bizogot right in front of hamnet caught an arrow in the throat gurgling when he tried to scream and drowning in his own blood that could have been me the raumsdalian thought and shuddered and got another gnat or another three in his eye he ducked to rub at himself and an arrow hissed past just above his head if he were sitting straight on his horse it would have caught him in the forehead sometimes whether you lived or died was nothing but luck he could tell when liv and audun and possibly odovacar began to fight the mad swarm of insects the rulers wizards had summoned the bugs went from impossible to intolerable all the way down to extremely annoying he could spit bugs out of his mouth faster than they flew in he wasnt swallowing or inhaling so many he could even see sometimes for a minute or two at a time and what he could see was that everything had its price as soon as the bizogot shamans and audun gilli abandoned their spell to fight the one the rulers were using the lemmings and voles theyd called to the battlefield did what anyone would expect little animals to do in the presence of big ones they ran away and the war mammoths no longer bedeviled surged forward once more we can beat them trasamund shouted again and again he went on shouting it after he pulled an arrow out of his left hand he went on shouting it after the bizogots having fought as hard as anybody could fight had to retreat anyhow he went on shouting it as retreat turned to rout he went on shouting it roaring it out at the top of his lungs long after he must have stopped believing it ulric skakki was bleeding from a gashed ear the kind of wound that splattered gore all over the place without meaning much how come were going the wrong way if we can beat them he asked hamnet thyssen oh shut up count hamnet explained ulric nodded gravely as if the explanation meant something makes as much sense as anything i could have come up with myself he said hamnet pointed south actually a little west of south are those riding deer he asked well they arent glyptodonts thats for sure ulric said theyre cutting us off from the other half of the army they re cutting us off from the red dire wolves herds too hamnet said theyre good at war theyre better than the bizogots because they come into fights with a plan ulric said theyre going to be a lot of trouble theyre already a lot of trouble count hamnet said and theyre herding us the way youd herd musk oxen or even sheep baaa ulric said or was it bah hamnet couldnt tell the adventurer went on what do you think we can do about it right now not a cursed thing hamnet answered well thats what i think we can do about it too ulric skakki said nice to see we agree about something isnt it and its nice to see the rulers can run a pursuit when they feel like it eh fornicating wonderful hamnet said ulric laughed for all the world as if that were funny for all the world as if anything were funny wheres totila ulric skakki asked after looking around count hamnet also looked for the red dire wolves jarl dont see him he must be with the other bunch if hes still anywhere ulric said glumly hamnet nodded he didnt see odovacar any more either was the shaman still alive hamnet wondered if he would ever know then he had more urgent things to worry about a warrior of the rulers shouting something unintelligible slashed at him with a sword he parried and gave back an overhand cut the enemy fighting man turned it with a little round leather buckler he wore on his left arm his riding deer tried to prod hamnets horse with its antlers the raumsdalian cut again he wounded the deers snout the animal let out a startled snort and started to buck just the way a horse would have the man on it had everything he could do to stay in the saddle hamnet thyssen got a good slash home against the side of his neck blood spurted the warrior let out a gobbling wail and crumpled a tiny victory too tiny to mean anything in the bigger fight the rulers went right on driving this band of bizogots north and west away from the larger group farther south every so often an arrow would bite and a man or a horse would go down spring days had stretched in a hurry that let the rulers push the pursuit longer and harder than they could have at a different season or say down in the empire after what seemed a very long time night finally fell we must be backup in the lands of the three tusk clan liv said when the bizogots and hamnet and ulric and audun gilli finally stopped to rest she sounded ready to fall over from exhaustion or possibly from despair what are they going to do chase us till they smash us against the glacier maybe ulric meant it for a sour joke but it sounded much too likely to hamnet thyssen vl the sun cameup too early count hamnet munched smoked mammoth meat he scooped up water with his hands from one of the countless ponds and hoped it wouldnt give him a flux of the bowels and then one of the rearguard shouted that the rulers were coming swearing wearily hamnet climbed up onto his horse the animals sigh sounded all too human all too martyred it was weary too hamnet didnt care if he didnt ride the rulers would kill him if he did he might get away to fight again later on what did we do to deserve this trasamund groaned as they headed north and west again why does god hate us it hasnt got anything to do with god ulric skakki said the weathers warmer so the gap melted through thats all there is to it all eh trasamund said and who made the weather warmer was it you i dont think so did god have a little something to do with it well maybe ulric grunted the jarls sarcasm pierced like an arrow and the weather was warmer without a doubt this would have been a warm day down in nidaros let alone here on the frozen steppe count hamnet wondered whether the steppe would stay frozen if weather like this persisted what kind of country would this be if it ever thawed out all the way up ahead growing taller every hour loomed the glacier imagining it gone from the world seemed lunatic only a few years earlier though imagining it split in two would have seemed just as mad whether god had anything to do with it or not the glacier was in retreat does this land belong to the three tusk clan hamnet asked or have we come so far west were in the country of whats the next clan over they are the white foxes trasamund answered they are a pack of thieves and robbers not to be trusted even for a minute to raumsdalians all bizogots were thieves the harsh land in which they lived made them eager to grab whatever they could and not worry about silly foreign notions like ownership if trasamund thought the white foxes were thieves even by bizogot standards that made them larcenous indeed unless it just said the three tusk clan looked down its collective nose at its neighbors ulric skakki must have had that same thought for he asked and what do the white foxes say about the three tusk clan who cares trasamund missed the sly mockery in ulrics voice with a pack of neerdowells like that what difference does it make you still didnt say whose land this is hamnet pointed out these are not three tusk grazing grounds that much i know trasamund said maybe they belong to the red dire wolves maybe to the white foxes but i have roamed every foot of our land and this is none of it can you not see how much poorer it is than the lands we use hamnet thyssen could see nothing of the sort he doubted trasamund could either the three tusk jarl reflexively boasted about the glories of his clan and its grazing grounds or rather the grazing grounds the clan had once held the grazing grounds now under the rulers sway his horse thudded and squelched its way to the northwest it was tired and blowing he didnt know what hed do if it foundered he shook his head that wasnt so he knew all too well he would die he was worn himself worn and nodding but he jerked upright when a deep rumble as of distant thunder came from the direction in which he was riding he thought at first it was thunder but thunder from a clear blue sky with the warm sun shining down would have meant god was taking a more direct interest in worldly affairs than he seemed to be in the habit of doing what the he asked liv i think it was an avalanche she answered she looked even wearier than he felt which he would have thought impossible if he werent seeing it with his own eyes but she hadnt merely fought in yesterdays battle shed worked magic all through it which would drain anyone after a yawn she continued sometimes chunks of the glacier will crash down when the weather is like this it will melt near the top and sometimes set everything farther down in motion lucky it didnt do that at the gap hamnet exclaimed farther north there its usually cooler liv pointed ahead look at all the dust rising from the plain it was an avalanche and a big one too sure enough a cloud of dust like the ones that sometimes rolled across the plains of the empire was climbing into the sky obscuring what lay behind it hamnet looked back over his shoulder riding deer and a few war mammoths still pursued though the rulers didnt seem to want to close and then as if to grind the fugitives between two stones bizogots rode at them from straight ahead they were men from the white fox clan which answered the question of whose grazing grounds these were what are you doing here you saucy robbers one of them shouted angrily get off our land or well fill you full of holes why dont you ride on by us trasamund yelled back then you can tell the rulers the same thing do you think theyll listen to you what are you talking about the white fox bizogot said then he recognized trasamund by god youre the three tusk clans jarl and much good thats done me trasamund answered bleakly ive lost my clan the rulers have taken our grazing lands and the red dire wolves too theyll come after you next theyre on the way he pointed back over his shoulder the white foxes reined in they put their heads together the warrior whod been shouting was plainly a man of some importance in their clan hamnet thyssen watched him bringing the rest of the white fox bizogots around to whatever it was that he thought he rode out ahead of them pass on he said if you come to our herds you may kill enough to feed yourselves but no more if anyone challenges you tell him i sunniulf have given you leave he struck a pose there on horseback so they might see what a powerful fellow he was still holding himself straight and proud he added as for the rulers well deal with them he waved the rest of the white foxes forward they trotted past the men fleeing the latest battle lost shall we go with them and do what we can to help count hamnet asked i wouldnt help that arrogant son of a rotten mammoth chitterling up on his feet if all the glacier fell on him trasamund growled did the white foxes do anything to help us let them find out for themselves and see how they like it the ones who live may have more sense after that hamnet didnt like it but he wasnt in charge trasamund was if anyone was after the disaster of the day before hamnet wasnt sure anybody could give orders with confidence these bizogots would follow them but then bizogots generally obeyed orders only when they felt like it we ride trasamund shouted they rode ulric skakki looked back a couple of times trying to watch the white foxes get what they probably will hamnet asked well yes ulric sounded faintly embarrassed people always stare when a really nasty accident happens you cant help yourself oh spare me you arent even trying hamnet thyssen said well what if im not ulric retorted i didnt like that sunniulf item any better than trasamund did what about you he could have done worse he could have pitched into us instead of the rulers as far as his clan is concerned pitching into the rulers will be worse we likely wont be able to take his name in vain much longer hell be too dead to come back and defend his honor such as it is count hamnet wished he could tell the adventurer he was wrong but he thought ulric was right sunniulfs doing us a favor though he said hes keeping the pursuit off our backs huzzah ulric said sourly for one thing he doesnt know hes doing us any favors for another he wont keep doing them for very long hes not going to run into the rulers theyre going to run over him again that marched too well with what hamnet was thinking he sighed his breath didnt burst forth in a puff of steam proof indeed that spring had come to the frozen steppe he wondered if he would hear the sounds of battle behind the ragged band of fleeing bizogots but the white foxes and the rulers clashed too far off to let him with another sigh he said well wed better get as far away as we can while the rulers are busy and we ought to cover our tracks too now youre talking ulric skakki told him concealing a trailin the north country was at the same time simple and next to impossible splashing through shallow rills and puddles and pools and there were no deep ones thanks to the permanently frozen ground gave long stretches where travelers showed no hoofprints on the other hand the mud all around that standing water showed tracks only too well if there were more high ground on the northern plains concealment would have been hopeless anyone on a hill even a modest hill could have seen for many miles but the swells and dips in the landscape were smaller than that they were just enough to keep the ground from being perfectly flat enough so that when riders were in dips swells helped hide them from those who came after them but when riders came up onto swells looking south and east a few hours after sunniulfs white foxes rode past to battle the rulers hamnet thyssen spotted war mammoths and riding deer silhouetted against the sky even though he swore his heart wasnt in it trasamunds was how the glory of the bizogots is fallen he groaned these bandits thrash us as if we were naughty boys how will we ever get away from them even he could no longer imagine beating the rulers escaping suddenly seemed too much to hope for liv by contrast stuck to what was still possible she pointed ahead theres a herd of musk oxen lets kill one and butcher it we need the meat three or four white fox bizogots and their dogs accompanied the herd they shouted angrily when they saw strangers on their grazing grounds and even more angrily when they discovered one of the strangers was the jarl of the three tusk clan but trasamund still downcast used sunniulfs name without his own usual display of chestthumping pride and it worked well enough anyhow where is sunniulf now one of the white foxes asked why isnt he with you he led his men off to fight the rulers hamnet thyssen answered when trasamund hesitated ah the white fox bizogot nodded that will have taken care of those rogues then well no hamnet said not long ago we noticed the rulers were still coming after us that made all the white foxes exclaim they couldnt have beaten sunniulf one of them said nobody beats sunniulf the others nodded ulric skakki jerked a thumb towards the southeast maybe you should go tell that to the rulers he said i dont think theyve got the news what do you mean the white fox bizogot lifted his fur cap and scratched his head what are you talking about if you wait around here much longer youll find out ulric said can we have our musk ox you can have it sunniulf said so the bizogot eyed him youre a foreigner dont see many foreigners around here you will hamnet thyssen ulric skakki and trasamund all said the same thing at the same time the white fox scratched his head again they killed the musk ox downwind from the herd then butchered it as fast as they could the speed of the job meant they left some meat behind that they might have taken otherwise clucking the herders started stripping that flesh from the dead beasts bones the three tusk bizogots and red dire wolves and raumsdalians left them to it the refugees rode off the rulers wouldnt be far behind liv pointed ahead towards the glacier which loomed higher on the horizon than it had a couple of days before you can really see what the avalanche did she said you can by god hamnet thyssen agreed it looked as if the collapse had started near the top of the ice sheet and extended all the way down the jumble of freshly exposed ice boulders was whiter and brighter than the older ice to either side the glacier didnt rise straight up from the edge of the bizogot steppe there either the slope was gentler more gradual we might really be able to climb that if we had to we might yes but why would anyone want to liv said instead of looking ahead ulric skakki looked behind them count hamnet imitated him yes the rulers riding deer and war mammoths had come up over the horizon again if our lovely friends keep herding us in this direction they may give us some reasons to think about it ulric said liv bared her teeth not at him but at the idea is escape to the top of the glacier if we could get there escape at all weve talked about that before hamnet said it depends on whether anything and anyone lives up there if anybody does getting up to the top may not be escape ulric skakki said that made hamnet bare his teeth because it held too much truth and because he hadnt thought of it god grant we dont have to worry about that he said liv nodded even cynical ulric skakki didnt say no trasamund was the one who grunted and scowled god has turned his back on the bizogots he said gloomily he pays us no mind not anymore well if you feel that way why not ride back to the rulers and throw yourself at them ulric asked you might get two or three before they kill you that is not revenge enough the jarl answered two or three pah i want to kill them all and if god wont help me ill cursed well take care of it on my own to count hamnet that was on the edge of blasphemy he didnt say so he understood what drove trasamund to feel the way he did and ulric skakki slapped trasamund on the back saying theres the first sensible thing youve come out with since i dont know when why dont you do it more often trasamund said something about ulrics female ancestors concerning which he could have had no personal knowledge at another time it might have started a fight to the death now ulric only laughed and slapped him on the back again trasamund said something even more incendiary ulric laughed harder if the weather stays so warm will we see more avalanches like this hamnet asked i wouldnt be surprised liv answered well probably start getting a meltwater lake up here too like sudertorp lake down in the leaping lynx country yes that makes sense audun gilli said the wizard looked towards the sun which was going down in the northwest not far above the avalanche in fact it stays light a long time in these parts doesnt it now count hamnet laughed at him you were up here last summer too you just noticed that audun smiled ruefully it does seem to matter more when the extra daylight means youre likelier to get killed hamnet thyssen grunted a glance back over his shoulder said the rulers were still there a glance ahead said the sun wasnt going down fast enough to suit him either well need to set plenty of sentries tonight in case the rulers try to hit us in the dark sounds like something theyd do trasamund growled i would too if i thought it would work ulric skakki said wouldnt you trasamund didnt answer from which count hamnet concluded that he would but didnt want to admit it to ulric the bizogots and raumsdalians rode on eventually the sun did set and twilight did fade on the other side of the glacier it was getting towards the season of the year where twilight lingered from sundown to sunup setting fires seemed too great a risk raw muskox meat wasnt hamnets idea of a feast but it was ever so much better than empty he wolfed down a goodsized gobbet so did ulric audun gilli looked revolted but he ate too the bizogots took raw meat in stride they ate anything and everything the three tusk jarl sent hamnet out to watch as soon as he was done eating the gleam in trasamunds eye even in the dark had to mean he was waiting for the raumsdalian noble to kick up a fuss hamnet went without a word did trasamund sigh behind him he didnt turn around to look he did hope liv would come out and keep him company while he stood sentry but she didnt he didnt get angry at that she had to be wearier than he was but it disappointed him stars wheeled through the sky in circles set at a different angle from the one he knew down in the empire more of them stayed above the horizon all night long than was true in nidaros somewhere off in the distance a fox yipped at the halfgoldpiece moon hamnet wondered if the yip was a signal but it came from due west a direction from which the rulers were unlikely to attack sometimes a fox was only a fox when dire wolves off in the south started howling hamnet worried more but nothing came of that either jumpy tonight arent you he asked himself with a wry chuckle havent i earned the right his answer formed as fast as the question hed begun to wonder whether trasamund intended him to watch till dawn when a bizogot came out to take his place anything the big burly blond asked foxes dire wolves hamnet thyssen answered i didnt see any rulers or hear any signs of them i didnt see any owls either owls the bizogot sounded puzzled their shamans spy on wings hamnet said his replacement grunted count hamnet stumbled back towards the encampment splashing through little pools and rills he didnt see till too late he might not have found the resting bizogots if not for the whickering of their horses and then a small sudden flare of witchlight that led him over to liv and audun gilli who were sitting close together on the ground and talking in low voices livs raumsdalian by now was fairly fluent audun had learned some of the bizogots tongue and eked it out when he ran short as he did now and again they both looked up when hamnet drew near oh its you audun said anything out there stars half a moon hamnet pointed up to the sky then waved a fox dire wolves howling no rulers god be praised the dire wolves were only wolves no wizards in the shape of owls or none that flew close enough for me to see audun had asked the question in raumsdalian and hamnet answered in the same language his birthspeech felt strange in his mouth even with ulric hed been using the bizogot tongue more often than not i didnt sense any spies liv said and audun gilli nodded liv went on i dont know why theyd need them were hardly worth worrying about anyway that held more truth than hamnet wished it did what was the little flash i saw when i was coming into camp i was showing liv a spell for piercing illusions audun gilli answered the flash is sorcerous energy dissipating think of it as steam rising when you boil soup steam wont betray us to the rulers but hamnet thyssen relented before either audun or liv could complain i dont suppose that little flash would either not unless they were already right on top of us he yawned with any luck at all im going to sleep for a week between now and sunrise with any luck at all liv would lie down beside him when he rolled himself in his blanket with any luck at all the two of them would lie under the same blanket he was tired yes but not too tired for that but all she said was sleep well i do want to learn this charm its better than the one we use hamnet couldnt very well say he wasnt so sleepy as all that with a martyred sigh not that he hadnt done it to himself he did go off and lie down liv and audun gilli went on talking quietly she laughed once just before hamnet would have dropped off the sweet familiar sound brought him back to wakefulness he wondered if he ought to be jealous of audun he thought and laughed too at himself yes the wizard and liv had sorcery in common but if he wasnt a weed of a man such a man had never sprouted liv hamnet thyssen was comfortably certain had better taste than that he twisted and turned and did fall asleep trasamund had to shake him awake are you dead or what the jarl rumbled thought id need to kick you one of us would have been dead after that hamnet thyssen said i dont think it would be me after weve beaten the rulers ill fight you if you want trasamund said till then weve got other things to worry about why whatever could you mean count hamnet asked the bizogots answering laugh was sour as vinegar hamnet rolled up his blanket and ate another chunk of raw muskox meat then he climbed onto his horse he hoped the poor animal wouldnt give out somewhere not nearly far enough away the rulers would be climbing onto their riding deer before long theyd be trotting out after the bizogots they seemed as stubborn in the hunt as a pack of dire wolves they kept pressing the quarry till it had nowhere to go hamnet thyssen looked ahead towards the glacier and the remains of the avalanche before long that would hold true for him and his comrades too with a sad snort the horse began to walk it tried to turn its head and look back at him when he urged it up into a trot it might have been saying you cant really mean that can you but he could he did the horse might fall over dead if it had to work too hard it would die and so would he if the rulers caught up to them by the nature of things the horse couldnt understand that count hamnet couldnt explain it to the animal all he could do was command the poor horse not understanding had to obey hamnet thyssen waited for the shout from the rearguard the shout that said the rulers were in sight the skin even the muscles between his shoulder blades tensed as if anticipating an arrow as if he wondered what else was he waiting for from those implacable pursuers he looked around trying to gauge what kind of fight the bizogots could make if when the rulers attacked in earnest he didnt like what he saw a few men trasamund chief among them in spirit as well as rank still had fight in them most of the bizogots though were all too plainly beaten theyd lost too many battles theyd fled too much and too long if when the rulers hit them they would break or die were a jolly crew arent we as happened too often for comfort ulric skakki divined what he was thinking oh of course count hamnet said in a hollow voice he pointed ahead towards some of the ice boulders from the avalanche that had bounced and bounded farthest across the bizogot steppe the dance is just past those big rocks isnt it ulric laughed as merrily as if they really were riding towards viols and a drum and plenty of beer and smiling pretty girls it would be a better dance than the one weve been making wouldnt it couldnt be much worse hamnet looked around again this time for his pretty girl even if she had nothing to smile about right now liv rode beside audun gilli earnestly talking about something sorcerous auduns hands shaped a pass liv tried to imitate it he corrected her with a little extra emphasis on the motion shed missed she tried again he nodded had ulric skakki not been riding beside him hamnet would have done some muttering he misliked the tenor of his thoughts defeat ruined everything even things that should have had nothing to do with it but the last thing he wanted was for ulric to know he had any worries like that the adventurer might not say anything he had to know hamnet would ignite if he did he would think whatever he didnt say though and that would be bad enough worse than bad enough the rulers there it was the cry count hamnet had waited for he hunched down in the saddle to make himself a smaller target he didnt realize hed done it till he saw ulric doing the same thing how many arrows have you got left he asked ulric some the adventurer answered reaching over his shoulder to feel what was in his quiver how about you some hamnet thyssen agreed they dont grow on trees you know again ulric skakki produced a cheery laugh from nowhere in particular even if they did much good it would do us what could we harvest here toothpicks by god that made count hamnet smile too the birches and willows and other wouldbe trees that grew on the frozen steppe never got bigger than calfhigh bushes setting a hand on his sword hamnet said this doesnt shrink it had better not ulric said but can we get close enough to cut up the rulers or will they shoot us before we do well find out count hamnet said and not even his argumentative countryman could disagree with that more and more riding deer and war mammoths came up over the horizon closer and closer they drew till now theyd seemed content to chase the bizogots by the way they came on they had more than that in mind today can you summon the voles and lemmings hamnet thyssen called to liv well have a better chance if theyve got to fight without their mammoths we can try liv answered and then she turned to speak to audun gilli count hamnet knew they were only planning their magic together all the same he frowned and looked away that wasnt what he wanted to see right now it turned out not to matter liv and audun had barely started their spell when whatever wizards the rulers had with them struck first it wasnt the spell theyd used before bugs didnt choke the bizogots and torment their animals instead hawks and falcons and owls dove out of the sky slashing at horses and riders alike wounded horses screamed in pain and surprise a bizogot not far from hamnet thyssen shrieked and clapped his hands to his face blood poured out between his fingers had cruel talons robbed him of an eye hamnet couldnt be sure but feared the worst were some of those wheeling hurtling owls wizards in sorcerous disguise he had no way to be sure but he feared the worst there too trasamund actually caught a hawk out of the air wrung its neck and flung the corpse to the ground hamnet marveled at the feat without imagining for a moment that he could imitate it ulric skakki slashed a falcon out of the sky hamnet thought he might do that but had no time to dwell on the possibilities the birds of prey flew off as abruptly as theyd appeared leaving the bizogots in disarray and confusion then shouting their harsh war cries the rulers rode in for the kill archers shooting from atop a war mammoth pincushioned the bizogot with the bloodied face an arrow hissed past hamnet thyssens head so close that he felt the fletching brush his beard he shot at one of the men up there the warrior of the rulers jeered as the arrow went wide then one from ulric skakki caught him in the forehead he crumpled a look of absurd surprise the last expression he would ever wear hamnet cut at another warrior on a riding deer the fighter turned his first stroke but the second one got home when the rulers were wounded they cried out like any lesser breed the warrior tried to fight on but count hamnet cut him down he looked around again some of the bizogots were still fighting fiercely others though streamed away from the rulers as fast as they could riding deer trotted after horses seeing riding deer get past him sent a chill through hamnet a chill more frigid than any winter on the frozen steppe could bring surrounded cut off weve got to get out of this he called to ulric well yes the adventurer said his sword had blood on it but how do you want to cut and run yes count hamnet thought then he saw trasamund pull his horses head around and ride off towards the northwest we cant stay anymore hamnet said and pointed after the jarl by god ulric skakki exclaimed what is this world coming to an end i think hamnet answered grimly when the gap melted through when the rulers invaded everything we knew before is gone its all different now even if we win even if we find the golden shrine it will never be the same i didnt expect a philosophy lesson which doesnt mean youre wrong ulric said id better go look for arnora and youll want to find liv well make for where the avalanche came down ill meet you there or i hope i will luck count hamnet said ulric skakki nodded do i need to look for liv wont audun take care of that hamnet swore at himself yes he was letting defeat poison everything in his life before he could even think of finding the three tusk clans shaman he needed to fight off another warrior of the rulers he wanted to kill the curlybearded fighting man but had to content himself with driving him off with a bleeding forearm there was audun gilli and sure enough not far away was liv she wasnt working wizardry against the rulers now she had a bow in her hands and used it with as much skill if perhaps without quite the same strength as a man might have neither she nor audun saw the warrior riding up from behind them hamnet thyssen shouted to distract him then plucked out a dagger and threw it at the enemy it wasnt a proper throwing knife it didnt pierce him but the thump against his side made him slow up and look around which gave hamnet time to engage him metal belled on metal as their swords clashed together you are that one the warrior of the rulers said in the bizogot language they want you bad well they cant have me hamnet answered his foe made as if to shout but hamnets sword went home then the warrior looked amazed he slowly crumpled from his riding deer hamnet forgot about him as soon as he stopped being a threat he grabbed liv by the arm we have to get away he yelled we cant she said the demon we cant trasamunds already gone hamnet answered her eyes widened her head swung as if on a swivel when she didnt see the jarl her features sagged in weariness and dismay truly everything is lost she said her voice quiet and amazed and all but hopeless not while were still breathing come on before the rulers close the sack around us hamnet said a heartbeat slower than he might have he added you too audun yes the wizard said maybe well win another chance later we can hope anyhow he didnt hesitate in talking to hamnet thyssen perhaps that meant he was a good dissembler in another man hamnet would have thought it did but hed spent too much time at close quarters with the wizard to find it easy to believe if audun thought something he usually said it ulric skakki could smile and charm and say one thing and mean another not audun thinking of ulric reminded hamnet what the adventurer had said lets ride for the avalanche hamnet said we can use the ice boulders for cover for a while liv said well get hungry there if the rulers want to sit around and starve us out they can and where do we have to go up to the top of the glacier by god count hamnet answered they wont look for that and we may get away and its something maybe no ones ever done in all the history of the world the idea had intrigued him ever since it first crossed his mind it didnt seem to intrigue liv no ones ever come back from doing it thats sure enough but she didnt say no not straight out and she did guide her horse towards the northwest so did audun so did hamnet thyssen some bizogots were riding in that direction others tried to break out to the southwest hamnet supposed they wanted to join up with the white foxes if they could they might stay safe for a while he feared climbing the glacier gave a better longterm hope and climbing the glacier was pure desperation a few warriors on riding deer had already got between the bizogots and the glacier liv shot one of them out of the saddle she had more arrows left than hamnet he relied on the sword and slew a warrior himself when one of the rulers started to attack audun gilli his deer seemed to go mad bounding off across the steppe at random despite his curses and soon his fist nicely done count hamnet said his tone as neutral as he could make it would it work for more than one riding deer at a time i dont think so audun watched the animals antics with solemn fascination i was surprised it worked once so was he hamnet said then they were past the rulers hamnet spied trasamund a couple of bowshots ahead and to the left he waved and shouted after a moment the jarl waved back and steered his horse over towards them misery loves company hamnet thought what now up the glacier plainly trasamund didnt mean it he blinked when hamnet thyssen nodded have you got a better idea hamnet asked trasamund spat i have no ideas left and nothing else either if you say you want to take it out and piss your way through the glacier ill try to follow everything ive tried everything ive done has turned to dung in my hands count hamnet shivered it wasnt altogether in response to trasamunds despair here close by the glacier it was colder than it had been even a couple of miles farther south this was where winter lived the growing warmth might have weakened it but it was a long way from dead theyd ridden past a housesized chunk when hamnet heard a shout from ulric skakki over here beside him arnora pressed a chunk of moss to a cut that split her cheek she wouldnt be pretty any more but that was a worry for later if there was a later now ulric said well here we are in this jolly place where do we go next hamnet told him vii this is madnesstrasamund said scrambling up over a tilted block of ice madness i tell you of course your ferocity ulric skakki said politely he pointed down towards the edge of the frozen steppe which now lay some distance below them would you like to explain to the rulers how mad it is hamnet thyssen paused for a moment at the top of another jagged chunk of ice he looked down towards the ground too the rulers werent coming after the dozen or so bizogots and raumsdalians who were trying to use the avalanche to climb to the top of the glacier in their boots count hamnet wouldnt have either they were doing about what he would have done were their positions reversed they were standing there pointing at the fugitives and laughing themselves silly we got a chance to kill a couple of horses and hack off some of the meat liv said with the musk ox that will keep us going for a while anyhow horseflesh tastes like glue ulric skakki complained how much glue have you eaten hamnet asked well ive eaten more crow i must say ulric answered and its plain enough i havent eaten enough glue to know when to keep my mouth shut he still sounded like a man on a lark not someone fleeing for his life without much hope that even fleeing would stretch it very far one thing audun gilli said we can keep our meat fresh as long as we need to we wont have any trouble putting it on ice the wizards laugh sounded slightly hysterical or perhaps just slightly cracked that didnt mean he was wrong most of the ice in the world was either under their feet or ahead of them hamnet thyssen was glad he had his winter mittens without them his hands not only would have frozen but also would have been cut to ribbons much of the ice over which he struggled was almost swordbladesharp a couple of bizogot men were without mittens theyd wrapped cloth around their palms which was better than nothing but probably not good enough one of them a big blocky fellow named vulfolaic said some of that horsemeat still has the hide on yes i can cut strips from that when we stop it will spoil audun said proving he really was learning the bizogots speech not if i piss on it a few times vulfolaic answered not proper tanning but it will have to do er yes the wizards expression said he would rather do without gauntlets than wear that kind vulfolaic wasnt so fussy squeamish bizogots wouldnt last long how long will we last anyhow hamnet wondered climbing to the top of the glacier if they could might give them their best chance to escape the rulers but he knew that best was none too good if they died here and if scavengers didnt find them they might stay perfectly preserved for a long time what held true for horsemeat also held for human flesh come on he said we ought to get as high as we can while the daylight lasts what if we touch off another avalanche with the wound to her cheek arnoras voice was mushy and indistinct hamnet thyssen only shrugged if we do we wont need to worry anymore that made vulfolaic laugh spoken like a bizogot by god i wouldnt have thought you southerners had the manhood to say such things and to mean them if i had a copper for every time a bizogot wondered how long my prong was id be too rich to want to leave nidaros ulric skakki said he wasnt questioning yours he was questioning mine hamnet answered and as long as arnora doesnt worry about yours i dont see that its anybody elses business youre no fun ulric told him life would be so much duller if people didnt get all hot and bothered over stupid little things you mean like being invaded like being beaten count hamnet said im bothered i cant very well say im not but i defy anyone to stay hot climbing the glacier well youve got something there ulric reached up to him give me a hand will you you made it to the top of that block but i dont think i can not by myself youre taller than i am i wish i had hobnails in the bottom of my boots hamnet said grabbing ulrics wrist and yanking him upwards with a grunt the adventurer scrambled onto the top of the ice boulder beside him theyd make climbing a lot easier hobnails no trasamund shook his head you wear hobnails on ice or in snow they bleed heat right out of your feet maybe theyre all right in raumsdalia where its warm but not up here hadnt thought of that count hamnet admitted you may be right if we had boots with a couple of layers of hide between our soles and the nails though if we had wings we could fly up to the top of the glacier trasamund said and we could piss on the miserable rulers down below too hamnet shut up when he looked down to the bizogot steppe now he could hardly make out the invaders down there they might have been ants or fleas or other small annoyances they might have been but they werent he looked behind and then he looked ahead how far had they come maybe a third of the way he guessed the going got no easier as they moved on if anything the slope grew steeper without the titanic avalanche they wouldnt have had a prayer of reaching the top of the glacier even with it the climb wouldnt be easy anything but and something else was wrong or at least different he seemed to need an extra breath or two whenever he struggled up onto a new chunk of ice hauling ulric after him had made his heart pound then a light dawned were climbing a mountain he exclaimed the airs getting thinner it would do that wouldnt it liv said no wonder im breathing so hard do you have a magic that would let us breathe the way we do down on the plain hamnet asked her i dont she answered we never needed anything like that what about you audun audun gilli shook his head maybe someone in the empire does someone in the west most likely who has to worry about mountains more than people around nidaros do but ive never needed a spell like that either too bad i hope there will be enough air to keep us going when we get to the top count hamnet said dont you think you should have worried about that before we started climbing ulric skakki asked maybe well die up there hamnet said but maybe we wont if wed stayed down on the bizogot plain wed all be dead by now that wasnt quite true the rulers might have let liv and arnora live for a while but the women wouldnt have been glad if they did most of the time people didnt know what they were talking about when they spoke of a fate worse than death serving the enemys lusts till he decided to knock you over the head though that came much too close to the real thing he started climbing again so he wouldnt have to think about it liv went up the broken blocks of ice beside him her face was particularly grim maybe she was trying not to think about what the rulers would have done to her too after a while ulric pointed to the plain far below and said look you can watch sunset spreading over the land was it sunset or the shadow of the glacier after a moment hamnet thyssen decided the two were one and the same the sun wouldnt come up again till morning and he could see the shadow or the sunset line or whatever it was stretching farther and farther till everything down there the whole world hed known up till now was swallowed in deepening blue shadow the sun kept on shining on his comrades and him for some little while he watched the shadow creep up the avalanche from below them at last the sun set halfway up the glacier too or however far they were well trasamund said as it got darker and chillier and then again well he didnt go on it was as if he couldnt go on when nothing came after those two false starts ulric skakki nodded sagely and said i couldnt agree with you more the bizogot jarl glowered at him your whole world has just turned to a steaming pile of mammoth turds go ahead tell me how you feel about it well ulric let it hang too was he mocking trasamund or sympathizing with him count hamnet couldnt tell by the way trasamund muttered to himself neither could he hamnet wondered whether even ulric skakki knew raw meat made an uninspiring supper hamnet thyssen had gone without often enough though to know how much better it was than no supper at all as a smith stoked a furnace so he fueled himself he wished he could have found a furnace somewhere closer than hundreds of miles away a cold wind wailed down off the top of the glacier even wrapped in a mammoth hide he was chilly like any traveler he carried tinder and a way to start a fire he used flint and steel the bizogots who didnt work iron made do with firebows instead but how they would have got a fire going didnt matter now for they had nothing to sustain it liv sat up for a while talking about wizardry with audun gilli count hamnet was too weary to be jealous or to wait for her to go to sleep too the rough ice on which he lay might have been a feather bed exhaustion clubbed him down summer morning camesoon in the north country hamnet thyssen didnt want to wake up but light sneaking in between his eyelids left him little choice he yawned and stretched down below on the steppe night still reigned methodically hamnet cut bite after bite from a chunk of cold raw horsemeat he chewed and swallowed chewed and swallowed hed had breakfasts he relished more but he knew he would miss the meat when it was gone he ate now while he still had the chance not far away vulfolaic was doing the same thing after swallowing a bite he said i sat up a while in the night and watched did you by god well more power to you youre a stronger man than i am count hamnet made as if to tip the hat he wasnt wearing you didnt see the rulers sneaking up on us thats plain enough no vulfolaic shook his head he sent hamnet a quizzical look no bizogot would have admitted another man was stronger than he yet the raumsdalian had fought bravely in all the battles and skirmishes just past he scratched his head then crushed something between his thumbnails when he didnt say anything more on his own hamnet prompted him well what did you see you must have seen something or you wouldnt bother telling me you did sentry duty true enough now vulfolaic seemed impressed at how clever he was count hamnet wanted to pound his head against the glacier after another pause vulfolaic went on i didnt see the rulers no but a big snowy owl flew around us it must have known men well for it stayed out of bowshot he blinked when not only hamnet but also liv audun gilli and ulric skakki exclaimed that was the rulers looking us over liv said they wont be back either thats a sure thing ulric said why not audun didnt follow the adventurer clicked his tongue between his teeth as if surprised such naivete could exist dont be silly he said the owl will have taken one look laughed till it almost fell out of the sky and flown away why bother coming back im surprised they bothered checking at all a ragged bunch like us wont give the rulers any trouble even if we dont end up frozen for our trouble oh the wizard said in a small unhappy voice he didnt try to argue hamnet thyssen wouldnt have either he saw things the way ulric did he and his comrades were likely just putting off the inevitable and chances were not for very long either trasamund sucked horse blood out of his mustache lets get going he said if we have to do this well do it hamnet admired his determination living up to it was something else again every muscle in his arms and legs and back groaned when he got moving hed done too much the day before and he hadnt slept on a feather bed after all i feel my age he said if you werent old when you started this climb you would be by the time you finished ulric skakki said which also held a painful amount of truth whether they could finish the climb grew less and less certain as the day wore along the slope got steeper as they neared the top of the glacier they had to try several different ways to get around or over tilted blocks of ice theyd taken harness trappings from the horses they killed those helped but hamnet wished the leather lines were longer careful he called when he saw a block shifting under trasamunds bulk you dont want to start another avalanche trasamund held very still then backed down instead of climbing on the chunk of ice bigger than he was didnt move any more he nodded to count hamnet thanks i wouldnt have had the chance to start more than one thats for sure mm no hamnet said and what you started the avalanche would finish trasamund nodded again as they climbed higher though the bizogots and raumsdalians had to take more and more chances it was either take them or have no way to go forward they used what precautions they could no one climbed right behind anyone else except when the going was uncommonly good or when there was no other choice that way if they did start an avalanche it wouldnt wipe out all of them they hoped it wouldnt anyhow the long northern day helped even down in nidaros the sun would have set before they got close to the top of the glacier a mist coming off the frozen surface veiled the plains far below you know what someone looking up towards us would see ulric skakki said pausing to pant atop an ice boulder as clear and sparkling as a jewel he wouldnt see anything if we cant see him he cant see us hamnet thyssen was panting too the air felt as thin as a cheap tapmans beer after hed watered it he couldnt get enough into his lungs to let him move as freely as he wanted he felt weary unto death and had a pounding headache he knew his logic was good and started to get angry when the adventurer shook his head but ulric had an answer of his own hed see clouds were above those clouds looking down on them isnt that something you thought only birds and god could ever do no matter how cynical he was awe filled his voice well youre right hamnet said i hope theyre not the last thing we see so do i id sooner look down on the rulers than on clouds ulric said maybe because of the thin air scrambling his brains count hamnet needed longer than he should have for the pun to sink in when it did it made his headache worse or he thought so anyhow come on trasamund pushed himself to his feet again were almost there lets finish the job up on top of the glacier by god no one from down below has ever done that or wed have tales to tell of it theyll remember us forever in a low voice ulric said no one from down below s ever done it and then made it back to start tales will we well the bizogots right about one thing we wont if we dont get moving hamnet thyssen heaved himself upright too and we are almost there they had one last bad stretch nearly vertical with the ice alarmingly shaky under them then they clawed their way up out of the scarp the avalanche had bitten from the edge of the ice sheet hamnet s breath smoked as he stared across the top of the glacier it might have been spring down below but winter still reigned here or maybe not in the midst of all that white and blue enough dirt had blown into crevices in the ice to let plants sprout here and there and not too far away in the distance was what seemed an oasis in this frozen desert a mountaintop that climbed out of the glacier and showed green streaked with snow well we know where were going hamnet said no one disagreed with him never mind where were going for now liv said were here we did it isnt that enough of a marvel before i started up i thought it would be now im not so sure he answered she made a questioning noise he explained looking at what its like up here seems to me getting down again will be the real marvel she thought about that then nodded youre bound to be right he wished she had told him he was wrong he wished she had convinced him he was wrong the more likely he was to be wrong the better their chances were he wanted to ask her to sleep with him to make love with him that evening but he held back not so much for fear she would say no as for fear she would say yes and find him unable to perform after all the fighting and climbing hed done the past few days he was far from sure he could and the thin air up here atop the glacier only made things worse he felt as if he were moving under water with every step costing far more effort than it should have he and liv did sleep in each others arms once the sun went down but sleep was all they did hamnet woke once in the middle of the night when he looked up at the sky he wondered if he was seeing things it was blacker than hed ever known it to be and a whole host of stars blazed down far more than hed seen on a clear night down on the ground people who came from the mountains talked about how many stars they could see hed always nodded when he heard talk like that nodded without taking it very seriously now he saw hed been wrong so many shone here he had trouble picking out the brighter ones that marked the outlines of the constellations the milky way was a glisten of motherofpearl and then despite the beauty despite the wonder he fell asleep again he could admire the night sky for as long as he stayed atop the glacier sleep though sleep he needed now he didnt want to wake up come morning even with the sun smacking him in the face he yawned and stretched and groaned then he saw ulric skakki gutting a snowshoe hare for a heartbeat that meant nothing special to him which only proved how tired he was then he blinked where did you get that he asked through another yawn oh i looked in my pocket and there it was ulric answered airily hamnet thyssen growled down deep in his throat ulric laughed then before hamnet attempted mayhem on his exasperating person he went on it just came hopping along happy as you please it stopped to nibble on one of those little patches of plants they have up here and i put an arrow through it i wouldnt eat raw rabbit down below trasamund said ive known too many who got sick after they did up here up here ill eat anything i can kill and worry about getting sick later on they still had horseflesh and muskox meat too hamnet thyssen wasnt hungry any more when he started trudging towards the peak that stuck up through the glacier tired stiff sore trying to suck in more air than he readily could all of that but not hungry he saw more rabbits hopping across the glacier and other little creatures he couldnt name so readily do they go from one mountaintop to another like boatmen in the southeastern sea sailing from one island to the next he wondered seems so audun gilli said those mountains are islands here islands of life islands of life count hamnet echoed it was a pretty phrase and one also likely to be true the two didnt go together all that often what would we do if one of them werent close by ulric skakki had a oneword answer for that starve that wasnt very pretty but it too was likely to be true hamnet trudged along the top of the glacier they might starve anyway once their food ran out how many hares and voles and whatever other little creatures that lived up here could they catch enough to live on he would have been surprised a fox trotted past unfortunately well out of bowshot spit flooded hamnets mouth as he watched it go fox meat was bound to be rank but it was meat he got the feeling that if he stayed up here long he wouldnt sneer at anything even remotely edible in this thin air in this cold a man needed to eat like a sabertooth to keep going but for its eyes and nose the fox was white down on the bizogot steppe the animals had turned brown there wasnt enough dirt up here to make that worthwhile we can drink ourselves through every tavern in nidaros with this tale and never once touch our own money ulric said if we get back hamnet thyssen said well yes there is that the adventurer allowed though you didnt hear me being rude enough to talk about it id like to drink my way through a tavern or two audun gilli said wistfully hed spent a lot of time in nidaros drinking mourning his family lost in a fire hed had his head stuck in the ale vat for three years but hed done well enough and stayed sober enough since ulric skakki hauled him from the gutter and made him dry out one thing seemed plain he wouldnt have a chance to do much drinking up here no matter how far count hamnet and the other refugees walked the mountaintop seemed no closer hamnet had heard the air in the southwestern deserts was clear enough to make things seem closer than they really were god knew what air there was up here was achingly transparent we should have brought some horses up the avalanche trasamund said for a moment hamnet thought he meant it that only proved he wasnt getting enough air to keep his own wits working vulfolaic needed longer to realize it was a joke than he did which made him feel a little better the other bizogot did a splendid double take then sent trasamund a dirty look you could have strapped three or four of them on your back and carried them up that way vulfolaic said dont be foolish trasamund shook his head the wizards could have shrunk them and wed each have one in our belt pouches why not hamnet asked liv if the rulers wizards can turn themselves into owls why couldnt you do something like that easier to work magic on yourself than on something else she answered audun gilli nodded she went on we were a little rushed before we started climbing too or more than a little if youre going to complain about every little thing trasamund said i ought to clout you with something liv said but i havent got anything handy and im too tired to do a proper job of it on they went suddenly the mountaintop seemed to loom just ahead of them hamnet wasnt sure how it had got so close without his noticing probably because hed been trudging along with his head down it looked less inviting now that he could examine it better but then what didnt the green that had drawn them from afar wasnt the green of rich upland meadows as hed hoped it would be it was thin and patchy with gray rock showing through here and there or perhaps more often than that but it was undoubtedly a more hopeful place than the vast solitude of the glacier all around it some of the plants had flowers some even had berries already and if mosquitoes buzzed well they were life too something that looked like a rabbit with short hind legs and short round ears stared at the newcomers from little black eyes funnylooking creature trasamund remarked it probably thinks the same of you ulric skakki answered trasamund rewarded him with a glare ignoring it the adventurer went on i do believe thats what they call a pika they live up in the mountains south of the glacier too i wonder if it tastes like rabbit vulfolaic said before he could do more than wonder the pika if that was what it was disappeared into a hole in the ground thats interesting liv said why count hamnet asked the hole cant be very deep chances are we can get the beast out she shook her head not what i meant why would it be afraid of us if it never saw people before because were large and noisy and we smell bad he suggested livs grin was crooked enough to suit even ulric skakki well god knows thats all true she said a few buntings and longspurs fluttered about as they might have on the bizogot plains hamnet thyssen wouldnt have thought they could find enough seeds to eat up here but they didnt seem to care what he thought they were meat too if the bizogots and raumsdalians could figure out some way to catch them a spring bubbled up out of the rock hamnet had been chipping off bits of ice and putting them in his mouth when he got thirsty the spring water wasnt much warmer but it tasted far better he sprawled down not far away god im tired he groaned the others rested too the rock again wasnt much warmer than the glacier surrounding it but it seemed so the sun shone down brightly we have a refuge for a while arnora said hows your face ulric asked her her hand went to the moss covering her wound sore she answered the scar will make me lose my looks she shrugged im still alive i may stay alive a while longer anyhow you still look fine to me sweetheart ulric skakki said you say that because you want to screw me and you have no other women handy arnora said with a wry onesided smile tell me im wrong i know men i know how they work no man in his right mind would say he knew how women worked ulric said of course not but men are simple arnora replied i feel pretty simple right now ulric said i wont argue with you there i need food and i need sleep the more of each the better after that well my dear after that ill still think you look good you tell me so now arnora said when we get down again if we get down again well if we get down again that will be a miracle maybe i can look for another miracle afterwards liv was methodically gathering dead plants she eyed them none too happily theyll burn fast they wont give a good longlasting fire the way muskox dung would but maybe well be able to cook a little anyhow even getting a fire going proved harder than it would have down on the bizogot plain the air was so thin sparks didnt want to form and the fuel didnt want to catch finally though they could cook or at least sear chunks of meat chewing and chewing and chewing ulric skakki said no matter what you do to this stuff i dont think well see it at fancy eateries in nidaros any time soon odds are against it count hamnet agreed the odds were against their ever seeing anything in nidaros again but he didnt dwell on that dwelling on it wouldnt have done him any good anyhow while the sun shone the mountaintop stayed warm enough but theyd come to the eastern side of the mountain and its bulk made the sun set for them earlier than it would have otherwise they could watch the mountains shadow stretch west across the glacier they could but they didnt spend much time doing it they spread across the rocks and screen all of them looking for anything that would burn we might as well be sleeping on ice hamnet grumbled as a frigid wind began to blow as long as were sleeping someplace where our enemies cant get at us ill worry about everything else later liv said cold is only cold it gets much worse than this in winter down on the plain since she was right hamnet left it there he spread out his bedroll behind a boulder that shielded him from the worst of the breeze liv lay down beside him he looked around for audun gilli but didnt see the wizard anywhere close by that suited him fine i never imagined anyone could come up here liv said now that they were here the mountaintop gave new meaning to the phrase cold comfort hamnet thyssen tried not to dwell on that either twisting to escape a pebble that was digging into his ribs he said if it werent for the avalanche we couldnt have done it we never would have made the climb straight up the side of the glacier no liv shook her head we barely got here as it was im sorry things didnt work out better hamnet said maybe if you and trasamund had stayed up in the north she shook her head again it wouldnt have made much difference the rulers would have beaten the three tusk clan anyhow they are stronger than we are she grimaced though the sun was down twilight lingered long as it did in these parts hamnet could watch her lips twist strange to say something like that strange to have to say it but it is true do you think they are stronger than the empire too they may well be hamnet said slowly their wizards seem able to do things we cant match its true livs voice was sleepy and sad auduns had no better luck against them than any bizogot shaman youve spent a lot of time talking with him lately hamnet remarked not casually enough magic liv answered too much magic going on these days he knows things i dont i know some things he doesnt too she sighed doesnt seem either one of us knows enough doesnt seem anyone does would we be here if we did count hamnet didnt know where theyd be just magic he knew he shouldnt ask the question knew he especially shouldnt ask it like that and asked it anyway liv leaned up on an elbow she searched his face not just magic no she said we talk about things any people would talk about why is something wrong with that in the wintertime the bizogots had a devilish way to kill dire wolves they would skewer a chunk of meat with several long bone needles then leave it out on the snow a dire wolf would swallow it whole would have to because it froze hard as stone but when it thawed out inside the belly of the beast the needles would skewer from the inside out livs counterquestion seemed just as dangerous well i dont know hamnet thyssen said cautious now cautious too late the way people usually are cautious is there youre jealous liv said arent you no he answered the way anyone asked that question would answer and that question answered that way was almost always a lie he knew it was here as if to prove as much he added of course not uhhuh liv said which could have meant anything at all anything that wasnt good for the two of them she went on dont you think we have more important things to worry about right now yes he said which couldnt and didnt mean anything but no staying alive for instance liv said as if he hadnt spoken seeing if we can find a way down from the glacier with or without magic that doesnt get us killed i said yes hamnet reminded her he needed to remind himself too i know you did liv sighed again im going to sleep or im going to try to go to sleep anyhow good night good night he set a hand on her shoulder she didnt shake it off she just acted as if it werent there that might have been worse he took it away himself marveling that it wasnt charred to the wrist before long she started breathing deeply and regularly if she wasnt asleep she had a promising future on the stage if any of them had a promising future anywhere which seemed unlikely hamnet thyssen wondered whether sleep would find him no matter how weary he was he was also upset with himself for charging out onto thin ice and falling through and with liv for not giving him the reassurance he craved but no matter how upset he was he was also weary he went from wondering how he could have put things better to complete unconsciousness without even noticing when he woke in the middle of the night he was startled to find how dark and cold it had got and how many stars crowded the sky even more than had on the way up the glacier and he was even more startled to hear several foxes yowl and yip out on the ice not far from the base of the mountain he opened his eyes to see trasamund feeding the fire then he closed them and stopped thinking altogether he woke up again a little before sunup twilight already brightened the eastern sky and would for some little while before the sun actually rose he looked over at liv had she been awake they could have taken up where theyd left off the night before that would have been a mistake which wouldnt have stopped count hamnet from doing it luck or something like it was with him though he didnt think so at the time liv went on snoring the longer hamnet listened to her the slower and more regular his own breathing got pretty soon he was asleep again why not he thought as he dozed off it wasnt as if the refugees were going anywhere very far today he woke with the sun shining in his face but sunshine wasnt what woke him a kick in the ribs was he started to grab for his sword then froze when he saw that the man whod kicked him had an arrow aimed at his chest from a stride away and couldnt possibly miss if he let fly very slowly hamnet raised his hands his captor recognized the gesture and nodded a glance told hamnet the whole camp was overrun the fugitives hadnt imagined they needed to set sentries here atop the glacier that only proved their imaginations werent so good as they might have been these werent the rulers these men plainly lived on the glacier all the time they were short and stocky with great barrel chests to take in all the thin air they could they wore clothes pieced together from hare and fox hides their arrowheads and knives were of stone which was primitive but would serve fear pierced hamnet like an arrow would they think strangers in their frigid domain were anything but meat viii do you knowthis speech hamnet thyssen asked in the bizogot language the strangers looked something like bizogots though they didnt come close to matching them for size they were fairskinned and paleeyed with hair and matted beards of yellow or red or light brown one of them said a few words in his own tongue it sounded something like the bizogot speech count hamnet couldnt make anything of it though by their frowns neither could trasamund or liv or any of the other mammothherders to his amazement ulric skakki said something in what sounded like the same language or one much like it and if hamnet was amazed the barrelchested men of the glacier were astonished they all pointed at ulric and said something that had to mean how can you talk with us he replied haltingly count hamnet could almost follow him but meaning somehow flitted away then ulric spoke in the ordinary bizogot language theres this little clan bumped up against the western mountains the crag goats they call themselves they speak a dialect god couldnt follow its as old as those hills and twice as dusty thats what im using even if god couldnt you learned it vulfolaic said a man of the glacier shouted angrily and raised his bow in plain warning the captives werent supposed to talk in a tongue he couldnt readily follow then the man spoke to ulric skakki again ulric answered yes that much hamnet thyssen could make out but no more what he answered yes to hamnet had no idea ulric skakki and the men of the glacier went back and forth he spoke slowly feeling for words they answered at their usual speed they seemed to have trouble grasping the idea of someone who spoke only a little of their language after pointing to his comrades ulric got some grudging nods from their captors all right he said in the usual bizogot language though slowly and with an antique turn of phrase they give me leave to speak somewhat to you i think their ancestors came up here the same way we did and then found they could not return how long ago trasamund and audun gilli asked at the same time they looked at each other in surprise two men less likely to think alike were hard to imagine it did them no good ulric shrugged and spread his hands i have no idea he answered they dont know either longer ago than any of them remember thats all i can tell you what will they do with us liv asked what will they do to us had to be what she meant she was wise to phrase the question the way she did no telling how much of the normal bizogot tongue they might be able to grasp well i dont think were breakfast right now ulric said hamnet thyssens stomach did a slow lurch that had already crossed his mind should we give them the meat we have left arnora asked thats a good idea youre as smart as youre beautiful ulric told her and she blushed like a girl he went on theyll find it anyway better we give it to them than that they take it from us he spoke again in the ancient dialect the men of the glacier used the bizogots had lived north of the raumsdalians for a couple of thousand years when in that time did these peoples forebears come up here were they fleeing some disaster or were they just exploring hamnet thyssen shrugged a tiny shrug if they didnt know any more he was unlikely ever to find out when they understood ulric skakki they could hardly hide their excitement the strangers had meat the strangers would give them meat one of them pointed to his ear as if to say he couldnt believe what he was hearing he answered ulric quickly count hamnet couldnt be sure what he said but thought it likely to mean if youre really going to do this youd better do it the adventurer confirmed that saying they want to see it time for us to cough up im afraid go to the packs and get it out dont hold any back and dont go for your weapons were all dead if you do when the men of the glacier saw the chunks of raw horseflesh and muskox meat they sighed in something close to ecstasy those gobbets were too big to come from any of the animals hamnet had seen up here one of the men of the glacier used a stone blade to cut a mouthful of meat he chewed and swallowed his face lit up in surprise not man meat he exclaimed hamnet made that out very clearly some of the other men of the glacier sampled the new food they nodded agreement then they tried to get ulric skakki to tell them what beasts it came from horse and musk ox were only words to them when he talked about what the live animals were like when he stretched out his arms to show how big they were the men plainly didnt believe him theyd forgotten too much they ate the horsemeat and what was left of the musk ox in nothing flat hamnet thyssen knew the bizogots could eat more at a sitting than raumsdalians that was what happened when you didnt always eat regularly but the men of the glacier effortlessly outdid the bizogots trasamunds eyes widened to watch them put away the meat when the men of the glacier finished they seemed amazed themselves at what theyd done they patted their bellies and swaggered around count hamnet got the idea they werent used to feeling full they didnt let down their guard though several of them kept the bizogots and raumsdalians covered with nocked arrows their bows were marvels of bone and sinew and lashings of leather and roots they had no wood to give them proper bowstaves that meant they also had no spears which had to make hunting harder if we get the chance we can take them hamnet murmured to ulric without moving his lips i think so too ulric had also mastered that small but useful skill but will they give it to us hamnet wished he could talk to liv or audun gilli but neither stood close enough to let him do it without drawing the notice of the men of the glacier if they could use magic to distract the barbarians who could guess what might happen next the opportunity passed the men of the glacier used gestures to get their captives to hold their hands out for binding again the cords were strange to hamnet s eyes but they did the job he strained at them trying not to show he was doing it he had no luck breaking free a man of the glacier plucked a dagger from a sheath on ulric skakkis belt he stared at the iron blade holding it up close to his face then he tried the edge with his thumb he tried his own stone knife a moment later his shrug said he found them about equally sharp hamnet thyssen waited to see what the shaggy men made of swords especially of trasamunds great twohanded blade but they didnt disarm all their captives though another man did rob ulric of his bow and quiver the men of the glacier admired the bow and even more the few arrows he had left they still remembered something of herding they got the bizogots and raumsdalians moving off the mountain refuge and back down to the glacier as soon as they could see it they pointed to another peak that stuck up farther west and off they went surrounding their captives and urging them along having no choice hamnet went where he was bidden as long asthe prisoners tried to keep up the men of the glacier didnt harry them they also didnt seem to mind any more if the bizogots and raumsdalians spoke among themselves now that their hands were bound they didnt seem so dangerous that was hamnets guess anyhow do they have any shamans with them he asked liv as they trudged along i dont feel any men of power she answered after a moment spent doing whatever a shaman did instead of listening maybe there is one where were going though i cant imagine living your whole life without magic no up here thats for sure hamnet said i thought you bizogots led a hard life well you do but this is harder liv nodded these people are of our kindred she said not close kin not now but they were bizogots once their looks and their speech say the same thing so does ulric skakki count hamnet agreed some snow buntings fluttered by looking for plants growing in the pockets of dirt that clung to the top of the ice the men of the glacier sprang into action as if theyd practiced for years and so no doubt they had they carried nets made from sinews and twisted dried plants the same kind of cords they used to bind their prisoners flinging them up they caught several little birds then quickly killed them they seemed pleased with themselves afterwards the birds didnt offer much meat nothing up here offered much meat every little bit meant the men of the glacier wouldnt starve for a while longer hamnet thyssen would have pitied them more if they hadnt shown they knew what mans flesh tasted like things could be worse ulric skakki said a bit later oh of course they could count hamnet agreed sardonically they could have killed us all right away and started feasting on us back at the other mountain wouldnt that have been jolly not quite what i had in mind ulric said with what was probably commendable restraint i was thinking we could have grown up here ourselves the worlds biggest frozen trap god must have been in a nasty mood when he left these poor buggers stuck here he wasnt wrong not even a little bit to try to stay alive on terrain that gave a man so little it would have driven anyone to the edge of madness or maybe beyond hamnets shiver for once had nothing to do with the vast plain of ice across which he tramped then one of his captors let out a startled grunt and pointed north hamnet thyssens head turned that way he saw more human figures moving in the distance and those distant people saw his comrades and captors too they loped towards them the men of the glacier whod captured the bizogots and raumsdalians looked to their weapons theyre people all right ulric said put a few of them together and they make factions and go to war inspiration struck hamnet tell these bastards well fight on their side if they turn us loose he said urgently they didnt eat us right away after all and if we can get our hands free with something in them ulric gave him a foxy grin ill try no guarantees but ill try if it doesnt work how are we worse off how could we be worse off went through hamnet thyssens mind but there were ways he and ulric had both come up with some the adventurer spoke to the men of the glacier they werent altogether naive they could see that ulric didnt have only their benefit in mind but they could also see that the approaching band of barbarians outnumbered them if they didnt do something they were liable to end up on a spit or in a stewpot themselves they went back and forth with ulric at last he spoke in the regular bizogot tongue ive promised them we wont attack them right after this fight that seems fair to me but if we get our hands free well be equals or more than equals is it a bargain theyll understand yes i think yes everyone shouted the men of the glacier cut their bonds then the stone knives did the job about as fast as iron could have hamnet opened and closed his hands again and again working circulation back into them he hoped he wasnt frostbitten he drew his sword his comrades were taking hold of their weapons too you know youve been in a bad place when the chance of getting killed is better than what you had before ulric skakki remarked with what seemed to count hamnet excessive good cheer trasamund drew his great twohanded blade and swung it in circles so it thrummed through the air let them come he roared let them come by god and i will make them go the men of the glacier exclaimed and pointed theyd never seen anything like the weapon and maybe theyd never seen anything like the bizogot jarl either shouting the members of the other clan or tribe or whatever it was trotted forward if the sight of strangers with strange weapons fazed them they didnt let on one of them drew his bow and let fly his arrow fell short splintering against the glacier before long though the missiles would start to bite trasamund shouted a command much used in bizogot warfare chaaarge he lumbered towards the attackers so did the rest of the bizogot men and so did hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki hamnet threw himself flat on the ice when an arrow hissed through the space where his head had been a couple of heartbeats earlier as he scrambled to his feet again he said if we can close with them well slaughter them they dont have shields or armor or swords no sooner had the words passed his lips than he suddenly felt as if he were running through porridge not air the band of barbarians that captured him and his comrades might not have had a shaman along these newcomers did a bizogot howled and fell when an arrow pierced his leg the attackers might pincushion all of them if something didnt happen in a hurry liv count hamnet bawled audun do something even in that moment of desperation he wished he werent calling for the two of them together but he couldnt do anything about that now except hope they had a counterspell handy they must have for all at once he could move normally again one of the attackers a fellow with streaks of gray in his beard and how many men of the glacier lived long enough to go gray hung back a little from the rest when the counterspell freed the bizogots and raumsdalians from the magic that had slowed them he stamped his foot and swore the gesture was so obvious and so universal it would have got a big laugh on the stage in nidaros having stamped and sworn he started incanting again hamnet thyssen resolved to kill him before he could finish his new spell resolving to do it and doing it were two different things as hamnet knew too well but he got one lucky break for an arrow from a man of the glacier on his side pierced an attackers hand before that attacker could finish pointing his arrow at hamnets midsection the wounded archer howled broke the arrow and pulled it from the wound exactly as any other injured warrior might have done seeing hamnet bearing down on him he took a stone knife from a sheath on his belt and got ready to defend himself a stone knife made a good enough weapon against another stone knife against a good iron sword it was hardly any weapon at all hamnet thyssen didnt let the man of the glacier close with him and grapple a slash sheared off two fingers when the fellow tried he stood there astonished staring at the spouting stumps till hamnet cut deep into his neck with another stroke then count hamnet ran on towards the attackers shaman the mans eyes blazed at him blue as the depths of the glacier they radiated power and hatred with a shout the shaman started to aim a spell at him before the man of the glacier could finish it hamnet swung his sword nimble as a hare dodging a fox the shaman ducked away he shouted something hamnet couldnt understand whatever it was though he doubted it was an endearment hamnet thyssen swung the sword again again the grizzled man of the glacier evaded the cut again it disrupted his magic and again he cursed count hamnet the raumsdalian noble thought so anyhow one of the phrases the shaman used sounded something like the bizogot words for go away that count hamnet didnt intend to do this time he thrust instead of slashing the man of the glacier didnt know what to do about that hamnet felt the sword grate on a rib as it went home those blue blue eyes opened enormously wide in astonishment and dismay and pain the shaman opened his mouth too to shriek but more blood than noise came from it slowly he crumpled to the glacier hamnets wrist twisted as he pulled the blade free a veterans trick to enlarge the wound and make sure it killed he probably didnt need it here but drillmasters had beaten it into him when he was young and he used it whenever he got the chance with the enemys wizard dying at his feet he looked around to see how the rest of the fight was going at least half a dozen of the barbarians were down their blood steaming on the ice one bizogot was dead a stone knife had slashed his throat the man wounded during the spell was swearing with that arrow through his leg several men of the glacier were running off as fast as they could go ulric skakki wiped blood from his sword on a dead mans trousers thrusting it into earth would clean it better ulric said but earths a little hard to come by right here just a little hamnet thyssen allowed theyve forgotten what to do about swords a good thing too or they would have been tougher ulric said they put up a better fight than i thought they could when you scragged their shaman that took a lot of heart out of them did it hamnet had been too busy to notice oh yes they must have thought he was the finest thing since raw meat ulric skakki eyed the shamans corpse now he is raw meat i wonder if our charming friends will turn him into the main course and i wonder if theyll expect us to share you come up with the most delightful ideas hamnet said ulric made as if to bow as hamnet s stomach twisted he went on maybe i could turn cannibal to keep from starving maybe just to feed myself no i hope not anyway up here the difference between needing to feed yourself and starving isnt likely to be very big ulric said hamnet thyssen grunted before he could say anything a man of the glacier came up to him and pounded him on the back the fellow poured out a torrent of gibberish whats he saying hamnet asked ulric skakki that youre a demon of a warrior the adventurer answered that he didnt think anybody could kill old leudigisel but you made it look easy uh that youre entitled to his heart and liver and ballocks if you want them reflecting that his stomach had twisted too soon count hamnet said tell him i dont want to offend him but thats not our custom tell him i wouldnt pollute myself by eating any part of old whatshisname im not sure i can say that but ill try ulric skakki did he must have made his point for the man of the glacier said something and pointed to hamnet he likes what you said ulric translated he says it shows a manly attitude the man of the glacier spoke again he asks if you mind if his clan feeds on their dead foes flesh they can do whatever they want hamnet replied we didnt come up here to reform them we didnt even know they were here when we did come up he switched to raumsdalian so the man of the glacier couldnt possibly understand and id rather have them butcher the shaman than us by god yes that crossed my mind too ulric skakki said he spoke haltingly in the tongue the men of the glacier used the tongue related to an obscure bizogot dialect the man with whom he was talking shouted to his comrades they started butchering their fallen enemies hamnet thyssen couldnt watch for long hed butchered many animals and slain many men but hed never seen people deliberately cut up human corpses for meat no man of the glacier ate any raw mans flesh through ulric count hamnet asked why not the man who answered him explained that there was a curse on the practice i bet they come down sick when they eat their neighbors raw ulric guessed shrewdly you have to cook pork gray to keep that from happening and its bound to be worse with your own kind lots of curses have common sense behind them if you know where to look that wouldnt have occurred to count hamnet ulric skakki had a knack for eyeing the world sideways and seeing things other people missed hamnet said i hope there are enough rabbits and mice and berries and whatnot on the next mountain to keep us going for a while otherwise otherwise we have to keep quiet forever if we do somehow make it down from here ulric finished for him yes if we dont no one will want to do anything with us but kill us on sight thats what i was thinking all right hamnet wished it werent he didnt want to become a cannibal to put himself beyond the pale of decency for the rest of his life but he didnt want to starve to death either ulric spoke to a man of the glacier who was helping to cut up a corpse hamnet caught something that sounded like the bizogot word for friends the barrelchested barbarian nodded he said something that had leudigisels name in it hamnet guess the man meant that anyone whod killed leudigisel was a friend of his when ulric asked another question the man of the glacier shrugged and spread his gory hands he paused and wiped his fingers clean well cleaner then the man of the glacier said something more whats going on hamnet asked i asked him if he knew how we could get down from the glacier get back to the rest of the world ulric replied he said he didnt he asked me why anyone would want to when things were so much better here oh hamnet thyssen put no stress on the word he didnt think it needed any by ulric skakki s crooked smile neither did he did vultures and teratorns come up here to the top of the glacier hamnet couldnt remember seeing any overhead if he had he would have thought they were waiting for him to keel over marching and fighting in this thin air left him crushingly weary we went to war for this clan he told ulric they owe us help getting down if they have any to give the adventurer translated his words for the man of the glacier the barbarian shrugged he spoke he says to wait for another avalanche ulric skakki said no thanks count hamnet answered scavenger birds might or might not come up here but smalleared foxes no doubt drawn by the scent of blood already stood waiting just out of bowshot to clean up the remains the men of the glacier didnt want pointing to them ulric skakki said they show these people have been up here for a long time poor devils how do you mean hamnet asked they know how far a bow shoots and they know not to come that close that makes them smarter than a lot of warriors ive run into hamnet pointed to the puddles of blood now freezing on the ice heh ulric said thats one of those jokes that would be funny if only it were funny know what i mean who said i was joking hamnet thyssen answered the mountaintop refugeto which the men of the glacier led the raumsdalians and bizogots was larger and more hospitable than the one theyd found on their own it had a broad low southfacing slope that caught as much sun as there was to catch flowers and berries and other greens grew as thickly as they could at that height and in that weather stone pens housed hares and pikas and voles the men of the glacier did everything they could to make themselves at home here and everything they could do still left their little world terrifyingly bleak to anyone who came to it anew count hamnet saw his first women and children of the glacier there the only difference between them and their menfolk he could find was that they grew no beards so their faces were only filthy not shaggy they hid behind rocks when they saw oddly dressed strangers accompanying their kinsmen but came out with glad cries when the men of the glacier told of the battle theyd fought and showed off the meat theyd brought back they used dried dung for their fires as the bizogots did down on what hamnet had thought of as the frozen plain till he came to the top of the glacier some of the dung was rabbit pellets the rest well the men of the glacier couldnt even afford to waste waste we cant stay here long trasamund said in a low voice i wouldnt want to god knows hamnet answered but why do you say we cant because well eat them empty if we do the jarl said ill bet some of them starve every winter the way things are pretty soon theyll see they cant keep us if they havent seen it by now and then theyll kill us and cook us or try as soon as hamnet heard that he knew it had to be true wed best keep sentries up while the rest of us sleep then he said already thought of it trasamund replied good hamnet said we dont want to be pushy about it if we are were liable to give them ideas they dont need but we dont want to let them talk us out of it either thats about how i see things too the bizogot said we can whip them if we have to i think maybe hamnet said but even if we do so what do you want to be lord of this mountain he didnt come out and ask are you utterly mad but he didnt miss by much either the idea appalled trasamund i want to come down off the glacier i want to fight the rulers i want to beat them by god im jarl of the three tusk clan and thats what i aim to grow old being no matter how he aimed hamnet thyssen feared he was unlikely to hit his target his clan was shattered beyond repair so was the bizogots whole way of life on much of the frozen steppe if not on all of it hamnet could hardly blame the jarl if that hadnt sunk in yet sooner or later though it would have to he looked around to see what liv was doing he seemed to be doing that more and more lately and wished he werent she and audun gilli were both trying to talk to a scrawny woman of the glacier with long stringy blond hair the womans fur tunic and trousers were decorated with fringes and bits of sparkling crystal tied on with rawhide or cord he nodded to himself if she wasnt this clans shaman he would have been very much surprised can you translate audun gilli called to ulric skakki youre the only one of us who knows their language its a little like what i speak but only a little liv added when i guess i guess wrong half the time and you dont want to guess wrong when youre talking about shamanry a mistake can kill you a shame you dont want to put any pressure on me ulric said with one of his lopsided smiles ill try but i dont know how much i can help i didnt have a lot to do with the crag goats shaman he squatted down beside the stringyhaired woman and spoke to her in her language listening count hamnet felt he ought to be able to understand it but couldnt except for a word here and there it was at least as far from the regular bizogot tongue as the oldfashioned raumsdalian priests used in their liturgies was from the everyday speech of nidaros a moment later he forgot about the fine points of dialect for the smell of roasting pork brought spit flooding into his mouth hed marched and fought on very little food and that savory smell reminded him of it but it wasnt pork he realized that a moment too late a moment after the smell dug down deep and made his belly growl nausea and hunger warred within him hed wanted mans flesh he hadnt quite known what it was but hed wanted it part of him still did and that was worst of all trasamund went from smile to scowl in a way that suggested the cooking cannibal feast had smelled good to him too the men of the glacier watched their enemies flesh sizzle with eager anticipation they didnt think they were doing anything wrong by eating it had the men of the other clan won the fight these barbarians would have been burchered and so would i count hamnet thought ulric he called what is it the adventurer looked up from his colloquy with the shaman ask if we can eat some hares or whatever else they have instead of that hamnet pointed to the meat cooking above the fires oh right ulric skakki went back to the language the men of the glacier could follow the shaman sounded surprised as she answered ulric said she wants to know why when mans flesh is so much sweeter she says theres nothing better than the flesh of foes youve killed yourself wonderful count hamnet said tightly well tell her its not our custom or whatever you have to say to get us out of it god knows you arent lying ill do my best again ulric returned to the other dialect the shaman shrugged and tapped her forehead with a callused finger as she said something in reply she thinks foreigners are crazy ulric translated unnecessarily well we love her too hamnet said which made ulric bark laughter and earned the raumsdalian noble a sharp glance from the shaman hamnet thyssen looked back impassively and the woman of the glacier was the first to turn her eyes away instead of hares the men of the glacier fed their guests pikas and voles hamnet guessed they were being given the glove but he wasnt inclined to fuss about it he would have eaten worms and earwigs instead of the meat that smelled so damnably tempting the men of the glacier didnt worry about it hamnet could see why life here was impossibly hard they probably didnt recognize the folk of other clans as human beings at all but when he watched them cut flesh with their stone knives and greedily stuff it into their mouths he almost lost his own appetite almost but not quite he was so hungry before long he would have eaten mans flesh and been glad to get it that thought made him despise the locals less as he watched them feast how much does their shaman know he asked liv if he could talk about anything else it had to help hard to be sure but more than i expected she answered they have so little up here they cant use much for shamanry but what will can do will and bone and stone marcovefa does i suppose thats true for the other one too the one you killed ive never seen anything like that tanglefoot spell before i know that hamnet shivered i hope i never do again either he remembered the choice morsels hed been offered from the dead shaman with another shiver he wondered if one day before too long hed regret not eating them when he had the chance it was different sure enough liv looked at him from under lowered eyebrows why do you think im cheating on you with audun count hamnet started to deny that he thought any such thing he started to yes but found he couldnt it wasnt so much that he minded lying as that he minded minded lying and getting found out his voice dull with a mixture of anger and embarrassment he answered i imagine because i saw it happen before with gudrid im not gudrid thank god i hoped you might have noticed liv said tartly and im not sleeping with audun gilli either if you keep trying to watch me all day and all night though im liable to start just to give you something to watch he got out two syllables of a laugh before he realized she wasnt joking she thought spying was as big a betrayal as infidelity and she would repay the one with the other he hesitated he knew the words he needed but bringing them out came hard hard but he had no choice not if he wanted to keep her hating himself hating her a little he mumbled im sorry are you liv expected words to mean what they said bizogots werent much for polite hypocrisy but shed seen that raumsdalians could be she eyed him narrowly trying to scent dissembling she must not have for at last she nodded yes i think you are all right then let it go he nodded too it wasnt done between them he knew that but it wouldnt crash down on them like a great ice avalanche either not right now anyway he changed the subject can we sleep safely sooner or later well have to liv answered we may as well do it now no quarrel between us and them for the time being except about what they eat hamnet thyssen couldnt get the smell of roasting pork out of his nostrils or out of his mind we cant do anything about that except not eat it ourselves liv tossed a pebble up into the air it fell with a small click not eating it may make them leery of us but i dont think we can do anything about it nothing wed want to do anyhow hamnet said he curled up on the slope liv lay down beside him he slid his arm around her and pulled her close to him she moved willingly enough it should have been comforting reassuring it seemed anything but instead reminding him of how theyd quarreled and of what he feared he couldnt keep his arm around her all the time what would she do when it wasnt there shell look around to see if you re watching her thats what he told himself and youd better not be or shell make you sorry but how could he not watch gudrid had taught him that unwatched women cheated whenever they felt like it and you wouldnt know they were cheating because you werent watching them then when you couldnt not know any more you hurt all the worse because theyd been doing it for so long you couldnt win he couldnt even stay awake hed done too much and slept too little his eyes slid shut in the middle of a worry he never knew hed slid under if anyone tried to rouse him to stand sentry it didnt work except for breathing he might have been dead when he woke he was confused not realizing hed been asleep wasnt the sun over there a moment earlier or had he somehow shifted so that what he thought was east was really west no and no he finally decided this was morning and the sun truly did lie in the northeast the men of the glacier hadnt tried to murder him while he slept either liv still lay beside him snoring softly sleep stole weariness and years from her face hamnet thyssen could see the girl she had been not the desperate shaman with the strange foreign lover shed become when liv woke a little later she smiled at hamnet but the expression soon faded as she remembered where they were and no doubt what theyd been talking about before exhaustion claimed them they had a lot of repair work to do if they lived ix weve got toget down from here hamnet thyssen said if we dont and if we dont do it soon well have a war on our hands yes and so trasamund sent a hooded but scornful glance towards the men of the glacier it wouldnt last long and wed cursed well win wed slaughter them as a matter of fact and we wouldnt have much trouble doing it either i know thats what im afraid of count hamnet answered the bizogot jarl sent him a quizzical look he explained we slaughter the men we take the women and sire our own children on them we raise rabbits and voles on this crag and we fight with the men of the glacier who live on other crags then what we turn into men of the glacier ourselves thats what and the children we sire will think everything we say about what it was like down in the bizogot country is a pack of lies is that what youve got in mind trasamund bared his teeth in a horrible grimace good god no well i dont either hamnet said and so wed better take as much food as theyll let us have and get out of here before the fighting starts where can we get down though except where we climbed up trasamund said if we try that the rulers are liable to be waiting for us i doubt it were only an afterthought to them if that by now hamnet said theyve got bigger things to worry about farther south not just the bizogot clans down there but the empire odds are theyve forgotten about us maybe the bizogot didnt sound as if he believed it he was so selfimportant he couldnt imagine that anyone else even his enemies perhaps especially his enemies wouldnt think him important too at least were here in the summer hamnet felt like stretching in the sun like a cat it was almost as warm as it would have been down on the bizogot plains and up so high the sun was harder on the skin than it would have been down there a swarthy man hamnet had got darker many of the fairer bizogots were sunburned some of them badly with a grunt trasamund nodded winter up here wouldnt be much fun from a bizogot especially a bizogot whod lived his life hard by the edge of the glacier that was no small admission no not much count hamnet didnt want trasamund outdoing him at understatement maybe though it will melt enough of the glacier to touch off a new avalanche at the edge and maybe we can use that to get down even if it does how would we know trasamund replied and how long do you want to wait around and hope you were the one who said we couldnt wait long and i think youre right if a big chunk does let go we might hear it even though were a long way from the edge of the glacier count hamnet said not a lot of other noise between there and here he growled down deep in his chest as for the other youre right i did say that and its true curse it not enough food up here to keep guests long what are you talking about trasamund retorted up here guests are food not for us if we turn cannibal theres no point going down again next to that the rulers are welcome to do as they please not to me theyre not by god the bizogot said id eat mans flesh if it was that or starve not before but then it happens in hard winters once in awhile mm i can see how it might hamnet tried to sound calm and judicious not revolted but what do you think afterwards of the people who did it depends if they really had no other choice then its just one of those things if its not like that or if the friends and kin of the ones who got eaten decide its not like that well the cannibals dont last long then hamnet thyssen found himself nodding by the bizogots rough standards that seemed fair enough even down in the empire there were stories of men who ate neighbors and relatives when the breath of god blew strong and the harvest failed people laughed at those stories more often than not which didnt mean some of them werent true sometimes you laughed because screaming was the only other choice ulric was translating for audun gilli and the shaman from the men of the glacier whose name was marcovefa the adventurer suddenly straightened and stiffened like a dog that had taken a scent ha he said turning thyssen im here hamnet answered what do you need come over here why dont you that way i wont have to yell ulric said besides you may understand pieces of this in the original and its better if you try i might make a mistake grunting hamnet got to his feet parts of him creaked and crunched as he moved he had enough years to feel sleeping on hard ground after marching and fighting enough years to make him feel half again as old as he really was he creaked again when he squatted beside ulric and marcovefa and audun he had to make himself nod to the raumsdalian wizard audun nodded back as if nothing was wrong whats the story hamnet asked she may know another way down ulric answered that got hamnet s interest all right tell me more he said ulric spread his hands in frustration i cant or not much more anyhow the verbs are driving me crazy here wait ill have her tell you what she told me maybe youll be able to make some sense out of it i couldnt audun gilli said but audun had needed a year to get something more than a smattering of the ordinary bizogot language whatever his talents as a wizard he made anything but a cunning linguist well ill try hamnet knew he sounded dubious he thought he recognized words here and there in the language the men of the glacier used a couple of times hed made out a sentence as long as it was short and simple ulric spoke to marcovefa hamnet thought he said something like tell him what you just told me he wouldnt have bet anything he cared about losing though marcovefa answered it was her birthspeech she didnt stumble or hesitate the way ulric did that made her harder for hamnet thyssen to follow not easier he frowned listening intently when she finished he said didnt she say she knows where a way down will be ha you heard it like that too ulric said maybe the verbs are strange but that sure sounds like a bizogot future tense doesnt it it did to me hamnet said why dont you ask her ive tried it didnt help ulric sighed and tried again past now later all the same that was what hamnet thought marcovefa said he looked a question at ulric the adventurer sighed i think shes saying theres no difference between one time and another crazy little bird isnt she he spoke in raumsdalian which the shaman couldnt possibly understand nothing in his face or his tone of voice gave him away but marcovefa let out an indignant sniff and slapped his arm the way a mother would slap a child whod done something rude and silly she might not have followed the words but she knew she knew he hadnt treated her with the respect she deserved maybe theres more to it than you think count hamnet said slowly maybe ulric didnt sound as if he believed it but now he didnt sound as if he dared disbelieve it either that left him sounding confused he went on speaking raumsdalian maybe up here theres so little going on that now and then can blend like salt and garlic in a stew nothing up here would surprise me very much anymore i mean what is time but a way to keep everything from happening at once hamnet thyssen half more than half expected marcovefa to slap him again for being flip he wouldnt have been surprised if she was crazy at least by the standards that prevailed at the bottom of the glacier this was too strange and too harsh and too different a world to expect standards to stay the same but instead of being insulted the shaman nodded vigorously she let out what was to hamnet mostly a stream of gibberish by the bemused look on ulric s face he understood a good deal more of it but was none too happy that he did what was that all about hamnet asked when marcovefa finally fell silent she says i get it after all ulric replied shaking his head she says she thought i was as vacant as a vole which is a demon of a phrase even in her weird dialect till i made my snide joke but everything i said was true she told me she feels it in her heart marcovefa laid a hand over her left breast she might not understand raumsdalian in any ordinary sense of the world but she could sense truth and falsehood or she thought she could anyhow by what hamnet was seeing here he would have had a hard time telling her she was wrong then she said something else something that sounded very selfassured ulrics jaw dropped what now hamnet asked do i really want to know well im damned if i want to be the only one who does ulric answered she says shes going with us to the edge of the glacier and over it but what about her clan hamnet said wont they end up a feast for some of the others up here if she leaves them how can she do it the adventurer spoke to her she pointed to a young man scraping flesh from the inside of a pika hide with a sharpened bit of flint thats dragolen ulric said hes well on his way to turning into a shaman himself by what she can tell nothing too horrendous happens not will happen but happens to the clan till he finishes learning the things he needs to know tell her we dont eat mans flesh down below hamnet said maybe that will make her want to stay here but marcovefa only shrugged at the news like a lot of shamans and wizards she could be imperious when she chose i go she said and even hamnet couldnt misunderstand her however much he might have wanted to no matter whatmarcovefa thought of dragolen as an upandcoming shaman hamnet thyssen wondered whether the clan chief he didnt have enough people under him to count as a jarl in the raumsdalians mind would be eager to let her leave but he said not a word against her he was probably so glad to get rid of the dangerous strangers that losing his shaman seemed small by comparison hamnet asked both liv and audun gilli if they foretold trouble by bringing marcovefa along liv simply shook her head on matters that didnt touch their private lives she and hamnet still worked well together on those that did they didnt were already in so much trouble whats a little more audun said having no good answer for that hamnet walked away shaking his head ulric dickered with the clan chief over how many hares and pikas and voles the bizogots and raumsdalians would take with them when they left when he didnt like the deal the chief proposed he sweetened it by offering to leave a couple of swords behind with the men of the glacier that made the chief cheer up swords wont help them catch rabbits audun said a puzzled note in his voice ulric eyed him with something approaching pity rabbits arent the only meat they hunt and swords will help them with the other the other oh light a revolted light shone in the wizards eyes marcovefa led them off the mountainside and down onto the surface of the glacier count hamnet shook his head in wonder hed never dreamt he would need to descend to travel over the glacier hed never dreamt of a lot of the things that happened to him till they did a good many of them he would have been happier to avoid that was afterwards though and afterwards was always too late here and there puddles dotted the top of the glacier marcovefa eyed them dubiously she said something when hamnet looked a question at ulric the adventurer translated in her grandfathers grandfathers days this didnt happen she says is she sure shes not talking about her grandchildrens days hamnet asked shes the one who cant keep time straight before ulric could render that into marcovefas dialect she sent hamnet a severe look as if he were a child acting snippy around grownups that shouldnt have been easy to bring off he thought he was older than she was but when she wanted to she could assume as many years and as much dignity as she pleased it was an unusual gift and not a small one either she led the bizogots and raumsdalians south and west with a fine display of confidence count hamnet wondered what lay behind it he wondered if anything did maybe she was willing to sacrifice herself to strand them on the glacier and rid her clan of the threat they posed but when that thought bubbled up from the dark places at the bottom of his mind he shook his head he could imagine it but he couldnt believe it she acted like someone who knew what she was doing and where she was going of course a madwoman would act that way too hamnet was much less certain marcovefa and the real world touched each other very much why are you following her then he asked himself but the answer to that was all too plain even if she was leading them to disaster what did they have to lose staying up here was only disaster of a different kind the miserable cannibal life the men of the glacier led showed that all too clearly he skirted another puddle atop the glacier what do you suppose would happen if it all melted he asked never happen trasamund said not while we still live those two things werent the same though the jarl didnt seem to understand it even if he and hamnet thyssen lived to grow long white beards which seemed most unlikely at the moment they would die in an eyeblink of time as far as the world went not so far long ago as far as the world went the glacier had pushed down to not far north of nidaros the country around the present capital was much like the bizogot steppe in those days if the glacier disappeared this northern land might turn out not to be so useless too but trasamund wouldnt be here to see it to him nothing else mattered well that made a certain amount of sense or maybe more than a certain amount but hamnet tried to take a longer view marcovefa said something ulric answered she said something else ulric translated the day is coming she says or maybe the day is here not here yet by god hamnet said or what are we walking on again ulric turned that into words marcovefa could understand she gave back one word illusion ulric said well as long as it fools my feet im not going to worry about it hamnet said the bizogots caught a few voles in patches of greenery marcovefa had a bird net and a chant that seemed to lure birds into it but there werent many to lure they steadily went through the meat theyd got from the shamans clan count hamnet began to wonder if they would have enough to get back to the crag at need before long he stopped wondering they wouldnt marcovefa led them towards the edge of the glacier the rim of the world she called it with perfect and sublime certitude when they got there they could look down at a sea of curdled white clouds that hid the bizogot country from the eye count hamnet and ulric stared at each other both appalled but neither somehow enormously surprised liv glanced over towards marcovefa as if wondering what her fellow shaman would do now audun gilli by contrast only shrugged as if to say well this is interesting isnt it but trasamund exploded like a tightly shut pot forgotten atop a fire he didnt just curse marcovefa he screamed at her he pulled his twohanded sword from the sheath he wore on his back and brandished it bellowing we ought to carve steaks off you you worthless mangy trull marcovefa answered more calmly than hamnet thyssen thought he could have managed under such circumstances she said something that set ulric giggling helplessly what was that hamnet asked something like why didnt your mother spank you when you were little the adventurer answered trasamund didnt ask for a translation he kept on raving when count hamnet thought he really might swing that sword his feet went out from under him and he sat down hard on the glacier he was lucky the sword didnt skewer or slice him marcovefa looked the slightest bit smug enough to convince hamnet that the bizogots pratfall was no accident even trasamund seemed convinced after trying four times to stand and failing again and again give over he told marcovefa holding up a hand in token of surrender ill put the blade away by god i will the shaman didnt speak the ordinary bizogot tongue what trasamund said couldnt have meant much to her but she seemed to grasp the essentials behind or under language she knew what the jarl meant even if she didnt know what he said with a nod whose somber dignity the raumsdalian emperor might have envied she signaled that he was free from her spell when he tried to get to his feet once more he succeeded he shuddered she knows somewhat of shamanry all right he said to hamnet thyssen but why the demon didnt she know the glacier here is just like the glacier everywhere else except at that one big avalanche if i could tell you id be on my way towards making a pretty fair shaman myself count hamnet answered liv shook her head i am a fair shaman or i like to think i am she said i have no idea why were here then she turned to audun gilli and asked do you hamnet wished she hadnt even if he understood why she had audun started to shake his head too but hesitated nooo he said slowly not unless he did shake his head then firmly and decisively his voice firmed as he repeated no and continued the whole idea is too ridiculous and what about this mess isnt ulric asked come on out with it but audun wouldnt talk all he said was if we know well know without any doubt and if we dont well be too busy starving to worry about it you so relieve my mind ulric said not even his sly mockery could pry any more words out of the raumsdalian wizard marcovefa looked on with what hamnet would have called innocent amusement if he hadnt already figured out that she was much less innocent than she seemed and in a way that had nothing to do with her taste for cannibal feasts arnora came over and linked her arm with ulric s we may as well camp here she said were not going anywhere thats for sure marcovefa asked a question hamnet thyssen would have bet it was what did she say the shaman didnt understand everything that went on around her words spoken without strong emotion behind them remained opaque ulric translated for her she said something else ulric asked her a different question she repeated herself hamnet could hear that more emphatically what now he asked ulric she says we all die before our time if we camp here the adventurer replied arnora tossed her shining head what does she know more than you do sweetheart when it comes to things up here ulric said arnora pulled her arm free and glared at him i think maybe the woman from the men of the glacier is right maybe audun gilli always spoke the bizogots language slowly and clumsily now something new was in his voice only the way he looked at marcovefa helped hamnet thyssen give it a name awe without a doubt it was awe where do we camp if we dont camp here trasamund asked eyeing the westering sun wherever it is wed better take care of it before too long i know twilight lingers but not forever marcovefa led them away from the edge of the glacier back in the direction of the mountain refuge from which theyd come she still had an imperious certainty that made anyone else doubt her at his peril why didnt she just tell us to stop where she wanted us to stop arnora grumbled instead she almost led us off the tallest cliff there is i dont think she knew the cliff was still there ulric answered you dont think she knew the bizogot woman said shrilly and you followed her anyway ulric only shrugged have you got a better idea arnora opened her mouth then she closed it again up here atop the glacier there were few good ideas to have the best one to hamnet thyssens way of thinking was not to get stuck here in the first place but when the only other choice was staying where you were and getting slaughtered trying to reach the top of the glacier suddenly looked a lot better it had to hamnet not long before and it must have to the ancestors of the men of the glacier sometime in the dim and vanished past marcovefa stopped without warning in the middle of an icefield which looked no different from the rest of the glacier that stretched as far as the eye could see she spoke as usual ulric translated this will do she says do what hamnet asked she looked at him even before ulric turned the dour question into words she could understand he thought she would be angry at him for presuming to talk back but amusement glinted in her eyes she said a few words ulric asked her something she nodded do to keep the glacier under our feet he reported thats what she says well where else would it be trasamund rumbled up our he didnt finish that but went far enough to leave no doubt of his meaning hamnet thyssen waited for marcovefa to get angry at him instead the shaman started to laugh when she spoke so did ulric she says youre welcome to put it there if that makes you happy she added something else shed like to watch if you try trasamund turned red never mind he muttered ill keep my mouth shut from now on hamnet didnt believe he would or could that he said he would was surprising enough they set stones on the glacier and dried dung on the stones so they could make fires and cook their meat marcovefa carried cuts that did not come from a hare or vole now that hamnet had got used to the smell of that flesh roasting he decided it didnt quite smell like pork after all it smelled better than pork as if it were perfectly right for the nose for the mouth for the belly he supposed it was in a way in every other way though hed done a lot of things for which people could blacken his name better to walk off the edge of the glacier than to earn the name of cannibal it didnt bother marcovefa mans flesh was only food to her count hamnet couldnt match her detachment and didnt want to try twilight lingered long even after the sun went down trasamund posted sentries never can tell who saw the fires he said he looked to marcovefa to see if she had anything to say about that she didnt she was getting ready to sleep lying on the glacier was like lying on frozen rock hamnet thyssen didnt care when you were tired enough frozen rock felt like a mattress stuffed with eiderdown morning twilight was already turning the eastern sky gray when a bizogot shook him awake for sentry duty anything look funny he asked around a yawn everything up here looks funny answered the bizogot whose name was magnulf nothing looks any worse than it did before though all right hamnet climbed to his feet his back and shoulder and one knee creaked maybe frozen rock wasnt so wonderful to sleep on after all the bizogot pointed northeast to show hamnet where he should go knee still aching he trudged in that direction after taking his place out there he looked back towards the camp in happier times in easier times liv would often come out to keep him company while he stood watch not now she lay there sleeping she might have done that anyway hamnet thyssen knew as much but he chose to resent it this morning in due course fire struck the edge of the world in the northeast the sun climbing over the horizon for the moment hamnet could look at it without hurting his eyes that wouldnt last long the higher it climbed the hotter it would seem and the day would be warm too how long could the glacier last if weather like this came every year itll last longer than i do by god hamnet thyssen thought and he turned away from the sun his shadow stretched out before him across the glaciertop many times taller than he was it would shrink as the day advanced and then advance as the day shrank and finally darkness would swallow it as the shadow goes so the man come morning his shadow would be reborn himself he had much less hope about that looking away from the sun meant looking in the direction from which hed come people there were starting to stir someone waved in his direction ulric even at a couple of bowshots distance the adventurers sinuous grace made him stand out ulric gestured to him to come back in with the sun in the sky anyone could see trouble coming ha count hamnet thought if people could see trouble coming as easily as that wed all have less of it small plumes of smoke rose from dried dung on flat stones the air above the fires shimmered with heat the bizogots and raumsdalians cooked small animals marcovefa roasted the abominable meat she liked better now what hamnet asked carefully licking all the grease from his fingers ulrics head swiveled as he surveyed the glacier all around as far as i can tell the plan is for us to sit here till we starve he didnt sound like a man who was joking but he did sound absurdly cheerful at the prospect no that wasnt hamnet thyssen it was audun gilli the wizard shook his head oh no you know something count hamnet sounded accusing even to himself what is it something is about what i know audun agreed something is going to happen and happen soon what he spread his hands and shrugged your guess is as good as mine maybe better will it happen before we starve hamnet asked that would be nice because ulrics right were going to by god we wont starve to death up here the wizard said i dont know what will happen to us but not that you so relieve our minds ulric said you notice marcovefa isnt coming over here and slapping him silly well sillier hamnet said which won him a wounded look from audun gilli that worried him not at all he went on must mean she thinks he knows what hes talking about happy day ulric said which of them is crazier do you suppose both of them count hamnet answered that confused the wizard but ulric nodded in perfect understanding marcovefa eyed hamnet as if wondering whether to say anything when she didnt he was more relieved than he hoped he showed what are we going to do today trasamund demanded sit around here freezing our arses off if you do much sitting around here you will freeze your arse off count hamnet said on the other hand where do you propose to go back to the edge of the glacier but trasamund didnt sound sure of himself almost a first for the big rambunctious bizogot why ulric asked what can you do there besides jump off how long do you suppose youd have to regret that before you went splut he picked a particularly expressive noise to describe how trasamund would sound when he hit the jarl glared and muttered into his beard then he walked away shaking his head sometimes the worst thing you can do to somebody is tell him the truth count hamnet remarked no doubt ulric said and do you have any idea how many people get old and gray without ever once figuring that out too many or i miss my guess hamnet said marcovefa seemed happy enough sitting around doing nothing once halfway through the day a raven flew up and landed on her shoulder it sat there as if it belonged preening and making soft croaking noises and peering around with disconcertingly clever beady black eyes marcovefa took its presence for granted she scratched its head instead of pecking her with its formidable bill it bent forward like a cat so her hand could better find its itches a familiar ulric wondered out loud not exactly or i dont think so audun gilli said seems more like a friend the longer count hamnet watched the more he thought audun was right marcovefa croaked too as if she and the raven shared a language where she didnt share one with the bizogots and raumsdalians all around her the big black bird seemed to understand what she was saying and she also seemed to follow it hamnet told himself nothing the shaman could do surprised him much anymore hed already told himself the same thing several times and been wrong every one of them after a while the raven flew off towards the edge of the glacier ulrics eyes followed it good bit of meat on a bird that size he remarked those cursed things have got fat off us on every battlefield since the beginning of time we could start paying them back even as he spoke his gaze slid to marcovefa he might have known she would understand the essence of what he was saying she came over to him and pulled his ear exactly as if he were a naughty boy then she gave him a piece of her mind in her own language she eats mans flesh but she draws the line at raven audun gilli shook his head maybe she does shes sure making ulric eat crow though count hamnet said deadpan audun started to nod then he caught himself and drew back from count hamnet as if the raumsdalian noble had some rare dangerous and highly contagious disease chances were he did too at any rate people often treated foolishness that way an hour or so later the raven came back no one tried to catch it or kill it it perched on marcovefas shoulder again and croaked in her ear one of the croaks sounded like soon to hamnet thyssen he scratched his ear wondering if hed heard that or only imagined it he knew ravens could be trained to speak but he had trouble believing this one had been he had even more trouble believing it had been trained to speak a language he understood was he becoming like marcovefa then and gaining the ability to grasp meaning even without knowing a language he had an enormous amount of trouble believing that the shaman scratched the base of the ravens beak with a forefinger that beak might have been able to bite the finger off instead the raven nuzzled her like a lovesick pup getting it to do something like that getting it to want to do something like that probably wasnt magic in any ordinary sense of the word but hamnet had a hard time deciding what else to call it a warm breeze ruffled his beard and the ravens feathers for the moment maybe even for the season the breath of god the cold ravening wind from the glacier had failed it would blow again when the year turned hamnet was sure of that but for now even here the wind came up from the south liv and audun gilli both stiffened at the same time like two hunting dogs taking a scent liv stared at marcovefa audun exclaimed she really did hamnet thyssen felt the glacier shudder under his feet earthquake he thought he was safer here than he would have been in nidaros in bad earthquakes people died when heavy things fell on them the only thing that could fall on him here was the sky along with the shaking came a deep bass rumble from the south a rumble and a crashing and a roar when hamnet looked that way he didnt see anything maybe his wits were slow because he didnt grasp what the noise might mean clever as usual ulric did his trouble was different he tried hard not to believe it she couldnt have known an avalanche was coming could she he said his own doubt showing in the last two words although the raven fluttered its wings when the shaking and rumbling started it stayed on marcovefas shoulder the shaman stroked the bird calming it did she look pleased with herself if she didnt hamnet lacked the words to describe the way she did look at last the commotion subsided marcovefa said something in her language everyone else looked towards ulric for a translation reluctantly he gave one she says we can go down now she knew she knew audun gilli made it sound more like an accusation than praise even back on the mountainside she saw the avalanche coming hes right liv said not something hamnet wanted to hear from her but not something he could disagree with either she must have known shes a shaman not a sham sure enough ulric said the only thing she didnt know was just when it would happen and i dont think she cared marcovefa said something else even hamnet thought he understood it when didnt matter maybe she was right maybe she was wrong either way she sounded very sure she didnt wait to give ulric a chance to translate she just started walking south every line of her body made it plain that she didnt care whether the bizogots and raumsdalians went with her no matter what they did she would try to descend from the glacier they did follow of course something occurred to count hamnet as they tramped along over the glacier he caught up with ulric who was walking not far from marcovefa and said ask her if she knows of the golden shrine well i will but what are the odds ulric said before he could ask the question in marcovefas dialect she stopped dead and stared at hamnet thyssen a flood of words burst from her ulric held up his hands as if to dam the flow he didnt have much luck a moment later he started to laugh what is it hamnet asked you impressed her thats what ulric replied up till now she thought we were a bunch of godless savages but if we know about the golden shrine we cant be so bad after all she understood me before you translated hamnet said slowly and the adventurer nodded hamnet went on what does she know then again marcovefa started talking without waiting to hear the question in her tongue she pointed north then south ulric said she knows its somewhere not under the glacier its a salve for the good and a snare for the wicked she says you get from it what you bring to it it makes you even more what you are already im not sure what that means im not sure shes sure what she means come to that marcovefa let out an indignant sniff i think she is count hamnet said eyvind torfinn talked about the place the same way and he knows more about it than anybody anybody except maybe a cannibal savage he thought how strange was that stranger than anything else here atop the glacier hamnet doubted it the avalanche theyd heard proved even bigger than the one theyd climbed to get here marcovefa and her raven both looked smug the way down lay open if the travelers could take it x hamnet thyssen hadthought climbing up tumbled and shattered blocks of ice was bad and it was how many times had he almost killed himself in the desperate scramble to escape the rulers probably more than he realized which said everything that needed saying all by itself but descending made going up childs play by comparison if you slipped while you were climbing someone below you had a chance to catch you and save you if you slipped on the way down you went down yourself maybe all the way down and you had a good chance of starting another avalanche when you did it by god i wish we had more rope trasamund said before theyd gone even a bowshot if we could tie all of ourselves together a slip wouldnt be so bad it might be worse count hamnet said if one of us slipped he might carry everybody he was roped to down with him the jarl grunted he looked as if he wanted to tell hamnet he was wrong he didnt though because too plainly the raumsdalian was right disaster waited under their feet at every step they took they might have done better staying up on the glacier except that they would soon have begun to starve that other avalanche had a chance to settle down before we tackled it as usual ulric sounded most cheerful when the going was worst this ones still shifting and sorting itself out you noticed that too did you hamnet pointed down the steep slope crashes and thuds farther down told of more shifting below this ones a long way from finished but it can finish us any time it wants to dont give it ideas its bound to have enough of its own ulric said i wish i could call you a liar hamnet said the bizogots and raumsdalians had separated into little groups of three and four and five each group staying as far from the others as it could if one set of climbers did touch off another avalanche with luck it wouldnt sweep them all to their doom with luck marcovefa descended without a care in the world sometimes the raven stayed on her shoulder sometimes it flew off and soared and spun and swooped through the air hamnet thyssen had seldom had the chance to watch a bird flying from above it he didnt have much of a chance now he was too busy watching where he put his hands and feet killing himself for the sake of an unusual sight struck him as excessive devotion maybe marcovefa thought she could stop any trouble with a quick spell maybe she was right and maybe she wasnt count hamnet noticed that liv and audun gilli both seemed much less carefree audun probably the clumsiest person in the band seemed scared out of his skin hamnet had a hard time blaming him for that anyway not only were they above the raven at least from time to time they were also above a bank of clouds that bumped up against the side of the glacier and then they werent above the clouds any more but in them count hamnet discovered what mountain dwellers already knew clouds up close were nothing but fog not being able to see more than a few feet as he struggled down towards the ground only made the descent even more alarming than it would have been otherwise he was on the point of complaining about that when trasamund beat him to it ulric loaded his voice with treacle as he answered you poor dear maybe we should go back up to the top and try again when the weather gets nicer the bizogots reply should have melted the glacier all by itself somehow it didnt it didnt scorch ulric either the adventurer only laughed which infuriated trasamund all over again hamnet thyssen went right on scrambling down the steep slope of the avalanche glad he hadnt offered himself as a target for ulric s merciless wit little by little what had been a layer of clouds below and then a layer of fog all around became a layer of clouds above that seemed normal to hamnet as it doubtless did to the other raumsdalians and the bizogots marcovefa said something that sounded intrigued as she looked up ulric started to laugh again this time hamnet judged without sarcasm well hamnet asked she says theres something you dont see everyday ulric said shes more used to the tops of clouds than to their bottoms marcovefa looked down then that also seemed to interest her there at least hamnet thyssen could understand why she was closer to the ground than any men of the glacier had come for who could say how many hundred years she spoke again this time ulric translated without waiting for anyone to ask him she says even the air feels heavy and thick down here tell her we think there isnt enough of it up where she lives hamnet replied ulric did the comment only made the shaman laugh and shake her head oh no she says ulric reported its just right up there all what youre used to i suppose no doubt count hamnet said of course shes also used to eating neighbors she doesnt get along with he paused considering a few of the people i know in nidaros that does have something to recommend it but still i know some of the people in nidaros you wouldnt mind seeing dead ulric said anybody who ate em would sick em up again afterwards it could be hamnet said i he broke off someone in the group of climbers farthest to his right let out a wild scream of terror watch out two bizogots and audun gilli shouted the same thing at the same time it was much too late and altogether useless that whole group except for arnora who was trailing plunged down the stillsteep side of the ice mountain in an avalanche theyd touched off themselves hamnet thyssen never knew what went wrong a misplaced hand a foot that came down where it shouldnt have odds were whichever bizogot made the mistake didnt have long to regret it either how long could you last in a tumble of snow and icy boulders if you were lucky you would die fast before you got buried alive ulric slid half a step towards arnora then checked himself any move he made or any she made might start things sliding again one of the bizogots in the next group over did have some rope he threw it to her whitefaced and panting with terror she tied it around her waist then moving as if walking on eggs she sidled towards the man whod thrown it he hauled in the rope and eventually hauled in arnora with it she threw her arms around him and kissed him when she was safe or as safe as she could be on the side of the glacier count hamnet glanced over to ulric to see how he liked that id kiss him myself but hes bound to like it better from arnora ulric said hamnet only nodded either ulric really worried less about such things than he did or hid his worries better whichever it was the adventurer had the advantage there we knew this was dangerous before we started down trasamund said now we truly know it is lets remember till we hit bottom ulric suggested yes trasamund said and then no curse it will you be serious for once in your life oh im serious enough the adventurer said hard to stay jolly for long when you watch people die on a slope only maniacs would try even sane sensible people will try anything if they see their other choices are worse count hamnet said ulric didnt try to argue from which hamnet concluded that he didnt think he could theyd all decided taking the chance of dying was better than turning into men of the glacier hamnet wondered whether the men the avalanche had buried would still agree he wouldnt have the chance to ask them not in this world he wouldnt the rest of the climbers gingerly went around the new avalanche as they kept descending they couldnt go too far around not unless they got away from the slope of the bigger avalanche they were using for their route down the rest of the glacier wasnt dangerously steep it was impossibly steep hamnet thyssen looked up towards the top of the avalanche back the way hed come the clouds that had been below him now hid most of the route it might have been just as well seeing what hed done would only have convinced him hed been out of his mind to try this or had he what other choice was there if he and his comrades hadnt climbed the glacier the rulers would have killed them if they hadnt come down they would have turned into cannibals this was bad those as hed told ulric were worse weve been beyond the glacier and on top of it he said not many can claim that you me ulric audun liv trasamund said not many fools in the world youre welcome to speak for yourself your ferocity but ill thank you to include me out ulric said yes tell me youre not a fool tell me and make me believe it the bizogot jarl said ulric maintained a dignified silence trasamund made a noise somewhere between a grunt and a snort didnt think you could marcovefa pointed down towards the ground specifically towards a herd of musk oxen in the middle distance she said something that made ulric snort too a snort that came close to a giggle well hamnet asked she says were either closer to the ground than she thought or those are the biggest voles shes ever seen the adventurer reported after a moment count hamnet started to laugh too there he was clinging like a fly to the side of the glacier unable to fly away if by some mischance he slipped and he laughed hard enough to have trouble holding on what will she think when she sees mammoths he said when he could finally speak again probably that the pikas should have gone to the dentist before they grew up ulric answered that set them both laughing again and got trasamund and audun gilli started i think were losing our minds audun didnt sound especially dismayed trasamund shook his head we lost them a long time ago we wouldnt have gone up there if we hadnt marcovefa asked a question ulric answered by the way he kept going back and forth he was having a hard time getting her to believe him she kept screwing up her face and making derisive gestures at last he said something that turned her thoughtful she doesnt want to believe the musk oxen are as big as i say ulric said i reminded her of the chunks of horseflesh we had when we got to her mountain beasts really do grow bigger down below the glacier the raven croaked in marcovefas ear she answered it as seriously as shed replied to ulric it croaked again she shrugged and nodded shed sooner believe the bird than you hamnet thyssen said proves she knows them both trasamund put in i laugh ha ha ha ha ha ha ulric said hamnet pointed to the ground in front of the musk oxen we really are getting close he said pay attention to where you are not to where you want to be trasamund said were still plenty high enough for the glacier to kill us if it sees a chance he spoke of it as if it were alive and malevolent after two long climbs one up one down and a little while atop its frozen immensity hamnet would have been hard pressed to tell him he was crazy and he gave good advice a careless mistake now could still be the last one somebody ever made they all talked one another down hamnet let out a sigh of commingled exhaustion and relief when his boots squelched in mud made soft and slimy by meltwater trasamund knelt down to kiss the dirt that should have been laughable somehow it wasnt there is a world below the glacier who would have believed it marcovefa said ulric translating in one way its no different from the world you just left count hamnet said after ulric did the honors marcovefa made a questioning noise hamnet explained plenty of enemies will want to kill you here too as the sun setthe glaciers shadows stretched farther and farther and darker and darker across the bizogot plain the travelers had moved a couple of miles south from the glacier not least because they didnt want to risk another avalanche thundering down on their heads marcovefa marveled at everything she saw the swarms of birds the variety of voles and mice and lemmings in the undergrowth and the sheer scope and exuberance of the undergrowth itself this land is so rich she said through ulric so wide so many plants and even the air makes me think ive chewed magic mushrooms so much more air to breathe down here its probably making her drunk hamnet thyssen said again remembering the thin stuff atop the glacier i hope it doesnt make her sick nothing we can do about it if it does short of sending her off to the mountains i suppose ulric said marcovefa almost stepped in a mammoth turd when she realized what it was she stared down at it in disbelief then yammered in her own language whatever she said it set ulric laughing well trasamund said tell all of us she wants to know if a mountain shit here or maybe the glacier ulric told him marcovefa added something else she says no animal could be big enough to leave a turd like that she may say it but that doesnt make it so the jarl said now maybe shell believe we werent pulling her leg when we told her what the beasts down here were like shed better or shell have a thin time of it when she meets her first lion or dire wolf ulric translated that for the shaman from the men of the glacier count hamnet found he could make out more words now than hed been able to when he first met that folk it was a dialect of the bizogot tongue sure enough but a strange one and a very oldfashioned one as well you just told her a dire wolf was a fox that weighs as much as a man didnt you he asked the adventurer thats right ulric said do you want to take over some of the interpreting i wouldnt miss it by god i dont think i could hamnet said i can figure out what some of the words are when i hear other people say them but i dont know how to say them myself does make it harder ulric allowed marcovefas got to learn the ordinary bizogot language trouble is till we made it up to the top of the glacier she didnt imagine there were any other languages i dont know if shell have an easy time finding new words for things marcovefa looked down at the mammoth turd again she quickly lost count hamnet when she spoke again he had an easier time following ulrics efforts to speak her tongue with a small sigh ulric did the honors she says we can have big fires whenever we want if weve got turds like that to burn i wonder what shed think if she saw rounds of hickory burning in a fireplace down in nidaros hamnet said anyone who imagines the bizogot country is rich has been living on a mountaintop above the glacier her whole life long ulric finished for him that wasnt what hamnet would have said which made it no less true maybe you ought to tell her about horses and riding deer and riding mammoths he remarked we may have to travel fast now that were down here again why just because well be one jump ahead of the rulers again one jump ahead if were lucky ulric had a knack for knowing where the worst troubles lay all right he went on well ill try shes not going to understand about riding you know not till she sees somebody doing it he spoke slowly to marcovefa he had to keep backing up and starting over at last he had hamnet get down on hands and knees and straddled him to show what riding meant marcovefa went into gales of giggles it might have been the funniest thing shed ever seen why didnt you let me do the riding hamnet asked irritably because i didnt want to look like an idiot ulric suggested and hamnet tried to buck him off marcovefa laughed harder than ever unfazed and unthrown ulric went on besides youre bigger than i am even if you make a fractious horse i wanted to show her people ride bigger brutes thank you so much hamnet ground out now that youve shown her get the demon off me ulric did which was lucky for him count hamnets next move would have been to stand ulric couldnt very well have ridden him then any more than he could have sat in someones lap after the former lapholder rose well hamnet said an ominous rumble in his voice does she understand what ridings all about now after more backandforth between ulric and marcovefa the adventurer nodded she understands it all right he said she isnt sure she believes it she isnt sure its any good but now she knows what the word means and she didnt before hamnet thyssen had to think about that for a little while hed made cracks about how impoverished the men of the glacier were now he saw hed barely begun to understand that even their language was a poor starveling thing so many things they couldnt do and if you couldnt do something you didnt need words to talk about it so the words had fallen out of their vocabulary and taken the ideas with them he looked back towards the glacier and then up towards the top both the layer of clouds through which hed descended and gathering darkness kept him from seeing all the way up but he didnt really need to he knew where hed been and what hed done and if the rest of the world didnt want to believe him that was the worlds lookout not his then he looked south i suppose we ought to be glad the rulers werent waiting for us when we got to the ground again he said and i suppose youre right ulric said dont lose any sleep over it though they arent likely to leave us alone very long no i suppose not hamnet said nothing could have made him lose sleep that night slightly muddy ground made a better mattress than ice or bare rock but he suspected he could have lain down on a porcupine the size of a glyptodont and still started snoring two heartbeats after he closed his eyes the sun had to climb up over the glacier before morning came to the land by its base that won him more sleep than he would have had a little farther south he woke grabbing his sword hilt when trasamund shook him we need food the bizogot said we need to find out whose land this is too and turn them against the rulers if they arent already are we still on the white foxes grazing grounds hamnet asked or have we come farther west than that which clan lies west of theirs west of the white foxes are the snowshoe hares trasamund answered he knew and had to know the bizogot plain the way a native of nidaros knew the capitals streets they chase the foxes more often than the foxes chase them for all we know the rulers are here ahead of us liv said everything thats held true on the steppe for generations is scrambled now even if we beat the rulers sorting things out afterwards will take years well spill a lot of blood doing it too trasamund sounded matteroffact about that not dismayed the way a raumsdalian would have but at least that will come by our own choosing not on account of these godcursed invaders not that the people who get maimed and killed will care ulric said of course theyll care trasamund insisted in a fight doesnt who wounds you matter id rather not let anybody wound me if its all the same to you ulric said hamnet thyssens eyes slid towards liv hed given her the power to wound him hed done the same with gudrid all those years before only to discover hed made a mistake that kept him from doing it again till he did he couldnt prove liv would make him sorry too no he couldnt prove it but he worried about it she could have reassured him she could have and she hadnt he feared she was as out of sorts with him as he was with her that wouldnt do anybody any good it was in fact a recipe for disaster sitting down and talking with her might help if they ever found a moment to sit down together and if he could figure out what to say if they did they hadnt yet and he hadnt yet either and the silence between them was starting to fester and trasamund got to his feet saying we have to find a herd and we have to find the folk in charge of it we need food and we need mounts and we need to get back into the fight against the invaders come on lets get going as count hamnet wearily rose too and started trudging across the bizogot plain he almost hated the jarl the nobleman needed other things too and trasamund wasnt giving him a chance even to figure out how to find them the things he needed were much less important in the grand scheme he knew as much knowing was scant consolation if any at all because what he needed was no less important to him they were onthe snowshoe hares grazing grounds they found out when two horsemen pulled away from a herd of musk oxen and rode up to look them over marcovefa stared at them then she stared at ulric and hamnet thyssen and then she started to laugh she said something hamnet thought he understood it when ulric translated he proved right so you werent making it up after all ulric said something in reply something on the order of did you really think we were and marcovefa answered well you never know who would have thought beasts could truly grow so big again hamnet followed her well enough to get meaning from her words before ulric turned them into the ordinary bizogot speech who are you ragamuffins one of the snowshoe hares shouted what the demon are you doing on our land we escaped the rulers trasamund answered we had to climb up onto the glacier and then come down again so we did that the snowshoe hare laughed in his face by god ive heard some liars in my time but never one who came close to you marcovefa stepped forward to get a better look at him she said something in her language she says youre a noisy fool even if you can ride a horse ulric translated helpfully adding shes never seen anybody ride before so that impresses her more than it does us what do you mean shes never seen anybody ride a horse before the snowshoe hare demanded i usually mean what i say you should try it it works wonders ulric said and shes never seen anybody ride a horse because the biggest animals up on top of the glacier except for people are foxes more of those lies the bizogot from the snowshoe hares jeered marcovefa spoke again hamnet thyssen was afraid he understood what she said ulrics translation confirmed it she says shes eaten better men than you and she doesnt mean it any way youd enjoy believe me she doesnt the expressions on the faces of the other raumsdalians and the bizogots with them told both riders from the snowshoe hares exactly how marcovefa did mean it as soon as they understood they looked revolted too why dont you kill her then if she does things like that asked the one whod done the talking because shes a shaman for one thing ulric answered because twolegged meat is a good bit of what theyve got to eat up there for another its a hardscrabble life on top of the glacier believe you me it is maybe the way the snowshoe hare said it made it sound like an enormous concession in his mind it probably was now will you answer what i asked you trasamund demanded are you still free of the rulers have the white foxes gone down before them yet that made the two horsemen put their heads together when they separated neither one looked happy somethings happened to the white foxes anyway admitted the one who liked to hear himself we thought it was a feud inside the clan the other one said proving he wasnt mute after all its worse than that by god trasamund gave his own name continuing you may have heard of me i am the jarl of the three tusk clan and whats left of the free three tusk clan stands here in front of you the rulers are that bad well they havent troubled us the talkier snowshoe hare said the other one nodded theyre probably heading south instead hamnet thyssen said toward the empire audun gilli added how much would that matter to the snowshoe hares not much not unless count hamnet missed his guess the raumsdalian empire seemed barely real to most bizogots up here by the glacier just as their world was strange and alien to the folk who dwelt below the tree line and especially to those who lived south of the great forests let us talk to your jarl trasamund said feed us if you will were not your foes if you dont help us you help the godcursed rulers hamnet thyssen hoped he didnt ask the other bizogot for horses for all his comrades the snowshoe hares were unlikely to have enough to give them to him they were less likely to want to do it even if they did have horses to spare but trasamund must have made the same mental calculation himself instead of barking out more demands he stood there waiting with as much calm dignity as he could muster doing his best to seem like a man whod asked for no more than he was entitled to calm and dignity were in short supply among the bizogots and so all the more impressive when they did get used the two snowshoe hares put their heads together again then the mouthier one said yes come with us well feed you and well take you to euric and hell decide what to do next im buccelin this is my cousin gunthar one by one the bizogots and raumsdalians with trasamund named themselves marcovefa came last or count hamnet thought she would anyhow but after she told buccelin and gunthar her name the raven on her shoulder croaked out a few syllables too was that a coincidence or was it also naming itself hamnet thyssen wasnt sure by the way buccelin and gunthar muttered they werent either marcovefa she smiled and scratched the big black birds formidable beak the raven couldnt very well smile back but hamnet got the feeling that was what it was doing the snowshoe hares led the travelers whod come down from the glacier off towards the southwest they traveled at what was a slow walk for their horses so the men and women on foot wouldnt fall behind marcovefa watched them intently after a couple of miles she spoke up she says shed like to try to ride for a little while shes never done it before ulric said plainly the mounted bizogots wanted to say no just as plainly they didnt have the nerve their eyes kept going from her face to the raven and back again gunthar reluctantly reined in and dismounted he showed marcovefa how to set her left foot in the stirrup and swing up over and onto the horses back she managed more smoothly than hamnet would have expected when she was in the saddle she smiled again she says she feels so tall ulric said she says she can see as far as the raven can gunthar laughed is she witstruck not the way you mean hamnet answered everything down here is new to her they havent got much there up on top of the glacier youre still going on about that are you the snowshoe hare said its the truth hamnet thyssen said stonily if you dont believe it try crossing marcovefa and see what happens no thanks gunthar said i dont know where the demon shes from for all i can say she fell from the back side of the moon but i know a shaman when i see one weve had a witstruck shaman or two in our clan it doesnt mean they cant use spells well enough buccelin showed marcovefa how to use the pressure of her legs to urge the horse forward and how to guide it to the right and left with the reins she proved an apt pupil the first question she asked was how do you make these big beasts your slaves we train them starting when theyre small buccelin answered after ulric translated the shaman nodded then she asked and what do you do when they rebel she really doesnt know anything about this business does she buccelin remarked with a shrug he went on we train them some more we punish them if we still cant break them we can always kill them and eat them ah marcovefa said you are men sure enough whats that supposed to mean the bizogot demanded the woman from atop the glacier said not another word after a few more minutes she dismounted and did so with more grace than shed used getting up on the horse buccelin mounted marcovefa sketched a salute he gave back a brusque nod then made a point of not riding anywhere near her in midafternoon they approached a herd of musk oxen marcovefa pointed towards them so many large animals do you get up on top of these too maybe we could but we dont by then buccelin seemed resigned to playing guide we use them for their meat and hides and milk and wool and bones and horn he chuckled everything but the grunt marcovefa thought that was funny which proved she came from the back of beyond a couple of other snowshoe hares rode out from the herd who are these ragamuffins one of them shouted where did they come from down off the glacier he threw back his head and laughed at his own wit yes i think they really did buccelin answered which made the other bizogots jaw drop were taking them to euric they know what the mess to the east is all about this one he aimed a thumb at trasamund used to be jarl of the three tusk clan and i still am by god pride rang in trasamunds voice for a little while but he seemed to deflate as he continued its just that the clan has run into a few problems lately a few problems have run over the clan he means ulric whispered to hamnet thyssen who nodded we need to feed them buccelin said they seem hungry like they just came down off the glacier thats for sure any beast in bad shape weve got a cow thats limping the other bizogot said its not slowing up the herd or anything but we can kill it they did and butchered it and got a big fire of dried grass and dung going to cook the meat meanwhile trasamund and his clansmates and the raumsdalians told what they knew of the invasion of the rulers they also told how theyd climbed the glacier and what theyd found on top of it none of them though mentioned some of marcovefas dining habits maybe that was coincidence maybe it was shared revulsion maybe it was some subtle spell from the shaman hamnet thyssen couldnt be sure he was sure he stuffed himself like a bizogot gobbling down meat and fat and breaking big bones to reach the marrow his hands and face got all greasy he didnt care hed been empty a lot lately not having the fist of hunger pounding his stomach felt wonderful so did not needing to worry about standing watch the snowshoe hares insisted that was their job none of the travelers tried to argue with them were out of danger for a little while anyhow hamnet said danger from the outside anyhow liv said whats that supposed to mean he asked im like you and ulric i usually say what i mean she answered we have trouble you and i have trouble because you cant get over being jealous can you blame me hamnet said but liv nodded yes by god i can blame you because i havent done anything to make you jealous the demon you havent hamnet didnt like arguing in a nearwhisper to keep the others from hearing what was going on he wanted to shout and raise a fuss and pound on things he wondered why he didnt it wasnt as if they didnt know about his squabbles with liv but he went on quietly if you havent been clinging to audun gilli i havent livs voice was also soft but fire filled it all the same you sure havent clung to me lately god only knows the last time we made love i have trouble remembering hamnet said i could say im not your toy i could say weve had a few other things going on lately i could even say youve been spending a lot of time around marcovefa her hamnet thyssen clapped a hand to his forehead you are out of your mind shes a barbarian a savage you mean you dont think the same thing about me liv retorted and why am i out of my mind for doubting you when youre not out of yours for doubting me because nothings going on between me and the cannibal count hamnet answered she couldnt accuse him of thinking that about her im just trying to learn a little of her language and teach her some of yours well what do you think im doing with audun i dont know what youre doing with audun thats what worries me you pick stupid things to worry about especially when we have so many real ones that are bigger liv turned her back on him and rolled herself in her hide blanket finding enough sleep is a real one i had trouble up on top of the glacier i never thought i was getting enough air count hamnet felt the same way but he would sooner have jumped from the top of the glacier than admit it he got under a hide too and closed his eyes he didnt think he would sleep at all too much anger seethed inside him but exhaustion sneaked up from behind and clubbed him over the head when he woke in the middle of the short northern summer night liv was leaning over him he wondered if he ought to grab for one of the knives on his belt but all she did was shake her head and say you fool what for loving you too much yes for loving me too much it makes you stupid and you arent stupid often enough to know how to do it right shaking her head liv slid under the hide with him well she said a oneword challenge as if he didnt deserve what she was giving him she probably thought he didnt he did the best he could it seemed to be good enough but even if it was he knew it didnt really settle anything xi weve stayed upin the north too long hamnet thyssen said as the bizogots and raumsdalians and marcovefa approached the snowshoe hares encampment well god knows im not about to argue with you but why do you say so ulric skakki asked count hamnet pointed to the gaggle of tents made from mammoth and muskox hides because thats starting to look like civilization to me oh my dear fellow are you well ulric grabbed his arm and made as if to take his pulse swearing and laughing at the same time hamnet jerked free not a bit abashed ulric went on much as i hate to admit it i feel the same way and if thats not a judgment on both of us what would you call it it cant really be civilization though and ill tell you why not hamnet said ulric skakki made an inquiring noise hamnet explained euric may want to listen to us and sigvat sure didnt there is that the adventurer agreed sigvat turned out to be one of the best arguments in favor of barbarian invasion anyone ever saw didnt he i hadnt thought of it like that but yes hamnet said fierce bizogot dogs some of them by their looks at least half dire wolf ran out of the encampment towards the newcomers barking and snarling buccelin and gunthar shouted at them which slowed them down but didnt stop them when hamnet and ulric and several of trasamunds bizogots drew their swords the dogs did stop they knew that meant danger audun gilli looked disappointed he had a spell that made him seem like what god would have been if god were dog instead one that terrified even the fiercest beasts now he wouldnt get to use it marcovefa eyed the big dogs and their big teeth she said something in her language whats that hamnet asked ulric she says they really are foxes the size of men ulric answered one more thing we told her that she didnt believe tell her these are tamed like the horses tell her the real dire wolves are bigger and fiercer hamnet said ulric skakki did marcovefa raised an eyebrow she said something else well count hamnet asked she says these will do ulric reported i think so too hamnet said he frowned a moment later he had the feeling you can sometimes get when someone is staring at you from behind not quite sorcery but the next thing to it he also had the feeling he knew who it would be and he was right when he turned not quite so casually as he would have liked he caught livs eye on him it was nothing he didnt say it for it was too obviously true to need saying she eyed him even so had he eyed her and audun the same way for as little reason he didnt shake his head since liv was still watching him but that was how he felt he hadnt been thinking anything untoward about marcovefa he knew that down deep inside he didnt know what liv thought about audun gilli he also didnt know how unfair that comparison was but he didnt know that he didnt know and so it did him no good the dogs reluctantly moved back and to the sides as the travelers advanced children stared at them too particularly at hamnet and ulric and audun who in spite of their clothes plainly werent bizogots marcovefa stared at everything the dogs the children the tents the fires burning in front of them the pots trade goods up from the south bubbling on top of those fires the shaman sighed and spoke when count hamnet raised a questioning eyebrow ulric translated shes going on again about how lucky the bizogots are they have big animals to get big hides for their tents they have big bones to use they have these big fires because of all the dung they have those things to cook in she wonders why the men of the glacier never thought of those hamnet thyssen tried to imagine the men of the glacier making pottery they almost certainly didnt have the clay they would need they would have trouble making fires big enough and hot enough to bake the clay even if they did have it i didnt even see any baskets up there let alone pots he said i was surprised they could make rope and what they do make is the strangest stuff i ever saw that it is ulric said it does the job though it had done the job on the descent from the top of the glacier no one could ask more from it than that buccelin held open a tent flap here is the jarl you will show him the respect he deserves we will trasamund agreed if he shows us the respect we deserve buccelin looked dismayed at that but did not contradict it along with trasamund hamnet and ulric and audun went into eurics tent so did liv and marcovefa liv stayed as far from marcovefa as she could inside the tent especially with so many people in it that wasnt very far butterburning lamps and the open tent flap gave what light there was inside the smell of the lamps warred with that of indifferently cured hides and with the smell of euric himself he was a big burly man a few years younger than hamnet nodding to trasamund he said hello your ferocity ive heard a lot about you ive heard a lot about you too your ferocity seeing that euric did treat him as an equal made trasamund preen tell me who your comrades are the jarl of the snowshoe hares said trasamund named them one by one when he got to marcovefa eurics eyebrows leaped upwards men from the south are one thing the other bizogot observed a woman from the north a woman from the north and from on high is a different story we were there hamnet thyssen said we had to go up there or the rulers would have killed us they are another story too and one you need to worry about you wont find the men of the glacier coming down to eat your musk oxen or your clansmen ulric skakki added too quietly for euric to hear weve heard there is trouble with the three tusk clan and lately with the white foxes too euric said worse than trouble trasamund said the only free folk left from the three tusk clan are with me here the white foxes have also been broken so have the red dire wolves south of the three tusk clans grazing grounds count hamnet said the rulers make bad enemies do they make good friends euric asked proving himself as practical and cynical a diplomat as any raumsdalian ever born hamnet thyssen ulric skakki and trasamund all looked at one another theyd come looking for an ally not an opportunist ulric had the quickest tongue among them and he gave an answer upon which hamnet couldnt have hoped to improve good luck your ferocity euric grunted he was neither foolish nor innocent enough to imagine that ulric meant the words literally how do you know he asked did you try we spent a good bit of time talking with them when we went through the gap last summer hamnet said as far as theyre concerned anyone who isnt of their folk is less than human they call other people herds its hard to make friends with somebody who thinks he can drive you or shear you or slaughter you whenever he wants the snowshoe hares jarl grunted again well you may be right he said hardly a ringing endorsement but then you dont seem to have had much luck fighting them either theyre not easy by god trasamund burst out they ride mammoths and id heard that euric broke in i didnt know whether to believe it its true all the bizogots and raumsdalians whod met the rulers spoke together in a mournful chorus euric didnt seem to know whether to be appalled or amused he finally just nodded all right i believe it now and their magic is stronger than anything we use liv added they can do things we cant and they hurt us when they do theyve won battles because of it marcovefa said something euric stared at her in surprise her speech sounded as if it might belong to the bizogot language but when you tried to understand it you couldnt whats that the jarl asked as usual ulric skakki translated she says the rulers wizards arent so strong as liv makes them out to be i should point out that shes never seen them let alone tried to match her power against theirs fat lot she knows about it then euric said scornfully scorning marcovefa was not a good idea had euric asked him hamnet thyssen would have said as much the shaman from the mountain refuge atop the glacier murmured more incomprehensibilities to herself euric started to say something else instead looking much more surprised than he had a moment earlier he developed a sudden and apparently uncontrollable impulse to stand on his head then he whistled like a longspur then he yipped like a fox then he croaked like a raven marcovefa didnt know much about horses or musk oxen or mammoths or the jarl probably would have impersonated them too tell her thats enough hamnet whispered to ulric we want him to respect us not hate us right i hope she listens to me ulric spoke to marcovefa she shook her head he spoke again this time with a definite pleading note in his voice she sniffed but at last she nodded and murmured to herself once more euric collapsed in a heap he needed a moment to sit up straight and another moment to regain his aplomb when he did he proceeded to prove himself no fool for he inclined his head to marcovefa and said i cry pardon wise woman she acknowledged him with another sniff this one quite regal hamnet understood what she said next since euric probably wouldnt ulric skakki translated and well you might what do you people want from the snowshoe hares euric asked this time with the air of someone who might think about giving it getting turned upside down literally might do that to a man trasamund took advantage of the edge theyd gained food to keep us going and horses to let us move as fast as the rulers i can give you meat and suet and berries weve had a good year with such things euric said but horses for so many he shook his head even though he sent marcovefa an apprehensive look while he did it i cry your pardon too your ferocity but we havent got so many beasts to spare he might have would have said no before but he said it much more politely now how many can you give us hamnet thyssen asked if we can get some from you maybe the next clan farther south will give us more the rock ptarmigans euric didnt quite laugh in his face but he came close well maybe they will since your shamans are so strong but most of the time you cant pry a dried muskox turd out of them let alone anything worth having in raumsdalian ulric said i wonder what the rock ptarmigans have to say about the snowshoe hares nothing good im sure euric said in the same language but theyre only the rock ptarmigans so what do they know hamnet thyssen had rarely seen ulric abashed but he did now you caught me by surprise there your ferocity the adventurer admitted that will teach you to talk behind somebodys back in front of his face euric said then he swung back towards count hamnet how many horses can we spare a dozen at the most he looked horrified as soon as the words were out of his mouth plainly hed wanted to name some smaller number just as plainly he hadnt been able to marcovefa looked pleased and innocent at the same time did some small spell of hers make the snowshoe hares jarl tell the truth regardless of what he wanted hamnet wouldnt have been surprised by eurics sour expression neither would he on his own he probably would have said four and haggled up to eight or so well i will not make myself out to be a liar he said now you may take them but when times come right again you will pay the clan for the use you got of them agreed count hamnet and trasamund said in the same breath and marcovefa nodded she might not speak the usual bizogot language but sometimes she understood it even so when euric clasped hands with the raumsdalian noble and his fellow jarl to seal the bargain he also held out his big square hand to the shaman from atop the glacier that struck hamnet as only fair without her they wouldnt have had a bargain they certainly wouldnt have had the one they had more than a little relief in his voice euric said and now we feast bizogots could usually outeat raumsdalians not least because the mammothherders went hungry more often when marcovefa got a chance to show what she could do her appetite amazed even the bizogots ive seen a man twice her size who couldnt put away that much euric said admiringly you may have hard times here your ferocity but i promise you that its worse up on top of the glacier count hamnet said no horses or musk oxen or mammoths just hares and voles and little animals halfway between called pikas when marcovefas folk get hungry they get hungry i suppose so the snowshoe hares jarl said he no longer seemed to doubt that the shaman did come from the top of the glacier thoughtfully he added im surprised they dont start eating each other when times get tough hamnet thyssen decided it might be just as well to pretend he didnt hear that he counted himself lucky that euric left it there someone passed him a skin of smetyn next to wine or even beer fermented milk was no great delight but he was glad to drink something besides water and even if the bizogots brew was thin and sour pouring down enough of it would let him forget his troubles for a while trasamund started drinking as if he intended to forget about his troubles for a month when marcovefa tasted the smetyn she looked puzzled she asked a question of ulric skakki what does she say does she like it euric asked she asks what is it you drink besides water ulric said that set trasamund laughing hed already downed enough to let almost anything set him laughing what do we drink besides water he echoed anything we can by god anything we can why marcovefa asked hamnet thyssen understood her on his own the question was almost identical to the bizogot phrase because of what tell her shell find out after she drinks for a while trasamund laughed some more this time in anticipation ulric skakki put that into marcovefas tongue she nodded as if accepting a challenge and began to drink as seriously as shed eaten before long her eyes grew bright her smile went slack and she swayed even though she was sitting down they dont have smetyn on top of the glacier euric asked his voice dry we didnt see any or hear of any hamnet answered would you want to try to milk a rabbit or a vole well no the jarl said with a wry smile marcovefa said something else she wants to know why her head is spinning ulric said she says she hasnt eaten any shamans mushrooms but shes all dizzy anyway liv looked interested when she heard that they have magic mushrooms up on that rock do they she said i cant say im very surprised mushrooms grow almost everywhere shes talked about them before count hamnet said i didnt notice livs voice was chilly tell her people down here use smetyn and things like it instead of mushrooms most of the time audun gilli said ulric skakki did marcovefa spoke in return she says this isnt as good she doesnt see all the colors she would with mushrooms and she doesnt feel as if the sky were about to break hamnet didnt know what that meant by livs nod she evidently did marcovefa added something else she says this isnt bad mind you just not as good in the morning shell feel like her heads about to break audun gilli said and so will trasamund yes but trasamund will know why hamnet thyssen said for marcovefa itll be a big surprise and not one she likes very much everything that happens to marcovefa down here is a surprise ulric skakki said some of the surprises shell like others her first hangover well maybe not some of the snowshoe hares began pairing off that was another thing that happened at bizogot feasts euric found women for trasamund and the bizogots who accompanied him and one for audun gilli as well they werent all beauties but hamnet didnt think any of the bizogots would have to close his eyes to lie down with one of them then euric surprised him the jarl inclined his head to marcovefa and said if you feel like it yes the shaman from atop the glacier sometimes understood what people meant without understanding what they said she also surprised count hamnet she smiled and nodded and none too steadily got to her feet and went back into eurics tent with him well well ulric said a slightly bemused grin crossing his foxy face that ought to be interesting arnora set a hand on his shoulder and shook him what about us she said with drunken intensity dont you want to be intereshting interesting too my reputation would never be the same if i said no the adventurer replied i aim to please and god forbid i should fail in my aim he rose too more smoothly than marcovefa had done and went off into the deepening twilight with his scarfaced lady friend that didnt quite leave hamnet and liv all alone but not many people were close by and none of them paid any attention to the raumsdalian noble and the bizogot shaman well liv said an odd note of challenge in her voice shall we im with ulric hamnet replied i aim to please too they went into one of the tents and slid under a mammothhide blanket bizogots lived in one anothers pockets especially during the long hard northern winters and needed less in the way of privacy than raumsdalians did they were better at looking the other way and pretending not to hear too by now hamnet had spent enough time among them to worry less about who might be watching and listening than he would have down in nidaros all the same he wasnt sure how well he would respond after everything hed eaten and drunk making love with a full belly took more effort nowadays than it had when he was younger and his quarrels with liv didnt help either but he succeeded by the way she responded he was better than good enough tonight you do still care she murmured as they lay in each others arms afterwards their hearts slowing towards calm ive always cared he answered too much maybe liv had said that before hamnet thyssen frowned how can a man care too much about a woman easy enough liv said if you care so much if you worry so much that you drive her away instead of pulling her towards you isnt that too much are you saying i do that he asked sometimes she replied which was just polite enough to hold off a row but sometimes not too she caressed him not is better better for you maybe he muttered he was lucky she didnt hear him she sprawled across him warm and soft and for the moment happy he found himself yawning he didnt usually fall asleep right after making love but he didnt usually eat and drink as much as he had beforehand either his eyes slid shut he and liv both started to snore about the same time liv woke hamnet the next morning by poking him in the ribs his automatic response was to grab for his sword then he discovered he wasnt wearing it or anything else whats going on he asked i dont know she answered but its noisy out there and it doesnt sound like good noise wed better find out hamnet listened and found himself nodding no the racket out there didnt sound happy if that wordless keening wasnt a woman in mourning then it was a woman desperately ill the groaning man also sounded none too healthy despite the noise some of the bizogots in the tent stayed asleep others like him and liv were waking up down in the empire hamnet wouldnt have wanted to get out from under the blanket and dress with so little privacy he especially wouldnt have wanted liv to put herself on display like that bizogot customs were different though he didnt worry about it much the bright sunlight hurt his eyes and made his head ache yes hed poured down too much smetyn the night before but he wasnt nearly so bad off as trasamund and marcovefa their moans and groans had fooled liv and him into thinking some real disaster had befallen the snowshoe hares trasamund found a skin of water and poured it over his head he came out blowing and snorting like a grampus then he found a skin of smetyn that he applied internally ill be better in a while he said the hair of the dire wolf that bit me marcovefa said something that sounded pitiful hamnet thyssen looked around for ulric skakki and didnt see him maybe the adventurer figured out what the commotion was about or maybe he was just an uncommonly sound sleeper without ulric around hamnet had to work out for himself what marcovefa meant he pointed to a skin of water and mimed pouring it over her she looked at him through bloodshot eyes then nodded she spluttered and coughed then gasped out something hamnet only half followed he thought it meant this is supposed to make me feel better here trasamund thrust a skin of smetyn at her and showed her she was supposed to drink from it she recoiled in horror water dripping from her hair and her chin and the end of her nose the way she held out her hands as she spoke told hamnet what she had to mean that she didnt want to get near smetyn ever again curse it thyssen tell her itll make her feel better not worse trasamund said ill try count hamnet told him and he did with the regular bizogot speech and the few words of marcovefas dialect he thought he knew and a lot of gestures she didnt want to believe him for which he could hardly blame her if it had poisoned her once why wouldnt it poison her again he tried to show her that a little would help but a lot would make things worse at last warily she drank it wouldnt be a miracle cure hamnet knew that from somber experience but chances were it would do her some good euric looked more sympathetic than count hamnet had thought he would he even kissed marcovefa on the cheek she must have pleased him when they went back into his tent together what would she be like under a blanket that was probably not the kind of question liv wanted him asking himself even if marcovefa had pleased the jarl of the snowshoe hares euric did his best to wiggle out of the bargain hed made with her the day before he didnt refuse to turn over a dozen horses he did do his best to give the refugees the dozen worst the clan owned a couple of them were visibly on their last legs none of the ones he wanted to turn over looked capable of anything more than a lazy canter a few swigs of smetyn had made marcovefa more nearly reconciled to staying alive ulric took her aside and murmured in her ear when she pointed at euric he blanched she spoke ulric translated she says not to be niggardly if you cant give with both hands at least give with one but euric began then he swallowed whatever else he might have been about to say hamnet thyssen had no trouble figuring out why after what he and marcovefa had done the night before she was able to work the most intimate kind of magic against him he didnt know she would but he didnt know she wouldnt either hamnet wouldnt have wanted to take that chance himself then he glanced over to liv glanced more nervously than he wished he would have whatever marcovefa could do to euric liv could do to him if she decided she wanted to when you fell in love with or even made love with a shaman you took chances you didnt with an ordinary woman euric did give with one hand he still passed on some of his clans horrible screws but he also gave away some horses that didnt look as if a strong breeze would blow them over he sighed and moaned and mourned about every one of them so much so that hamnet wondered if he was laying it on too thick but hamnet knew more than a little about horses himself and the replacements werent bad animals euric was just unhappy he had to give them up with half the bizogots and raumsdalians mounted but the rest still on foot the band of refugees moved no faster than it had before if the clan south of the snowshoe hares had enough horses to let everybody here ride things would pick up in the meantime the nags didnt slow the travelers down liv and arnora and marcovefa rode most of the time the men took turns on the other horses hamnet didnt mind walking hed got used to it he did begrudge their sorry pace though who knows what the rulers are doing farther east he said come on you know and i know and the rest of us know ulric skakki said theyre chewing up every bizogot clan that gets in their way hamnet thyssen winced not because he didnt find that likely but because he did he wished ulric hadnt been so blunt you dont think well be able to pull the bizogots together to fight them do you he said well it gets harder when theyre going south faster than we are ulric replied another painful truth we may have to ride south and warn the empire hamnet said when we get the horses to do it i mean and if its not too late by then yes if ulric was nothing if not discouraging but then with the way things were there was too much to be discouraged about they got no help from the rock ptarmigans well before they found the clans encampment hamnet thyssen began to fear that might be so his first moment of worry came when the travelers approached a herd of mammoths the beasts awed marcovefa the rulers ride these you say she asked and hamnet had no trouble following her thats right ulric skakki answered well i can see why marcovefa said then she added something hamnet couldnt follow ulric translated she wants to know if there are any beasts bigger than these some of the forest mastodons get a little bigger i think but not much hamnet said ulric nodded as he relayed that count hamnet went on but whales are supposed to be a lot bigger than any mammoths or mastodons arent they getting the idea of whales across to marcovefa wasnt easy getting the idea of the sea across to her was even harder she understood what streams and ponds were but a pond full of salt water bigger than the glacier and deeper than a mountain was tall strained her credulity again she spoke too fast for count hamnet to keep up with her she says were joking with her she says that just because the mammoths and the musk oxen turned out to be true now we think shell believe anything ulric reported hamnet thyssen raised his right hand as if taking an oath by god its the truth he said marcovefa didnt care much for god either and remained unconvinced nobodys riding out to see who the demon we are trasamund said thats not how things ought to work he was right bizogots were as territorial as badtempered dogs they should have spotted the strangers and come forth to challenge them maybe to try to order them off the clans land her voice troubled liv said i dont think there are any men with those mammoths as count hamnet drew closer to the herd he decided liv was right and that was out of the ordinary out of the ordinary in a bad way hamnet had trouble imagining any innocuous reason why the bizogots would let a herd of mammoths wander on its own those animals meant food and wool and hides to the clan knowing where they were at a given moment was no light matter audun gilli nodded no dogs either more likely to see dogs around musk oxen than around mammoths trasamund said musk oxen pay attention to them because dogs remind them of dire wolves but dire wolves dont trouble mammoths except maybe to nip in and kill a calf once in a while so mammoths dont care so much about them still its not a good sign ulric skakki said and the jarl of the three tusk clan nodded the mammoths didnt seem to care much about strangers on horseback either the rulers really tamed their mammoths the bizogots followed them sometimes guided them and used them but the mammoths here below the glacier remained their own masters in a way dogs and horses and even musk oxen didnt when trasamunds bizogots and the raumsdalians with them came upon a herd of musk oxen with no riders or dogs nearby hamnet thyssen began to worry in earnest the rock ptarmigans would have had to have someone along to keep an eye on animals even more vital than mammoths wouldnt they a cow musk ox was trailing the herd trasamund and some of the bizogots from his clan cut the beast away from its fellows and killed it after the feast count hamnet had had with the snowshoe hares hed been groaningly certain he would never want to eat again a couple of days of travel showed him how foolish that was he stuffed himself full of tough stringy halfcharred muskox meat and he was glad to get it when morning came ulric skakki pointed to the southwest count hamnet didnt need long to spot the carrion birds sliding down from the sky there are a lot of them he said more than there would be for a dead musk ox more than there would be for a dead mammoth too ulric said what do you want to bet thats where the rock ptarmigans had their camp keep that bet or find a fool hamnet answered i wont touch it if we werent fools what would we be doing up here ulric asked much too good a question the bizogots and raumsdalians rode and walked towards the spot where the birds were landing more and more birds kept coming crows and ravens vultures and teratorns even owls and hawks hungry for meat that hadnt got too high before the travelers saw corpses they saw mammothhide tents in the distance and nodded to one another yes this was where the rock ptarmigans had lived and this was where the rock ptarmigans had died owls and hawks notwithstanding the stench of death filled the air corpses of bizogots and their dogs sprawled in unlovely death among the tents the scavengers rose in skrawking screeching clouds as the travelers neared teratorns some of them with wingspans more than twice the height of a man had to run along the ground before they could get airborne do you see any wounds on those bodies trasamund asked heavily after the birds would we hamnet thyssen returned some trasamund said yes some by god do you see any arrows do you see any broken spearshafts do you see any signs of battle looking around hamnet didnt cold chills walked up his back what killed them then he asked before trasamund could answer marcovefa and liv began to keen at the same time they looked at each other in surprise but both kept on audun gilli didnt keen he was on horseback and leaned over and noisily lost the meat hed eaten for breakfast spitting and coughing he gasped out one word magic strong magic foul magic liv added marcovefa said something in her own language ulric skakki didnt translate it but count hamnet had no trouble guessing what it meant if the rulers can do this trasamund didnt go on ulric did if they can do this the empire is in even more trouble than we thought it was we need to get down there as fast as we can bugger the empire what about the rest of the bizogots trasamund roared what about them ulric looked him in the eye odds are we write them off because theyre already lost anyhow trasamund gaped he must not have looked for the adventurer to be so frank count hamnet could have told him that was a mistake if anyone didnt like such forthrightness ulric skakki lost no sleep about it if the empire can beat the rulers well redeem the bizogots hamnet said if the empire loses were all ruined together audun gilli pointed past the encampment that death had struck arent those the rock ptarmigans horses he said the death that had struck men and dogs spared the horses as it had spared mammoths and musk oxen count hamnet supposed the rulers expected to use the herd animals for themselves they wouldnt have got to use the horses unless they showed up soon though not when the beasts were tied in a line if dire wolves didnt find them they would soon perish for want of water and food i didnt want to get mounts for the rest of us like this trasamund muttered as he cut the animals loose one after another better us than them hamnet thyssen looked east i wonder if theyre on the way now we cant fight them trasamund sounded as if he wanted hamnet to tell him he was wrong but the raumsdalian nodded i know we cant the best thing we can do is disappear before they get here chances are theyll just think were a band of brigands who happened on the camp before they did well what else are we ulric skakki sounded proud not ashamed trasamund didnt gape this time he glared however much he must have wanted to though he did no more than glare count hamnet took that to mean he feared ulric was right hamnet cut another horse free and watched it start to graze he feared ulric was too xii hamnet grew hardened to the saddle with the horses from the rock ptarmigans camp the travelers could switch mounts as beasts tired which let them travel till they got too weary to go on themselves the long days and twilightfilled nights of the bizogot steppe in summer also kept them going longer than they would have at any other season of the year riding straight south or rather a little east of south would have taken them to nidaros by the shortest route hamnet would have liked to go that way but trying it was also more likely to make them bump into the rulers and so they went south and west away from the newcomers who had irrupted into the land of the bizogots trasamund and his clansmates didnt know much about the clans who dwelt on that part of the plain ulric skakki by contrast had been there before and was on good terms with several of the jarls they met this is embarrassing trasamund whispered to hamnet thyssen after the jarl of the green geese greeted ulric like a longlost brother what business does a raumsdalian have knowing bizogots better than a bizogot does why ask me hamnet said why not ask ulric or even grippo here grippo was jarl of the green geese hamnet went on ulric would tell you you know that and hed gloat while he was doing it trasamund said he gloats even when he doesnt know hes gloating ulric did enjoy trotting out what he knew and showing it off well ask grippo then hamnet said i cant i dont know him and ulric skakki does curse it grippo raised a skin of smetyn to ulric in salute warmer than the last time you were here isnt it the jarl of the green geese said oh just a little ulric answered couldnt very well be colder by god when were you here before trasamund inquired a couple of winters ago ulric skakki answered lightly he glanced over towards trasamund that was the winter i slipped up through the gap trasamund looked as if he didnt know whether to laugh or curse he ended up doing some of each why you lying sack of horse turds he burst out you expect me to believe that you would have had to go right on past the three tusk clan without ever letting us know you were around yes and so whats so hard about that ulric said you stuck by your tents and by your herds no one had any idea i was there you cant make me believe that trasamund said by god i was the first one through the gap the first one to see what was on the other side of the glacier why would i have come down to the empire if i wasnt because youre not as smart as you think you are ulric skakki suggested his voice stayed mild but he had no give in him trasamund sent a glance of appeal to hamnet thyssen tell him to ease off your grace he said as if ulric werent standing there a few feet away tell him i dont want to thump him but i will if he doesnt quit spewing nonsense like this your ferocity i dont think it is nonsense count hamnet answered in fact im pretty sure i believe him he told me about this when we were going up through the gap last summer he sounded like somebody who knew what he was talking about too and when we got beyond the glacier some of the things he said turned out to be true he might have stabbed trasamund in the back you want me to think a raumsdalian is as good up here as any bizogot the jarl said you want me to think a raumsdalian is better up here than most bizogots i wont do it do you know what you sound like ulric said you sound like one of those tiresome raumsdalians who go on and on about how bizogots are too barbarous to do this that or the other thing theyre stupid bores if you ask me he didnt say what trasamund was if you asked him but you didnt need to be a scholar of logic to figure it out trasamund certainly had no trouble if any of your drivel is true why didnt you come out with it a long time ago he demanded well i did tell count hamnet here and i told him to keep it quiet ulric skakki replied i didnt tell you before because i thought youd get tiresome yourself if you knew and i was bloody well right wasnt i i ought to thump you from here to nidaros and back again trasamund snarled youre welcome to try ulric said politely trasamund was much the bigger man ulric was quicker and as hamnet thyssen had painfully discovered knew more fighting tricks than anyone had any business knowing if the bizogot and the adventurer fought count hamnet knew which way hed bet trasamund was no coward anything but hed hurled himself at the rulers without the slightest worry about what might happen next but something in ulrics matteroffact invitation seemed to give him pause he grabbed a skin of smetyn and took a long pull with the air of a man being more magnanimous than he might he said i am going to let you live and ill tell you why i hang on your every word your ferocity ulric skakkis tone suggested that the jarl was welcome to hang himself ignoring it trasamund said i am going to let you live because the rulers are the enemies we have to fight once theyre beaten we can worry about each other again congratulations ulric said you see you can make sense if you put your mind to it i wasnt sure but you can after all enough hamnet thyssen said quickly ulric was working on making trasamund lose his temper volcanic as the bizogot was that wouldnt be hard it might be good for the sake of ulrics amusement but it also might end in blood and trasamund was right when he said fighting the rulers was more important youre no fun the adventurer said petulantly yes i know that seems to be how things work for me count hamnet said but trasamunds trying hard to do the right thing he deserves credit for it he doesnt deserve you pushing him into a brawl hes doing his best to walk away from ulric skakki pushed out his lower lip youre really very ugly when youre right too just in case you didnt know thank you hamnet said if ulric was trying to bait fern now he wouldnt have any luck by his sour stare ulric was trying to do exactly that you are a band of brothers grippo observed before count hamnet could figure out a polite way to call the jarl of the green geese an idiot grippo continued my brothers and i we would fight like dire wolves in mating season you seem the same way you know one another too well and youve been too close together too long instead of calling grippo a fool hamnet thyssen bowed you have good sense your ferocity maybe and even if i do how much will it help me if these invaders decide to serve us the way they served the rock ptarmigans that was a good question in a way it was too good a question because hamnet had no answer for it were all doing what we can he said which was true but liable to be less than helpful will it be enough grippo inquired another pointed query and if it isnt then what i dont know your ferocity count hamnet answered but if the rulers win i dont expect to be alive to see it if the rulers win not many of us will be grippo said not unless we bend the knee to them anyhow and maybe not even then hamnet thyssen said anyone who is not of their folk is part of the herd as far as theyre concerned why would they treat a herd of people any better than a herd of mammoths the bizogot grunted he lived in a mammothhide tent he slept under a mammothhide blanket he ate mammoth meat used mammoth fat and butter in his lamps wore mammothleather clothes and used mammoth ivory for everything from ornaments to arrow points the mammoths had no say in any of that under the rulers neither would he by god any bizogot who bends the knee to the rulers deserves whatever happens to him trasamund declared any bizogot who bends the knee to anyone deserves whatever happens to him are we not the free folk is it not better to die on our feet than to live on our knees people say so grippo answered the ones who do say so are all alive though i havent heard what the dead ones say there was a piece of cynicism worthy of any diplomat from nidaros worthy even of sigvat ii himself hamnet thyssen bowed his head in admiration of a sort euric had shown him that the bizogots could aspire to civilized deceit listening to grippo he found that theyd truly mastered the art we ought to bring him with us ulric skakki murmured in raumsdalian hed swindle the emperor right out of his shoes for which i thank you though you do me too much honor grippo said in the same language his accent elegant and educated first euric then grippo again count hamnet had rarely seen ulric nonplused but he did now you never let on that you could speak raumsdalian the adventurer yelped life is full of surprises isnt it replied the jarl of the green geese if you deal with the rulers youll get your share hamnet thyssen told him you may not like them once you have them though youve made yourself very plain grippo said i will do what i do whatever it is i wont harm you by it i could you know if i seized you if i gave you to the rulers id win favor from them will you tell me im wrong you wouldnt enjoy it long that was as much as count hamnet could say if he tried to tell grippo the rulers wouldnt reward him for turning over such persistent nuisances the jarl would know he was lying so i judge grippo replied calmly marcovefa said something a long angry burst in her own language how much of the talk had she understood she was learning the usual bizogot tongue and she had that gift for understanding whether she knew the words or not she glanced expectantly towards ulric skakki well go on her attitude said and he did she says you have her curse grippo if you go against what is best for your folk for the sake of what you think best for you marcovefa nodded as if satisfied with the feel of the translation how much should this worry me by the way grippo asked the question he thought the answer was not much marcovefa muttered to herself grippo started to say something else something that probably would have been sardonic or cruel or crude what came out instead was a deep gabbling honk the honk a goose the size of a man might have made grippo looked astonished then he started pecking for seeds on the ground his face wasnt built for that the way a gooses was but he didnt seem to care and then he started preening unlike a goose a man had no business being able to stick his head into his armpit grippos neck seemed to stretch to accommodate he honked some more now seeming seriously alarmed tell her shes made her point hamnet thyssen whispered to ulric too much is too much same as it would have been with euric she should let him be a man again ulric nodded and spoke in marcovefas language grippo raised his head he went on honking for a few heartbeats but then found ordinary words what the demon did you do to me ulric translated his question and then her reply she says she showed you what a silly goose you would be if you kissed the rulers backside by god i guess she did the jarl of the green geese said it was the oddest thing some of the seeds i found there were really good now i know they had to be disgusting but i sure liked them when i pecked them up and i knew what my honks meant even if you didnt shamans sometimes take beast shape themselves you know liv said oh yes grippo nodded ive seen that but i never thought id do it im a man and thats flat but now im a man with a different look at things i hope its a look that says dealing with the rulers wouldnt be such a good idea hamnet thyssen said oh yes oh yes grippo nodded again and shivered at the same time next time if there were a next time your shaman might turn me into a bird louse instead of a bird marcovefa gave him a grin full of teeth no one had said anything about her eating habits atop the glacier that grin suggested them despite the silence grippo flinched from it and from the idea that shed followed him without knowing his language when the travelers rode south the next morning the green geese gave them more horses and everything they asked for in the way of supplies count hamnet had the feeling grippo would have done anything at all to get them away from his clan unlike euric he didnt invite marcovefa to sleep with him hamnet thought he would sooner have slept with a serpent and grippo had never seen a serpent in his life she does make an impression on people doesnt she hamnet said as the tents of the green geese shrank behind them who our cannibal princess oh just a little ulric skakki replied yes just a little and if he gave her half a chance she would make an impression on him he mimed biting down hard hamnet thyssen winced that wasnt what hed meant which didnt mean it wasnt so the sun seemed to stay in the sky forever it was high summer on the northern plains for a few weeks you could forget all about the glacier unless the breath of god decided to blow down from the north even at that time of year if it did all kinds of strange things could happen from snowstorms that blighted a growing season to twisters that picked up anything from a mammoth to a whole bizogot encampment and flung it across the landscape but now the breath of god might have been a million miles away it got as hot as it ever did down in nidaros maybe hotter the hunting was good and grippo sent one of his men with the travelers down to the edge of his grazing lands the man from the green geese ordered muskox herders to kill a beast for the bizogots and raumsdalians passing through what are you sure one of the herders said grippo never tells us to do things like that he did this time the other bizogot sent marcovefa a sidelong glance he didnt explain his jarls embarrassment not in public but he sounded very sure of himself the herder stopped grumbling audun gilli shaved bits from the musk oxs horns after it fell why are you doing that liv asked him i dont know not exactly the wizard sounded a little sheepish but here we are and here i am and heres the musk ox and the horns are strong and they may be good for some kind of magic one of these days that sounded like a stretch to hamnet thyssen but liv only nodded i do the same sort of thing sometimes she said my tent used to be full of this and that and the other thing back when the clan was strong i mean and maybe i would have used some of what i gathered and maybe i wouldnt but i had it just in case when i had a house down in nidaros it was the same way audun said wonderful count hamnet thought theyve found something else they have in common theyre both packrats liv kept telling him he was worrying over nothing every time he looked though the nothing seemed bigger what about you liv asked marcovefa do you save things even when you dont know if you can use them yes marcovefa answered in the regular bizogot tongue she was learning what she needed to know or maybe her capacity for understanding helped whether she knew the words or not youre going to be out of a job when she can speak for herself all the time count hamnet remarked to ulric skakki well it wont break my heart ulric answered arnora already says i spend too bloody much time talking with her and talking for her he rolled his eyes women wont leave you alone when they think you might be fooling around right hamnet showed less enthusiastic agreement than he might have would liv have said something like men wont leave you alone when they think youre fooling around would she have pointed at him when she said it would she have had reason for pointing at him that way then marcovefa pointed off into the middle distance and said something in her own dialect what are those that was what it had to mean those were lions a couple of males three or four females and several cubs maybe the smell of blood from the butchered musk ox drew them they were wise in the ways of men though for they stayed well out of bowshot whatever was left of the carcass they would take after the bizogots moved on awry selfmocking smile on his face ulric explained about lions marcovefa seemed intrigued maybe even impressed she said something more ulric translated she asks if well spare one if she calls it close enough to get a good look at it can her shamanry make sure it spares us trasamund asked instead of answering in words marcovefa walked over and patted him on the cheek as if she were reassuring a nervous little boy the jarl of the three tusk clan muttered something that probably wasnt a compliment marcovefa ignored him she began a crooning chant one that made liv prick up her ears we use that tune for summoning spells she said the men of the glacier spring from bizogots hamnet thyssen said should you be surprised they still share some things with you when you put it that way i guess not i liv broke off the larger male lion trotted towards marcovefa hamnet thyssen started to string his bow then cut off the move before it was well begun an arrow seemed more likely to enrage the big cat than to kill it outright and marcovefa had a way of knowing what she was doing of course if she turned out not to this time it would be the wrong moment for a mistake down in the empire lions had manes not much more than stubble this one boasted a full luxuriant growth its coat was thinning with summer but still far heavier than any the beasts in the south grew it needed all the help it could get against the ferocious winter weather in these parts when the lion drew near to the shaman from atop the glacier it flopped down on the ground and rolled with its paws in the air for all the world like a pampered house cat but these paws could rip the guts out of a man or for that matter a horse marcovefa scratched the lion under its chin a deep rasping purr rewarded her the beast yawned exposing fangs that wouldnt match a sabertooths but that were more than savage enough for all ordinary use she rubbed its belly and the purr got louder by god i wouldnt want to do that ulric skakki muttered id want to trasamund said but i wouldnt dare from the fierce bizogot that was no small admission when marcovefa had seen as much of the lion as she cared to she chanted a new song the great murderous beast stopped acting like a happy kitten it got to its feet and trotted away from her only when it got back to the rest of the pride did the spell suddenly seem to wear off the lion began washing and washing going over its hide with its large rough tongue cleaning the stink of us off it ulric said amusement in his voice it doesnt think were fit to associate with it must have met people before then count hamnet said and the bitterness in his voice made everyone who heard him either stare or else look away from him in embarrassment what kind of embarrassment he wondered that i made a fool of myself or that i told a truth that hurts but that they cant deny he shrugged what difference did it make anyone who still took a sunny view of human nature after what the rulers visited upon the rock ptarmigans was too big a fool to deserve to wander the bizogot plains alone anyhow marcovefa pointed out towards the lion and spoke she says were lucky to live in a land that has such beasts ulric said she says they give us something to measure ourselves against measuring myself against a lion is easy audun gilli said i am less than a lion and i hope i have sense enough to know it when ulric skakki translated marcovefa shook her head could the lion have called you away from other men and made you come to it she asked through the adventurer i hope not by god audun blurted which struck count hamnet as the truth wrapped in a joke the wizard went on i wouldnt have called it here either maybe i could have maybe but i wouldnt why not marcovefa asked for fear something would go wrong with my magic thats why audun said never fear the shaman from atop the glacier said seriously never when you fear it makes your magic small well yours isnt weve noticed that audun gilli said you see even with ulric skakki translating for her marcovefa sounded sure of herself i think she is of our blood trasamund said bizogots know better than to fear not fearing isnt always good either hamnet thyssen pointed out sometimes you can run straight into something you would have stayed away from if only youd had the sense to fear it i dont believe that trasamund said what about your clan hamnet thought if theyd kept proper watch at the gap they might have kept the rulers from getting through for a long time but they hadnt known enough to fear the mammothriders theyd found out soon enough too soon in fact he knew trasamund would quarrel with him if he pointed that out life was too short they bickered often enough as things were sometimes over things that might actually get fixed they were stuck with the past though however little either one of them liked it instead of chaffing the jarl hamnet asked what will we do if we run into the enemy on our road south what will we do when we run into the enemy thats what you mean ulric skakki was rarely shy about throwing oil on the fire but count hamnet shook his head i said if i meant if were trying to stay out of the paths the rulers are likely to take the answer is the same any which way trasamund said if we find them if they find us we fight them he reached back over his shoulder to touch the hilt of his great twohanded sword they can die we can kill them we have killed a good many of them not enough but a good many he scowled unless we kill them all it is not enough i dont know how to do that i wish i did we can kill them yes but they can kill us too and theyre rather better at that than we are at the other ulric enjoyed irritating trasamund where hamnet thyssen didnt wouldnt we do better staying away from them than fighting where we cant win if you are afraid trasamund began a bizogots automatic retort but then he shook his big head i know you too well you are not afraid you are only annoying me like any other gnat well i dont feel like letting you bite today if we run into the rulers do whatever you please you will anyhow hamnet looked down at the ground so ulric wouldnt see him smile when he had his features under control he raised his head once more ulric skakki was using the edge of a blade of grass to rout out something stuck between his teeth if trasamunds thrust bothered him he didnt show it but to those who knew him his very nonchalance said he knew hed lost the exchange how does it feel to be a gnat hamnet asked natural enough ulric replied easily hamnet started to nod then he grimaced and found something else to do if ulric had lost the exchange to the bizogot jarl hed just lost it to ulric and the adventurer needed only two words to make him do it he wasnt sorry to take sentry duty when the sun finally went down a few stars came out but only a few twilight lingered long in the north and the moon filled the southern sky with pale light everything was grayish colors muted and distances confused even motion seemed indistinct it was like watching half in dreamland sounds though were somehow magnified a dire wolf that howled far off to the south might almost have been sniffing at hamnets boots an owls hoot made his hand drop to his swordhilt the rulers wizards flew through the night and sometimes through the day as owls he needed another hoot or two to realize how distant this bird was real or sorcerous it would not come across the travelers encampment and a footfall that sounded as if it came from right behind him was much farther away than that for a moment there in the uncertain light he wasnt sure who was coming out to him but liv was impossible not to recognize the way she moved spoke to him in his blood at a level below words is it all right she asked as she came up it seems to be hamnet answered why arent you sleeping she shrugged with the sun in the sky so long i dont seem to need as much hamnet found himself nodding hed noticed the same thing when he had to he could go longer without sleep here than he could have down in the empire the long deep winter darkness in the north made him want to curl up and hibernate like a bear though i heard an owl not long ago he said yes i heard it too liv said i think it was only an owl i hope it was only an owl she looked around the twilight was deepening but almost imperceptibly this stretch of days makes up for the rest of the year it tries to anyway half light and half dark anywhere you go hamnet thyssen said only the way theyre blended is different yes liv stared up at the moon it washed the shadows and lines from her face she might have been a marble bust not a woman of flesh and blood seeing her lips move as she spoke again seeing that her lips could move seemed startling i suppose people are the same way only the what did you call it the blend is different it could be hamnet said i dont know that it is but it could be even the wickedest man wont tell you hes wicked he wont think he is whatever he was doing he was doing for the best of reasons or he thinks he was anyway even the rulers are heroes in their own eyes liv s mouth twisted but not in mine oh no not in mine her clan was shattered she hadnt been there when the rulers struck hadnt pitted her wizardry against theirs that the rulers would have rolled over the three tusk clan anyhow seemed as certain to hamnet thyssen as tomorrows sunrise telling liv as much was pointless he knew because hed tried what could he have done to keep gudrid from betraying him all those years ago nothing very likely faithlessness was in her blood that didnt keep him from lacerating himself even now or from wishing things might have been different it also didnt keep him from lacerating himself about liv whether he needed to or not indeed it drove him to do just that but it blinded him to why he did it too and blinded him to his being blind that of course he could not see what are we going to do liv cried hamnet thought she meant the two of them but she went on what are the poor sorrowful bizogots going to do fight the enemy hamnet answered what else can you do but every time we try we lose he shook his head youve beaten them weve beaten them in raids she brushed that aside as being of no account we can nip them when we catch them without a shaman but when they have one we lose the empires wizards arent to be despised hamnet said dont you think the rulers will smash them she returned their magic is of much the same kind as ours maybe they know a bit more or maybe they can do a bit more but it is of the same kind and how much good has that kind of magic done against the rulers not enough count hamnet admitted hardly anything liv cried in a passion of fury most unlike her whatever we try even against their mammoths they do something better or rather something worse to us do you really think the empires wizards can stop them or even slow them down very much if they cant hamnet said slowly then this whole land is in even more trouble than we thought it was it is liv said it is the only other choice is rolling on our bellies the way the jarl of the green geese was thinking of doing hamnet said i cant do that can you no i cant do anything at all and i hate it liv said one of the best things about being a shaman is that youre able to change things able to make them better against the rulers i cant and it drives me wild were running away from them and that seems to be the most we can do he put an arm around her she clung for a moment then broke away he bit down on the inside of his lower lip he couldnt even manage to comfort her why did you come to me he asked his voice wooden because she broke off oh never mind because why he asked he could come up with answers on his own the likeliest one was because audun gillis asleep even imagining that one did wonders for the way he felt about himself liv didnt say that though because if i kept quiet any longer i thought my head would explode she told him there is that enough or do you want to stick any more thorns in me somehow shed twisted things so he was in the wrong i never wanted to do that he said no eh or did you just want to stick something else in me instead you know i do he answered as steadily as he could i thought it went both ways maybe i was wrong no but do you have any idea how impossible you are i do my best he said with a certain somber pride in spite of everything that made her laugh this time she put her arms around him he squeezed her which made him do exactly what shed said for a moment she squeezed him back then she twisted away again not now she said it wouldnt be right why not with the blood pounding in his veins he couldnt see any reason because thats something you should do when youre happy liv answered im not happy now not when i miss the clan so much i walked away from the empire hamnet thyssen said i walked away and i want to make love with you anyhow yes but you walked away from somewhere you didnt fit any more liv said i belonged in the three tusk clan ill never find any other place where i belong half so well she was right about him hed stayed on the fringes of imperial life as much as he could for years before deciding to give it up and come north shed had a place where she belonged till the rulers robbed her of it hed thought he fit with gudrid after he found out how wrong he was there hed been on his own an uncomfortably independent island in an ocean full of people sure of their places and comfortable in them let it go then he said gloomily not that he wanted to let it or her go but that he had not the energy to quarrel over it he wondered what he would have had the energy to quarrel about just then a sudden irruption of the rulers perhaps getting excited about anything smaller seemed more trouble than it was worth maybe liv caught some of that in his voice i dont mean never she said i only mean not right now i know hamnet thyssen couldnt make himself get very excited even about being turned down and if that wasnt a sign of something badly wrong deep inside his spirit then it wasnt that was all well liv said the word seemed to hang in the air hamnet knew he ought to say something anything but nothing came to him he couldnt even care about not caring liv sighed ill go back to the rest of them then and leave you here to stand your watch she walked away looking back over her shoulder once was she hoping he would call out to her he nearly did but again kept silence after what seemed a very long time but by the slow wheeling of the moon and stars was no longer than it should have been a bizogot came out to relieve him anything funny going on the man asked anything strange no hamnet thyssen said its been pretty quiet he walked back to the encampment lay down and got a little sleep before the earlyrising sun stuck slivers of light under his eyelids and forced them apart someone had built up the fire hamnet carved off a gobbet of muskox meat and began toasting his breakfast you look cheerful ulric skakki said i doubt it hamnet answered mechanical as if moved by clockwork he climbed aboard his horse and rode off with the rest of the travelers if he nodded in the saddle he wasnt the only one and then trasamund pointed south and let out a bellow of mingled fear and fury riders ahead riders not on horses but on deer the rulers apathy fell from count hamnet like a discarded cloak he strung his bow and made sure his sword was loose in its sheath if they wanted to go on they would have to fight yes he was ready for that xlll fighting held a welcome simplicity no time to brood no time to think only to do and to do fast your body knew far ahead of your mind hamnets mind had spun in too many circles better to snuff it out and let his body show what it knew he would rather have done that lying with liv since he couldnt pleasure her killing someone else would do almost as well the rulers though took a deal of killing even if their deer didnt measure up to horses their bows made them formidable enemies and they had no fear the bizogots and raumsdalians might outnumber them but they rode to the attack without the slightest hesitation by the way they came on they thought the men who followed trasamund would scatter like chaff before them they were used to victory and expected nothing else hamnet thyssen nocked an arrow no matter what they expected he vowed that they would get a beating instead they started shooting before he would have with those powerful compound bows they could afford to but their deer were a little slower than horses so they couldnt stay out of range of the raumsdalians and bizogots they faced they didnt seem interested in staying out of range anyhow an arrow hissed past hamnets head at such a range that was fearsomely good shooting or perhaps fearsomely lucky had the arrow hit him which wouldnt have mattered he let fly himself the enemy he aimed at didnt fall shooting from a bucketing horse at a foeman on a galloping deer wasnt easy he swore anyhow and reached over his shoulder to pull another arrow from the quiver he drew the bow aimed and released all in one smooth motion guiding the horse with his knees while he did the bowstring thrummed against his wrist a moment later the riding deer that carried the man hed shot at crashed to the ground that wasnt quite what hed had in mind but it would do out in front of him trasamund bellowed a hit a hit for the three tusk clan the jarl let out an alarming and alarmingly authentic mammoth squeal he shook his fist at the rulers and bawled obscenities their way he hadnt seen who shot the deer and wasnt likely to give a raumsdalian credit in place of one of his own to be fair many more bizogots followed him so the odds were on his side even if he happened to be wrong one of his bizogots tumbled from the saddle with an arrow through the chest the remnant of the three tusk clan had just got smaller hamnet shot a couple of more arrows at the rulers he didnt see any of them or their mounts go down after either one of those shots but all he could do was keep trying then he set his bow aside and drew his sword it was going to come down to handstrokes the way fights always did that gave him and his companions the edge for their mounts were bigger than the ones the rulers used they could strike down at their foes from horseback and the enemy didnt seem to have a wizard along if they had odds were the raumsdalians and bizogots would already have come to grief that thought had hardly crossed count hamnets mind before the rulers riding deer seemed to go mad they started leaping and bounding like oversized rabbits and refused to answer their riders commands the rulers shouts mingled fury and dismay hamnet glanced over towards liv she looked as surprised as he was he looked at audun gilli the raumsdalian wizard was having trouble staying on his own horse not the kind of trouble the rulers were having but the kind of trouble any bad rider might have in battle whoever was driving the rulers mounts crazy it wasnt either of them which left as soon as hamnet thyssen saw marcovefa he knew hed wasted his time with his first two glances the shaman from atop the glacier was almost hugging herself with glee hamnet had no idea how shed done it but he had no doubt that shed done it he also had no doubt that his side needed to take advantage of it come on he yelled lets hit them while theyre having trouble the bizogots from the three tusk clan and the others whod joined them needed little encouragement slaying their foes while the warriors of the rulers were fighting to control their riding deer wasnt sporting but it was very effective the enemy would have done the same to them had done the same whenever their sorcerers let them revenge was sweet they took no captives the rulers tried to flee when they saw things going so far against them but had no luck their riding deer couldnt outrun horses three bizogots died in the fight several more were hurt ulric skakki looked at count hamnet youre bleeding he remarked am i hamnet said in surprise then he looked down and saw the cut on the back of his hand as soon as he noticed it it started to hurt so are you i know i know ulric had a scratch on his left ear he shrugged my tunic is stained so what itll make me look fierce and warlike wont it he looked anything but that didnt mean he wasnt but he didnt look as if he were like the northern beasts that changed color with the seasons he concealed his talents as best he could tell marcovefa she did a good job spooking their deer hamnet thyssen said she did didnt she ulric looked around for her then called out in the strange oldfashioned dialect she used she replied at some length what does she say hamnet asked ulric looked bemused she says weve been going on and on about how strong their magic is but it wasnt anything much how does she know hamnet said they had no wizard with them good point ulric skakki put the question into marcovefas tongue knowing what he was going to say helped count hamnet follow some of it marcovefa answered volubly when she spoke hamnet could find a word here and there but not enough to piece together into meaning she says you can always tell ulric skakki reported she says you can taste it on the wind smell it in their sweat the adventurer shrugged i dont know whether to take that literally or not considering her eating habits up on top of the glacier i hope im not supposed to marcovefa scowled at him she had to understand what he meant she could follow the regular bizogot language but not raumsdalian which hed used not usually anyhow but when she decided to she understood whatever she wanted now she chose to be affronted or at least to act affronted it wasnt the same thing were she really angry she would have made ulric as sorry as grippo trasamund bowed in the saddle to marcovefa for your aid i give thanks wise woman he said any blow against the rulers is a good one they are not so much marcovefa said clearly in the bizogot tongue then she added something hamnet couldnt follow neither could trasamund what was that he asked she repeated it this time ulric translated they deserve drowning like little beasts a mother cannot raise they will get what they deserve by god may it be so the jarl boomed he pointed to the corpses dotting the steppe if youre hungry youre welcome to them again marcovefa spouted gibberish again ulric translated she says she would not touch illomened flesh that suits me let the crows have them then trasamund said we ride on and they did theyd swung even farther west than hamnet thyssen thought he expected they would have to travel along the northern edge of sudertorp lake and looked forward to showing marcovefa the wide expanse of water shed lived her life above a much wider expanse of water but that didnt occur to him till later the glacier yielded meltwater yes but it didnt really cross his mind when he thought of the lake it was or felt like something altogether different but they were west of its westernmost tip and had to find a way to cross the little sudertorp river which flowed out of it he was stuck with talking about the lake instead of having it there in front of him through ulric skakki marcovefa asked why does the water stay in the lake why doesnt it all run out through the river count hamnet frowned at him you know the answer to that as well as i do well yes but so what ulric said you were playing tour guide and i wasnt you do the explaining fine hamnet pointed east back towards the outlet to the lake tell her about all the dirt and rocks and ice that dam up the end and hold the water in the lakebed tell her theyre leftovers from the days when the glacier came this far south ulric did hamnet could follow bits and pieces of what he said to marcovefa and of what she said to him that meant he was braced when ulric translated another question from her what would happen if the dam gave way the idea was plenty to make him shudder the biggest flood anybody ever saw you know about the badlands west of nidaros where hevring lake flooded and tore everything to pieces tell her about those and tell her wed have more just like them up here if sudertorp lake broke the dam ulric did with gestures marcovefa seemed suitably impressed but hamnet wondered how much she really understood how much could she understand when shed had so little to do with running water before descending from the glacier wheres the closest ford he asked ulric the adventurer pointed west about an hours ride that way i think theres a closer one we could use if the water were lower but i dont think we could get away with it now he knew the steppe like a bizogot knew it better than a lot of bizogots in fact for hed ranged it widely while they stayed on their clans grazing grounds most of the time dire wolves drank by the river their heads rose when they saw or heard or smelled the riders coming they peered towards the approaching bizogots and raumsdalians as if wondering whether to stand their ground and fight one of them let out a querulous whine that must have been the signal for all of them to leave they trotted away tails held high as if to say they werent really afraid big foxes marcovefa remarked friendly foxes they go in bunches like the musk oxen yes she was learning the regular bizogot tongue packs we call them packs trasamund said and you wouldnt think they were so friendly if you ran into them by yourself count hamnet wondered about that if anyone could stay safe in the company of hungry dire wolves the shaman from atop the glacier seemed a likely candidate but she hadnt meant they were friendly to people she was talking about how they behaved with one another rocks sticking up out of the water showed where the first possible ford lay seeing the white water churning around them hamnet shook his head i dont think we want to try to get across there he said looks like a good way to drown i told you it wouldnt be good with this much water in the river ulric skakki said you tell me all kinds of things hamnet replied some of them are true some im so insulted ulric laughed out loud they reached the real ford a little later the water there didnt get up past the horses bellies it was cold but that was no great surprise marcovefa watched with eyes as wide as a childs as the horse carried her across to the southern bank up above the glacier were any streams big enough to make such a thing possible even if theyd had horses up there hamnet didnt think so is this still leaping lynx country he asked after splashing up onto the far bank i think so or maybe their lands end farther east ulric skakki answered either way theyll be in trouble when the rulers get this far south hamnet thyssen nodded the leaping lynx clan were rarities semisedentary bizogots in winter they roamed like any other mammothherders but in the warm season they lived in stone houses near the eastern edge of sudertorp lake the swarms of waterfowl that bred in the reeds and marshes there gave them so much food they didnt have to roam they wouldnt even be a moving target when the invaders swept down on them hard to feel real sorry for the leaping lynxes trasamund said they arent really proper bizogots at all set against the rulers everybody from this side of the glacier is proper hamnet thyssen said if we lose sight of that we lose and theres the end of it the bizogot jarl grunted he didnt want to lose his particularism it suited him too well anything bigger than a clan had to feel artificial to him people across the steppe are saying well the three tusk clan cant be proper bizogots because they lost a battle and lost their grazing lands ulric skakki said are they right no by god trasamund shouted but he couldnt or wouldnt see that that had anything to do with the way he looked at the leaping lynxes ulric sighed but didnt seem surprised hamnet thyssen wasnt surprised either saddened yes but not surprised trasamund always had trouble seeing that hed made a mistake or even that he could there wasnt really time to worry about it or time to quarrel about it audun gilli asked are the rulers over this river yet that was the burning question if they are we may find out about it soon hamnet said sudertorp lake will have pushed them either this way or off to the east if it is to the east god help the leaping lynxes and if its not god help us he thought this land is so rich marcovefa said it can hold so many such a shame to need to fight over it hamnet and ulric looked at each other she saw the land was richer than the mountaintop sticking up through the glacier but she didnt see how very poor that was rich by comparison didnt mean truly rich not even close trasamund pointed there are mammoths he said in the days before the gap melted through the bizogots and raumsdalians would have welcomed that news it would have meant more mammothherders were close by now it might mean mammothriders were near the difference sounded small but was even bigger than the one between marcovefas homeland and the bizogot steppe it was the difference between safety and disaster they approached the mammoths with as much caution as they could muster if the great beasts belonged to the rulers what could trasamund and those with him do but flee and what kind of chance would they have if they did not good hamnet thyssen thought no anything but good but they breathed easier when the man who rode out to see who they were and what they were up to rode a horse not a deer the hair under his fur hat was bizogot yellow not the shiny black of the rulers even his brand of bluster sounded familiar who the demon are you and what the demon do you think youre doing here youre marcomer arent you hamnet thyssen shouted back pleased he remembered the fellows name we met when i guested with the leaping lynxes last year thyssen marcomer called and hamnet nodded the bizogot barely waited for that before he went on what in blazes is going on farther north weve had more people coming down through our grazing grounds than anybody in his right mind would believe and thats trasamund with you again isnt it its me all right trasamund was never shy about speaking for himself he and count hamnet took turns talking about the arrival of the rulers the jarl of the three tusk clan finished its even worse than we thought it would be when we came through going north last winter weve heard some of this from others marcomer said we didnt know how much to believe men riding mammoths mad sorceries but ive got to believe you when you tell me you went to the top of the glacier nobody would be daft enough to make that up and expect the folk who heard him to listen marcovefa stirred but held her tongue she must have realized the bizogot with the name that sounded like hers wasnt trying to offend will you let us pass on ulric skakki as usual went straight to the point you ought to go back to the stone houses and talk to the jarl marcomer answered if we go back to the stone houses were liable to run into folk we dont want to meet hamnet said i hope not but we dont care to take the chance folk you dont want to meet what are you talking about marcomer might have heard what the travelers told him but he hadnt really listened i dont know whether the rulers have come this far south but i wouldnt be surprised hamnet said i do know they havent come west of sudertorp lake because we would have met them instead of you if they had but if they have come this far and theyve gone east of sudertorp lake where are they likely to be at the stone houses marcomer went pale now he understood what count hamnet and trasamund were talking about wed better send someone over there to warn the jarl without any kind of farewell he rode back towards the mammoths shouting at his fellow herders as he went well we livened up his morning didnt we ulric skakki sounded more proud of himself than anything else before long marcomer and another horseman trotted east hamnet thyssen silently wished them luck maybe they could warn the rest of the leaping lynxes he feared they were more likely to run headlong into disaster but that was also part of life an all too common part lets ride trasamund said they wont kill a mammoth calf for us im sure of that we need to go on till we find a herd of musk oxen before too very long well be able to see the tree line hamnet said were more than halfway across the bizogot steppe when we started i never would have believed we could get this far something to that one corner of ulric skakkis mouth quirked up i wonder what the rulers will think of trees i wonder what their mammoths will think of them that hadnt occurred to count hamnet no denying ulric had something though or at least might have something the land beyond the glacier was also far beyond the tree line the unfamiliar terrain might slow down the invaders or on the other hand it might not brilliant hamnet thought sardonically you covered all the choices and you didnt settle a cursed thing after that riding on came as something of a relief the worst or something close to it had befallen the leaping lynxes two days after the meeting by the mammoth herd marcomer and several other bizogots from the lakeside caught up with the travelers from the north from behind along with his companions hamnet thyssen had feared they might be warriors of the rulers i never got to the stone houses these rulers attacked before i could marcomer said they struck the clan and they scattered us riccimir is dead he had his quirks but he was a good jarl he was hamnet agreed the leaping lynxes had the richest hunting grounds in the bizogot country riccimir defended them well against other clans some bigger and stronger than his that wanted to take them for themselves some of our houses fell down said one of the bizogots a woman with marcomer the mammothriders made a magic and the houses fell down the jarl died in the wreck of his when a rock smashed his head then the strangers swept down on us we tried to fight but how could we god only knows what happened to the ones who couldnt get away theyre part of the rulers herd now hamnet thyssen said that did nothing to cheer the leaping lynxes he hadnt thought it would what can we do marcomer asked i want to go back and kill as many of those demons as i can before they get me that might have done well enough if he were likely to kill any of the rulers at all before they killed him as things were hamnet answered you have a better chance for revenge if you come with us we think the empire can fight back against the invaders well we hope the empire can anyhow thats not the same thing even if i dont want marcomer thinking about the difference marcovefa said something incomprehensible hamnet looked a question towards ulric skakki the adventurer didnt sound happy as he translated she doesnt understand why were getting so upset about the rulers she says theyre nothing much shed said that before shed proved it too against a raiding party that had no wizard of its own along when she beats their shamans she may talk anyway she pleases trasamund said till then seeing as weve been running from the rulers ever since we came down from the glacier before that too i wish shed keep her mouth shut count hamnet waited for marcovefa to resent that and to show it by making trasamund do something embarrassing or absurd but she didnt she just smiled and blew him a kiss the jarl muttered under his breath he also seemed willing to leave it there though audun gilli tried to look on the bright side were a stronger party now if we have to fight the rulers we stand a better chance something you really need to learn is the difference between better and good ulric skakki said audun gilli looked wounded hamnet thyssen would have sympathized with him more if he hadnt been thinking the same thing ulric put it better than he would have and spoke first that was all when they came down to the tree line the year before theyd been racing winter and winter moved south faster than they did this time summer was sliding towards fall but hadnt got there yet although days were getting shorter nights hadnt yet outdistanced them the firs and spruces remained dark no snow stippling their needles ive heard about trees marcomer said i never thought theyd be so big though up on the bizogot plain which began where the forest could no longer grow wood was an imported luxury scarce and expensive i thought they would be bushes marcovefa said i thought they would be bushes taller than me but they arent really like that are they and he is right i never thought they would be this big hamnet thyssen ulric skakki and audun gilli all smiled then tried to pretend they hadnt so did trasamund and liv whod come south before they knew about trees for the rest of the bizogots as for marcomer and marcovefa these scraggly samples just below the line where the ground froze were far and away the biggest living things theyd ever seen as hamnet peered first east and then west ulric sent him a quizzical stare what are you looking for the adventurer demanded a border station count hamnet answered ulric arched an eyebrow why those snoops are nothing but nuisances and if you remember the way we left theyre liable to have orders to arrest us on sight let them try hamnet said weve got thirty warriors and three wizards with us if that isnt enough to make border guards leave us alone were in real trouble and when we find a station well find a road leading south from it mm there is that ulric admitted he looked along the edge of the forest too it would be easy in the wintertime so it would hamnet thyssen said during the winter the border guards kept big fires blazing to stay warm a column of smoke pointed the way to each post at this season of the year though the men didnt need to worry about freezing hamnet shrugged i dont see one but our wizards can tell us which way to go to find one close by theyd better be able to anyhow audun gilli had a bit of lodestone on a string that he used for finding directions the spell wasnt so accurate up in the far north as it was in the empire but the wizard thought it would work here count hamnet judged him likely to be right but they didnt need enormous precision now knowing whether to ride east or west would do west audun said after chanting and making passes and watching the way the lodestone swung they went west marcovefa tried to question audun about his charm ulric skakki translated with a martyred expression on his face hamnet understood that for a nonwizard nothing was more boring than trying to render sorcerys technical terms from one tongue to another hed done it himself before audun learned the bizogot tongue now he wasnt sorry to see audun talking with marcovefa and not with liv jealous me he thought and then well yes they reached the border post in a couple of hours the stations were scattered thinly across the frontier between civilization and barbarism this one looked like all the others hamnet thyssen had seen a wooden hut held by a handful of raumsdalian soldiers who didnt have the clout to get posted anywhere else the raumsdalians seemed horrified to see such a large party approaching them what you do one of them shouted using the bizogot language badly but understandably no war here no no war here yet hamnet answered in raumsdalian but how long will it be have you heard of the coming of the rulers what we hear and what we see are two different things the soldier answered when we see these rulers or whoever they are maybe well worry about them if they deserve it i guess we will meantime though who the demon are you i am count hamnet thyssen hamnet waited to see what would happen next one of the border guards started violently hes that one he exclaimed thats right im that one what are you going to do about it hamnet asked with a certain somber pride before answering the guards put their heads together then one of them said whatll you do after we let you into the empire try to persuade people there really is a danger to the north youll see for yourself soon enough so will everybody and it wont be much longer the border guards put their heads together again when they drew apart they all wore almost identical unpleasant smiles pass on one of them said youll do worse to yourselves than anything we can do to you thank you so much count hamnet wasnt about to show that he thought they were much too likely to be right he translated the permission to advance for the bizogots who spoke no raumsdalian ulric rendered it into marcovefas dialect she said something in return something he didnt translate whats the closest town down this road hamnet asked the guards malmo answered the man whod spoken before its about half a days ride from here he sighed wistfully i sure wish it were closer hamnet believed that a stretch at a border station could seem too much like one in jail as they rode past the border station marcovefa murmured to herself her hands twisted in quick passes the guards got down on all fours and started cropping grass when a noise from the travelers startled them they bunched together in a ring heads facing out they werent musk oxen but they didnt seem to know they werent how long will the spell last count hamnet asked a day maybe two marcovefa seemed pleased with herself hamnet looked over his shoulder the border guards were grazing again he hadnt cared for their arrogance maybe they wouldnt act quite so high and mighty when they regained full humanity or maybe they wouldnt notice any difference either way they werent his worry on to malmo he said and marcovefa nodded the shaman from atop the glacier wasnt so happy by the time she reached the forest town several bizogots from the frozen steppe were also in a bad way these trees one of them said with a shudder theyre pressing in on me where is the sky another one added where is the the space he threw his arms wide as if to push back the branches that hung out over the road which was hardly more than a track and the dark trees from which they grew out on the plains to the north count hamnet often felt he was too small and the landscape much too large here where things closed in bizogots had the opposite trouble hed seen that before when traveling towards nidaros with trasamund and liv liv didnt seem too happy now but shed been through this then and knew what to expect now the mammothherders who hadnt got an unpleasant surprise so did marcovefa whod also lived her life in a land of wide horizons she sighed in relief when they rode out into the clearing that surrounded malmo the sun she said not shadows in my face all the time then she dropped into her own tongue whats she saying hamnet asked ulric skakki something about wood but i cant make out what shes excited about all the ways you can use it ulric said the palisade the houses she called them wooden tents that was amusing and clever at the same time wait till she sees the fires at the serai hamnet said malmo wasnt a very big town but it was bound to have a place where travelers could stay wasnt it as things turned out it was the serai was nothing special even by the standards of provincial towns but it had a bathhouse and cooked food and rooms with beds hamnet thyssen wasnt inclined to be fussy after so long among the bizogots to say nothing of the sojourn on top of the glacier even the rough edges of civilization seemed wonderful marcovefa marveled at everything shed never known real buildings before bathing in hot water with soap must have seemed indescribably luxurious to her she didnt want to come out and let some of the other travelers wash at supper she ate roast pork when she first tried it she looked surprised is this she started count hamnet knew what she was driving at no by god it isnt he told her when it cooks it smells like that but its not it tastes like that too she said maybe not just like that but close she added something else in her own dialect ulric translated she didnt think we ate each other but she would have believed you if you told her that was what it was we dont it isnt hamnet thyssen drained a mug of ale glad to be spared at least one sin after smetyn ale seemed very good to him he didnt ask for wine the tapman might have had some but this far north it was bound to be painfully expensive ale would do through ulric marcovefa asked if i drink a lot of this will my head want to fall off tomorrow morning yes hamnet and ulric and trasamund and audun gilli all said the same thing at the same time then she asked how much is a lot that was harder to answer hamnet said its different from one person to the next it depends on how big you are and how much you usually drink and on who knows what have to find out then marcovefa finished her mug and waved to the tapman for another she was starting to figure out how things worked here but when ulric gave the fellow a coin for the fresh mug she got puzzled all over again to her copper and silver and gold made good ornaments but that was all trying to explain why money was money wasnt easy what good is it she asked over and over the way she asked it made hamnet thyssen wonder himself we make lots of different kinds of things youve seen that ulric said after several false starts he got a cautious nod from marcovefa thus encouraged he went on we find it easier to give coins for things than to trade things all the time it makes dealing simpler how did you decide to do that she asked now he shrugged i dont know i do know weve been doing it for a long time everybody down here does it that makes it work you have strange customs marcovefa said seriously a raumsdalian talking about the ways of the folk who lived up on the glacier would have used the exact same tone of voice up on the glacier it was impossible to be rich there wasnt enough for anyone to get a surplus having enough wasnt easy trading with one another and with the empire bizogots could get rich trasamund had been before his clan fell on hard times but it wasnt easy for that matter it wasnt easy in the empire but it was easier because there were more goods to move around and because there was money to make the moving easier was that good or bad hamnet had never wondered before it was what raumsdalia and every other civilized land had and what the bizogots and other barbarians aspired to if the clans atop the glacier had lost it that was only because theyd lost so many other things as well everyone has strange customs to people who dont have the same ones he said and waited to see if the shaman would need ulric to translate for her her nod said she followed on her own audun gilli emptied his mug of ale yawned and went upstairs several bizogots had already drunk themselves sleepy ulric skakki grinned they havent got the head for real drinking he said seems that way hamnet agreed glad he was drinking ale instead of smetyn who says trasamund demanded and shouted for a fresh mug ulric also waved for a refill so did hamnet drink yourselves foolish if you please but im going upstairs liv set down her mug and did just that after hamnet thyssen had more ale in front of him he found he didnt feel like getting getting blind drunk just to make a point he knew what he could hold and so did ulric and trasamund the people he would have been most interested in impressing he drained the mug in a hurry no point in letting it go to waste after all then pushed back his stool and stood up im going upstairs too he said his friends jeered at him hed known they would so he had no trouble ignoring them the room spun a little as he walked to the stairs yes hed already had plenty he climbed the steps with exaggerated care and quiet at the top of the stairs he stopped dead there stood liv and audun gilli kissing in the hallway xiv sometimes when you were wounded you didnt feel the pain for the first few heartbeats sometimes it pierced you right away when hamnet thyssen heard a noise like a dire wolfs growl he needed that handful of heartbeats to realize it came from his own throat the other two also needed a moment to hear it through their more enjoyable distraction it reached audun before liv he sprang away from her with a gasp of horror i can explain he gabbled you have to understand understand what hamnet said still growling understand how many pieces im going to cut you into his hand already lay on the hilt of his sword though he didnt remember telling it to go there dont be foolish hamnet liv said its over you know it is its been over for a while now you know that too he did know it even if he hadnt wanted to look at it that made things worse not better it cant be he said hed lost gudrid how could he stand losing another woman i loved you you loved me he wished that hadnt come out in the past tense maybe his mouth was wiser than his brain liv nodded i did for a while but when you started herding me the way dogs herd musk oxen when you started wondering whether i was faithful every time i breathed you caused what you wanted to cure killing audun wont get me back even if you can its too late for that i ought to kill you too he ground out he should have done that with gudrid then she wouldnt have been able to torment him all these years after they broke apart would liv do the same would she revel in it the way gudrid had you can try she said but what good would it do it wont bring me back to you nothing can do that now what we had was good while it lasted why not remember it that way hamnet started to say that killing her and audun would make him feel better but he wasnt even sure that was true it might make him feel better for a little while but he knew he would be sorry afterwards if he did it he couldnt tell them he hoped they would be happy together he didnt he didnt see much point in telling them he hoped they would be unhappy together they could figure that out for themselves and so he pushed past them without a word audun gilli shrank from him liv didnt she had as much courage as any bizogot she looked as if she wanted to say something but she didnt do that either after their first spell of intoxication with each other neither of them had been able to find enough to say to each other that was part of the trouble though hamnet didnt realize it when he walked into the mean little room hed thought he would share with liv he found shed already taken her meager belongings out he said something that should have made the roof cave in and the walls collapse everything stayed up though and the bed didnt collapse when he threw himself down on it even if the frame did groan after losing gudrid hed wept for days weeks in fact he wept now too but even he knew the tears were more drunken selfpity than anything else gudrid had had a hold on him that liv couldnt match knowing he would probably be all right before too long made him all the more mournful one good thing audun gillis chamber lay halfway down the hall if hed had to listen to the mattress in the next room creaking rhythmically he really might have drawn his sword and done his best to slaughter the wizard and the shaman instead he fell asleep with his boots still on sprawled out across the bed after that he didnt hear a thing when he came downstairs the next morning some of the bizogots were already eating breakfast so was ulric skakki he sat next to trasamund both of them cautiously spooned up porridge of rye and oats and sipped from mugs of beer by their sallow skins and redtracked eyes they hoped the beer would soothe aching heads by the way the corners of their mouths turned down it hadnt done the job yet trasamund stared at count hamnet by god man what ails you the jarl burst out you went to bed long before we did but you look worse than either one of us ulric by contrast had a way of cutting to the chase he did it now with two words he knows hamnet scowled at him how long had they known how long had everybody known how long had people been laughing at him behind his back hadnt he had enough of that with gudrid evidently not whatll it be friend the tapman sounded cheerful why not he hadnt just lost his woman beer hamnet said porridge even if part of him wished he were dead his belly craved ballast sorry thyssen ulric said when hamnet sat down across from him it happens thats all itll probably happen with me and arnora before long yes but hamnet began and then stopped but what ulric asked his voice deceptively mild but you and arnora arent in love no we just screw each other silly which isnt bad either but you and liv arent in love any more either if you ever were ulric said i still love her hamnet cried which has nothing to do with what i said ulric was most dangerous when he was most accurate you may love liv but its pretty plain she doesnt love you right now and if she doesnt you two arent in love no matter how much you may wish you were or will you tell me im wrong count hamnet wanted to he knew too well he couldnt no he mumbled a serving girl who might have been the tapmans daughter brought him his breakfast dig in ulric said cheerfully you may as well and hamnet did the porridge had onions and bits of smoked sausage in it no matter how the rest of him felt his belly was happy arnora came down a few minutes later instead of sitting by ulric she made a point of plopping herself down at a far table and scowling at him he grinned back which only seemed to annoy her more then liv and audun gilli came down together they were holding hands liv looked pleased with herself the wizard looked happy and frightened at the same time hamnets glower said he wished they would both catch fire liv shook her head and audun flinched but they stayed unscorched they did have the courtesy to sit where hamnet couldnt see them without twisting to do it that helped a little but only a little every time he heard livs voice he felt vitriol dripping down his back ulric skakki waved to the serving girl and pointed at hamnet bring this man another mug of beer are you sure thats a good idea trasamund asked im not sure of anything ulric answered but i think one more will numb him three or four more well three or four more wouldnt be a good idea right now the girl set the mug in front of count hamnet he drained it ulric was a nice judge of such things no doubt from experience the beer built a wall a low wall but a wall between him and what he was feeling a few more though and he wouldnt have cared what he did marcovefa was one of the last travelers to come down to the taproom when she did she noticed right away how people were sitting the clans atop the glacier must have had their quarrels and squabbles and scandals too people were people no matter where and how they lived they would fall in love with one another they would fall out of love with one another too marcovefa sat down by hamnet i am sorry she said in the ordinary bizogot tongue it happens he looked at her through her really go away he said she looked back no then keep quiet and leave me alone she said something to ulric skakki in her own dialect hamnet could follow just enough of it to know it wasnt complimentary to him he ignored it he made a point of ignoring it he made such a point of ignoring it in fact that marcovefa thought it was funny the only response he could find was to keep on ignoring her she thought that was even funnier when they rode out of malmo count hamnet got fresh salt rubbed in his wounds after gudrid finally left him she went off to nidaros and he hardly saw her till she came with eyvind torfinn on the journey up beyond the glacier he brooded that she was gone brooded and brooded and brooded but at least he didnt have to watch her with whatever lovers shed had before latching on to the scholarly earl but he couldnt get away from liv there she was not far away talking animatedly with audun gilli her face glowing the way it had not long before when she talked with him even when he rode too far away to make out what she was saying he could hear the lilt in her voice she talked to audun the way a woman talked to a lover who pleased her hamnet knew the tone too well to mistake it now that she used it with someone else he ground his teeth till his jaw hurt he wished a shortfaced bear or a lion would spring out of the woods and devour audun gilli slowly he thought so l can savor his screams once the wizard was gone he reasoned liv would come back to him that she might have other choices didnt occur to him which showed his reasoning wasnt all it might have been they rode on through the empires northern forests the deeper they got the more marcovefa and the bizogots whod never before come down off the steppe marveled that marveling wasnt always of a happy sort they seemed to feel the trees pressing in on them more than ever to hamnet it was only a forest not the same kind as grew by his castle farther south but close enough the jays here had dark heads and blue bellies not blue heads and white bellies but their screeches werent much different from those of any other jays sedranc the next town farther south was larger and more prosperous than malmo as marcovefa had before she ate barley bread and oatcakes in sedranc though she really seemed to notice what she was eating and how unlike anything shed known atop the glacier it was what is this she asked how do they make it she sounded almost as wary as a raumsdalian at one of her folks cannibal feasts some of the bizogots also seemed curious no crops grew on their plains either they gathered berries and roots and leaves but they knew nothing of grain explaining how raumsdalian farmers raised their crops and harvested them how the seeds were ground into flour and the flour baked took quite awhile a lot of work marcovefa delivered her verdict too much work maybe lots of food count hamnet said more than we could get from hunting and picking berries that food lets us have towns lets us be civilized he thought the two amounted to the same thing what good is a town asked the shaman from atop the glacier why have this place why not wander she wasnt being sardonic or hamnet didnt think so to let us have beds to let us have bathtubs to let us build houses the breath of god has trouble blowing away he replied to let us buy and sell and trade ulric skakki added money marcovefa used the raumsdalian word as if it were a curse money it sounded different in ulrics mouth to stay safe behind the wall audun gilli said he was right too hamnet thyssen glared at him anyway wall is not so much either marcovefa said what would you do different how would you do better if hamnet argued with her if he argued with anyone but audun he wouldnt have to dwell on his own misery for the first time a question seemed to give her pause i dont know she said at last something not like this though these are just country towns and backcountry towns at that ulric skakki said in the ordinary bizogot tongue then he had to go back and forth with marcovefa no doubt explaining what a backcountry town was and why it wasnt so much of a much when he dropped back into speech hamnet could understand he added plenty of places farther south much finer than this its true liv said when i first came down to raumsdalia i thought each place was the finest one id ever seen then the next one down the road would be grander still hamnet remembered that remembered it with heartbreaking clarity shed shared her amazement and delight with him only the autumn before now if she still had them shed share them with audun gilli hearing her voice stabbed hamnet in the memory and what wounds hurt worse than that hed felt the same way about gudrid last year shed gone out of her way to bait him too which liv didnt seem to be doing a small mercy but a mercy even so and yet when a shortfaced bear burst out of the forest killed gudrids horse and menaced her hed ridden to her rescue without a thought in his head except driving the bear away or killing it even at the time hed wondered why did he hope shed be grateful if he did she disappointed him yet again what would he do if a shortfaced bear came after liv now he was lucky if it was luck he didnt have to find out the forests northern edge was clearcut there was a line past which trees simply could not grow its southern border was more ambiguous men could farm on southfacing slopes even in the midst of the trees in good years in warm years in years when the breath of god didnt blow too hard theyd bring in a crop chances were they could bring in enough to last out one bad year two long hard winters in a row though and they would start to starve more farmers seemed to be trying to carve out steadings up here than had been true before count hamnets beard started going gray more seemed to be making a go of it too in his grandfathers day the forests lower edge lay miles to the south go back enough generations and it hadnt been forest here at all but frozen steppe go back further than that and the glacier had ground forward and back and who could say what it ground into oblivion only a few legends and maybe the golden shrine survived from those days if i found the golden shrine could i make liv love me again hamnet wondered god could i make gudrid love me again could i make myself not care if i couldnt make either one of them love me again without love poppy juice for the soul seemed plenty good he looked around as if he would find the golden shrine in the middle of this frontier district that would have been funny if it werent so sad he hadnt found the golden shrine even beyond the glacier what chance of stumbling over it in these mundane surroundings did he have none and he knew it what chance do i have he wondered bitterly the question was hard enough to answer all by itself he looked back over his shoulder back past the forest back towards the bizogot steppe he wondered why he cared so much about beating the rulers what did he care if they smashed the bizogots and hurled raumsdaliadown in ruins part of the answer to that seemed plain enough if the rulers smashed the empire he was all too likely to get caught and killed in the collapse even if he didnt he would have to bend the knee to the invaders from beyond the glacier every fiber in his being rebelled against that better to fight them for for what for the love of a woman gudrid lay in eyvind torfinns arms and in any other arms she happened to fancy and now liv had thrown hamnet over too and for whom for a wizard lost in the real world why care whether he lived or died himself let alone the bizogots or the raumsdalian empire another question easier to ask than answer big sharpnosed roughcoated dogs that looked to be at least half dire wolf ran snarling at the travelers from a farm cabin near the woods almost without thinking hamnet strung his bow and let fly the arrow caught a wolfdog in the flank its snarls turned to yelps of pain it ran off faster than it had come forward the other beasts hearing their friend wounded seemed to think twice what did you go and do that for the farmer shook his fist at count hamnet hes a good dog good dogs dont act like they want to tear my throat out hamnet answered he nocked another shaft if he had to shoot again it might not be at a dog but the farmer no matter what he thought had better sense than to pick a fight with a band of thirty or so bizogots and raumsdalians he went back to weeding each stroke of the hoe against some poor defenseless plant said what he would have done to hamnet thyssen if only he were a hero hamnet glanced up at the sky it was blue a watery blue but blue a few puffy clouds sailed across from west to east no sign of dark clouds threatening clouds riding the breath of god down from the north but if the wind changed when the wind changed it could happen any day any time hamnet thyssen knew that well the farmer had to know it too to hamnet it was a fact of life to the farmer it was a matter of life and death which brought hamnet back to the question hed asked himself before why did he want to hold on to the one and hold off the other he looked over at liv who was chatting happily with audun gilli yes why indeed once they came out of the forest and down into country where crops would grow most years marcovefa started marveling all over again at the richness of the landscape boats with sails astonished and delighted her as the mere idea of them had delighted liv a year before hamnet thyssen wished he hadnt had the earlier memory it meant he took no pleasure from the shamans discovery what happens in winter marcovefa asked about what youd think the rivers and lakes freeze they haul the boats out of the water hamnet illustrated with gestures marcovefa followed well enough they were well to the west of nidaros and had to work their way southeast hamnet didnt think local officials in this part of the empire were warned against them he didnt see any couriers hotfooting it off to the capital to say hed presumed to come back when he remarked on that to ulric skakki the adventurer shrugged and said well no but if these people have any idea what theyre doing you wouldnt see it theyd make sure of that if they knew what they were doing they wouldnt be here count hamnet said theyd be in the capital or somewhere else that mattered most of the time youd be right now ulric was the one looking north if the rulers come down no when the rulers come down it wont be like an ordinary bizogot raid though the bizogots likely wouldnt get this far anyway i dont know if the rulers can either i dont know but they might yes they might hamnet thyssens scowl covered the invaders and the empire impartially i dont even know if i care you need to spend some silver ulric skakki said seriously the quick change of subject confused hamnet what are you talking about you need to spend some silver ulric repeated go to a whorehouse or pick a pretty serving girl whos easy god knows there are enough of them once you lay her or she sucks your prong or whatever you happen to want you wont hate the whole cursed world hamnet shook his head it wouldnt mean anything a pretty girls got you in her mouth it doesnt have to mean anything ulric said it feels good nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with it while its going on count hamnet said gloomily but afterwards you know she only wanted money and shed spit in your eye if you didnt pay her if she doesnt care about you to begin with why bother because it feels good ulric suggested with exaggerated patience not reason enough hamnet said ulric threw his hands in the air they came to the town of burtrask just as the sun was setting burtrask had outgrown its wall suburbs flourished outside the gray stone works the gate guards hardly bothered to question the newcomers burtrask was used to prosperity and seemed to have not a care in the world touts just inside the gate bawled out the virtues of competing serais others bawled out the vices of competing bawdy houses count hamnet felt ulrics ironic eye on him he didnt give the adventurer the satisfaction of looking back ulrics chuckle said he knew exactly what hamnet wasnt doing and why hamnet went right on ignoring him the seraikeeper they chose seemed surprised to have so many people descend on him at once but he didnt let it faze him well have to set out pallets in the taproom for some of you im afraid he said well keep the fire going all night no need to worry about that i dont believe in freezing my guests neither do the girls down the street the brothel stood a few doors away that was also true of the other serais in burtrask they knew what travelers wanted most travelers anyhow thunk thunk a hatchet came down on the necks of chickens and ducks out back no doubt supper would be fresh a couple of servants rolled barrels of beer into the taproom everybody in the empires northern provinces knew how bizogots could drink food and drink did make count hamnet feel better but not enough he bedded down on the taproom floor himself ulric skakki and arnora stayed together and trasamund had found a friendly serving girl without needing any suggestion from ulric strangers coming in for breakfast woke hamnet not long after sunup the seraikeeper with work to do didnt bother keeping quiet he rattled pots and pans and thumped mugs down on the counter anyone who didnt like it his attitude declared was a lazy slugabed who should have paid for a room far from the racket that his serai didnt have rooms enough for all his guests bothered him not a bit as hamnet sat up and yawned one of the men whod come in for breakfast walked over to him a nondescript fellow not too tall or too short not too fat or too thin not too young or too old with features altogether unmemorable except for gray eyes of uncommon alertness you are count hamnet thyssen he said it was not a question count hamnet got to his feet here we go he thought as he belted on his sword which had lain beside him thats right he said aloud im afraid you have the advantage of me sir that sounded politer than who the demon are you even if it meant the same thing im kormak bersi the man replied a name as ordinary as his looks i have the honor to serve his majesty that was a polite phrase too it meant im an agent though it sounded nicer well what raumsdalian doesnt hamnet said he pointed to the oatcakes and mug of beer kormak was carrying do you mind if i get myself some breakfast too then we can talk if talk is what youve got in mind by all means your grace feed yourself kormak said and talk is the only thing i have in mind believe me im a peaceable man thats nice hamnet said but whenever somebody says believe me i usually take it as a sign i shouldnt i hope that doesnt offend you too much kormak bersis smile didnt reach his eyes not too much your grace he had a blade on his hip and looked to be in good shape count hamnet thought he could take him if he had to but didnt want it to come to blood he stepped over a couple of bizogots who kept snoring away despite the noise and got a breakfast like the one the emperors man had bought kormak sat down at a small table will this do as well as anywhere hamnet perched on a stool across from him well whats on your mind he tore off a chunk of oatcake put it in his mouth and deliberately began to chew kormak also ate and drank a little before answering then steepling his fingers in front of him he said a bit of a surprise discovering you back in raumsdalia life is full of surprises hamnet said stolidly he had to fight a scowl as he raised his mug to his lips the surprises hed got lately werent pleasant ones what do you suppose sigvat ii will think of your return kormak bersi asked as if it mattered no more than the price of a jug of wine i hope hell think i wouldnt come back unless it was important hamnet replied you know about the rulers im familiar with what you said last year kormak answered which was no surprise at all and some ah wild rumors have also come down from the bizogot country more recently ill bet they have most of what youve heard is less than whats really going on oh how do you know what ive heard have you heard that the rulers have already conquered most of the steppe hamnet demanded have you heard theyve smashed the leaping lynxes theyre that far south and getting closer i dont believe it kormak bersi exclaimed youre making that up so you can watch me jump and shout like a man a wasp just stung by god servant of his majesty hamnet laced what should have been a proud title with scorn i am not some of these bizogots lying here in the taproom are leaping lynxes theyre whats left of the leaping lynxes now or whats left thats still free he switched to the bizogot tongue marcomer are you awake there afraid i am marcomer answered glumly why what do you want whos that sourlooking fellow with you i dont know enough raumsdalian to follow the two of you going back and forth jabber jabber jabber his names kormak bersi or thats what he says anyway hamnet replied drawing a glare from kormak and proving the imperial agent understood the bizogots language hamnet went on he serves sigvat ii he doesnt believe youre from the leaping lynxes he doesnt believe what happened to them either well hes a bloody fool if he doesnt marcomer said ambling over to join them watch your mouth you kormak not only understood the bizogot tongue he spoke it well and arrogantly oh go bugger a weasel marcomer said what the demon do you think you can do to me that the godcursed rulers havent already done what did they do kormak bersi demanded so far ive heard nothing but noise what really happened most of the noise is your own jaws flapping seems like raumsdalians like to hear themselves talk dont they the bizogot said if he was trying to annoy kormak even more he succeeded in fact he succeeded even if he wasnt trying but while the imperial agent steamed marcomer told him of riding back to the stone huts at the eastern edge of sudertorp lake and discovering that the rulers had got there ahead of him he told of rescuing a tiny fragment of his clan and then riding after the band trasamund led and he finished here we are in the empire if you think the rulers are very far behind us youre even stupider than i give you credit for kormak bersi didnt seem any angrier which proved hed got caught up in marcomers tale his majesty must hear of this and quickly the imperial agent said our officers up in the forest need to know of it too if they dont know already it isnt because we havent spread the word hamnet thyssen said of course they may not want to listen we cant do anything about that when do raumsdalians ever listen to bizogots marcomer sounded more resigned than bitter im no bizogot count hamnet reminded him neither is ulric skakki and neither is audun gilli the last name tasted like bad fish in his mouth he spat it out as fast as he could and wiped his lips with the back of his sleeve afterwards if what i hear is true kormak bersi began and then stopped in alarm for marcomers growl sound much like an angry dire wolfs the raumsdalian agent had nerve for after gathering himself he repeated if this is true it changes the nature of the orders i have what kind of orders are those hamnet asked lock me up lose the key and god forbid you should pay attention to anything that comes out of my mouth something like that kormak could sound almost as dry as ulric skakki but i may have to think twice that would be nice most people have trouble enough thinking once count hamnet said your precious emperor must if he doesnt believe the things hes heard about the rulers marcomer said kormak looked at him looked through him really you will find it a good policy not to speak ill of his majesty he said his voice as chilly as if blown on the breath of god why if somebodys an idiot hows he going to find out hes an idiot unless somebody else tells him so bizogots didnt waste a lot of respect on their clan chiefs to marcomer sigvat ii was nothing but a jarl writ large to kormak bersi the idea that the emperor might be an idiot wasnt far from blasphemous his majesty is not an idiot he said stiffly his majesty cannot be an idiot why not now marcomer sounded honestly puzzled isnt that like saying he cant shit everybodys an idiot now and again on one thing or another over women usually or over men if youre a woman but other stuff too his majesty is not an idiot kormak repeated in tones more gelid than ever anyone who says otherwise will be very very sorry by marcomers expression he thought the threat was idiotic too hamnet thyssen kicked him under the table to keep him from saying so hamnet also thought the threat was idiotic or at least juvenile but he knew the agent could enforce it marcomer glowered but for a wonder took the hint ulric skakki came down then looking indecently and that was probably just the right word pleased with himself he stopped and grinned well well kormak bersi as i live and breathe hullo skakki kormak answered have you really been daft enough to hook up with these fools and renegades i heard it but i didnt want to believe it you may as well because its true ulrics grin got wider and more engaging and if you knew him the way hamnet did less reliable life would be dull if you did the same old things over and over besides theres real trouble loose up there no matter what his majesty thinks or even if he thinks dont you start kormak exclaimed ulric looked more innocent than ever who me what did i do you imagined that the emperor might not be perfect hamnet said now bersi here has to decide whether to roast you over a slow fire or just cut off your head well if he does cut it off i cant very well tell him the rulers are on the way down to cut off his majestys ulric said youd think that was something people would want to know but maybe not his shrug was a small masterpiece of its kind so you people plan on going to nidaros and telling the emperor hes been wrong all along kormak said youd think he could see it for himself but somebodys got to tell him if he cant ulric replied since nobody else seems to want to well do it id better come with you the imperial agent said why not the more the merrier ulric nodded to count hamnet isnt that right your grace how could i be any merrier hamnet replied its only my face that doesnt know it kormak bersi gave him a tired and dutiful smile marcovefa came downstairs just then and kormak forgot about everything but her his focus was so quick and so intent hamnet wondered if he was something of a wizard himself enough to sense that she was one at any rate where are you from he asked her in the bizogot language on top of the glacier she answered what about you me from nidaros kormak looked surprised that hed told her are you really from atop the glacier does that mean the stories these rogues were telling are true i dont know their stories marcovefa said but why would they lie plenty of reasons kormak bersi sounded sure of that how did you live up there on top of everything marcovefa shrugged as best i could we did not know we had little no one else up there has more only when i come down here do i see there is more to have what dont you have kormak asked up there i mean bread meat from beast larger than fox hide from beast larger than fox marcovefa didnt mention meat from men which was bound to be just as well she went on smetyn beer these are great wonders by the way the agent smiled he didnt think so he took them all for granted as hamnet had before he saw how the clans atop the glacier lived what do you think of the sorcery youve seen down here marcovefa snapped her fingers about that much you are puny shamans you have so many things you do not trouble with wizardry the way you should that rocked kormak bersi back on his heels he must have expected her to praise it to the skies what will you do now that youre down here among civilized people he asked dont know knock some sense into you maybe marcovefa replied kormak cast about for another question he seemed to have trouble finding one that wouldnt land him in trouble at last he said would you like to see nidaros would you like to meet the emperor nidaros yes big buildings we have no big buildings you must be clever to make them so they dont fall down marcovefa said then she shrugged your clan chief who cares i have met plenty of clan chiefs man like other men yes his majesty sigvat ii emperor of raumsdalia is no clan chief kormak bersi said haughtily thats true most clan chiefs have better sense ulric skakki said not you too kormaks scowl said he might have expected such things from hamnet thyssen but not from ulric yes me too ulric said what am i supposed to think when the emperors flatout wrong and doesnt want to set things right anything you say will be remembered kormak warned that would be nice hamnet said the agent stared at him he explained up till now everyones forgotten what weve said otherwise somebody would have paid a little attention to it i can hope so anyhow you arent helping yourself kormak bersi said take us to nidaros tell the emperor how naughty weve been count hamnet said my guess is he already knows xv kormak bersi rode out of burtrask with the travelers are you our nursemaid our shepherd or our jailer count hamnet asked him not your jailer the agent answered plenty of others to tend to that if youre lucky i may keep you out of their clutches and if we arent hamnet persisted if you arent i may not there didnt seem to be much to say to that so hamnet thyssen didnt try short of murder they werent going to shake kormak and murder seemed pointless when he went at least halfway towards believing them plenty of others in the empire from sigvat ii on down didnt was riding on towards nidaros pointless then hamnet could only hope it wasnt and wouldnt be as if to remind him of why he was taking the chance of returning raumsdalia spread itself out to best advantage before him the weather stayed fine and mild fields of barley and rye ripened under that watery but steady sunshine horses and cattle and sheep grazed on the meadows when the raumsdalians and bizogots rode through woods red and gray squirrels frisked through the trees above chattering and scolding as the horses clopped past with their soft fur large eyes and clever handlike paws squirrels charmed the bizogots ulric skakki who knew them better liked them less nothing but rats with fluffy tails he sneered and people are nothing but dire wolves who comb their hair hamnet said oh i dont know ulric said wed go to war less often if we could lick our own privates they eyed each other hamnet wondered which of them was more cynical by the look on ulrics face the adventurer was wondering the same thing better that better admiring the scenery than brooding about what would happen when he came to nidaros the emperors displeasure awaited him there so did gudrids thinking of her made him think of liv hed hoped he would never think of the two of them together but like gudrid liv was proving herself happier with someone else than with him how gudrid would laugh when she found out about that shed bedded audun gilli too before setting out from nidaros hamnet wondered why probably so as not to leave anyone out thinking about sigvat or gudrid or liv hurt yes better to watch squirrels in the pines and beeches and maples better to watch wind rippling through growing grain better to watch beasts fattening on long green grass than to think of his own personal and political follies hed just ridden out of a stretch of woods when he spotted vultures and teratorns and ravens spiraling down out of the sky ahead well well he said is that a sabertooths work or dire wolves or bandits all we have to do is ride on and well find out one way or another ulric skakki said let it be bandits trasamund rumbled my sword has rested too long in its sheath it grows thirsty he reached back over his shoulder to stroke the hilt of the great twohanded blade fighting is too important to make a sport of it ulric said count hamnet was inclined to agree trasamund shook his head what better sport than scattering your enemies before you he said what happens when they scatter you instead ulric returned wheres the rest of your clan jarl of the three tusk bizogots trasamund gave him a horrible look one that proved looks couldnt kill for ulric stayed upright and smiling his usual mocking smile in return trasamund started to reach for the sword again but arrested the gesture before his hand reached it ulric skakki hadnt told him anything but the truth of course the truth often hurt worse than any lies hamnet thyssen knew that too well and if he hadnt one look at liv riding alongside of audun gilli would have flayed the lesson into him forever instead of looking at her he grimly stared straight ahead after he rode to the top of a low rise he could see what the carrion birds were waiting for a sabertooth had pulled down a cow in a meadow and was tearing great chunks of flesh from the carcass the big cats short stumpy tail quivered in delight as it ate the rest of the cattle in the herd had run off they were starting to graze again a couple of bowshots away every so often their heads would rise they knew where the sabertooth was all right but they also knew the killer wasnt likely to go after them now that it had other meat and what it didnt eat the birds would they waited in an expectant ring around the cat and the carcass a raven hopped up and grabbed a gobbet of meat two more ravens tried to steal the dainty the first one flew off croaking angrily one of the others chased it the second seemed to decide its chances were better by the dead cow the sabertooth had ignored the thieving raven maybe it wasnt big enough to seem a competitor teratorns were another story a bird with a body bigger than a turkeys and a wingspan as wide as three or four tall men more to the point a bird that size with a hooked beak in proportion was enough to draw even a sabertooths notice this one lashed out with a mittensized front paw warning the teratorn back the oversized vulture squawked irately and retreated teratorns had a name for being stupid but this one wasnt dumb enough to take on a sabertooth and the sabertooth wasnt dumb enough to take on three dozen people on horseback its short tail quivered again this time in fury as they approached it roared baring its formidable teeth when it saw it couldnt scare them off it slunk away its short hind legs gave it a peculiar gait different from any other big cats as soon as the sabertooth scuttled off towards the woods the teratorns and lesser vultures and ravens and a couple of opportunistic foxes swarmed over the dead cow there was plenty of meat for all of them but they snapped and screeched at one another just the same eyeing them with wry distaste ulric skakki asked remind you of anything youve seen before what you mean nidaros count hamnet replied and ulric nodded hamnet went on i think they have better manners here kormak bersi looked from one of them to the other hamnet had the feeling he was remembering everything they said and he would use it against them when they got to the capital how can i land in worse trouble though he wondered and smiled a little being in bad odor at the court had advantages he hadnt suspected as the travelers made their long crablike progress towards nidaros hamnet thyssen wondered what news was coming straight to the imperial city from the bizogot plains were couriers pounding down from some border post farther east with news that the rulers had shattered the leaping lynxes did they have word that the rulers were closer to the tree line than that were the rulers already over the border themselves if sigvat ii got news like that what would he think would he decide hed been hasty when he looked down his nose at hamnet and his warnings would he set raumsdalia in motion to fight the danger pressing down from the north would he care at all or would he be so busy with his pleasures in the capital that it wouldnt matter a bit to him one way or the other hamnet thought ill find out pretty soon one thing didnt happen they didnt pass couriers galloping out from nidaros with orders for the imperial armies to assemble maybe that was a good sign maybe it meant the rulers werent close to the border or maybe it meant that sigvat wasnt going to worry about them even if they were again count hamnet had the feeling hed know the answer before long the scarred badlands that stretched out west from what had been hevring lake slowed the journey to the capital shrubs and clumps of grass sprouted here and there birds and rabbits and other small game prowled the pocked landscape the road had to make its way around and through all the scabby ravines and canyons often doubling back on itself like a snake with a twisted spine no farmers worked that land it was far too rough to be broken to the plow some of the handful of people who did live there were hunters others were men and women who hoped everyone outside the badlands had forgotten they were alive ulric skakki raised a sardonic eyebrow in hamnet thyssens direction always good to get a look at your future home isnt it i wont end up here by god hamnet said on the gibbet maybe but not here ulric said hamnet only shrugged the gibbet would be better what makes land like this marcovefa asked we didnt see any other land how do you say it torn up like this before as best he could hamnet thyssen explained about how the flood that burst from hevring lake when its dam of dirt and ice finally failed scarred the land over which it poured sudertorp lake farther north has the same kind of cork in the jug you saw that he added one day it will open up too and pour across the bizogot country when everything is done up there more badlands will stretch out to the west she thought about that then nodded could happen she agreed yes could happen did magic make this uh dam go down no hamnet pointed north once a couple of thousand years ago this was the edge of the glacier yes all the way down here but it moved back the weather got warmer and the ice in the dam melted through sometimes big things happen all by themselves maybe marcovefa sounded more as if she were humoring him than as if she believed it they saw nidaros smoke rising into the sky days before they came to the capital people lots of people marcovefa said pointing towards the dark smudge and she was right any town let travelers know it was there well before they came to its walls because of the smoke that poured from hearths and cookfires and torches and lamps and all the other useful flames men and women kindled an experienced traveler could gauge the size of a town from the smoke plume it sent up the shaman from atop the glacier was anything but an experienced traveler but she saw that this smoke rose up from anything but an ordinary town are you glad to be coming home kormak bersi asked count hamnet the raumsdalian noble didnt laugh in the agents face which to his mind only proved his restraint this is not my home i wouldnt be glad to come here even if i werent in hot water with the emperor he answered my home such as it is is a castle in the southeast not far from where the woods begin i wouldnt mind going there and forgetting about everything else but i dont think everything else will forget about me sooner or later likely sooner the rulers would end up besieging the place and i doubt i could fight off the whoresons with my own retainers kormak stared at him you think those barbarous savages can beat our glorious soldiers for shame for one thing our glorious soldiers have never fought lancers on mammothback hamnet thyssen said for another im not really worried about our glorious soldiers im worried about the rulers wizards ask he ran down with a growl deep in his throat hed started to say ask audun gilli ask liv now he didnt even want to think about talking to them though he knew he would have to growling still he went on bizogot shamans couldnt beat them couldnt come close and neither could our wizard he pointed towards audun he wasnt aiming an arrow at the man whod stolen liv from him it only felt that way i dont think much of the kind of magic bizogots can muster kormak sounded smug and patronizing raumsdalians often looked down their noses at their northern neighbors they often had good reason to look down their noses at them too here their shamans are good enough and they work magic the same way we do ive heard that from the shamans and from our sorcerers hamnet said the rulers dont they have their own way not surprising not when theyve been separate from us since the last time the glacier came down whenever that was kormak bersi surprised him by saying since the days when we could go to the golden shrine yes thats right since those days or maybe even longer who knows where their ancestors were back then hamnet said but that doesnt matter what matters is their sorcerers are stronger than ours kormak looked anything but convinced he had no reason to believe hamnet hed never faced the invaders wizardry before he could say anything marcovefa asked what are you going on about she was getting ever more fluent in the ordinary bizogot tongue but raumsdalian remained a closed codex to her except when her sense of understanding spilled out like hevring lake after the dam broke down that didnt seem to be happening now about the rulers shamans hamnet thyssen answered in the bizogot language many a raumsdalian noblewoman would have envied marcovefas sniff oh them theyre not so much she said maybe not to you hamnet said theyre better than anything we have theyve proved that even if we wish they hadnt too many things marcovefa said impatiently you these bizogots too many things she freighted the word with scorn you have so many things you dont pay enough attention to your shamanry the rulers have as many things as the bizogots hamnet pointed out marcovefa only sniffed again they dont pay enough attention to their shamanry either maybe a little more than these bizogots a little more than you raumsdalians but not enough not close to enough up where i come from they would be nothing nothing she snapped her fingers to show how much of a nothing they would be no one in his right mind wanted to go up where she came from the clans atop the glacier had no easy time climbing down either did their poverty in all material things really make them such formidable wizards hamnet hadnt seen that when he was up there himself but he hadnt looked for it either down here marcovefa did seem uncommonly accomplished did that mean she was a powerful shaman or that she came from a powerful school of sorcery hamnet didnt know and he wasnt convinced she did either maybe youll just have to beat them all singlehanded he said she looked at him then back up towards the north maybe i will the badlands ended as abruptly as theyd begun all at once the winding road ran straight and true towards nidaros western gate what had been the muddy bottom of hevring lake was now some of the richest cropland in the raumsdalian empire the travelers rode past orchards and fields and meadows finer than any theyd seen to the north and west the farmers reacted to the sight of so many bizogots on the road by hiding their livestock and shutting up their houses they were brave and stupid at the same time if these bizogots really were invaders only fleeing might have saved the locals it would be funny if it werent so sad trasamund said they havent seen raiders in a long time and they dont know what to do any more god help them when they have to find out first time ive heard you sound like you care about raumsdalians ulric skakki drawled the bizogot jarl screwed up his face then let his anger go in a long loud sigh i care about anybody the rulers hurt he said will you tell me i havent earned the right not even ulric had the crust to claim he hadnt all the bizogots and marcovefa exclaimed at the quality of the serai where they stayed that night the roast pork was better than most but the serai itself was nothing out of the ordinary to anyone whod seen nidaros itself and what the hostels there boasted hamnet found his bed wide and soft and inviting far too much for someone sleeping in it by himself he tossed and turned all night ulric and arnora had the room next door the walls werent thick enough to mute their screaming row or the way they made up afterwards hamnet thyssen plopped his pillow over his head it didnt block out the sounds of lovemaking which did nothing to help him drop off he came downstairs the next morning pouchyeyed and grumpy beer and bacon made a good breakfast but couldnt get him moving very fast that liv and audun gilli came down right after him only made things worse they sat at a table halfway across the taproom they werent trying to torment him as gudrid would have but his eyes kept sliding towards them audun faced him the wizard was smiling and happy and voluble hamnet knew the feeling hed enjoyed it himself not long before he could see only the back of livs head the way she held it made him sure she was happy too maybe he was imagining things but he didnt think so ulric skakki walked in and sat across from hamnet that kept him from seeing liv unless he peered around the adventurer which was probably part of what ulric had in mind it didnt help much though he didnt need to see liv with his bodys eyes to see her inside his mind to try to blot out that bright shining image he glowered at ulric and said youre bloody noisy you know that not all my fault ulric said arnora gets her share of the blame more than her share to tell you the truth she enjoys quarreling over nothing and i dont cursed walls are thin count hamnet said sipping from his mug by now i know just about everything she enjoys and you too i told you you needed to get laid ulric said with what sounded like exaggerated patience all that stuff is turning sour inside of you it cant be healthy youll end up like one of those bull mastodons in he snapped his fingers looking for a word what the demon do they call it musth hamnet answered thats it ulric agreed a serving girl came over to the table he ordered breakfast then turned back to hamnet thyssen theyd be a lot happier if they found a friendly female and so by god would you theres no such thing as a friendly female hamnet said stonily not if youre looking for something that lasts not always true a lot of the time maybe but not always ulric skakki said besides if all youre trying to do is steer clear of musth you dont care whether it lasts or not you musth believe me my deer fellow he lisped with malice aforethought count hamnet grimaced at the pun and at the sentiment it wouldnt mean anything he insisted it would mean you could sleep at night is that so bad it would take more than that hamnet said that would be a good start ulric looked back towards the stairs to make sure arnora wasnt coming he lowered his voice if you want to take my not quite beloved off my hands i wont say a word ill be glad i dont have to worry about her to tell you the truth and since you say you know what she enjoys no thanks hamnet s ears heated i know what id enjoy too and she isnt it too bad the adventurer eyed him one corner of his mouth canted up in rueful amusement i always remembered you were a hard case but i didnt think youd be quite so hard as this well i am hamnet said not without a certain somber pride all right fine ulric made flapping motions with his arms as if he were trying to get a duck to go where he wanted it to some people are stupid enough to enjoy being miserable i didnt think you were one of those but if you are you are the girl brought him breakfast then he settled in and began to eat he ignored hamnet thyssen altogether or seemed to hamnet grumbled to himself he didnt think he enjoyed being miserable he hated it he would much rather not have been miserable but whod given him a choice not gudrid not liv either that was how it looked to him anyway kormak bersi came down just then he sat down next to ulric and nodded across the table to count hamnet you look cheerful this morning he remarked oh drop dead hamnet snarled some men would have drawn sword on him kormak only turned to ulric and said he sounds as happy as he looks too somewhere down inside i think he is ulric answered only he hasnt told his face about it yet you should go up on stage and tell jokes hamnet thyssen said you could set a bowl at the edge and everybody who laughed would throw money into it youd get rich in nothing flat then you wouldnt need to go adventuring matter of fact ive done that ulric said if you think this is a hard way to make a living you ought to try it and mostly they dont throw money what they do throw he held his nose hamnet had helped jeer bad comics and jugglers off the stage hed never thought about what they were feeling when the audience booed them and flung old vegetables or rotten eggs they were doing the best they could even if it wasnt good enough all at once he understood that much too well when the travelers came to the western gate they had to wait behind carts filled with produce and donkeys carrying baskets of fruit the old lake bottom was nidaros larder these days a peasant woman with a young porker under each arm sassed the gate guards by the way they gave back her cheek theyd been harassing one another a couple of times a week for years a mounted party made up mostly of fiercelooking bizogots was something else again aside from likely being dangerous in their own right the travelers broke routine that was plenty to make the gate guards suspicious all by itself give me your names ordered the fat sloppylooking sergeant in charge of the guards one by one the newcomers did when hamnet thyssen announced himself the sergeant jerked as if a wasp had stung him you cant be here im supposed to arrest you if you show your face around here good luck hamnet said not only did his companions outnumber the guards about four to one each of them was probably worth at least two of these soft timeservers in a fight hes in my custody no arrest needed kormak bersi said the sergeant sent him a fishy stare and who the demon are you kormak bersi told him who and what he was the agent displayed a bronze badge that proved he wasnt lying any more questions he asked his voice ominously mild no sir the sergeant seemed to shrink into himself and to shrink away from kormak he waved the travelers rode into nidaros even trasamund and liv who had been to the imperial capital before stared in wonder for the other bizogots nidaros raised more than wonder it raised slackjawed astonishment and for marcovefa what went beyond astonishment hamnet thyssen had no word for it but he knew it when he saw it so many people she whispered she used her own dialect but he managed to understand it nidaros streets ran from southeast to northwest from northeast to southwest a few ran from east to west none went from north to south if they had they would have given the breath of god a running start houses stood close together so as not to let too much of the wind squeeze between them they all had highpitched roofs that would shed snow all but the poorest had two walls on their northfacing side the space between filled with air that helped blunt the cold doorways without exception faced south people from all over the raumsdalian empire and from beyond crowded the streets some of them looked to be tourists gawking at the tall buildings and at the shoals of mankind of which they made up a part others hawked everything from mammoth ivory to fine swords to sabertooth fangs to tobacco from the far south ulric skakki bought some tobacco first chance he got he charged his pipe lit it with a twig he ignited at a sausagesellers brazier and puffed out happy clouds of smoke marcovefa said i have seen you do that before what good is it i like it ulric answered i dont need any more reason than that she wrinkled her nose it stinks i dont think so ulric said but even if it does so what by god plenty of other stinks in a city the size of this one marcovefa couldnt very well argue with that the odors of all sorts of smokes rode the air so did the stenches of sewage and garbage horse and horse manure were two more strong notes unwashed humanity yet another hot greasy food had a place in there too whether that was a stench or an appetizing smell depended on your point of view and perhaps on the quality of the cooking if we stay here long and the emperor just ignores us well run low on money hamnet thyssen said everything here costs more than in the provinces whatever sigvat does he wont ignore us ulric predicted he may listen to us he may take our heads for being rude enough to show he was wrong but he wont ignore us count hamnet thought that over after a few heartbeats he nodded by riding north when sigvat ii wanted him to forget about the rulers and the bizogot steppe hed forced himself on the emperors attention sigvat wouldnt have forgotten about something like that there kormak bersi spoke in the bizogot language pointing straight ahead he went on you can see the palace over the closer buildings someone in that high spire who looked out over nidaros could see the approaching travelers too could that someone make out that most of them were bizogots would he know they were refugees fleeing the invaders from beyond the glacier if he doesnt know it its not because nobody told him hamnet thought try our hostel best in town a tout yelled trasamund and ulric skakki and count hamnet and kormak bersi looked at one another they all nodded at the same time take us there hamnet called the best hostel in nidaros would cost more than an ordinary one but he would have bet the tout didnt really work for one of the fancy places the capital boasted the man looked astonished and delighted and dismayed all at the same time what the lot of you he said yes the lot of us by god hamnet answered youre not the best hostel in town if you cant make us fit well well try the tout said come with me and ill show you what weve got merchants had to stop their wagons and pack trains as the travelers turned off the main thoroughfare and onto a little side street the traders sent some hard looks their way but no one seemed inclined to quarrel with a small army of mounted and armed bizogots and the handful of raumsdalians with the northern barbarians looked like dangerous customers too the hostel turned out to be better than hamnet thyssen had expected but it was still a long way from the best no southern wines graced the taproom only beer and ale and mead the rooms were cleaner than most but small and plain not as opulent as chambers in the palace the way they would have been at a firstclass establishment and the proprietor proved willing to haggle which he wouldnt have in a fancy place in one of those you went somewhere else if you couldnt afford what the landlord asked hamnet made sure he didnt get a room next to ulric and arnora the bizogots between whom he tried to sleep didnt rut their way through the night instead the big blond man on one side invited in friends and they all started to sing the racket was appalling but count hamnet wasnt appalled it wasnt the kind of noise he had to pay attention to the way lovemaking would have been even though drunken discords woke him a couple of times they didnt infuriate him or leave him quivering with unslaked lust he had no trouble dropping off again after breakfast the next morning he nodded to kormak bersi well youve captured me or near enough he said take me to the palace lets get this over with are you sure you know what youre doing the imperial agent asked no but then neither does sigvat and it doesnt stop him it doesnt even slow him down hamnet answered well see what he says when he finds out ive come back in spite of everything yes we will wont we on that encouraging note kormak rose from the table hamnet thyssen followed him they walked to the palace count hamnet would have ridden but kormak bersi didnt seem to think it was a good idea hamnet thought about arguing but let it go approaching anyway at all was arrogant enough sigvat ii was bound to see it like that anyhow a raumsdalian in bizogot furs and leather walking through the streets of the capital got his share of curious looks and more hamnet thyssen stolidly ignored them he hadnt trimmed his hair and beard either when he and kormak came to the palace the gate guards gaped at him too kormak displayed his emblem for them that got him respect at least whos the wild man with you sir a guard asked i am count hamnet thyssen hamnet growled sounding like the proudest of nobles and who the demon are you the guards jaw dropped his eyes all but bugged out of his head by god you are him he choked out what are you doing here kormak bersi had asked him the same question in different words couldnt anybody in nidaros see out past the city walls it didnt look that way reporting to his majesty hamnet answered i know more about whats going on in the bizogot country than anybody hes talked to lately i hope hell listen to me for the empires sake but hes angry at you didnt you know that the guard said count hamnet shrugged ill take the chance i have to if i can come back for the empires sake he can listen to me go report that count hamnet has returned to the palace kormak bersi said the guard didnt do it himself instead he told off a couple of his men and sent them hotfooting it down the corridor hamnet thyssen knew what that meant this fellow didnt want to be associated with bad news had hamnet been in good odor here the squad leader would have done the job himself a couple of disbelieving courtiers came back with the guards they stared at count hamnet as if at some fierce animal unaccountably running loose instead of being caged in a zoological garden good day gentlemen he said as if to show them he could be civilized after all they flinched from the sound of his voice what the demon did you come back here for thyssen one of them said dont you know the emperor would just as soon kill you as look at you well he can do that hamnet said the empire wont be better off if he does but he can you dont care whether you live or die do you the courtier croaked after examining what lay inside himself count hamnet shook his head now that you mention it no that made the courtiers back away in a hurry he didnt suppose he could blame them selfpreservation did matter to most people and especially to people who had anything to do with princes and potentates it would have mattered to him too if liv werent giving herself to a noaccount wizard but she was next to that anything sigvat or his torturers could do hardly seemed worth getting excited about another courtier came out this one with a fat gold chain around his neck to show what an important fellow he was so you want to see the emperor do you he said in a voice that sounded barely alive thats right hamnet answered can you take me to him i can i doubt i would be doing you a favor but i can let me worry about that count hamnet said i intend to and you have more to worry about than you can imagine the courtier replied but if you must come with me hamnet thyssen did the palace seemed badly overdecorated he was too used to serais and to bizogot tents it also seemed too warm how much wood did sigvat and his servitors go through every day is that why i came back to preserve such waste hamnet wondered the courtier with the gold chain led him to the throne room there he and kormak bersi had to stand and wait for a while sigvat ii was busy talking to an elderly merchant whose fur robe celebrated his wealth at last the fellow bowed and tottered away the courtier stepped forward in ringing tones he announced count hamnet your majesty hamnet went to one knee before the emperor beside him kormak who was not a noble dropped to both knees so you came back to mock me did you sigvats voice was too thin and light to give him a proper growl he was at least ten years younger than hamnet thyssen and perhaps had more than his share of a young mans worry about whether his elders respected him as much as he thought they ought to no your majesty count hamnet shook his head i came back to warn you the rulers turn out to be even more dangerous than i thought they were last year so you say sigvat jeered i say one set of barbarians up beyond the woods is the same as another and i say you disobeyed me when you went north last fall you werent supposed to do that how do you propose to defend yourself eh by telling you it was necessary hamnet thyssen answered i understood the frozen plains better than you did since ive been there and you havent your majesty whats happening on the plains now shows that count hamnet has a point kormak bersi said he he is a traitor the emperor broke in if you back him and i see you do then youre another he raised his voice to a shout guards take this wretch take both these wretches to the dungeons xvi hamnet thyssen had always known the imperial palace had dungeons he hadnt expected to make their personal acquaintance wasnt a big part of real life the difference between what you expected and what you got fighting a dozen guards would have been suicidally stupid hamnet took a certain dour satisfaction in noting how astonished kormak bersi seemed when the guards laid hold of him his only crime had been to tell the truth as he saw it to sigvat that was perfidious enough all by itself the guards hustled count hamnet and kormak out of the throne room the last thing the raumsdalian noble saw there was the courtiers smirking face whats going on here someone asked as the guards frogmarched the new prisoners through the corridors down which hamnet had come on his own not long before they made the emperor angry one of the guards answered he didnt seem to think he needed to say anything more by all appearances he was right how many times had hamnet walked past a stairway without wondering where it went now he found out with this one and wished he hadnt dungeons were supposed to be dark and gloomy werent they this one built below ground level lived up to or down to that specification mold clung to the massive stones of the wall only a few torches gave fitful light the air was cold and damp and smelled of sour smoke and stale straw in you go the guards told kormak bersi one of them opened a massive wooden door with a small iron grate at eye level kormaks captors shoved him in closed the door the hinges didnt squeal they were rustproof bronze and made sure it stayed closed with a heavy wooden bar now its your turn a guard said to hamnet he went into a cell some distance from kormaks he supposed the guards didnt want him plotting with the agent that was a compliment of sorts but only of sorts no matter how much plotting he and kormak did he couldnt see how it would help them get away his cell had stone walls a stone floor and ceiling a musty pallet and wool blanket that were bound to be verminous and a stinking slop bucket maybe a wizard could have put that together and used it to escape but hamnet knew he couldnt the only light came through the grate after a bit the door to the cell opened again three guards pointed bows at hamnet while a fourth set a jug and a loaf on the floor and then hastily withdrew when count hamnet sniffed the jug he sighed it held water if he drank from it it would probably give him a flux of the bowels of course if he didnt the loaf wasnt very big and seemed almost as full of husks and chaff as his mattress he ate about a quarter of it and found it tasted as bad as it looked saving the rest for later he had no idea how often they would feed him but feared the worst was no hardship eating more when he got hungry probably would be again though not eating was bound to be worse he paced off the cell six strides from the door to the back wall seven from one side to the other with nothing else to do he walked back and forth and around and around for a bit that soon palled as hed known it would he sat down on the miserable pallet the blanket that went with it would be warm enough now when the breath of god started to blow how many prisoners died of chest fever every winter as his eyes got used to the neardarkness all around he saw more sharply than he had when the guards first shoved him in here that might have been useful if there were anything much to see in the cell or so he thought at first after a while he got up and went back to the far wall no his eyes hadnt tricked him prisoners whod been here before had used well who could say what to scratch their names and other things onto the stones there some proclaimed their innocence some named the women theyd loved one had carefully shown a woman loving him the man wasnt a bad artist and he must have had plenty of time to complete his work hamnet wondered how many other luckless souls in this cell had wandered over to the obscene drawing to remind themselves of what they were missing his mouth tightened if he thought of gudrid or liv he wouldnt necessarily think of them doing that with him he might be more likely to see them in his minds eye loving someone else and some of the prisoners cursed the people whod caused them to end up here emperors names figured prominently there some of them went back hundreds of years viglund had been a great conqueror in the days when the raumsdalian empire was much younger than it was now someone hed conquered hadnt appreciated it much good it did the poor bastard hamnet thyssen thought much good anything does anybody with nothing better to do he went back to the pallet and sat down again he started reciting poetry and wished he knew more of it a bard might be able to entertain himself for a long time or he might not a guards head blocked the grate killing almost all the light in the cell shut up in there the man snarled no noise allowed hamnet thyssen laughed in his face what will you do to me if i make noise throw me in the dungeon when the guard laughed too it was not a pleasant sound anything but you want to find out smart boy keep mouthing off and you will by god theres never been a bad place that couldnt get worse he spoke with great assurance after a couple of heartbeats count hamnet decided he was bound to be right the guards could do whatever they wanted to a prisoner who annoyed them i was only trying to make time pass by hamnet said itll pass whether you do anything or not the guard said so shut up thats the rules he stomped off a kidney stone would pass too eventually and it would hurt all the time while it was passing as for the rules well the people who enforced them always liked them better than those at whose expense they got enforced swearing to himself hamnet quietly lay back on the miserable lumpy pallet when he and kormak bersi didnt come back to the hostel trasamund and ulric skakki would realize something had gone wrong no doubt they would have a good idea what too but what could they do about it when the emperor was angry could they do anything at all they would probably come straight to the palace to try to find out what was going on and what would happen then count hamnets best guess was that they would end up here in the dungeons themselves in short order if audun gilli and liv came along hamnet thyssen ground his teeth he didnt suppose they would end up here or marcovefa either but the emperor was bound to have some place where he could put wizards who caused him trouble a place warded by other stronger wizards no doubt did the raumsdalian empire have any wizards stronger than marcovefa count hamnet wasnt so sure about that she was liable to give sigvats arrogant sorcerers a surprise of the sort they hadnt had in many years if ever but was she stronger than all of them put together hamnet had trouble believing she was while he wondered about such things time seemed to move at its normal rate when his river of thought ran dry though it was as if everything stopped he might have been in the cell for centuries with another eternity or two to look forward to he wasnt too hungry he didnt need to ease himself in the unending dim damp twilight in there those were his only clues that he hadnt already spent a very long time indeed down below all the parts of the palace hed ever visited before if i do stay here long enough my nails will grow out into claws and my beard will reach down to my waist he might measure months and years that way days and weeks the gauge wasnt fine enough sunrise sunset he was even more cut off from them than he would have been in winter up beyond the glacier the sun might stay below the horizon for weeks up there but you knew it would come back sooner or later down here he had no guarantee of ever seeing another sunrise again he must have slept for he jerked in surprise when the cell door opened and a guard threw in another miserable loaf he still had some left from the last one they werent trying to starve him anyway was that any favor to him again he wasnt so sure he listened for ulric skakkis sly tones and trasamunds bellow outside the door it wasnt that he wanted them mewed up in here with him but he did expect them to come after him when they didnt he wondered what had happened to them what had gone wrong with them in other words hed been there for seventeen loaves another way to count the time when a guard looked in through the grate and said cmere thyssen youve got a visitor a visitor hamnets voice sounded rusty even to himself he hadnt used it much lately he also sounded astonished and he was he had trouble imagining any of the travelers talking their way down here without ending up prisoners themselves thats right the guard said you want to talk or not im coming count hamnet hurried to the door somebody thought enough of him to come down here that had to be good news didnt it he eagerly peered out gudrid looked back through the grate at him she wore attar of roses the same scent shed brought with her when she traveled beyond the glacier the year before the flowery sweetness seemed even more incongruous against the stenches in the dungeon than it had up on the frozen steppe hello hamnet his former wife said her redpainted mouth stretched into a broad happy smile so good to see you where you belong at last i dont know what i did to deserve you he answered whatever it is by god im paying for it now i thought the very same thing when we were together gudrid said hed thought she loved him hed always known he loved her part of him still did and always would that only made her betrayal more bitter he tried to show she couldnt wound him a lying and a losing battle are you enjoying yourself stare all you please he said i should throw peanuts the way i would at monkeys in cages she said smiling wider yet what would you do for a peanut hamnet he told her where she could put a peanut he told her where she could put a years worth of peanuts and how well they would fit there and why she only laughed why not she was on the outside looking in he was on the inside looking out it made all the difference in the world did eyvind torfinn tell you i was here he asked that only made gudrid laugh again dont be sillier than you can help darling dear eyvind knows yes because i told him but sigvat told me she sounded smug as a cat in a creamery she no doubt had the right to sound that way too hamnet thyssen used a shrug for a shield he can say what he wants he can do what he wants hes the emperor after all oh you do know that gudrid exclaimed in mock surprise he didnt seem to think you did well there is one thing hamnet said if the rulers overrun raumsdalia he wont stay emperor for long gudrid sneered how likely do you think that is you were up there you saw the rulers last year you saw more of some of them than i did by god count hamnet wasnt quite sure gudrid had slept with their chief he hadnt watched them in the act for which he was duly grateful but he was sure enough and that was the kind of thing gudrid did for good measure he added theyve spent the time since last winter smashing up the bizogots his former wife didnt bother denying anything she did ask is trasamund all right hes not hurt but his clans wrecked hes down here in nidaros too hamnet thyssen didnt think he was giving anything away with that news all gudrid said was ah then she asked and your new barbarous beloved liv is here too count hamnet didnt think he revealed anything by how he said that he must have been wrong though for gudrid pounced or rather burst out laughing so shes gone and left you has she well that didnt take long how did she know how could she tell whatever the answer was her instincts were unfailing yes shes left me hamnet said she doesnt torment me for the fun of it anyhow dont worry about it sweetheart sooner or later she will with that casual reassurance gudrid blew him a kiss and swept out of the dungeon a guard followed her hamnet watched them as far as the grate allowed which wasnt very then shaking his head he went back to the pallet and lay down again the guard spoke to him you were married to that gal afraid so hamnet said i was married to her id be afraid too the guard said shes nothing but trouble i found that out a little late but i did hamnet thyssen said she why youre shut up here no hamnet shook his head i found out about the emperor a little late too here now you cant talk like that the guard said you do and i know i know itll be even worse than it is already hamnet said wearily but you asked i tried to tell you the truth thats what they all say the guard didnt want to listen and he didnt have to listen either he walked away instead what will they do to me now hamnet wondered he knew how it could get worse all right they could stop feeding him they could stop giving him water or they could just grab him and haul him off to the torturer if enough of them came in he hadnt a prayer of fighting them off they didnt do any of those things the loaves and the water kept coming he stayed in the cell and stayed and stayed that might not have been worse but it was bad enough and then some you thyssen a guard with a raspy voice barked at him through the grate what now count hamnet asked any change in routine worried him silence being ignored was routine getting noticed he didnt expect good news somebody here wants to talk to you the guard said do i want to talk to gudrid again hamnet wondered after what had to be days of doing nothing even a quarrel with his former wife might seem entertaining if that wasnt madness he didnt know what would be all the same it was so he got to his feet and walked up to the door seeing him approach the guard nodded heres the bum the man said and stepped to one side hamnet braced himself to start snarling at gudrid again but those were not her aging but still attractive still beautiful features on the other side of the grate instead hamnet thyssen found himself facetoface with earl eyvind torfinn gudrids husband gudrids husband who hadnt or acted as if he hadnt the slightest idea how many times shed put horns on him i grieve to see you like this your grace the scholarly noble said im not too happy about it myself your splendor count hamnet answered did gudrid finally tell you i was here earl eyvind didnt notice that finally he shook his head his jowls wobbled hed regained the comfortable plumpness hed enjoyed before his journey to the north the year before scratching at the edge of his whiskers he said no i dont think she knows youre here that only proved the right hand didnt know what the left was doing nothing new where gudrid was concerned well how the demon did you find out i was stuck here then hamnet demanded ulric skakki is a resourceful chap eyvind replied a truth so obvious even he could see it he got word to me that you were having ah difficulties i was shocked i truly didnt believe his majesty would be so ah unaccommodating oh you cant say that hamnet thyssen wagged a finger at him no you cant by god after all here i am accommodated er yes eyvind torfinn laughed uneasily so you are but whether you should be that perhaps is a different question sigvats got the answer he says i should count hamnet sounded more nearly resigned than outraged which only proved he made a better actor than hed ever dreamt he could so i discovered eyvind said i urged your release urged it in strong terms too but his majesty was not amenable to reason he sounded surprised that reason couldnt sway the raumsdalian emperor reason would have swayed him and so he believed it should sway everyone that might have been logical but it wasnt reasonable gudrid would have known better even count hamnet knew better thank you for trying he said and meant it he couldnt dislike eyvind torfinn even if the man was occasionally no doubt sleeping with gudrid eyvinds fondness for her aside he was a decent man it was my pleasure my privilege he said now and skakki hinted at some remarkable adventures ascending to the top of the glacier meeting people who dwelt up there extraordinary i wish i could have been with you you had your chance last winter and you stayed here hamnet thyssen thought then he didnt just think it he said it out loud if eyvind torfinn didnt like it so what what could he do that sigvat wasnt already doing the scholarly earl winced i am not a young man your grace he said stiffly i thought myself unequal to another journey up into the wilds so soon after the first and gudrid would have been adamantly opposed to setting out again you know the travels were a considerable hardship to her poor thing she only had bizogots and warriors from the rulers to seduce hamnet didnt say that no one had told him when gudrid was sleeping with other raumsdalians either hed had to find out for himself earl eyvind would too or maybe he already knew and chose to look the other way hamnet had wondered about that before he knew himself to be incapable of it eyvind torfinn wasnt lying to him here he was sure of that the other nobles white hair and paunch declared his years and he seemed to listen to and to obey gudrid as if her fidelity were perfect and unquestioned if you talked to ulric youll know the rulers have come south of sudertorp lake hamnet said youll know theyve smashed the leaping lynxes yes he did tell me that eyvinds voice was troubled maybe hed done his best not to believe it it isnt good news too bloody right it isnt hamnet thyssen agreed if those bastards arent over the border they will be soon you saw some of what their sorcery can do will we be able to stop them will we even be able to slow them down i have to hope we will your grace eyvind said ive had all kinds of hopes hamnet said harshly gudrids married to you liv is sleeping with audun gilli im spending my time in this stinking dungeon so what the demon is hope worth eyvind torfinn lurched back two steps his face as shocked as if count hamnet had slapped him im im sorry he got out after a couple of heartbeats ulric said nothing of your misfortunes with liv no eh i wonder how often people have accused him of discretion hamnet said but he didnt need to keep his mouth shut its true everybody who came down from the bizogot country with me knows it itd be all over the city if people all over the city gave a curse about me my condolences losing one woman is hard losing another is much more than twice as hard earl eyvinds thoughts marched uncomfortably well with hamnets the old man sounded as if he spoke from experience he might well have he was old enough to have loved and lost any number of times before wedding gudrid did he love her or was she only an ornament to him if she was she was an expensive ornament with a sharp pin not much i can do about it from here not much i can do about anything from here hamnet thyssen said if you have the pull to get me out your splendor im in your debt the rest of my days and what i owe i pay if you know me you know thats so i do know you and i know that eyvind said i dont want your service thyssen i want you free to do what you can for the empire i am already doing everything i know how to do to get you out this does not sit well with my wife but i am doing it nonetheless he set his chins and looked as heroic as a peaceable mildmannered scholar was ever likely to look he would try in spite of what gudrid thought how much luck was he likely to have when gudrids thoughts and those of sigvat ii were so much alike hamnet had no idea of the answer though he doubted the omens were good he took a step back and bowed to eyvind i thank you your splendor its the least i can do or try to do eyvind torfinn answered i make no promises however much i wish i could god keep you he sketched a salute and stepped away from the grate the guard whod told hamnet hed come led him away hamnet listened to his footfalls even after he was out of sight someone out there hadnt forgotten god didnt dole out many miracles for hamnet thyssen eyvinds remembering came closer than most of the things hed seen so hamnet thought right after eyvind torfinn visited him anyhow but loaf followed nasty loaf one jar of stale water replaced another guards came into the cell to empty the slop bucket then left again the air in the dungeon grew chillier hamnet didnt think it was his imagination was the breath of god starting to blow outside when the guards lifted the bar and opened the cell door when it wasnt feeding time he quivered with fear though he tried not to show it another break in routine it couldnt be good news thyssen the lead guard barked yes thats me hamnet agreed come along the guard said or hamnet asked or rot in there no skin off my nose one way or the other hamnet came the guards paused in front of kormak bersis cell opened it and got him out too whats this all about the imperial agent asked as he emerged youll find out the guard snapped now shut your fool mouth and follow me his mouth twisted in disgust you stink and so do you thyssen do i hamnet couldnt smell himself any more he hardly noticed the stenches of the dungeon when he first came here theyd seemed horrible you could get used to almost anything hope came to life within him when they left the dungeon by the stairs that had brought him down into it he hadnt gone very far before he realized the guards could be taking him and kormak out to the chopping block what price hope then winters here kormak remarked even before they came up to ground level the chill in the air was more obvious now that they drew closer to doors and windows that gave on the outside world instead of the block the guards brought them to a bathroom that held two copper tubs full of steaming water wash yourselves the lead guard growled like i told you you stink without a word of argument hamnet stripped off the clothes hed been wearing ever since they threw him into the cell and got into the closer tub kormak bersi was only a heartbeat or two behind him the soap sitting on a tray on the edge of hamnet s tub wasnt perfumed but it got the filth off him and didnt sear his skin soap alone wouldnt kill nits though he wondered if the guards knew or cared another guard gave him some nastysmelling lotion and said rub this into your hair all your hair maybe the stuff was intended to deal with his lice standing up he smeared it over his scalp and in his crotch and under his arms in the other tub kormak was doing the same thing when hamnet rinsed the lotion out of his hair he got a little in his eyes then he quickly splashed more water into them be careful he warned kormak bersi spluttering burns like fire now you tell me kormak said which doubtless meant hed found out the same thing for himself hamnets old clothes had disappeared while he was bathing so had the imperial agents the tunic and trousers hamnet put on when he got out of the tub fit him tolerably well but no better than that the boots they gave him were loose but that was all right he asked for a second pair of thick wool socks and the guards brought them to him if the season really had turned as seemed likely the extra layer would help keep his feet warm when he had to go outside kormak bersi put on a similarly bland outfit as soon as they were both dressed the guards hustled them out of the bathroom will you tell me where youre taking me count hamnet asked shut up one of the guards explained youll find out another one added hamnet thyssen asked no more questions the men seemed jumpy and they were armed while he and kormak werent if they wanted to dispose of a couple of prisoners they could hamnet consoled himself by thinking they wouldnt have bothered cleaning him and kormak off if they were just going to take their heads he hoped not anyhow in here growled the guard whod told him to shut up hamnet got shoved through a door into what looked like a small meeting room so did kormak bersi hamnet wasnt astonished to discover sigvat ii sitting behind a small table there nor was he particularly surprised that the emperor looked as if he hated him sigvat had looked at him that way often enough to get him used to it no matter how sour sigvat looked he remained lord of the raumsdalian empire the forms had to be observed dropping to one knee count hamnet murmured your majesty beside him kormak went to both knees get up you two sigvat snapped as hamnet and the imperial agent rose the emperor went on i hope youre happy now that youve gone and shown how smart you are your majesty this time hamnet thyssen used the phrase as a question he couldnt very well know what had happened while he was in the dungeon the emperor couldnt expect him to could he sigvat couldnt reasonably expect him to no but how reasonable was his majesty one more question hamnet wished he hadnt thought of sigvat didnt look reasonable now he looked angry enough to bite horseshoe nails in half youve gone and shown how cursed smart you are he repeated vitriol in his voice these these rulers thats what he spat out the name of the tribe from beyond the glacier what have they done your majesty kormak bersi asked reasonably they wrecked an army of ours near vesteralen the emperor answered wrecked it i tell you we had wizards attached to the army whether you people think so or not i did listen to you by god i dont think any of the wizards got out for all i know the rulers ate them he wasnt joking or not very much hamnet thyssen tried to remember just where vesteralen lay somewhere up in the northern woods he knew that much he couldnt come closer than that as far as he knew hed never gone through the town what do you want us to do about the rulers your majesty he asked sigvat looked at him as at any idiot stop them he exclaimed how hamnet asked what do you think a couple of men fresh from the dungeons can do that an army and a squad of wizards cant you have friends i have trouble imagining how or why but you do the emperor might have been accusing him of some nasty vice like accosting little girls scowling and spiteful sigvat continued some of those friends have been whining that i should have let you out a long time ago or even that i never should have jugged you in the first place i really do have friends count hamnet thought with some surprise maybe eyvind torfinn had done what hed said he would do maybe ulric skakki had greased a few palms maybe no almost certainly trasamund had made a nuisance of himself for me hamnet had trouble believing it but as if to confirm it sigvat said your friends taken all in all are a sneaky slither of snakes put all of you together and you should be able to give the rulers trouble if anyone can yes if kormak bersi said which perfectly echoed what was going through hamnets mind i will do what i can your majesty on one condition hamnet said you dare bargain with me thumbscrews and racks and endless gallons of water roughened sigvats voice hamnet thyssen nodded anyway i do sir whatever you do to me here it wont be worse than letting gudrid come north with me she is no friend of mine if you send me against the rulers dont send her if you send her well id rather go back to the dungeon if i take you up on that you wont come out again sigvat warned count hamnet only shrugged the emperor filled his lungs to call for guards to take hamnet away wait your majesty think kormak bersi urged you need thyssen more than you need me he knows more about this business than i do and hes a better man of his hands than i am too sigvat looked as astonished as if one of his chairs had spoken to him he rounded on count hamnet gudrid is no fonder of you than you are of her then why would she want to come north again the raumsdalian noble asked but that question almost answered itself hamnet wanted nothing more than to stay away from his former wife she on the other hand wanted to keep sticking pins in him to make him writhe hed done all the writhing he intended to do though at least on her hook what liv could do to him he hadnt said anything to sigvat about liv was that because shed wounded him less or because he had the feeling the fight would need her he wasnt sure himself if i didnt think you were important the emperor ground out hamnet said nothing he just waited for whatever happened next if it was the dungeon then it was that was all but if it wasnt stop the rulers and there arent many rewards big enough by god your majesty i dont care about most of that nonsense you know i dont count hamnet said i just want people to leave me the demon alone you gudrid everybody is that too much to ask frequently kormak said before sigvat could answer the emperor said youd have all the privacy you want in a cell true again hamnet left it there but not for long he couldnt help adding till the rulers get here anyway sigvat ii made a horrible face that worry had to be in his mind too give me what i want your grace and ill do the same for you he said i will keep gudrid away from you while you fight the foe you have a bargain there thank you your majesty hamnet said and the rest of it if you beat the rulers ill leave you alone the emperor said before god i will and ill see that gudrid does too but if you dont dont worry about it your majesty hamnet said sigvat stared at him he explained if i lose chances are you wont get the chance to punish me ill be too dead for you to worry about it losing to the rulers is its own punishment mm yes i can see how that might be sigvat smiled a thin smile hamnet thyssen had a pretty good idea of what he was thinking whether hamnet won or the rulers did the emperor didnt lose everything or he thought he didnt anyhow hamnet doubted whether hed thought things through but hamnet doubted that about sigvat a lot of the time if the rulers won the most he could hope for was to go on as their vassal they were more likely to dispose of him and find another puppet or to do without puppets altogether as far as count hamnet was concerned sigvat deserved that kind of fate whether the rest of raumsdalia did might be a different story well go on the emperor said god go with you good fortune go with you thank you your majesty hamnet and kormak said together hamnet went on will the guards still have our weapons to give them back when we leave the palace they will sigvat promised and they did though the dirty looks one of them sent hamnets way suggested that hed done some appropriating while hamnet sat in his cell with a sword on his hip and a knife on his belt hamnet felt better able to face the world outside he knew it was more likely to yield to such weapons than the heartless world of the palace was the glacier lay a long way north but he could feel it in the wind when he walked out he stepped carefully ice crunched under his bootheels at every stride yes winter was here sure enough all you have to do now is keep your word and beat the rulers kormak bersi remarked yes thats all hamnet thyssen agreed the imperial agent sent him a sharp look scenting sarcasm hamnet hadnt intended any hed got out of sigvat s dungeon after that wouldnt anything else be easy by comparison xvii the innkeeper was carving a roast goose when hamnet thyssen and kormak bersi walked into the taproom oh you two he said looking up from his work your friends arent here anymore where are they hamnet hoped he kept the alarm from his voice but he wasnt sure would sigvat do something really monstrous like releasing him while arresting ulric skakki and audun gilli and the bizogots maybe the emperor would think that was funny not monstrous they all went to what shisnames house a few days ago the innkeeper replied valiantly resisting the impulse to pick up the goose carcass and crown the fellow with it count hamnet asked whose house whatshisnames the innkeeper repeated and hamnet did take a step towards the steaming juicy bird on its pewter platter but then the man went on old foof white beard kind of a big belly throws big words around you know this guy kormak asked eyvind torfinn hamnet said aiming the words at the innkeeper and the agent both and so turning them into half a question both men nodded thats him the innkeeper said you know where he lives you better if youre after your pals cause i sure dont as a matter of fact its not too far from here which is nothing but luck hamnet thyssen paused did somebody take my gear out of my room somebody must have because its sure not there now the innkeeper said dont know if it was your pals though thanks hamnet said dryly had ulric or audun or liv remembered his sackful of chattels or had the innkeeper made them disappear count hamnet couldnt imagine that the fellow would leave them around for some new lodger to find he went out into the cold again kormak bersi at his heels it wasnt much warmer than it would have been on the bizogot steppe if at all the big difference was it got cold sooner on the steppe stayed cold longer and rarely warmed up in between times the breath of god dominated winter there it did the same here a lot of times but not always here in nidaros other warmer winds warred with it so where is this foofs place kormak asked breathfog streaming from his mouth and nose with the words here on the west side on the higher ground closer to the palace hamnet answered his terrace looks out on the farm country that used to be at the bottom of hevring lake this time of year hes welcome to his stinking terrace kormak said with an exaggerated shiver hamnet thyssen nodded he wouldnt have wanted to stand around freezing his nose off either kormak went on well we might as well go there cant very well get started if we dont no i guess not count hamnet would almost rather have faced the rulers in battle than gone to earl eyvinds home the rulers were honest enemies eyvind torfinn was or acted like a friend facing gudrid a grim smile spread across his face it might not be so bad he could tell her sigvat wouldnt let her trouble him when he went north again that was worth something anyhow where exactly is this place kormak bersi asked after theyd wandered for a while ill find it hamnet said and after one more false start he did eyvinds house was almost as big as the castle count hamnet wondered if hed ever see again hamnet knew the older noble had about as many servitors too and books took up the space servants didnt hamnet could read and write he even enjoyed reading now and again but eyvind torfinns collection would probably take more than a year to read through even if you read for a couple of hours a day hamnet had trouble understanding why anyone would surround himself with so many words and eyvinds got gudrid too he thought sourly that really means he has no time for words of his own kormak bersi couldnt have known what was in his mind the imperial agent set a mittened hand on the door knocker and rapped four times had he seized the brass knocker with fingers and palm uncovered he would have left skin behind when he let go a panel above the knocker slid back behind a grate much like the ones on dungeon doors hamnet thyssen and kormak looked at each other without any doubt sharing the same thought the eyes behind the grate widened you a male voice exclaimed the panel slammed shut to hamnet s annoyance the door didnt open instead he heard running footsteps and that same voice shouting earl eyvind earl eyvind thyssens here well kormak said is he going to let us in or drop boiling oil on our heads count hamnet looked up there was a murder hole above the entrance eyvind torfinn and his servants could do that if they wanted to hamnet wasnt so sure sigvat wouldnt thank them too even if the emperor had turned him loose no boiling oil no hot water no heated sand came from above a few minutes later the door did open instead of eyvind torfinns majordomo there stood ulric skakki the usual mocking grin playing across his lips well well the adventurer said look what the scavengers dug up and left on our doorstep is that an invitation or shall we just go away hamnet asked ulric made as if to close the door in his face hamnet thyssen made as if to draw his sword they both grinned and then stepped forward and embraced ulric also thumped kormak on the shoulder you two may as well come in he said i already bothered to open the door sorry to put you to the trouble hamnet said and ulrics grin got wider if you are going to let them in do it by god the officious servitor said from behind ulric think how much heat youre letting out standing there gabbing with the door open hamnet and kormak hurried inside ulric skakki closed the door after them earl eyvinds servant might have been grouchy but plenty of people in nidaros would have voiced the same complaint heat in wintertime was always a serious business even for the rich youll take us to eyvind hamnet asked ulric shook his head no of course not i was going to bring you to gudrid im sure you have so much to tell each other thats not even funny as a joke count hamnet growled well maybe not ulric allowed you have my apology for whatever you think its worth im sure its worth its weight in gold hamnet said ulric started to nod then broke off with a quizzical expression on his face kormak bersi also looked bemused earl eyvind waited in the bestappointed study hamnet had ever seen it had a lot of books and a desk with a southfacing window few houses anywhere in the empire had a window that looked north the breath of god militated against that several lamps and candles made the room bright even when the weather turned too harsh to leave the shutters over the window open heaving himself to his feet eyvind torfinn said good to see you by god good to be seen your splendor hamnet thyssen clasped eyvinds hand and i think i have a lot to thank you for my pleasure your grace please believe me eyvind said kormak coughed hamnet introduced him to eyvind torfinn i also owe you a lot your splendor the agent said dont worry about it eyvind torfinn said dont worry about anything are you hungry are you thirsty we can fix it if you are his majesty fed and watered us hamnet answered now hes going to turn me loose against the rulers amazing what getting an army pounded to pieces will do isnt it possibly possibly i dare hope he would have let you go even absent a defeat earl eyvind said i bent my efforts towards that end i assure you im grateful hamnet said and all the more so because his voice trailed away he didnt want to talk about gudrid with her current husband he never had wanted to do anything like that just thinking about it made him acutely uncomfortable but eyvind torfinn understood what he didnt say with some embarrassment the older man said these things happen you know did he mean his marriage to the woman who had been hamnet s wife or did he mean that gudrid had hoped hamnet would rot in the dungeon or both at once that would have been hamnet s guess oh yes they do indeed he said in a voice like stone were audun gilli and liv sharing a bedchamber in eyvinds home how could they be doing anything else and where does that leave me alone he knew the answer he knew it and he hated it spacious though this place was it would be far more crowded than an inn and that would only make him feel more lonely because he would be here without anybody next to solitude in the midst of a crowd going off and fighting the rulers seemed easy while he was on campaign he would have so much time to think so much time to brood he could hope he wouldnt anyhow is that woman marcovefa the one who speaks the strange dialect is she really from a tribe atop the glacier eyvind torfinn had naturally noticed her oh yes count hamnet nodded do you understand her not so well as i wish i did but well enough some of the bizogots who live near the western mountains talk the way she does the scholarly earl replied ulric skakki had said the same thing but ulric had lived among those clans eyvind as far as hamnet thyssen knew had just studied them however he knew what he knew he did know it if you can follow her language can you follow why her magic is so strong count hamnet asked well i havent seen much of it with my own eyes you understand so anything i know of it is at second hand eyvind answered id only be guessing and my guess would be that her sorcery is strong because her folk dont have much else if they need to do something up there they have to do it with spells i gather they dont know how to smelt metal any more they have no crops they dont even have large beasts to tame what does that leave them but wizardry i had the same notion hamnet said slowly in a way it makes sense in another way i wonder if its too simple eyvind torfinns shrug set his jowls wobbling it may well be i said i dont know enough to be sure we need more research if we ever find the chance for it he looked unhappy we have more urgent worries closer to nidaros i fear you never tried climbing up to the top of the glacier either hamnet thyssen said even with the avalanche that made it easier for us its still nothing id care to try more than once i believe you earl eyvind said how does it compare to a stretch in his majestys dungeons ive never tried climbing the glacier your splendor kormak bersi said before hamnet could reply but i wouldnt care to do more than one stretch in a cell i didnt care for even one hamnet agreed his majesty is a great many things most of which he couldnt stand but an innkeeper he is not which i have no doubt is an understatement the size of a mastodon eyvind torfinn smiled to show hed made a joke he was a goodhearted man he was also a man whod seen a dungeon cell from the outside but never so far as count hamnet knew from within despite that lack or that luck he did have a certain grasp on essentials even if the emperor did give you a meal i daresay youll be thirsty for something better than musty water yes by god again kormak spoke before hamnet could hamnet didnt mind he couldnt have put it better himself eyvind torfinns reception hall would not have been too small for the imperial palace with all the bizogots guesting at his home hed given one servant tapman duty a couple of dozen bizogots would be plenty to keep a tapman busy at all hours of the day and night or so it seemed to count hamnet with beer and wine and mead to choose from in place of fermented mammoth and muskox milk the bizogots might drink even more than they did up on the frozen plain too trasamund had a drinking horn actually a silver rhyton in the shape of a mountain sheeps horn of beer in his hand when he saw hamnet it is you the jarl boomed rushing over to fold hamnet into an embrace that made him think of a hug from a shortfaced bear ulric said eyvind had got you loose but ulric lies the way most people fart he cant help himself i know some people who break wind through the mouth but im not one of em ulric skakki said with dignity he sent hamnet one of his crooked grins i hope im not anyhow his cup was smaller and plainer than trasamunds but he chose wine to fill it he could rough it with the best of them but he didnt when he didnt have to liv was also there and she came up to hamnet too taking both his hands in hers she said i am glad to free you again i wish you no harm no ill only the best i am sorry we didnt end up fitting together the way you hoped i hoped we could too sometimes things dont work out the way you wish they would thats all how was he supposed to answer that it was gracious and he believed it but it still felt like a sawblade thrust through his liver sometimes things dont he agreed in a voice rough as shagreen he squeezed her hands once then let them go that was well done ulric skakki said quietly liv nodded for a moment knowing how useless and how foolish it was hamnet hated both of them well done or not he said and made for the tapman as he came up the fellow raised a politely curious eyebrow wine count hamnet told him whatever youve got thats sweet and strong coming up sir eyvind torfinns servant said as he filled a cup if earl eyvind was making his bountiful cellars available to his guests hamnet like ulric aimed to take advantage of them and wine was stronger than beer and ale and smetyn even a determined drinker needed to pour down less to make the world go away of course the determined drinker would still regret it the next morning or whenever he finally sobered up right now the morning seemed a million years and a million miles away from hamnet thyssen the wine in his cup might not have been a great vintage but it was sweet and it was strong hamnet wondered what the southern wine growers got that they thought worth as much as their marvelous elixir a poet could do something with that conceit he thought no poet himself he made do with savoring the smooth bloodred richness as it slid down his throat so what are you going to have to do for sigvat to keep from decorating his dungeons again ulric skakki asked sidling up to him nothing much hamnet asked unlike the tapmans a moment before ulrics elevated eyebrow was redolent of skepticism nothing much by god count hamnet said again just drive off the rulers thats all theyre inside the empire in case you havent heard and theyve beaten the stuffing out of an imperial army and a bunch of imperial wizards believe it or not that even got his majestys attention and they said it couldnt be done ulric said in mock hamnet supposed it was mock astonishment he wont do anything to you if you dont manage it either im sure maybe cut off your fingers and toes one at a time and then start in on anything else that still happens to stick out like i say nothing much dyou suppose your ballsd count as one cut or two i hadnt worried about it up till now hamnet spoke the last three words in as shrill a falsetto as he could muster he caught ulric skakki by surprise the adventurers laugh was highpitched too almost a giggle youre not supposed to do things like that ulric said severely the others who understood raumsdalian were laughing too marcovefa chose that moment to walk into the dining hall what is the joke she asked why do i always come in right after the joke some of that was in her own tongue some in the regular bizogot language hamnet made it ulric said and pointed to the newly released nobleman say it again marcovefa told him he did in the bizogot tongue this time it sounded stronger in that language than it did in raumsdalian hamnet wondered why that should be so but had no doubt it was marcovefa laughed and laughed pointing to her he said when i do go against the rulers ill need you beside me she batted her eyes at him for all the world like a coquette of the kind he couldnt stand why darling i didnt know you cared she murmured in surprisingly good if still accented raumsdalian people in the dining hall laughed much harder at that than they had at count hamnets joke ulric skakki dropped his cup quick as a cat he caught it before it smashed but wine spilled on the floor a servant scurried away and came back with a rag hamnet groped for an answer even after the fellow was down on his knees wiping up the wine just then he would sooner have embraced a rattlesnake than a woman but he could see how marcovefa might not appreciate that kind of reply i want you for your magic not for your he began and then broke off again his mouth seemed determined to land him in trouble whether he wanted to end up there or not twat marcovefa suggested in the regular bizogot language maybe she hadnt learned how to say that in raumsdalian yet well yes hamnet muttered which brought on fresh gales of merriment from the bizogots liv very much included and ulric skakki where was audun gilli count hamnet didnt see him which spared him complete humiliation but only by the tiniest of margins or so he thought anyhow but then marcovefa leaned up and forward and brushed her lips across his as if they were old lovers dont worry she said i promise not to give you anything you dont want ah but will you give him everything he does want trasamund bellowed he thought his own sally was the funniest thing hed ever heard funnier than whatever had gone before hamnet thyssen had rather a different opinion if he showed trasamund he was angry he lost he saw that much i want to beat the rulers he said i want to drive them out of raumsdalia i want to drive them off the bizogot plains you do all that and so many women will want to say thankyou with their legs open youll need a club to keep them off ulric said maybe not trasamund said before hamnet could answer maybe the sour look on his face will do it he guffawed youre your own best audience hamnet told him drive off rulers not so hard marcovefa said everyone makes big fuss about rulers feh this to rulers she snapped her fingers the reason everyone makes a fuss about them is that they keep beating everyone ulric said its a reprehensible habit i know and one from which they should be discouraged by any means necessary what is reprehensible marcovefa asked why deserving of reprehension of course ulric answered blandly and what does reprehension mean was her patience wearing thin hamnet thyssen knew his would have been but ulric went right on playing reprehension is that which is reprehensible maybe marcovefa would have turned him into a newt more likely since there were no newts atop the glacier she would have chosen something like a pika instead before she could do anything she might or might not regret later hamnet said what ulric is doing now is reprehensible it deserves reprehension ah i understand thank you marcovefa said ulric skakki sent hamnet a jaundiced stare youre no fun i wouldnt be surprised hamnet said but then ive just come out of his majestys dungeons the sport down there isnt everything it might be well thats true enough the adventurer agreed i didnt enjoy the stretch i put in under the throne room either you never told me you got jugged count hamnet didnt know whether to believe him either ulric had done a lot of things but he hadnt done everything had he i never told you it snowed in the wintertime up in the bizogot country either i never saw the need he spoke with exaggerated patience and then he went on to talk about what things were like in the dungeons hed been there he left hamnet thyssen in no possible doubt about that he knew more about what went on in the bowels of the imperial palace than hamnet did himself he knew guards by name and by habit he knew those cells as if hed lived in them for years maybe he had how did you get out count hamnet asked when he finished same way you did ulric answered his majesty found something where he thought i might be useful as a matter of fact it was that bit of business we did together six or eight years ago you didnt tell me you were just out of the dungeon hamnet exclaimed you didnt ask me ulric said id washed most of the stink off same as you did i thought youd get all sniffy if you knew i was coming up for air for the first time in well in a while anyway id say i was right too was he looking into himself hamnet thought he might well have been im sorry the raumsdalian noble mumbled what for being what you are thats foolish ulric said besides youre a little better now and youve done a stretch yourself which doesnt hurt count hamnet bowed thank you so much ulric skakki also bowed with a sinuous elegance hamnet couldnt hope to match my privilege your grace before hamnet could take the next step in the politerthanthou dance a servant came in and said his splendor requests that i announce a meal is being served if you will be so kind as to accompany me all things considered hamnet thyssen would rather have gone on sparring with ulric it wasnt that eyvind torfinn didnt set an elegant even an extravagant table no the problem was who would be sitting at it and sure enough gudrid waited there when he walked in ignoring her would have been rude especially since he was a guest in her present husbands home glancing over towards earl eyvind hamnet thought the older noble awaited this meeting with more than a little apprehension of his own if theres a fight i wont start it hamnet decided that being so he bowed to eyvind torfinn and to gudrid and took his seat without speaking to either of them trasamund sat down to his left marcovefa to his right liv was some little distance down the table between ulric skakki and a leaping lynx bizogot count hamnet barely knew gudrid never failed to notice things like that and of course she already knew liv and audun gilli were sleeping together her mouth stretched into what looked like a smile of genuine pleasure how does it feel to have lost another woman she asked these things happen hamnet said stolidly oh indeed gudrids smile widened anything can happen to anybody once if something happens to someone again and again though chances are its his own fault you cant please a woman she didnt shout it not in so many words she let the guests of her husbands generosity figure it out for themselves instead and what she said might well have held a cruel barb of truth but it was a barb that could also have stung her count hamnet could have made some pointed gibes about her sport of infidelity if hed wanted to insult the man whod got him out of sigvats dungeon since he didnt he just shrugged gudrid drew in another anticipatory breath hamnet thyssen wondered how long he could go on giving mild answers if she kept baiting him not long enough he feared but eyvind torfinn beat gudrid to the punch that will be enough of that my dear he said in tones that brooked no argument gudrid blinked she wasnt used to hearing such tones from her husband or anyone else but he she began that will be enough of that eyvind torfinn repeated we are none of us perfect reminding one another how we fall short does nobody any good and the empire needs count hamnet whether he is perfect or not you may think what you please of course but i will thank you to stay courteous in what you say servitors began bringing in the meal trays of mutton and spicy pork and goose filled the table an edge sharper and more dangerous than the one on any carving knife filled gudrids voice and if i dont if she intimidated eyvind torfinn he didnt show it waving to one of the servants he said my wife wont be dining with us after all im afraid be so kind as to escort her to her bedchamber yes your splendor the servant said but i dont want to go to my bedchamber gudrid said which would surely do for an understatement till a bigger one came along will you mind your manners then earl eyvind asked with surprising firmness i will do and say whatever i need to do and say gudrid answered as if no other reply were possible plainly she thought none was rorik eyvind said the servant touched gudrid on the shoulder she screamed at him and at her husband hamnet thyssen looked down at the tabletop hed seen gudrids temper kindle before hed been on the receiving end of it more often than he cared to remember in a way he still was this fracas was about him even if he didnt happen to be at the center of it ulric skakki yawned a little politeness would fix everything too bloody much to ask for i suppose gudrid didnt intend to be polite she grabbed a knife rorik knocked it away from her before she had the chance to try to stab him that made gudrid screech like a dire wolf with an arrow in its rump for his part count hamnet didnt blame the servant one bit his former wife didnt take kindly to being thwarted by anybody you may stay if youll stay civil eyvind torfinn told her will you her eyes blazed she wasnt about to forgive her husband any time soon either but she nodded and spat out three words oh all right earl eyvind beamed which struck hamnet as misplaced optimism he kept his mouth shut though thank you my dear gudrids current husband said she answered with something lowvoiced something count hamnet couldnt quite make out if eyvind torfinn did hear what it was he affected not to a certain amount of forbearance was an asset in any husband or wife the earl seemed to grasp that gudrid didnt and probably never would as for hamnet himself he felt hed used all his forbearance and more besides trying to stay married to gudrid her opinion of that might have differed gluttony seemed safe here gluttony after the musty water and the small loaves of bad bread in sigvats dungeon seemed all but obligatory hamnet might not have been able to match the bizogots in his relentless pursuit of a full belly but he did his level best eyvind torfinn reminded him of one of the reasons he was feasting so extravagantly asking how soon do you expect to depart for the north as soon as i can hamnet answered as soon as his majesty gives me orders i can show people orders that let them know i really do hold command there though eyvind nodded the cynical ulric skakki asked will he give you orders like that in writing i dont know i dont much care either count hamnet said if he does give me what i need ill go off and do my best with it and if he doesnt ill go down to my castle instead and wait for the rulers to come to me what does he say marcovefa asked both ulric skakki and eyvind torfinn started to translate hamnets words into her dialect each waved for the other to go on after a moment ulric did marcovefa listened frowning then said does he really think they can do that she spoke mostly in the usual bizogot tongue hamnet thyssen had no trouble following that you may think the rulers are easy meat he told her but if you do youre the only one who does too many things down below the glacier marcovefa said that in her own dialect but hamnet had heard it often enough to have no trouble understanding it believing it was another story hamnet thyssen ate for a while eyvind torfinns chefs as always set a high standard and because hamnet was just out of the dungeon good food seemed even better to him after a while though he looked across the table and spoke to gudrid may i ask a favor of you her eyes widened in surprise not he judged altogether feigned what is it dont ask his majesty not to give me the orders i need he said this time the way she batted her eyelashes was much too familiar why would i do that she cooed as if she didnt know to stop me to make me go back to my castle to make me fail hamnet said bluntly we both know that would make you happy by all the signs though im more likely to fail if i do go up against the rulers than if i dont but if by some chance i dont fail that will be good for the empire what happens to me doesnt matter much not on that scale of things what happens to raumsdalia does eyvind torfinn nodded so did trasamund so rather grudgingly did ulric skakki who worried about himself ahead of most things so did liv without the least hesitation and so did audun gilli although count hamnet made a point of not looking at him gudrid gudrid stared at hamnet as if hed started speaking in marcovefas dialect why on earth should i care what happens to raumsdalia she demanded i care about what happens to me and i care about what happens to you the way she bared her small white teeth said she didnt want anything good happening to him eyvind torfinn took a sip of wine before speaking the whitebearded scholar didnt usually have any idea how to control gudrid as if anyone does hamnet thought he feared whatever eyvind said would only make things worse appealing to gudrids patriotism was like appealing to a dire wolfs sense of poetry you could if you wanted to but it wasnt likely to do you any good but all earl eyvind said was if you wish disaster upon your former husband my sweet the surest thing to do is let him go north and find it that the rulers have crossed the bizogot plain in one campaigning season that they have invaded the empire clearly shows anyone who stands against them is unlikely to stand for long his words held more truth than hamnet thyssen might have wished hamnet wanted to beat the rulers not to throw himself away as so many bizogots and now a raumsdalian army had done before him whether he could do what he wanted was a different question with eyvind torfinns help gudrid saw that too she sent count hamnet one of her poisonously sweet smiles all right she said and then all right again her soft red lips and moist tongue giving the words a lewd caress as they escaped sometimes the worst you can do to someone is to give him what he thinks he wants and then stand back and watch him ruin himself with it if you want to play the hero going after the rulers be my guest i wont tell sigvat to stop you ill just laugh when you come back after youve made a fool of yourself so will everyone else i wouldnt be surprised hamnet said ill have to do my best not to make a fool of myself then wont i gudrids laugh was loud and rich but darling we all know your best is nowhere near good enough dont we he shrugged all i can do is all i can do this is true of all of us eyvind torfinn said for myself i think doing our best against the rulers is more important than anything that has faced the empire for many many years i am so convinced of this that if i see anyone operating on a contrary principle i shall feel compelled to change my will the bizogots even the bizogots who spoke raumsdalian might have followed his words but they didnt grasp the thought behind those words hamnet thyssen did and so did gudrid if she kept trying to turn sigvat against hamnet eyvind would cut her off after he died maybe she could get around that but it wouldnt be easy she looked daggers at him he smiled in return which did nothing to reassure her she put the best face on things she could if dear hamnet wants to go north and kill himself hes welcome to for all of me thank you he said marcovefa set a hand on his arm you do what you do it will be all right i will help she said good thank you too he said gudrid laughed again your lovers get more barbarous every time sweetheart the next one will be a jungle ape no you taught me all i need to know about those hamnet replied besides shes not a lover only a friend not that you would know much about friends or what they mean gudrid bared her teeth at him he thought his shot actually went home that wouldnt be a first but it didnt happen very often either xviii sigvat ii dithered two more days before sending hamnet thyssen the orders he wanted hamnet wondered whether gudrid was trying to talk the emperor out of it in spite of eyvind torfinns warnings or whether sigvat simply disliked and distrusted him that much the nobleman swallowed a sigh either one seemed possible at last though a palace servitor fetched the required parchment to eyvind torfinns home count hamnet unrolled it to make sure it was what it was supposed to be he didnt need ulric skakki to warn him against going north with a document he hadnt examined a document that was liable to order any officer who read it to arrest him and kill him on sight the servitor only waited impassively while hamnet read through the parchment it was in fact everything hed hoped for and more besides a calligrapher had inscribed it in red and purple ink it was bedizened with not one but three imperial seals each stamped into wax of a different color sigvat iis scribbled signature at the bottom seemed almost an afterthought and it said everything it should have it gave hamnet powers just short of imperial to fight the invading barbarians said to be known as the rulers all commanders in the north were ordered in no uncertain terms to subordinate themselves and their soldiers and wizards to him whether they would obey and how well might prove interesting questions but sigvat s orders seemed clear enough ulric skakki read over hamnet s shoulder without the slightest trace of embarrassment what more do you want he said when he finished egg in your beer i want to get moving count hamnet answered do you think the rulers are standing still tomorrow is soon enough unless you think theyre going to land on nidaros with both feet tonight ulric said do you part of hamnet did a large part too but he recognized that the rulers wouldnt descend on the imperial capital before he could go out and face them the raumsdalian empire was bigger than that odds were that the invaders remained in the northern forests that would be strange country for them and they probably wouldnt be able to push their mammoths through very fast tomorrow is soon enough hamnet agreed grudgingly but it was agreement all the same there you go ulric set a hand on his shoulder besides who knows somebody else may go up against them before you get there probably will in fact if he loses what will sigvat think that he needs you more than ever thats what and if he wins well so what youre still out of the dungeon and thats what really counts a lot of raumsdalians would have held a decidedly different view of things for them a victory in which they had no part would have seemed worse than a thrashing it would have marked the death knell of their ambitions hamnet thyssen didnt feel that way not least because he had few ambitions well youre right he said ulric skakki knew him better than most but looked surprised all the same the adventurer had his own fair share of hope for himself and naturally expected other people to have theirs too a little later that day audun gilli came up to hamnet i will go north if youll have me the wizard said i want to do whatever i can against the rulers there were ambitions and then there were ambitions count hamnet had hoped to live out his days happily with liv that wouldnt happen now but did audun deserve the blame because it wouldnt wouldnt liv have taken up with someone else if audun hadnt been one of the travelers in the north hamnet feared she would have you can come he said gruffly i dont love you by god nothing could make me love you but i wont sneak up to your bedroll and stick a dagger in you while youre sleeping either audun looked relieved thank you your grace for what hamnet growled now youve got a better chance of getting killed than you would have if i told you to go to the demons so does liv for that matter do you really want to see her dead no curse it count hamnet s voice grew harsher yet he hadnt imagined it could audun for the most part wouldnt have known a hint if it walked up and bit him in the leg he took this one though bobbing his head in an awkward gesture of thanks he retreated in a hurry part of hamnet wanted to get blind drunk after that he didnt though which went a long way towards proving how serious he was about setting out the next morning he went to bed if not sober then close enough so that he wouldnt have more than a mild headache come the new day his bedchamber was as luxurious as any hed ever known a fireplace and two braziers held the cold at bay his mattress was soft and thick the furs that lay atop it even thicker he had no excuse for not sleeping well but sleep didnt want to come count hamnet lay in the darkness staring up at the ceiling he could barely see he muttered to himself when muttering didnt do anything he swore out loud that didnt help either he groped under the bed till he found the chamber pot after using it he lay down again sleep still stayed away when it finally came it took him by surprise he drifted into a dream without realizing he was dreaming he didnt remember much about it only that it was one of those busy complicated dreams that make waking life seem simple by comparison as he didnt realize when the dream began he also didnt realize when it ended he thought the weight pressing down on the bed next to him was something happening in his mind not anything real even when his hand touched warm bare flesh he turned that into part of the dream a part that mingled sweet and bitter almost unbearably but the soft throaty laugh he heard then couldnt possibly have sprung from inside his own mind his eyes flew open who the he burst out liv come to apologize the best way she knew how gudrid come to torment him the best way she knew how a serving girl come to make sure he slept sound after all no matter how kindly eyvind torfinn might mean that hamnet didnt want a stranger to say he didnt want gudrid proved what a weak reed words were liv would hurt him more than she helped though she might not understand that never mind who the answer came in the bizogot tongue so it wasnt gudrid or a servant but it didnt sound like liv either who then knowledge smote marcovefa hamnet said why because i want to do i need more reason a man would have said it like that but hamnets fingers told him she was no man she slipped under the furs beside him her fingers began to roam too how did you get in muzzy with sleep he knew he was a couple of steps slower than he should have been all the same he was sure hed barred the door when he came in he hadnt wanted company he had it though marcovefa laughed again i am a shaman remember if i want to be someplace i go there if i want something to be mine i take it but hamnet spluttered hush her mouth came down on his that shut him up in the most effective way imaginable he raised his arms to push her away but they went around her instead she twisted a little so that his hands found her breasts she made a noise somewhere between a purr and a growl when he squeezed them the bed was wide he rolled her over so that his weight pinned her to the mattress his mouth trailed down from hers to her nipples she sighed and pressed his head down on her his hand found the joining of her legs her breath caught as he stroked her she opened them wider she was wet and wanton waiting for him here she whispered i do for you she twisted in the red gloom her mouth came down on him easy he said as her tongue fluttered and teased oh easy or ill so what she dove deep on him so deep that she choked a little that made her pull back a little but she was laughing when she did more than a little of that and he would explode he knew it and marcovefa had to know it too he didnt think shed come here just for that so he touched her cheek she paused and made a questioning wordless noise lets do this he said pressing his weight onto her again he slid in with just the slightest of guidance they began to move together as if theyd been lovers for years again he thought he would finish too soon to satisfy her when his mouth slid down to her breast again though she murmured something in her own dialect there he was nearly at the peak of pleasure and there he stayed and stayed and stayed till delight turned almost painful marcovefa gasped and quivered beneath him again and again now she asked at last now hamnet said they were both sticky and slippery with sweat sliding together he reached the pinnacle and seemed to fall from it forever marcovefa shivered one more time good she inquired brightly my god he answered and then wait till i can see anything but fire in front of my eyes she must have liked that for she laughed again the motion made him slide out of her maybe you sleep now she said count hamnet was inclined to think hed sleep for the next month this wasnt love hed known love twice now and known it to turn on him and bite but hed never dreamt of so much animal pleasure and then mischief in her voice she went on or maybe that wasnt a complete sentence by itself but what she did a moment later made it one after his sweaty exertions of a moment before he hadnt thought he could rise again so soon he hadnt thought he could rise again at all not for days but he surprised himself maybe more likely marcovefa made him surprise himself this time she rode him less ferociously than hed taken her he didnt think she used any magic past that which any man and woman who please each other have if he was wrong he didnt much want to find out there she said when theyd both spent themselves again is that better better than what hamnet asked which set her laughing all over again it was better than almost anything he could think of almost if gudrid truly loved me and if she were truly faithful the thought flickered through his mind like heat lightning on a summer night far to the south of nidaros then sleep did smite him and the darkness in the bedchamber was as nothing next to the black welling up from deep inside when he woke the next morning he thought at first hed dreamt it all that couldnt really have happened could it but he needed only a heartbeats more consciousness to realize he wasnt alone in the bed the thin gray light leaking in through tightdrawn shutters showed marcovefa asleep beside him a small smile on her face her features relaxed in slumber she looked improbably young his eyes went towards the door yes it was barred she might have done that right after she came in she might have got out of bed after he fell asleep she might have yes but he wondered whether it had ever been unbarred at all marcovefa woke up a few minutes later she looked confused for a couple of heartbeats as if wondering where she was and with whom then she grinned at count hamnet good morning she said the night was better he leaned over to kiss her he half more than half hoped they would pick up where theyd left off though he was anything but sure he could rise to the occasion but marcovefa said we take care of one thing at a time now you are all right for a while yes so now we go and see what we can do to these rulers the invaders still didnt seem to trouble her even if they had everyone else below the glacier from trasamund to sigvat in something close to a panic hamnet wondered if he ought to resent being lumped with a water wheel that had got out of kilter pride and the memory of pleasure warred within him but not for long he couldnt stay offended not when he remembered how shed put him back in good working order marcovefa slid out of bed found the chamber pot and squatted over it like the bizogots her folk needed less in the way of privacy than raumsdalians did she straightened up still naked hamnet watched her in unfeigned admiration he looked around the room he didnt see her clothes anywhere had she walked through the corridors of eyvind torfinns house like that or she fluttered her fingertips in a wicked parody of a gesture someone like gudrid might have used see you at breakfast sweetheart she said and vanished hamnet didnt think shed made herself invisible shed really disappeared a soft pop of inrushing air said as much could liv or audun gilli apport themselves like that count hamnet shrugged he didnt know he only knew hed never seen them do it he used the pot himself then dressed in the clothes sigvats servants had given him they would do for winter wear though they werent ideal he would have stewed in his own juices wearing them in a summer heat wave here a slow smile not an expression he was used to wearing stole across his face his juices had done considerable stirring in the night he found his way to the dining room eyvind torfinn was there eating sausages and duck eggs and drinking a hot infusion of herbs gudrid was there too so was marcovefa the two of them ostentatiously ignored each other hamnet thyssen nodded to eyvind torfinn then walked up to the cook ill have what the earls having he said that looks good help yourself to the sausages your grace the man replied ill give you your eggs in just a bit would you like two or three three please hamnet answered the sausages were venison their flavor enlivened with garlic and fennel when he had his eggs almost as fast as the cook promised he sat down by marcovefa catlike she leaned against him gudrid never missed a signal like that one of her elegantly plucked eyebrows leaped this time of course it will be pure happiness she said in a voice filled with vitriol i doubt it hamnet answered it will be what it is thats all gudrid started to say something then stopped with her mouth open she must have expected him to come back with something like of course it will his smile held a certain grim triumph sometimes getting the best of her even in tiny things felt more important than driving the rulers beyond the glacier marcovefa pointed across at gudrid she catches bugs yes she said in the regular bizogot tongue gudrid understood that well enough to close her mouth with a snap and to redden in anger maybe we should all leave aside our quarrels whatever they may be until the happy day when the rulers are defeated eyvind torfinn said also in the bizogot language his wife understood that too which was not to say she agreed with it as count hamnet s own thoughts showed he wasnt sure he agreed with it either beating the rulers was his duty getting one up on gudrid was a pleasure and one he didnt enjoy nearly often enough at the moment though gudrids anger seemed more likely to be aimed at marcovefa than at him gudrid had squabbled with liv too and hadnt liked what happened when she did would she remember that angering shamans and wizards wasnt a good idea with the emperors order in my hand i want to go north as soon as i finish here your splendor hamnet said and with me and the bizogots out of your house you should have peace again god willing may it be so eyvind torfinn didnt sound convinced and hamnet had a hard time blaming him for that gudrid wasnt happy that hed prevailed on sigvat to open the dungeon as far as she was concerned hamnet and kormak bersi could have stayed there till they rotted she wasnt shy about making her opinions known either no earl eyvind probably wouldnt have a happy time of it once his guests left ulric skakki walked into the dining room he needed only a heartbeat to notice things there werent much warmer than they would have been up on the glacier hello he said have you called a truce or shall i go back and get my sword and shield we have a truce eyvind torfinn said with perhaps more optimism than conviction come on my friend eat refresh yourself i thank you kindly your splendor ulric said better grub here than ill get up on the road thats for sure i may as well fill up while ive got the chance knowing hamnet hell want to get moving as quick as he can your reputation precedes you gudrid murmured to her former husband if youre very lucky people wont say the same thing about you hamnet thyssen replied gudrid bared her teeth at him eyvind torfinn looked as if he wished he were drinking something stronger than his herbal infusion ulric skakki came back from the cooks station with enough food for three ordinary men he was no bizogot but he could eat like one he sat down and methodically started putting it away then liv and audun gilli walked in that might have made things even chillier but hamnet didnt think such a thing was possible liv got a plate of food that rivaled ulrics auduns eating habits were more sedate or more typically raumsdalian do i want him along hamnet thyssen wondered but that wasnt quite the right question can i really stand to have him along he looked over at liv she wouldnt come north if he told audun to stay behind why should she when the rulers had already conquered the bizogots next to that why did she why should she care a copper for what happened to the empire but hamnet knew he needed her wizardry and auduns too they hadnt beaten the rulers but had challenged them and if they worked with marcovefa if they work with marcovefa im stuck with them he thought maybe if he was sleeping with marcovefa seeing liv wouldnt make him feel as if someone were sticking skewers into his marrow he could hope it wouldnt anyhow in strutted trasamund the bizogot jarl had his arrogance back however much it had suffered up on the frozen steppe he waved to count hamnet then went over to the cook and came back to the table with two large plates groaningly full of food as he set them down he growled lets go north and kill all those miserable mammoth turds we will if we can hamnet said this ought to be our best chance nothing else matters nothing the bizogot said and fell to eating as if there were no tomorrow nothing gudrid murmured did she mean the way he was stuffing himself or was she thinking of herself first as she so often did shed taken him into her bed almost under eyvind torfinns nose was she reminding him of it again right past her husband she hadnt been that shameless even with hamnet or if she had he hadnt noticed at the time whatever she was looking for from trasamund she didnt get it nothing he said emphatically his mouth full of sausage marcovefa laughed softly did she know what was going on there had she heard or perhaps somehow divined it hamnet thyssen didnt know gudrid couldnt have known either but her baleful stare said she didnt like any of what she was thinking still all she did was stare she must not have felt like taking on another wizard just yet all the same hamnet was anything but sorry to be leaving eyvind torfinns house by the way things looked earl eyvinds stablehands were anything but sorry to see hamnet and his companions go the stables were enormous eyvind could afford not only the best but the most even so feeding and grooming and caring for all those extra animals must have been a burden the goodbyes from the grooms and their assistants seemed most heartfelt out through the streets of nidaros again this time zigzagging towards the north gate the breath of god was blowing maybe cities far far to the south had streets that ran north and south nidaros didnt and likely never would fog puffed from count hamnets mouth and nostrils every time he breathed out but the wind took it and blew it away he didnt like getting the breath of god full in his face even here a long way from the glacier it blew bitterly cold so he thought anyway trasamund and some of the other bizogots smiled at the familiar blast someone hamnet thought it was marcomer of the leaping lynxes said this place is wonderful but it was too stinking hot before some people dont know when theyre well off ulric skakki said like us riding north hamnet suggested ulric sketched a salute yielding the point a caravan from the north was coming into nidaros when hamnet and his companions got to the gate whats the news ulric asked hamnet supposed he would have thought of the question too but certainly not so fast the caravanmaster was a burly man with a graystreaked black beard tumbling halfway down his chest his face wore a scowl well and wore one now the news he echoed by god stranger its not good theres some kind of bizogot invasion or something up in the woods by the tree line and i hear tell one of our armies took a demon of a licking he didnt have everything straight but what he had was plenty to irritate the sergeant who was admitting him to the city dont you go talking about our armies that way the underofficer growled what should i lie to this poor bugger instead the merchant pointed at ulric if he gets it in the neck do i want it on my conscience he wont get it in the neck and you havent got a conscience the sergeant said the caravanmaster let out an angry bellow ignoring it and reveling in his own petty authority the sergeant went on what you have got is a demon of a lot of horses and mules that need inspecting who knows what you might be smuggling if you think our soldiers are no good this time the caravanmasters howls threatened to shake down the icicles hanging like the teeth of a new portcullis from the gates gray stonework with the majesty of the imperial government on his side the sergeant could afford to ignore those howls too and since he was going to spend some time making the merchant miserable he considerately waved hamnet thyssens party of out nidaros without asking for much less examining the order hamnet had got from sigvat ii poor bastard ulric skakki looked back towards the extravagantly unhappy caravanmaster sometimes the worst thing you can do is tell the truth you know really count hamnet answered deadpan i never heard that before the adventurer laughed out loud no you wouldnt have would you nobody in the dungeons would say anything like that to you right neither would the emperor would he his majesty has told me a lot of things hamnet said truthfully i dont believe he ever mentioned that though no eh somehow im not surprised even a free spirit like ulric skakki glanced back over his shoulder to make sure no one not from their party could overhear before going on his majesty doesnt know enough about telling the truth to know it can be dangerous hamnet thyssen laughed then he wondered why it wasnt as if ulric were lying of course if he didnt laugh he would have to weep or swear or ride back to nidaros and try to assassinate sigvat laughing was probably better but he confused marcovefa what is funny she asked nothing much hamnet answered were taking turns insulting the emperor thats all oh but she frowned he deserves insulting yes she didnt wait for an answer but nodded to herself yes of course so why is this funny you never met him count hamnet said some people have all the luck ulric skakki added marcovefas eyes twinkled do you say i am lucky or do you say he is lucky youre lucky you never met him take it from one who has hamnet answered then after a moments thought he went on come to think of it hes lucky he never met you too or he probably wouldnt be here anymore if marcovefa could make herself disappear and go elsewhere could she also do the same to someone else hamnet couldnt see any reason why not if he is like that why is he your chief your uh jarl she asked imagining the color sigvat would turn if he heard someone call him a jarl made hamnet laugh all over again but the question deserved a serious answer and he tried to give one because his father and grandfather and grandfathers father ruled before him better a ruler from one family than endless wars to see who rules most of the time anyway ulric put in most of the time yes hamnet thyssen agreed well maybe marcovefa said our clan chiefs go by blood too but we dont fight wars about who should be chief she paused most of the time anyway she did a wicked job of mimicking ulric skakki hamnet believed her more things to fight about here he said which summed up the difference between a clan of hunters atop the glacier and the raumsdalian empire in half a dozen words why would anyone fight to become a clan chief even if you won the job what did you have that you couldnt have anyway no one needed to ask that question of sigvat ii or any other emperor the palace spoke for itself snow dappled the fields most of the trees had lost their leaves the bare branches made them look like skeletons of their former selves crows and jays lingered as they did in all but the worst of winters their cries were raucous in hamnets ears cattle pulled up grass the first frosts of fall had turned yellow and crisp they werent so shaggy as musk oxen but they did have thick coats to ward off the breath of god almost all of them grazed facing away from the wind marcovefa eyed the cattle she looked down at the horse she rode she glanced over to a flock of sheep almost out on the horizon even your beasts are things she said so many too many yes we dont go hungry as often as you do hamnet said not here marcovefa touched her belly then she touched her heart and her head here and here who knows that made him grunt thoughtfully he wasnt sure she was right but he wasnt sure she was wrong did being desperately poor because of where you lived give you spiritual advantages marcovefas magic argued that it did most of the rest of what hed seen atop the glacier suggested that the folk who lived up there were no more spiritual than they had to be it was a puzzlement he owned himself puzzled past that past that he would probably do better to worry about things he could do something about first among those was what would raumsdalian soldiers and their officers do when someone theyd never seen before started ordering them around count hamnet knew he wouldnt find out right away except for the imperial guards no large garrisons were posted in towns close to nidaros for one thing those towns lying at the empires heart were unlikely to need large garrisons for another large garrisons not under the emperors direct control might give their commanders ideas especially close to the capital most of raumsdalias soldiers then stayed near the frontier but the northern frontier in particular was not a place where garrisons had an easy time feeding themselves the line where crops wouldnt reliably grow lay south of the tree line which marked the border between the empire and the bizogot country without supply convoys up from the south the soldiers would start to starve that was incidentally another way the emperors could make sure their men stayed loyal and choke off rebellions hamnet thought about joining one of those convoys but he didnt need long to change his mind yes the wagons had large teams of big stalwart horses drawing them they wouldnt have gone anywhere if they hadnt even as things were they were painfully slow and that deliberate pace decided him against them instead his led the travelers off onto the side of the road and past the heavy wagons the soldiers who rode as flank guards waved to him he returned the courtesy the raumsdalians eyed the bizogots with him with suspicion all the same if the guards werent alert those barbarians might descend on the convoy so it had to seem to the men with the creaking groaning wagons anyhow he knew better but doubted he could persuade them trasamund summed it up in a handful of words were wolves by god of course the dogs dont like us he sounded proud of his wildness his ferocity ulric skakki raised an eyebrow what does that make the rulers then trasamunds answer was interesting amusing and highly profane but not very informative riding north seemed to speed up autumns passage into winter which would have come fast enough anyhow the storms blowing down from the glacier seemed fiercer and colder more and more snow covered the ground and the thaws between snowfalls grew shorter and shorter and finally stopped hamnet thyssen was resigned to bad weather the bizogots were resigned to worse as for marcovefa yes its cold so what she said when they camped one evening she shared his tent as a matter of course these days we all know what to do about cold we do it and we go on why get excited sometimes i think youre too sensible for your own good full of roast mutton hamnet didnt feel like getting excited not about the cold anyhow marcovefa wrinkled her nose and laughed at him i can be as foolish as anyone else but cold just is i lived on the glacier and on the mountain above it i never got away from cold not till i came down i never knew about hot baths for instance some things are good oh yes hamnet nodded the regular bizogots rarely bathed either getting truly clean was a luxury he cherished whenever he came into the empire if a copper tub and steaming water werent some of the most important hallmarks of civilization what was on campaign hed be dirty again but so would everybody around him after a while hed get used to it he wouldnt be so rank as he would when he traveled up in the bizogot country and neither would the people he dealt with for that matter when the nose smelled the same stinks for long enough it stopped noticing hed had plenty of experience with that in the dungeon and before hed also had plenty of experience making love with women who ended up breaking his heart somehow he never got tired of it what would marcovefa do to leave him sorry hed ever touched her something he was sure of that in the meantime though what she had to give was better than anything he could find anywhere else sorrow later probably that seemed to be what happened with him pleasure now without a doubt thank you he said after gasping his way to completion she laughed at him it takes two do you think you do not please me are you so much a fool she set his hand on her left breast her firm nipple and thudding heart said she had indeed kindled you see she laughed again yes hamnet said marcovefa might have told him something more after that if she did he didnt hear it he plunged deep into sleep staying on horseback all day took more out of him than hed expected maybe he was getting old maybe his time in the dungeon had drained him worse than he thought marcovefa shook him awake in the morning she seemed fresh and well rested even if shed fallen asleep after him was she using magic to lend herself strength and go without much rest if she was what price would she have to pay later count hamnet wondered if she could do for him whatever she was doing for herself asking her about it slipped his mind he had a command here one for which he was responsible bizogots liked sleep no less than anyone else ulric skakki would have gone into hibernation for the winter if hamnet gave him the chance hamnet was resigned to getting sworn at every morning even if not enamored of it they started off later than he wished they would have that happened every morning too he didnt know what he could do about it he didnt think he could do anything it particularly galled him this morning because they were nearing the north woods somewhere ahead were the rulers he wanted to hit the mammothriders while they were still in among the firs and spruces they would have trouble deploying in the woods they were used to wide open spaces where no trees grew as usual the gap between what he wanted and what he got yawned wide he took no special notice of the first few men who rode past him heading south as fast as their horses would take them they might have been ordinary traders on business of their own the odds were long but they might have been but the fellow who still slung an imperial shield on his back hamnet thyssen couldnt pretend he was anything but a fleeing soldier where are you going he called what are you running from the cavalrymans eyes showed white all around the irises like those of a spooked horse savages he said theres savages in the woods and theyre killing anything that moves he booted his horse into a weary trot and rode on xix getting any of the soldiers fleeing from disaster in the woods to stop long enough to say exactly what had gone wrong up in the north was hamnets biggest problem the men whod escaped wanted nothing more than to put distance between themselves and the rulers they didnt want to talk that slowed them down some of them warned of mammoths some babbled about magic none of that told hamnet thyssen anything he didnt already know he finally had to capture a raumsdalian soldier as if the man belonged to an enemy army not the one hamnet was going to command who the demon are you what do you think youre doing the cavalry trooper demanded he stared at the bizogots who made up most of hamnets strength seeing that they were northerners he went on are you in league with the devils in the woods no you idiot hamnet said the rulers attacked the bizogots before they ever got down here not that i could make anybody pay attention to what was going on north of the tree line but the trooper wouldnt care about that hamnet went on i am count hamnet thyssen the emperor has given me command in the north against the invaders he flourished his orders without unrolling them now who are you why are you running away i wont get in trouble the trooper asked warily not if you give me straight answers and stop wasting my time hamnet said well my names ingolf rokkvi the rider said i was part of count steinvors army we heard the barbarians had done something nasty up near where the trees stop but we didnt know just what was going on we figured it was bizogots kicking up their heels like they do sometimes oh good ulric skakki said thats the way to guarantee you win your battles make sure your soldiers know exactly what they need to do ingolf scratched his head is he joking uh your grace he asked hamnet thyssen i wish he were hamnet said while ulric snorted waving the adventurer to silence count hamnet nodded to the trooper go on well i was trying to ingolf rokkvi said we rode north up the forest tracks looking for the savages we figured wed give them a hiding and theyd run like they usually do and then we could go home trasamund and marcomer and several other bizogots growled at that scornful assessment of their prowess count hamnet waved them to silence too his glare was enough to keep them from reaching for their weapons he told ingolf rokkvi go on again i will if you let me ingolf said we were riding along and all of a sudden the worst blizzard in the world blows up right in the middle of the woods you wouldnt think something like that could happen but it did hamnet glanced at liv and audun gilli and marcovefa they all nodded liv and audun looked worried which meant they wouldnt have wanted to try a spell like that hamnet supposed that was what it meant anyhow marcovefa looked amused which could have meant anything at all then what happened hamnet asked ingolf rokkvi mammoths happened thats what ingolf said by god they did mammoths with soldiers on em they were built like bricks with big curly beards the mammoths ulric skakki asked the soldiers ingolf rokkvi said reproachfully they speared us they trampled us you cant make a horse stand against a mammoth on account of hes just not big enough and they laughed while they did it what happened then count hamnet asked what do you think happened ingolfs look told him he was short on brains we tried to get away from them thats what you do when you havent got a chance of winning and we cursed well didnt there was more horrible weather in the woods and shortfaced bears and dire wolves jumping out at us like they had no business doing and all the time it was like we heard those savages laughing at us like they thought we were the biggest joke in the world would you fight them again hamnet asked ingolf rokkvi needed some time to think about that maybe i would he said at last if i thought we had some kind of prayer of winning a lot of the ones who werent on mammoths were on these funny deer and they werent anything special a regular horseman doesnt hardly need to worry about em but the mammoths and the magic he scowled thats a pretty scary business we can beat them by god we can hamnet said ingolf rokkvis scowl got deeper he didnt believe a word of it after what hed been through hamnet had a hard time blaming him a little desperately the raumsdalian nobleman went on we have a wizard who can match anything they do he pointed to marcovefa ingolf eyed her the way a man will eye a goodlooking woman not like a soldier eyeing someone who might help his cause well if you say so he said after a moment he didnt believe a word of it his horse looked back at him and said dont be dumber than you can help she really can shes not running from them the way you are is she that wasnt marcovefas style of magic audun gilli enjoyed putting words in the mouths of things that didnt normally have mouths or at least had no business talking audun looked innocent when hamnet thyssen glanced his way ostentatiously innocent as a matter of fact hamnet didnt love him and never would but for the time being decided he wasnt sorry to have him along ingolfs eyes almost bugged out of his head how did you do that he demanded of marcovefa she really was innocent of this anyway in her accented raumsdalian she said is my fault if beast has more sense than you do the cavalry trooper gathered himself hamnet had feared he might go to pieces hed been through a lot lately but he didnt all right ill try he said if i end up dead i reckon the lot of you will be there beside me have i got that right yes hamnet said simply the next town ahead is kjelvik isnt it does it have a decent garrison not too bad ingolf answered i dont know whether theyll want to fight or bug out though well see hamnet thyssen said they all rode north they came across more soldiers fleeing the rulers before they got into kjelvik some of them they persuaded to turn around and resume the fight others seeing a body of armed men coming their way from out of the south rode around them no matter how far out of their way that took them hamnet didnt try to round up those soldiers they were too far gone to be of much use kjelvik sat on a low hill there were no tall hills or steep slopes in the northern part of the empire the glacier had lain here too recently and had ground such things down under its immense weight as count hamnet neared the top of the hill he could look ahead and see the dark smudge of the north woods out on the horizon he was getting close so were the rulers he got a less than overwhelming reception from the gate guards who the blazes are you and why are you coming the wrong way a sergeant asked instead of answering with words count hamnet displayed sigvats commission all adorned with seals and gorgeous with ornate calligraphy whats it say sergeant one of the guards asked i cant read for beans what you think i can the underofficer said i went to work when i was a brat same as most people i didnt have the time to waste on my letters this is an order from his majesty the emperor hamnet thyssen said it gives me command in the north against the new invasion of the barbarians right and rain makes applesauce the sergeant jeered nobody in his right mindd want to go fight these savages they ride mammoths i hear ride em would you believe it ingolf rokkvi shuddered he believed it all right and so did count hamnet who had also seen it with his own eyes he growled go get an officer someone who actually can read hell tell you whether im lying or not by god grudgingly the sergeant sent off one of his guards in due course the man returned with a young officer i am osvif grisi he said what do you want stranger what do you need i want to drive the barbarians out of the empire i need kjelviks garrison to help me do it hamnet answered osvif gaped hamnet displayed his commission again is he a fraud sir the sergeant asked if he is well give him whatfor like he wouldnt believe osvif grisi stared at the impressive parchment he reached sigvats peremptory commands his lips moving count hamnet didnt think the less of him for that he read the same way himself as did most people who could read at all the more osvif read the wider his mouth fell open by the time he finished his thinly bearded chin was hanging on his chest well hamnet said the youngsters jaw shut with an audible click he stiffened to a paradeground attention give me whatever orders you think right your uh grace he said i am at your service in all ways as is kjelvik hes real now the sergeants jaw dropped hes real all right osvif said grimly if he told me to hang you from a pole off the battlements youd be hanging there now the sergeant gaped osvif grisi turned back to hamnet what do you want from kjelvik sir every soldier you can put on a horse hamnet thyssen answered were going to have to scrape together some kind of army to fight the rulers you know i suppose so yes the young officer licked his lips i think youd better talk to the towns commandant yes i think so too hamnet thyssen agreed ive been trying to do that and people keep getting in my way he eyed the sergeant who did his best to hide in plain sight maybe he imagined himself kicking his life away up on the battlements hamnet wouldnt have ordered him hanged but he didnt have to know that the noble nodded to osvif take me to him kjelviks garrison wasnt big enough to hold the walls for long against a determined foe the keep wasnt strong enough to keep out an invader once hed broken into the city so hamnet s professional eye told him anyhow the guards outside the keeps portcullis stared at the bizogots behind him i thought some different barbarians were loose in the north one of them said to his friend me too shows what we know the other guard said then he noticed osvif with hamnets party whats going on sir this noble osvif pointed to hamnet is in charge of all defenses in the north by his majestys command that made all the guards spring to attention osvif went on i am taking him to baron runolf is that runolf skallagrim hamnet asked he hoped so if the local commander was a man he knew things would go smoother and osvif nodded thats right youve met him awhile ago but yes hamnet replied runolf skallagrim was about his own age a little heavier a little softer a little happierlooking if you wanted to get right down to it by god he said when osvif led count hamnet into his chamber look what the hound dragged in as he rose to clasp hamnet s hand he went on what the demon are you doing here last i heard youd got jugged thats old news now hamnet thyssen displayed his commission runolf looked it over in due course he nodded well thats better than sitting in a dungeon i must say is it hamnet asked bleakly in the dungeon i dont have to worry about a mammoth stepping on my head there is that runolf skallagrim agreed so what do you want from me as many men as youve got as many fugitives from the armies that have already lost to the rulers as you can round up and enough food for them to take north you dont ask for much do you runolf said if youve got three times that many men in your pocket ill gladly take em hamnet said oh any wizards in town we need them too a supply trainll be hard enough to come by that was much too likely to be true kjelvik wasnt a town from which anyone in the empire had expected an army to sortie if raumsdalia needed to move against invaders from a town this far south theyd penetrated farther and done worse than anybody would have guessed possible well so they had do what you can runolf please count hamnet said ive met these rulers before they come from beyond the glacier and theyre more trouble than you can imagine beyond the glacier the garrison commander looked and sounded intrigued so those stories about a way melting through dont just come from merchants off the bizogot steppe getting drunk and telling tales in taverns eh no theyre true all right ive been up there its a different world we havent had anything to do with it since the glacier walled it off god only knows how many thousand years ago but we do now runolf skallagrim grunted i will do what i can thyssen and i think the first thing ill do is set my men to rounding up the soldiers whove come south out of the woods my bet is well need a show of force before a lot of those buggersll want to remember why the emperor pays them my bet is youre right count hamnet said fair enough do that first after they comb them out of the fields and the taprooms and the whorehouses well see what weve got dont waste time on it though the way it looks to me is weve wasted all the time we can afford or maybe a little more than that the soldiers lined up in front of hamnet thyssen and baron runolf were a sorrylooking lot some of them were obviously hung over some were still drunk several were wounded though none seemed seriously hurt a man with a bad wound wouldnt have been able to come so far so fast they all glared at him they knew he wanted them to fight the rulers again and they were anything but keen on the idea most of them still had swords if he hadnt had the bizogots and some of runolfs archers backing him he wouldnt have been surprised if they tried to mob him and mutiny his guess was that bad odds were the only thing holding them back so youve met the mammothriders he said what do you know about it you blueblooded son of a whore one of the soldiers said somebody told you they could do that did he do you know what it means though not bloody likely not if youre coming up from nidaros i fought them half a dozen times up on the bizogot plains hamnet thyssen said he waved back towards trasamund and the other big blonds so did they the soldier blinked and shut up another one found a bitter question why the demon didnt you whip them then they wouldnt have set on us we didnt because we couldnt as usual hamnet used the truth however unpalatable it was how come you think youll do any better this time then curse you the second soldier demanded because this time we have a wizard who can beat anything the rulers throw at her count hamnet waved to marcovefa she took a step forward and nodded to the soldiers as if they were firstrate fighting men not the flotsam and jetsam of a campaign gone wrong another bizogot twat huzzah the second soldier said slathering on his scorn with a trowel maybe he thought marcovefa didnt speak his language maybe he just didnt care if he didnt he made a bad mistake as gudrid could have told him angering a wizard you couldnt kill on the instant was commonly a mistake it was here marcovefa murmured to herself the soldier developed a sudden uncontrollable urge to disrobe once he was naked in front of his staring comrades he acted like a jackass literally he brayed got down on all fours and started pulling scraps of dead grass up from between cobbles with his teeth he also relieved himself like an animal calmly and without shame marcovefa murmured again the soldier came back to himself and cried out in horror as he realized what hed done marcovefa suffered him to dress and return to the ranks with no further afflictions any other donkeys here hamnet thyssen inquired nobody said anything the unhappy survivors of one encounter with the rulers looked apprehensively from him to marcovefa and back again something like a sigh rippled through their ragged ranks count hamnet understood the sigh all too well his nod was precisely calibrated between scorn and sympathy thats right he said you can turn around and have another go at the barbarians this time with a real chance of winning or you can face us now which one looks like a better bet even after marcovefas magic the question didnt seem to have the quick and obvious answer hed hoped for he knew what that meant the rulers had beaten the raumsdalian army even worse than hed feared theyd made the men afraid of them sure another beating lay around the corner but they also looked at the soldier whod done such a humiliating impression of an ass if that could happen to him what was liable to happen to them if they tried to tell hamnet no well go i guess said a man with the look of a sergeant if the savages kill us at least its over with in a hurry most of the men assembled with him nodded hed summed up what they were thinking we fought them again and again on the bizogot steppe hamnet said again we lost more than we won i wont tell you anything different because i cant but you can beat them by god you can and well do it he didnt expect them to break into frantic cheers a good thing too because they didnt that kind of thing happened only in bad romances a few of them looked thoughtful which was about as much as hed hoped for he turned to runolf skallagrim what do you think theyll march theyll fight some the commander of kjelvik replied if they win the first time out theyll fight harder after that if they lose the first time theyll run away so fast their shadows wont keep up with em heh hamnet hadnt remembered that runolf had such a gift for pungent truth then he added the most he could were better off with em than without em you hope runolf said thats right hamnet thyssen nodded i hope hed come into kjelvik with a troop of bizogots he rode out of it with an army of raumsdalians it wasnt exactly the army he would have wanted not when it was made up of garrison troops and men whod already run away from the rulers once but it was an army and it could fight it could whether it would were going in the right direction he told ulric skakki were moving towards the enemy so we are the adventurer said if only we had to move father before we bumped into those bastards runolf skallagrim said what i dont understand is why didnt the emperor do something about these rulers sooner he seemed glad to be out of kjelvik he kept reaching for his sword and pulling it halfway out of the scabbard as if ready to go into battle then and there if all the soldiers who followed were as eager as the baron the rulers really might have something to worry about youd have to ask his majesty about that hamnet replied i really couldnt tell you he didnt want to shout that sigvat was a purblind idiot even if that explanation made more sense than any other well its too bad any which way runolf said count hamnet nodded that too was an understatement the sky was gray and lowering with clouds that seemed almost close enough to the ground to let him reach up and touch them snow swirled through the air not a lot but enough to compress the horizon to not much farther than bowshot the wind blew out of the north it didnt have the howl of the true breath of god but it was no gentle zephyr either the season felt like what it was autumn well north of nidaros heading towards winter sheep and cattle huddled in the fields scraping up what fodder they could from under the snow army outriders scooped them up as they came across them outraged herders howled protests hamnet paid them for the animals the army took that made them less angry but didnt end all their rage scowling down at the silver in his mittened palm one shepherd snarled why shouldnt we pull for the stinking barbarians when the soldiers whore supposed to be protecting us pull a stunt like this by the way he said it count hamnet might have been paying him for the corpses of his family why ill tell you why hamnet answered because the rulers if they come this far will take your sheep they wont give you even a copper and theyll cut your throat if you complain or maybe just if they spot you thats why you say so anyhow the shepherd growled calling the noble a liar without quite using the word yes by god i do say so hamnet replied ive fought them before which is more than you have you dont know anything about them i sure dont the shepherd said but i know more than i want to about the likes of you he spat in the snow at hamnet thyssens feet and stumped off his oversized bizogotstyle felt boots leaving equally oversized footprints behind him nice to know youve charmed the natives isnt it ulric skakki remarked we need the meat hamnet said he really doesnt know how lucky he is and its our job to make sure he doesnt find out too ulric winked arent we lucky speak for yourself count hamnet said which only made ulric laugh annoyed hamnet went on if i were really lucky you wouldnt have me bothering you the adventurer put in hamnet thyssen nodded well that too but it isnt what i was going to say i was going to say if i were really lucky id have an honesttogod army with me not a garrison that doesnt know how to fight and a bunch of odds and sods whove already run away once and dont want to fight i dont follow that at all marcovefa said say in the bizogot language please why not hamnet translated his own words the shaman from atop the glacier rode up alongside him and kissed him on the cheek sometimes you get what you wish for she said as if she were personally responsible for arranging it no matter how much hamnet looked around though he saw only the men hed mustered in kjelvik they were better than nothing but as far as he was concerned not nearly enough better on he rode they might not have been enough better than nothing but they were what he had the storm got stronger now the wind did start to feel like the breath of god the snow swirled thicker just staying on the road towards the northern woods was anything but easy another road a broader highway came up from the southeast to join the one hamnet and his men were on which ran almost straight north if runolf skallagrim hadnt warned count hamnet the crossroads was coming up he never would have known it which road do we take runolf asked hamnet wanted to laugh or maybe to cry youd do better to ask some of the men who came south he answered they have a better notion where the rulers are than i do and they have a much better notion where the rulers are than sigvat does not that thats saying much runolfs coughs sent steam rising from his lips and nostrils they also suggested that count hamnet had said quite enough or maybe too much before runolf could ask anything of the soldiers hamnet heard hoofbeats lots of them off to the right he would have caught them sooner if the falling snow hadnt muffled them he peered in that direction but the snowflakes dancing on the north wind kept him from seeing much his first thought was that a caravan of merchants was coming to the crossroads on the other highway that was close to laughable too the traders would be sorry if they got in front of his force and found the rulers first and they would slow him down if they blocked the road he didnt want to have to swing out into the fields to get around them and then a peremptory shout came through the howling wind you there strangers clear the road for his majestys soldiers what if hamnet hadnt been wearing mittens he would have dug a finger in his ear to make sure hed heard straight when he decided he had he shouted back the demon you say were his majestys soldiers dyou know whatll happen to you for lying in case he didnt the still invisible man at the head of the other army went into grisly detail im no liar you hamnet thyssen shouted back something even nastier it seemed to shock the other sides herald into silence hamnet gestured to runolf skallagrim ulric skakki and trasamund and a moment later to marcovefa ride with me he told them he raised his voice and called hold up to the rest of his force he and his handful of companions trotted towards the challenge he wasnt overwhelmingly surprised to find a party coming out from the other host to see who he was an officer wearing the hame of a dire wolf as a headpiece shouted what do you think youre doing interfering with his majestys army i told you were his majestys army hamnet produced the orders he had from sigvat ii and thrust them at the other man here do you read yes the officer in the wolfskin said angrily he snatched the parchment away from count hamnet then fear filled hamnet for a moment what if sigvat had reneged on his promises what if this force had orders to ignore one hamnet thyssen or to clap him in irons if gudrid had been working to get her way with the emperor it wasnt impossible it wasnt even unlikely as hamnet knew all too well but by the way the other officers eyes widened it hadnt happened hamnet blew out a fogfilled sigh of relief you see he said i see the other officer said unhappily youd better come with me and show this this thing to count endil endil gris hamnet asked thats right the officer said you know him uh your grace weve met hamnet answered endil gris was a warrior with a considerable reputation for his wars against the savages who raided raumsdalias southwestern frontier so far as hamnet knew endil had never fought in the north before sigvat must have figured a capable general on one border would prove just as capable on another maybe the emperor was right on the other hand maybe he wasnt come with me then the officer said you and your ah friends his gaze lingered longest on trasamund and marcovefa when he said that after a moment though he added you have some experience against these new barbarians ive heard is that right yes it is hamnet answered not happy experience not a lot of wins but experience i gather that puts me one up on count endil instead of answering the man in the wolfhame only grunted endil gris army put him one up or more than one on count hamnet endil had more soldiers than hamnet did many more and they were men with the look of regulars tough and composed and ready they thought for whatever lay ahead of them quite a few of endils men also had suntans that said theyd come up from the south with him they couldnt have turned so brown on northern duty anyhow endil himself wore a black leather patch over his left eye thyssen by god he said what are you doing here even in mittens his handclasp felt odd along with his eye he was also missing his right middle finger show him what im doing here hamnet told the officer in the wolfhame who still carried his orders reluctantly the man passed the parchment to endil gris count endil held it out at arms length to read it count hamnet had to do more and more of that himself when endil finished one of his bushy eyebrows leaped how the demon did you get the emperor to appoint you god of the north thats what this amounts to hamnet always did have a charming smile ulric skakki said endil glanced at him skakki isnt it as ulric nodded the veteran soldier went on ive heard of you for good and for well for not so good ulric skakki nodded again unembarrassed thats what life is all about dont you think i could say the same thing about you i wouldnt doubt it but endil gris gave his attention back to hamnet youve got all the authority you need dont you before hamnet could answer endil continued youve got it if i say youve got it anyway otherwise youre just a beggar with a bowl looking for a handout anywhere you can how to answer that if hamnet tried to bluff here he reckoned he would lose his man endil was not a man who gave way to bluffs if anything they enraged him and so count hamnet shrugged and said yes thats about the size of it his majestys right about one thing i know more about the rulers and how they fight than you do you couldnt very well know less ive never seen one of the buggers not yet count endil replied all ive heard about em is from people who ran away from them so i was going to do the best i could but he shrugged and spread his mittened hands ive seen them ive talked with them ive fought them ive run from them too its what you do when you lose hamnet thyssen said but some of the forces i was with almost won and i think weve got a wizard now who can stand up to anything they throw at us he gestured towards marcovefa the rulers they are not so much of a much she said in her curiously accented raumsdalian endil gris long somber mutilated face crinkled into an unexpected grin nice to know somebody thinks so anyway he rumbled everybody down in nidaros was shrieking about how they ate us up without salt he swung his good eye back towards count hamnet ill serve under you thyssen i think youve got a better chance of making this come out right than i do and what else matters plenty of other officers would have made that question anything but rhetorical to them their chance for fame and glory came ahead of anything else hamnet thought endil gris was a man of a different sterner school he hoped endil was if the oneeyed noble claimed he was hamnet couldnt afford to do anything but take him at his word thanks he said as long as weve got that settled lets go after the barbarians and give them what they deserve sounds good to me endil said one of his aides had been listening with more and more agitation but your grace the junior officer burst out this is your army are you going to let some some stranger take it away from you thyssens no stranger endil gris replied why did we come up here dalk to whip these rulers right out of their boots yes if count hamnet can do that ill stand behind him because im not sure i can but dalk didnt want to let it drop would you like to take it up with his majesty endil asked would you like to go back to nidaros and take it up with his majesty his aide recognized danger when it blew his way uh no your grace very good very good count endil was ponderously sarcastic in that case would you like to salute count hamnet thyssen and do everything you can to help him against these barbarians thats what i aim to do by god he did it after a moment so did dalk but rebellion still glittered in his eyes as he said may you lead us to victory your grace count hamnet knew what that meant he gave the unhappy dalk a thin smile dont worry about telling tales to the emperor if i lose hell hear them from better men than you i promise and he pulled me out of the dungeon to do this if he throws me in again what have i lost what has he lost dalks eyes went big and round he pulled you out of the dungeon id heard that endil gris said i hoped it wasnt true youre not the kind of man who ends up in one except maybe for telling the truth well you got the crime right the first time ulric skakki said such men are dangerous and if you dont believe me ask sigvat enough hamnet held up a hand only the rulers get anything if we start slanging each other youre right by god trasamund said we bizogots did that and we paid for it dalk and endil gris both eyed him as if to say so what they didnt want to listen to a bizogot do they really want to listen to me hamnet thyssen wondered ill find out then he realized marcovefa had told him he would get a real army before he got it how the demon had she known how could she have known shes a shaman thats how hamnet thought a strong one too by god maybe weve got a chance in spite of everything xx hamnets army reached the southern edge of the forest before the rulers broke out of it the raumsdalians rounded up more soldiers fleeing from the mammothriders count hamnet wasnt sure he was glad to have them he feared they hurt morale more than they swelled numbers some of them were eager enough to try conclusions against the rulers again more though babbled about barbarians spearing them from mammothback and about magic shaking ground and twisting weather in summer the forest mostly pine and fir and spruce was a dark green wave across the north of the raumsdalian empire in the winter snow cast a white veil of beauty over the same inhospitable countryside the trees thrived where even oats and rye wouldnt grow and went on thriving up till the ground stayed frozen the year around and the bizogot plains began within five minutes of count hamnets ordering the army to halt before going into the woods ulric skakki runolf skallagrim and endil gris all asked him the same question are you going to go in there after them or wait till they come out and hit them on better ground thats what im thinking about he answered and answered and answered suddenly he tried to snap his fingers inside his mittens it didnt work but he still smiled marcovefa he called what do you want she asked can you find out where in the forest the rulers are lurking she nodded yes i think i can they not belong here they leave trail show where they go where they are do that then please hamnet said in case she thought he was only asking a hypothetical question marcovefa muttered to herself in the strange dialect the folk who lived atop the glacier used she rubbed her horses ears why count hamnet couldnt have said unless it was to touch something that did belong to this part of the world after a moment she pointed north and a little west they are there she said in clear raumsdalian hearing her hamnet thyssen had no doubt she was right he looked to endil gris and runolf skallagrim he would have been ready to argue with either one or both had they chosen to disbelieve but they didnt each of them nodded in turn her certainty brought conviction with it how far hamnet asked marcovefa frowned and muttered to herself again a days journey no more she answered but they are not standing still they are heading this way she spoke in raumsdalian once more how do you know that runolf skallagrim asked her marcovefas frown got deeper she tried to explain and she did go on using the imperial language but what she said made little sense to hamnet or he could see to baron runolf or count endil what did blue fringes have to do with anything and why would there have been red fringes had the rulers been moving away instead of forward fringes on what runolf asked their clothes no no no marcovefa sounded frustrated their she couldnt find the raumsdalian word she wanted or even one in the regular bizogot tongue finally biting her lip in annoyance she came out with one in her own dialect that did neither hamnet nor runolf nor endil any good their auras ulric skakki suggested and went back and forth with her in her tongue for a few sentences she beamed yes their auras i thank you the way their spirits rub against the fur of the world the fur of the world endil gris still sounded confused and count hamnet couldnt blame him not when he was confused himself i think someone who spoke raumsdalian from birth would say the fabric of the world again ulric did the interpreting where marcovefa comes from there are no fabrics except felt runolf skallagrim asked a genuinely important question do they know were so close with an army thats ready for them no regardless of how strange marcovefas sorcery was she could be completely convincing when she wanted to by runolfs grin she convinced him now count endil also seemed satisfied even dalk whose family name hamnet had learned was njorun nodded thoughtfully we know where they are they dont know where we are hamnet said what could be better lets go get them nobody told him no or tried to talk him out of it he always remembered that the army was in good spirits as they rode into the woods he always remembered that too count hamnet always liked going into the northern forests he liked it all the better now that he had an army around him the clean spicy smells that came from the conifers fought the stink of soldiers and horses the fighting men and their mounts didnt smell so bad as they would have in the summertime but they smelled bad enough firs and spruces were better set scouts out ahead and to all sides ulric skakki advised we want to surprise them we dont want them surprising us yes mother dear hamnet answered ulric laughed and stuck out his tongue he didnt care if he annoyed count hamnet he only cared about not getting ambushed which hamnet had to admit was reasonable enough sending scouts up the road ahead of the army was easy enough sending them out on the flanks was anything but the road after all was there to make travel easier the horsemen trying to pick their way through the trees had a harder time of it audun gilli rode up alongside of count hamnet the wizard still acted nervous and embarrassed around him and still had good reason to nervous or not he spoke up now i cant feel the rulers anywhere ahead of us licking his lips he added neither can liv what are they doing hamnet thyssen asked marcovefa are they hiding themselves with magic if its a masking spell its a good one audun said better than any we use on this side of the glacier marcovefas nostrils flared as she breathed in deeply she might have been tasting the air trying to find the flavor of the rulers she pointed ahead and a little to the left the direction in which the road was taking the raumsdalian army they are there she said it is a masking spell but not so much of a masking spell not such a good masking spell turning to audun she asked you not feel the the empty moving along the road towards us in the empty that is where the rulers are audun started to chant a spell marcovefa gave him a different tune with words from her dialect he imitated them as best he could by the third try his pronunciation was good enough to suit her instead of practicing the charm any more he aimed it at the road ahead his jaw dropped in astonishment they really are there he exclaimed or the emptiness around them is anyhow he gave marcovefa an awkward bow in the saddle thank you ill take this back to liv by your leave however it pleases you marcovefa said indifferently that indifference pleased hamnet thyssen how had audun wormed his way into livs good graces and then into her bed by sharing magic with her by learning spells he didnt know and teaching ones she didnt hamnet didnt believe audun gilli could teach marcovefa anything what a shame he thought but he did ask if the rulers use magic to look for us theyll find us wont they i have a small masking on us maybe it serve maybe not better than their junk though marcovefa answered only a small one dont think we need any more the rulers too stupid even to think to look they werent stupid not to hamnet s way of thinking but they were arrogant they always seemed to underestimate their foes that could amount to the same thing it could if hamnet could bring home a victory push the scouts forward he ordered does anyone know if theres a large clearing anywhere between the rulers and us if there is i want to form my battle line there a couple of the men whod run from the invading barbarians stirred theres a wide place in the road two maybe three miles up one of them said youre going to face those bastards anywhere thats a pretty good spot the other soldier nodded if i remember straight theyre right ulric skakki said had he been everywhere in the northern reaches of the empire count hamnet wouldnt have been surprised and hearing him agree with the soldiers whod been so unenthusiastic about going north again came as no small relief all right well do that then hamnet said nodding he called to the trumpeters who directed the armys movements blow forward the martial notes rang out count hamnet urged his own horse ahead with pressure from his knees and with the reins he reached down to make sure his sword was loose in the scabbard it was of course he felt foolish for checking but he wasnt the only man making sure his weapons were ready when youd go into battle soon you wanted to be certain your tools wouldnt fail you he found the clearing where the soldiers and ulric said it would be it wasnt so wide as he might have wished but it would do he didnt think he would come across any better place to fight anyhow he put his armored lancers in the center with horse archers on either wing he also kept a reserve brigade he could rush to wherever it was most needed he was just getting his line the way he wanted it when a scout came galloping into the clearing theyre coming the raumsdalian shouted they arent far behind me as if to prove him right more frightenedlooking horsemen emerged be ready hamnet shouted well want to knock them back as soon as they start to deploy he turned to marcovefa do they know were here they know the scouts are she answered his exasperated snort sent steam from his nostrils as if he were a hardrunning horse i know that he said do they know this army is here she laughed of course not darling she said i keep telling you and telling you they are not very smart maybe they werent hamnet thyssen wasnt so sure about that but maybe they werent but they were very strong or they wouldnt have come so far so fast as arrogance could ape stupidity so strength could do duty for wisdom more and more riders burst into the clearing one was wounded while another rode a horse with an arrow in the rump then a man on a riding deer trotted into the open space all the way across it hamnet could see his leather armor and his thick dark curly beard he was a man of the rulers sure enough marcovefa proved right he hadnt known a raumsdalian army was on its way north at the sight of so many soldiers drawn up in neat ranks the enemy rider reined in frantically hamnet could read his thoughts he had to get away and warn his friends loose hamnet shouted a good many archers had already strung their bows almost in one motion they nocked and let fly the arrows sang through the air the warrior of the rulers had time to throw up his shield but it did him no good the ironheaded shafts pierced both him and his riding deer together they crumpled to the snow their blood streaked the clean whiteness and sent steam up into the air well theres one of the buggers down runolf skallagrim said he didnt seem so tough no hamnet thyssen agreed one by one or even a few at a time theyre nothing special but when you put a few of them together or more than a few for the next little while the rulers outriders drifted into the clearing by ones and twos and threes plainly their wizards had no idea an army awaited them there the raumsdalians started cracking jokes as they shot down the invaders if the rulers kept blundering into them in driblets they could keep killing barbarians till they ran out of arrows but it wouldnt last as hamnet knew too well a couple of warriors saw the carnage in the clearing soon enough to wheel their riding deer and bucket off to the north before the raumsdalians could slay them before long marcovefa said they know curse them now the real fight starts hamnet thyssen said marcovefa nodded the shaman from atop the glacier would bear a lot of the burden on the raumsdalian side hamnet bit his lip that was a great deal to ask of anyone and especially of a lover liv hadnt been able to shoulder such a weight try though she did the rulers proved too strong for her up on the bizogot plains hamnet had to hope the same thing wouldnt happen with marcovefa here the ground trembled beneath his horses hooves the beast snorted and shied as a low rumble filled the air and then vanished again some snow fell from the branches of the trees lining the clearing just what we need kormak bersi said a little earthquake right at the start of the battle somehow i dont think that was supposed to be a little earthquake count hamnet answered marcovefa nodded they want to squash us her teeth flashed as she grinned they not get what they want she looked towards the north now they come down on us they think we all she ran out of words but gestured flattened hamnet said flattened yes i thank you marcovefa smiled again for all the world as if a forgotten verb were the only thing she had to worry about a rumble came from the north more snow fell from tree branches on that side of the clearing the ground seemed to shake again this time marcovefa couldnt do anything about it but hamnet thyssen didnt expect her to with cries like horns full of spit the mammoths with warriors aboard them thundered into the clearing loose hamnet shouted once more pointing towards the great beasts hundreds of arrows hissed through the air as the mammoths had up on the bizogot plains they wore armor of leather dipped in boiling wax that kept most of the raumsdalian shafts from biting but not all wounded mammoths screams were even more bloodcurdling than their usual cries some of the great beasts pulled riders off their backs with their trunks and dashed them to the ground as if blaming them for the pain they suffered and if they thought that were they far wrong others broke formation one or two trampled down the riding deer on either flank smashing swaths of chaos through the rulers ranks but most of the mammoths kept coming in spite of the barrage of arrows forward hamnet thyssen shouted the raumsdalian trumpeters amplified the command momentum of your own was the best way to meet a charge even of mammoths hamnet wondered but by then his horse was already getting up into a gallop he knew he didnt want to try to withstand a line even a disarrayed line of charging mammoths on a horse that was standing still he also knew men on horseback could beat men on riding deer hed seen that up in the bizogot country it ought to be even more surely true here the raumsdalians being better trained better armored and better disciplined than the big blond barbarians who lived north of them nothing on this side of the glacier could withstand a charge by heavy cavalry those big horses suddenly didnt seem so big when men on mammothback shot down at riders from above and speared them out of the saddle with long long lances still the rulers didnt have it all their own way not even close count hamnet slashed at a mammoths leg hoping to hamstring the monster it didnt topple but a squall of torment rewarded him another rider thrust his lance deep into a mammoths unarmored belly even on so huge a beast that was bound to be a mortal wound blood poured from it in great gouts the mammoth sank to its knees then rolled over on its side something buzzed past count hamnet s head like an angry wasp that wasnt an arrow it was a slingstone the realization made him want to duck especially if made of lead those could be worse than arrows sometimes they sank into the wounds they created and disappeared you couldnt use a sling from horseback or mammothback or even he supposed deerback not if you hoped to hit anything hamnet looked around till he spotted the detachment of enemy slingers who had just come out of the forest and into the clearing where they had the room they needed to set up get them he shouted pointing their way but a lot of enemy warriors stood between the slingers and the raumsdalians he looked around for marcovefa can you take out the slingers he asked her she didnt even know what they were i have other things to worry about she answered muchly magickings hamnet thyssen hadnt felt any magic from the rulers now he realized why he hadnt keeping their wizards busy was much more important than knocking out their slingers who in the big scheme of things were no worse than nuisances so he told himself not knowing how bad a nuisance could be but he had other things to worry about too an unhorsed or undeered or unmammothed warrior of the rulers cut at him he took the blow on his shield and slashed back his stroke caught the enemy warrior in the side of the neck the warrior groaned and toppled spouting blood to me three tusk clan to me bizogots trasamund roared revenge is ours death to the rulers death cried his clansmates and the other bizogots from clans all across the frozen steppe death to the rulers they dealt out plenty of death too they steered clear of the mammoths at which hamnet thyssen could hardly complain but big men on big raumsdalian horses they worked a fearful slaughter against the archers mounted on the rulers riding deer the enemy warriors were brave enough and to spare no one ever questioned the rulers courage the horses towered over the deer though and gave the bizogots a decided closerange advantage over their foes shouting out his orders urging his men forward on the flanks and doing what he could to keep the mammoths from smashing through in the center count hamnet began to sense a certain agitation among the rulers even if their courage did not falter they were used to prevailing by strength of sorcery as well as strength of arms whatever they were used to though they werent having their magical way today off behind the enemy line to the right hamnet watched one of the rulers who carried himself with even more arrogance than was usual for that arrogant breed screaming at four or five other men they had to be wizards even if they didnt deck themselves out in fringes like bizogot shamans or in the fancy gowns raumsdalian sorcerers sometimes wore and at the moment they were mightily unhappy wizards too one of them pointed towards the raumsdalian line pointed in marcovefas general direction in fact hamnet thyssen couldnt hear what he said and didnt speak his language anyhow that didnt mean hamnet didnt understand oh no theyve got a wizard whos holding us up thats what the trouble is the enemy officer didnt buy a word of it he did some more screaming he did everything but jump up and down in the trampled snow when screaming didnt satisfy him he slugged the wizard whod dared tell him the truth he kicked him when he was down too then stepped away in magnificent contempt hamnet watched the wizard slowly and painfully rise he wasnt so sure he would have wanted to be that officer highranking men who made their subordinates hate them suffered a startling number of unfortunate accidents that was true among raumsdalians and bizogots anyway if the rulers partook of ordinary human nature it was probably so for them too he glanced over to marcovefa who seemed to be enjoying herself in the thick of the fighting maybe you should get back he told her they know what youre doing theyll try to get you let them try she said gaily hamnet thyssen would have argued with her more but endil grabbed him by the arm and pointed to the closest mammoth come on thyssen the other count yelled if we swing in behind that bugger we can hamstring it do you think so hamnet said but he was already booting his horse forward alongside endil gris he slashed at the mammoths hairy column of a leg so did endil the mammoth didnt crumple as hed seen one of the great beasts do but it did scream in pain and lumber away from its tormentors the warriors of the rulers on top of the mammoth shouted in their guttural incomprehensible tongue they tried to get it to return to its duty a mammoth was not like a man though it understood nothing of such notions all it wanted to do was get away from what pained it not bad endil gris said and then why do these curlybearded maniacs ride deer instead of horses i dont think there are any horses beyond the glacier count hamnet answered i dont remember seeing any anyhow i suppose they tamed the best beasts they could find thats all you may be right you sound like you make sense anyhow endil said they arent as good as horses though we can whip these bastards how did they beat us before we must have messed up magic hamnet thyssen said they have better wizards than we do or they did till marcovefa he looked around to make sure she was all right shed never seen a horse till she came down from the glacier either shed never seen any beast larger than a fox she made a pretty good rider though and she had no trouble staying away from the rulers and much more to the point fending off the spells their wizards threw at her as long as hamnet saw her well and unhampered he could go back to the business of fighting the enemy without a worry if he fell endil gris or runolf skallagrim would take over and make about as good a general as he did he was valuable to the raumsdalian cause marcovefa was indispensable he understood the difference he hoped she did too not far away audun gilli traded swordstrokes with a warrior of the rulers on a riding deer no one would even think audun was a firstrate horseman or a firstrate swordsman he was keeping the enemy fighting man from killing him but that was about all hamnet thyssen rode towards them the warrior of the rulers steered his deer away not wanting to fight two at once audun gilli gave hamnet a wry grin i didnt think you cared your grace the wizard said count hamnet couldnt even say he would be sorry to see audun dead because he could imagine plenty of ways he wouldnt he could say i dont want anyone from the rulers to do you in without telling any lies so he did youd rather do it yourself if it gets done audun suggested as a matter of fact yes hamnet thyssen answered the wizard bit down on his lower lip if hed thought he would get some soothing hypocrisy he need to think again another slingstone buzzed past hamnet he pointed towards the dismounted men behind the enemy line can you do anything about them he asked theyre hurting us i can try auduns quick spell was only a small one it did no more than whip up snow into the slingers faces but that put them off for a while anyhow he sent hamnet a real smile this time maybe the first one hed given him since taking liv away its nothing big and it works mostly because the strong wizards are all busy doing other things it does what it needs to do and no ones complaining except those godcursed slingers hamnet said if you stay up at the front of the battle line try not to get yourself killed right away all right ill do my best audun answered are you sure you mean it right away i told you count hamnet said liv wouldnt come back to me even if you did so you may as well live for now we need you for now would you want her back since youve got marcovefa the wizard asked that question probably deserved more serious consideration than it would get on the battlefield i dont know if i want her back so much hamnet thyssen said i want not to have lost her in the first place if you know what i mean dyou see the difference i may yes i think so audun gilli replied i wasnt trying to steal her from you you know if she didnt want to go she wouldnt have looked at me not that way anyhow count hamnet believed him but what was meant to be reassuring proved more dismaying than otherwise gudrid had been ready to go and she went liv had been ready to go and she went too why cant i keep a woman what will make marcovefa decide its time for her to leave those questions wouldnt get answered on a battlefield either the lull that had given him a minute or two to talk with the wizard ended more warriors of the rulers swarmed towards him on their riding deer the mounts werent everything they might have been but the men on them were as fierce as shortfaced bears hamnet had to fight for his life again slashing with his sword keeping his shield between his vitals and the enemys weapons and once smashing it into the face of a soldier he couldnt stop any other way he picked up a cut over his eye that stung like vitriol and half blinded him as it bled his sole consolation was that it could have been worse it could have split his skull and it almost had a slingstone thudded off his shield he felt it all the way up his arm to his shoulder audun was fighting hard too fighting too hard to keep on harassing the slingers count hamnet swore under his breath not keeping that spell on would get raumsdalians hurt but he didnt know what he could do about it audun gilli was he grudgingly supposed allowed to keep himself alive if he could with a little luck raumsdalian horsemen would ride down the slingers before long anyhow they were bending the rulers on riding deer back and back on their flanks if they could surround the enemy altogether this whole army might get wiped out not even sigvat ii could complain about that hamnet supposed he couldnt worry about the emperor either a warrior on a mammoth came much too close to skewering him with a long lance he couldnt do anything about that but duck hack at the spearshaft and sidestep his horse to get out of the way he shook his head angry at himself if you didnt pay attention to what was going on around you you almost deserved to get speared was marcovefa paying as much attention as she should this was her first big battle did she know enough to stay alive on the field where had she disappeared to anyway count hamnet stared across the field in growing alarm spotting her he sighed in relief that was all right but then quite suddenly it wasnt any more he chanced to be looking her way when a slingstone caught her in the side of the head it was a glancing blow if it hadnt been it would have smashed in her skull like a hammer smashing a rotten melon yet even a glancing blow proved quite bad enough she swayed in the saddle and started to crumple to the ground no hamnet howled a cry of despair both for himself and for the fight a raumsdalian trooper held marcovefa upright if she did fall off her horse shed soon get trampled by friends and foes impartially hamnet spurred towards her hacking past any enemy warriors who tried to stand against him he saw them less as foemen than as obstacles like boulders and tree trunks hullo your grace the trooper said when hamnet rode up he was one of the men whod run from the rulers once and been forced back into the army at kjelvik she got one right in the pot im afraid i saw it hamnet thyssen answered grimly he shook marcovefa her limbs were as limp as a fresh corpses his thumb found her wrist her pulse still throbbed and strongly she lived anyhow he had a skin with beer in it on his belt holding it to her lips he wished it were wine she choked but then swallowed her eyelids fluttered but she wasnt awake not in any real sense of the word count hamnet had no idea how badly she was hurt he was neither healer nor wizard he hoped the rulers didnt know how badly she was hurt when she got knocked cold what happened to the sorcery that held their spells at bay wouldnt it dissolve like mist on a hot day how long would they need to realize that he got the answer faster than he wanted to it wasnt quite a shout of triumph echoing across the battlefield but it might as well have been as soon as the enemy wizards found they could at last work unhindered here they did and the battle which had inclined towards the raumsdalians swung the rulers way as well the trooper grabbed count hamnets left arm the one that wasnt steadying marcovefa he pointed into the cloudy sky by god he shouted did you see that did you see it maybe because hamnet was holding marcovefa maybe because he was too stubborn to yield easily to anyones magic he hadnt seen anything what he asked his heart sinking a teratorn the trooper cried its claws almost tore my eyes out dont be ridiculous hamnet said there are never any teratorns on a battlefield till the fightings over for a couple of heartbeats the trooper looked doubtful he knew that too once someone reminded him of it but then he ducked and quivered another one he yelled and hamnet thyssen saw it too and felt the wind of its passage and smelled the stench of corruption clinging to its feathers was it there was it real if he thought it was if his senses told him it was how could he doubt it who could guess what the wizards of the rulers could do with no one there to thwart them cries of dismay came from all over the field whatever the enemys wizards were doing here they were doing everywhere fear seemed to rise up from the ground like a poisonous fog and choke the flame of raumsdalian hopes which had burned so bright a moment before desperately count hamnet looked around for audun gilli and liv and the wizards endil gris had brought north with him they probably wouldnt be able to beat the rulers wizards nobody but marcovefa had done that but they might slow down the enemys sorcery and give the raumsdalians a chance to do with weapons what they couldnt now with magic there was audun incanting as if his life depended on it which was no doubt all too true a puff of snow leaped up from nowhere and hit him in the face almost the same trick hed used against the rulers slingers it wasnt deadly but it made audun cough and splutter and clap his mittened hands to his face to get snow out of his eyes while he was busy with that he couldnt chant or make passes when he started again he got another sorcerous snowball right between the eyes where was liv hamnet thyssen couldnt see her or the raumsdalian wizards he was sure they were doing all they could liv herself had her share and more of stern bizogot courage whatever she and the raumsdalians were doing wasnt enough even hamnet felt despair and darkness rising inside him like mold crawling up a dank board hoping against hope the only kind of hope he had left he shook marcovefa if only she would come back to herself everything might yet be saved she moaned and muttered something but didnt wake for all he knew her skull was broken she might stay like this for days or months or years or she might die in the next few minutes no god hamnet whispered as if god were in the habit of paying any attention to what he wanted he leaned over and kissed marcovefa the familiar feel of his lips didnt do much she murmured again what could have been the ghost of a smile flitted across her face for a moment then it was gone as if it had never been hamnet thyssen swore softly he might have known his kisses held no magic whats wrong thyssen runolf skallagrim cried our wizards down curse it hamnet answered then were ruined runolf was no coward not without magic curdling his marrow but he wheeled his horse and rode off to the south as fast as it would go all at once the rulers riding deer seemed bigger and fiercer than raumsdalian war horses rationally hamnet knew that couldnt be so but terror drowned common sense its only magic his mind yammered it was magic but it wasnt only the mammoths seemed twenty thirty fifty feet high and broad in proportion the raumsdalian army melted away like the snow when spring finally came to the bizogot steppe it was flee or die flee or be overwhelmed by what didnt seem to be phantasms at all and once flight started it took on a momentum of its own hamnet thyssen was one of the last to leave the field he brought marcovefa away in his arms even he or maybe especially he knew a disaster when he saw one xxi hammnet thyssen and what was left of his army made it out of the woods again the one and only piece of good news he took from the lost battle was that the rulers didnt press their pursuit maybe that showed how close theyd come to losing if it did well so what they hadnt lost and when would the empire get out of the woods not soon count hamnet feared hed had his chance to stop the barbarians had it and failed with it now raumsdalia lay open to invasion once more he wouldnt get this army to fight again not the way it had he looked around to see whod lived through the battle he didnt see endil gris or kormak bersi either where was marcomer the leaping lynx bizogot liv was here she had a bandage on her forehead a sword slash someone had told hamnet even though she wasnt his anymore he didnt like to think of that stern beauty marred maybe audun gilli knew a spell to hide scars or defeat them altogether hamnet could hope so anyhow trasamund was telling anyone who would listen about the slaughter hed wreaked on the rulers all the slaughter in the world though wouldnt give him back his clan he had to know that maybe the tale kept him from brooding about it so much silent as a snowflake ulric skakki appeared behind hamnet the adventurer had a cut on his right arm and one on his right cheek he spoke out of the left side of his mouth shes awake by god count hamnet said thats the first thing thats gone right in awhile how is she she asked the same thing about you ulric answered she wanted to come see you but shes still too wobbly on her pins ill go to her hamnet hurried away marcovefa sat on a wounded horse that had foundered and died theyd laid her on the animal when they stopped here to keep her out of the snow and in the hope that what was left of its warmth would help her maybe it had hamnet wasnt sure about anything anymore except that he was glad to see her with reason in her eyes how are you he and she asked the same question at the same time they both smiled if his smile was as shaky as hers he wouldnt have been a bit surprised my head hurts marcovefa touched her temple very lightly then jerked her hand away i believe it hamnet thyssen said a slingstone got you i told you to move farther back from the fighting to his amazement her smile got wider so you people say i told you so too not just us on top of the glacier we say it hamnet answered sometimes we have reason to say it well yes she waved that aside as casually as if theyd been married for years what happened after i got hurt they threw magic at us they threw fear at us we lost hamnet said why do you think were down here without you we lost without you he wondered how to go on without you it wouldnt have mattered so much if we won i like you too but fight is more important now marcovefa said count hamnet bit his lip but he couldnt even tell her she was wrong she looked around can we fight more no hamnet said bluntly even with your magic i dont think we could make the men stand and fight again soon the stone knocked you out you didnt feel the fear the rulers threw at us i felt it i held it off she said what that would have been like hadnt occurred to hamnet thyssen maybe he was lucky marcovefa shook her head very very carefully dont think i can do it again now head hurts too much all scrambled up in there i believe it you almost got scrambled for good hamnet said this much over he held his hands maybe three digits apart and the stone doesnt hit you sideways i know marcovefa looked unhappy i fight the magic to a standstill and a stupid rock does for me not seem fair count hamnet wouldnt have argued where was god while all this was going on probably on holiday at the golden shrine there was no sign of him here marcovefa went on what do we do now then well i suppose i have to send messengers back to nidaros and let sigvat know we lost hamnet sighed im really looking forward to that you did everything you could we all did everything we could marcovefa said we lost it happens happens up on top of the glacier too when the emperor sends someone he doesnt like out to do a job that fellow better do it hamnet thyssen said if he doesnt the emperor will blame him otherwise sigvat would have to blame himself and the next time he does that will be the first as long as i dont get my head knocked we win marcovefa said but you did hamnet thyssen answered and we didnt dont do it ulric skakki said when count hamnet chose a messenger to deliver the bad news i have to hamnet said stolidly no dont runolf skallagrim agreed well go back to kjelvik if we hold there everything will look a lot better how many of the towns in the woods held hamnet said what does the rulers magic do to walls what will sigvat do to you when he finds out you lost ulric skakki returned which echoed hamnets thoughts uncomfortably well wont the wizard from the north hold those buggers off runolf asked not for a while she cant do anything much in the way of magic now hamnet answered she came too close to getting her head broken like a dropped egg how long do we have to wait runolf sounded suddenly apprehensive no way to tell ulric skakki said before count hamnet could reply you get hit in the head you could be all right in a day or two or you could go on having headaches and such for weeks you sound like someone who knows what hes talking about hamnet remarked and dont i wish i didnt ulric said ive got clobbered more times than i wish i had ill say that probably why im the way i am today hamnet by contrast had got hit in the heart too often he reflected that he probably would again did you ever get used to such wounds could you liv hadnt hurt him so badly as gudrid but that wasnt because hed got hardened in the intervening years far from it the only difference was gudrid took a malicious glee in tormenting him while liv seemed sorry shed decided she had to go being sorry didnt stop her of course when did it ever trasamund methodically cleaned blood from his sword and honed it against a whetstone to sharpen the edge and get the nicks out he nodded to hamnet well have another go at them he said we almost licked em this time by god yes hamnet let it go at that he didnt want to lower the spirits of anyone who stayed ready to carry on but he couldnt help thinking that a horse which almost escaped a sabertooth got eaten just the same and no matter what ulric said count hamnet sent the courier off to nidaros sigvat ii needed to know what had happened up in the woods for better or for worse for better and for worse the fate of the empire rested in his hands and after that hamnet hunted up runolf skallagrim tomorrow morning he said well go down to kjelvik the way you said about the best thing we can do agreed the commandant of that town at least well have somewhere to fight from the walls in tolerable shape youve seen it for gods sake and weve still got a lot of food in the granaries and well be bringing back some more in the supply wagons that was my next question hamnet thyssen said how good were the rulers at siege warfare they were nomads like the bizogots he couldnt imagine them settling down around kjelvik and building catapults and siege towers the way a raumsdalian army would but after a little thought he could imagine them knocking down the walls with sorcery how soon would marcovefa be able to stop them if they tried runolf had a different thought what if they just go on by us go deeper into the empire they wouldnt do that hamnet exclaimed by which he meant he wouldnt do that himself but the rulers they might be a different story so what if they had enemy soldiers behind them if they were confident they could beat any force that came up against them why would they worry and wouldnt they have more warriors moving down into raumsdalia off the bizogot plains im full of cheerful notions today hamnet thyssen thought nothing like losing a battle to bring such ideas bubbling to the surface like noxious gases from the asphalt pits of the far southwest wounded mens moans did nothing to lift his spirits he spotted audun gilli doing what he could to help some of the worsthurt men with his magic after a while audun looked up and nodded to him the wizard looked weary and who could blame him a yawn that surprised count hamnet told him how weary he was himself he also realized how hungry he was he had a couple of hard rolls in a belt pouch they were even harder now than they had been when they went in there men were carving steaks from dead horses and roasting them if you were used to beef and mutton horsemeat tasted like glue if youd eaten all kinds of strange things to keep your belly full horsemeat wasnt half bad count hamnet took out his belt knife and haggled a chunk off the haunch of an animal dead on its side in bloody snow the meat burnt on the outside raw in the middle wasnt good even of its kind he ate it anyway then he got a chunk for marcovefa she didnt show her usual wolfish appetite that worried him head hurts too much she said he grimaced he couldnt do anything about that however much he wished he could they slept bizogotstyle with furs over them and snow heaped up to the north to hold away the breath of god the wind didnt blow too hard it was as if even god had forgotten about raumsdalia and as for hamnet thyssen hed never spent a lonelier night in someone elses arms when morning came he asked for volunteers to go north and spy out what the rulers were doing he wondered if he would get any more than a little to his own surprise he did were like fleas one of them said a lot of the time we arent worth smacking he grinned he couldnt have been more than eighteen to him it had to seem more like an adventure a game than something where he could lose his life with the bulk of the army with the bulk of what was left of the army count hamnet marched south and east towards kjelvik he rode close by marcovefa in case she needed help staying in the saddle up till this summer shed never ridden or even imagined riding was possible she didnt look happy now who with a nearly broken skull would have but she rode and kjelvik didnt seem particularly happy to see the returning soldiers either fleeing men had got there before the army did and had spread word of the disaster it suffered why did you go out there to lose someone yelled at hamnet thyssen when he rode back into the town were his bow strung he would have shot the obnoxious leatherlunged pest no one went out to lose a battle half the commanders who fought though ended up with what they didnt want hamnet had wound up in that unhappy number even if not on purpose a stone in the house behind the hecklers head suddenly sported a mouth in a vicious whiny imitation of his voice it squawked why did you screw that broad next door what i never but the local looked horrified and the man standing next to him who was both larger and better muscled looked first suspicious and then furious hamnet thyssen rode on before he learned how that drama turned out he looked around for audun gilli when he spotted the wizard he nodded his thanks hed never thought he would do that not after audun took liv from him but he did life was full of surprises not all of them as nasty as one would think the garrison cooks came up with meals tastier than charred horseflesh a bed in a room off the barracks made a better place to sleep with marcovefa than snowcovered ground a charcoal brazier gave the chamber at least a little warmth how are you he asked as the two of them sat down on the bed hurts marcovefa answered matteroffactly not tonight i have a headache hamnet wondered if he was losing his wits or just too tired to see straight hed seldom felt less lecherous he might want to hang on to marcovefa through the night for reassurance and warmth which was in short supply despite the brazier anything more could wait for the next year or two by the way his eyelids sagged sometimes things looked better after you woke up in the morning this wasnt one of those times for count hamnet the brazier had run out of fuel during the night which left the room as cold as the inside of a snowball almost as cold as the inside of sigvat s heart hamnet still remembered defeat much too well and when he looked over at marcovefa lying there beside him the bruise on the side of her head was much too plain he lay quiet letting her sleep as long as she would her eyes opened about half an hour later she smiled at him and said i need to piss so do i he answered i didnt want to bother you how do you feel not so bad marcovefa said but she winced when she sat up and then stood not so good either she used the pot first as usual she was much less selfconscious about such things than raumsdalians or even ordinary bizogots on that mountain up above the glacier privacy wasnt even a word what do we do now she asked as hamnet got up and eased himself lick our wounds was the first thought that came to mind try to find out what the rulers are doing he said out loud it had the virtue of sounding better anyhow see if we have to stand siege here can we marcovefa asked a much too pointed question for a while anyhow hamnet thyssen said till were relieved or till their magic knocks down the wall or till your magic comes back if yours comes back soon we can last a lot longer she frowned in concentration then shook her head then winced again regretting that with a sigh that puffed fog from her mouth even indoors she said not there yet like my head all clogged up inside youre lucky you really dont have a rock in there hamnet said this is luck marcovefa started to shake her head once more but thought better of it with luck the stone misses with luck we win the fight hamnet had had those thoughts when someone told him something bad was really lucky all it boiled down to was well things could be worse he supposed they could that didnt make them wonderful the way they were lets go get something to eat he said yes she said but the thought of breakfast didnt cheer her up either food makes me she couldnt find the word but mimed puking nauseated hamnet supplied nauseated yes i thank you she said but i try to eat i am a fire inside i need dung to burn a plains bizogot would have said the same thing it still sounded odd in hamnet s ears come on he said lets see what theyve got as in most towns where armies have suddenly arrived breakfast was uninspiring oatandrye porridge with not enough butter or salt and a mug of sour beer didnt satisfy hamnets tongue his stomach though quieted down there was enough for the moment anyhow marcovefa ate without complaint even though the food was strange to her you have so much she said you get food and you dont have to hunt for it even in wintertime do you know how lucky you are plains bizogots said the same thing they had enough themselves to appreciate how much more the raumsdalians enjoyed and to want it for themselves marcovefas tone was different her folk had so little up there atop the glacier she might have come to the empire from the dark side of the moon she was beyond jealousy everything she saw surprised her she didnt always admire it because you dont hunt so much i see some of you sit around and get fat you had better watch out such people are good only for roasting your foes will feast on you if you are not careful count hamnets stomach did a slow lurch hed managed to make himself forget his prized shaman his prized lover had eaten enemy clansmen no doubt those foes had also devoured men from her clan did that mean what shed done was any better maybe a little hamnet thought and then she said if i ever catch the scut who hit me with that stone ill eat his liver without salt a raumsdalian would have meant it for a joke an ordinary bizogot would have too though a raumsdalian who heard her might have wondered marcovefa was dead serious and if she did find that slinger he would be dead too dead and butchered toward noon a scout rode in theyre out of the woods he reported we skirmished a little and then fell back are they heading for kjelvik count hamnet demanded tensely could he stand siege here if he couldnt he would have to retreat now if he did sigvat ii would have one more reason not to love him but the scout shook his head no uh your grace theyre going southeast across country you ask me sir theyre heading straight for nidaros can we strike at their flank then hamnet aimed the question more at himself than at the rider whod just come in regretfully he rejected the idea his men had no spirit for another fight yet and without marcovefas sorcerous aid they might as well have gone into battle without shields against an army of archers what do we do if we dont hit them your grace the scout asked the question was more pointed than hamnet thyssen wished it were wait for the axe to drop was the first answer that sprang to mind he didnt come out and say that he feared the scout would believe him worse he feared he would believe himself ill talk with the others was what he did say and that satisfied the scout who didnt see or didnt want to see how little it told him when count hamnet gathered ulric skakki trasamund and runolf skallagrim none of them seemed eager to assail the advancing enemy if trasamund in particular held back that told hamnet the thing couldnt be done and the bizogot jarl did no point hitting em unless we hit em hard and we cant right now curse it he said unhappily looks that way to me too im afraid ulric skakki said and to me runolf agreed if were going to get squashed if we poke our noses outside the walls well then we dont thats all had hamnet thyssen had any great hopes of victory he would have argued against the others since he didnt he accepted their argument sometimes the best thing you could do was nothing he did send another courier down to nidaros warning that the rulers were loose in the empire below the northern woods and that he lacked the force to do anything about it maybe a miracle will happen he told ulric maybe the emperor will send me more soldiers dont wait up expecting them or youll get mighty sleepy the adventurer replied hell probably yell for your head instead for not doing enough with what he was generous enough to give you before yes that thought crossed my mind too count hamnet said what am i supposed to do then well if you want to go to the chopper or back to the dungeon you just do what dear sweet lovable sigvat tells you to do ulric said if you dont you do something else if you dont feel like getting chopped ill go with you for whatever you think thats worth if you do youre on your own hamnet thyssen set a hand on his shoulder a gesture of affection and appreciation he rarely used thanks im not going to let sigvat wreck me or the empire not if i can help it youve got a chance to keep him from wrecking you ulric skakki said if he doesnt wreck you hell have a harder time wrecking raumsdalia anyway but youve got to worry about yourself first you can do something about yourself right this minute you cant do much about the whole bloody empire the empire was going to get bloodier count hamnet couldnt do much about that either not till marcovefas wits unscrambled if they ever did congratulations he told himself you just found something brand new to worry about he sighed up till now ive always put the empire first i still do i guess but yes but ulric said one thing you still need to figure out is theres a difference between the empire and the emperor raumsdalia can go on without sigvat ii even if sigvats too cursed dumb to see that for himself since hamnet thyssen hadnt seen if for himself he maintained what he hoped was a discreet silence even if not just sigvat but his dynasty perished the raumsdalian empire could go on sometimes a truth was too obvious to be easy to see sometimes in the woods a mastodon was next to invisible but then it would lift its trunk and trumpet and everyone for a long way in all directions would know where it stood at least i know where i stand hamnet thought that would have to do for now who do you think hates me more right this minute he asked ulric the rulers or his majesty well it depends ulric said judiciously on what on whether your messenger has got to nidaros yet oh count hamnet weighed that then he nodded yes im afraid so youre not afraid enough to suit sigvat ulric said thats one of the reasons he doesnt like you there was an understatement of almost cosmic proportions even the adventurer seemed relieved to change the subject hows your lady love about how youd expect after almost getting her head smashed hamnet replied he hesitated then asked hows liv doing shell heal shell have a scar its a shame shes a nicelooking woman and no in case youre trying to find some reason to come after me with a hatchet i never slept with her she is anyway ulric skakki raised an eyebrow you dont need to ask me you know you could talk with her yourself shes not like gudrid she doesnt aim to carve chunks off you every time she opens her mouth i understand that hamnet said as steadily as he could i still havent decided whether it makes things better or worse even the glib ulric skakki had no quick and clever retort for that count hamnet was doing up his trousers as he came out of the garderobe when one of runolf skallagrims junior officers spotted him oh there you are your grace the very young subaltern exclaimed here i am all right hamnet agreed and why does it make any difference that i happen to be here because the baron needs to see you right away sir the junior officer said hes got six or eight men out looking for you does he hamnet said with a marked lack of enthusiasm that could only mean something had gone wrong two possibilities leaped to mind he wondered which was the more appalling well i suppose id better go see him then follow me your grace the youngster hurried off so fast hamnet thyssen had very little choice but to follow him he stopped in front of runolfs door as abruptly as hed sped away when hamnet came up a few heartbeats later the fellow said go on in sir i know hes expecting you im so glad to hear it hamnet said what a liar im turning into in my old age he wasnt that old but some days felt as if they added years he worked the latch and went inside as hed feared a man with the look of an imperial courier waited with runolf skallagrim morning thyssen runolf said trying to pretend he knew hamnet not at all well it certainly is hamnet said more or less at random he inclined his head to the man who looked like a courier i dont think weve met no i dont think so either im gunnlaug jofrid the man said i have orders to take you back to nidaros hamnet looked at him no what by the way gunnlaug gaped hamnet might have used a word in the language of the rulers its a technical term hamnet explained not unkindly it means well no you cant say that gunnlaug burst out his majesty commands it listen carefully watch the way my lips move no but you cant disobey the emperor gunnlaug jofrid said as if it were a law of nature oh i cant eh im afraid well just have to see about that hamnet said what will you do where will you go every mans hand will be raised against you all over the empire then ill leave hamnet thyssen said ive done it before his majesty wont be sorry to see me do it again gunnlaug looked doubtful to say the least thats not what my orders say and how do i know youll really do it anyhow how do i know you wont turn around and go somewhere and raise a rebellion that would be worth my neck he wasnt wrong he was in fact bound to be right well you can come with me hamnet suggested then youll be able to say you saw me ride up onto the bizogot plain with your own eyes youd rather go up there than down to nidaros gunnlaug seemed to have trouble believing his ears if i go down to nidaros sigvat will either throw me back in the dungeon or kill me count hamnet said if i go up into the bizogot country maybe the rulers will kill me but maybe they wont too and at least ill be able to fight back any which way im better off is that plain enough or shall i get a stick of charcoal and some parchment and draw you a picture youre making fun of me gunnlaug jofrids voice went shrill hamnet looked at runolf skallagrim nothing gets by him does it gunnlaug spluttered indignantly ignoring him count hamnet went on sorry this is awkward for you i can see how you might not want to meet the chopper just yet or any time at all to tell you the truth runolf said if you think im going to go to the back of beyond with you gunnlaug began the other choice is killing you right now hamnet thyssen broke in the courier shut up with a snap hamnet eyed runolf again i didnt know i was so persuasive maybe id better stash the poor fellow in the guardhouse till youre ready to leave runolf said wouldnt want him complicating your life even worse than it is already would we this is an outrage gunnlaug said an outrage i tell you when the emperor finds out what youve done he broke off had count hamnet the couriers boots he would have stopped some time sooner the snow wouldnt melt for months up here a body that went into a drift wouldnt see the light of day till spring and spring came late in these parts hamnet wondered whether he could afford to take the courier along if the fellow kept trying to escape well there was plenty of snow up in the forest too do stick him in the guardhouse runolf hamnet said that will give me time to see who all wants to come along and to load pack horses easier than running off before were ready ill take care of it runolf promised and he did hamnet rode out of kjelvik the next day marcovefa rode with him so did ulric skakki audun gilli and liv came out side by side trasamund went along as did a few of the other bizogots most of the leaping lynxes who still lived stayed behind though judging their chances better inside the empire than back up on the frozen steppe hamnet thyssen had to hope they were wrong also accompanying his band was gunnlaug jofrid the imperial courier said do you really imagine you can get away with this as a matter of fact yes count hamnet answered i cant believe sigvat will send an army up into the bizogot country after me can you hed better not trasamund rumbled hed better not even think about it by god wed swarm down into raumsdalia and tear his precious empire up by the roots if he tried the very idea he snorted in disgust ulric skakki snorted too though quietly an amused smile played over his features for a moment hamnet understood why poor trasamund had forgotten something with the bizogot clans shattered by the rulers the big blonds would swarm into the empire only as refugees or perhaps as vassals and hirelings of the mammothriders the bizogots independent power would be a long time reviving if it ever did the rulers were still trickling down into raumsdalia count hamnet s band rode past several small groups of them even before it reached the edge of the woods hamnet led enough men to make the rulers think twice about quarreling with him he wasnt sure whether that pleased trasamund or disappointed him plunging into the forest again felt strange not far ahead lay the clearing where his army had battled the rulers to a standstill till that one unlucky slingstone took marcovefa out of the fight and let the wizards from beyond the glacier use the spells shed blocked up till then she didnt remember much about what had gone on here hamnet doubted she ever would hed seen that loss of memory before in people whod taken blows to the head more often than not it was a mercy marcovefa didnt look at it that way i want to know what i did she complained i want to know what all they magicked at me i want to know what i magicked at them i know i was doing good these rulers are not so tough but i want to know maybe hamnet thyssen had to pause because talking while he was gritting his teeth was hard he made himself unclench his jaw and go on maybe you could ask liv and audun gilli if anyone on our side knows theyre the ones marcovefa kissed him that made him glad hed said what he had he hadnt thought anything could i do that she said she rode over to the raumsdalian wizard and the bizogot shaman count hamnet turned his head and looked the other way he could suggest it but he couldnt like it she was still talking with them when hamnet s band came to the battlefield ravens flew away croaking like big black frogs a shortfaced bear looked up from a meal of well hamnet hoped the beast was eating a dead warrior of the rulers the bear growled a warning at the newcomers when they took no notice of it it loped away long legs carrying it off at least as fast as a horse could trot marcovefa came back to count hamnet yes she does now but for how long he wondered would he ever be able to get these doubts out of his head she said this is where we fought thats right he nodded i remember the place i remember the the mammoths she had to cast about for the word i remember the fear the foe threw but even after i talk i dont remember the fight she slammed a fist down on her thigh in frustration i want to i dont know what to do about that hamnet said in lieu of i dont think anyone can do anything about that they pressed on to the north a strange truce held whenever they passed bands of rulers coming down into raumsdalia once a fellow who was pretty plainly a wizard stared at marcovefa even in her damaged state he knew her for what she was when she bared her teeth at him in what was almost a smile he flinched the rulers were made of stern stuff whatever else you said about them that didnt happen every day the trees began to thin out the customs post at the tree line was a burned ruin to the north as far as the eye could see and hamnet knew far beyond that stretched the snowcovered gently rolling terrain of the bizogot steppe here we are again he said to ulric skakki never loses its charm does it the adventurer returned how can you lose what you havent got hamnet thyssen said ulric laughed xxii gunnlaug jofrid rode back towards the south count hamnet didnt much want to let him go he feared the courier would land runolf skallagrim in trouble but the only other choice did seem to be slaughtering gunnlaug and hamnet didnt have the stomach for it not in cold blood dont worry it will probably work out all right audun gilli told him easy for you to say hamnet growled runolf is a friend of mine i dont like running out and leaving him in the lurch i dont think you are the wizard answered by the time gunnlaug gets down to nidaros again if he ever does how many rulers will be between him and kjelvik with the worst will in the world how much can sigvat do to your friend hamnet thyssen thought that over his nod was grudging but it was a nod well youve got something there he said and worried about it less too late now to do anything but what hed done anyhow now we find our fellow bizogots our fellow sufferers trasamund boomed he seemed to have no doubts about what came next we fire them with our fury and we lead them to victory against the accursed invaders he made it sound easy had it been easy the bizogots would have done it when the rulers first swarmed down through the cleft trasamund was always one to overlook details like that ulric skakki said finding enough to eat through the winter here ought to be interesting all by itself we bizogots dont starve trasamund declared except when we do liv had a better grasp on reality than the jarl did hamnet had known that for a long time she went on even with our herds it isnt always easy and well have to hunt without mammoths and musk oxen to fall back on dire wolves do it so can we trasamund said we can rob them too ulric said whats left of a musk ox or a baby mammoth or one of the rulers riding deer that strayed will feed us for a while for a while hamnet thought when the breath of god blew hard from the north up here folk needed more food than they did down in nidaros with fireplaces and braziers and double walls handy to hold cold at bay you had to keep the hearth inside you burning hot or else the breath of god would blow it out peering north then northeast then northwest count hamnet saw snow no mammoths no musk oxen no riding deer no geese or swans no ducks or ptarmigan no whitepelted hares no voles or lemmings either he knew game of all sizes lived on in and under the snowdrifts but finding any wouldnt be easy the horses would have to keep going too unlike musk oxen or mammoths they didnt always know enough to dig through the snow to find fodder underneath sooner or later most likely sooner the travelers would probably end up killing and eating the pack horses once the supplies they carried were gone what point to fussing over them he wasnt fond of horsemeat but he wasnt fond of hunger either come on trasamund said lets ride he booted his horse forward as if he had not a care in the world up here in the bizogot country maybe he didnt whether he should or not wasnt the same question count hamnet urged his mount forward too when he came north the winter before hed looked forward to running into people the bizogots guested strangers generously knowing they might need guesting themselves one day before long the rulers though would be enemies no matter what he made sure his sword stayed loose in its scabbard nothing only snow and chill and rolling ground under the horses hooves trasamund started singing a song about how splendid the countryside was the jarl couldnt carry a tune in a bucket he didnt care but count hamnet didnt feel like listening to him how are you hamnet asked marcovefa ive been better she answered my head still feels she made a face things in there arent right a slingstone will do that hamnet said but to knock out working magic she made another face an angrier one it did that i dont like it i feel stupid i cant work magic at all hamnet said am i stupid by her expression the question was suppose you go blind are you the same as you were before i feel like i am blind in there she carefully touched the right side of her head liv pointed northwest and called a herd that way hamnet thyssen saw nothing out of the ordinary when he looked that way how can you tell he asked even so simple a question hurt look at the air liv sounded as matteroffact as if they were strangers you can see the fog of all the animals breathing together she pointed again once count hamnet knew where to look and what to look for he could see it too that made him feel a little better but not much liv went on i think theyre musk oxen but im not sure the air doesnt look quite right hamnet couldnt tell the difference between fog from musk oxen and that from any other beasts could liv really maybe she could the bizogots had to learn such things if they wanted to go on living i think theyre musk oxen trasamund said i think we ought to slaughter one or two of them too we can use the meat it will keep us going longer than the bread we brought north bread is all very well when you have no meat but when you do hamnet wondered who was watching that herd or flock or whatever the word was if the outriders were bizogots there probably wouldnt be any trouble if they were rulers there certainly would his hand fell to his sword hilt again he was ready for trouble or hoped he was lets ride trasamund said once more nobody told him no ulric skakki looked dubious but ulric looked dubious about half the time he very often had good reason to look dubious but hamnet chose not to remember that before long the herd itself came into sight a brown smudge on the horizon the travelers hadnt gone much farther before liv exclaimed those arent musk oxen i dont know what the demon they are trasamund said hamnet thyssen still wasnt convinced they werent musk oxen but he had to believe the bizogots knew better than he did still it wasnt a bizogot who said theyre riding deer arent they it was ulric skakki he might look dubious but he was also an adaptable man before long hamnet could see he was right here what do we do audun gilli asked all things considered a more than reasonable question im in the mood for roast venison hamnet said his comrades bayed agreement what if the rulers have herdsmen with their deer audun asked then in a little while they wont hamnet answered grandly that got him more cheers he began to string his bow so did ulric sure enough a herdsman rode out towards them on a riding deer rather than a horse which said by itself that he was a warrior of the rulers you goes away he shouted in the bizogot tongue his accent and pronunciation terrible goes away thises our deers is we ought to kill him just so we dont have to listen to him ulric murmured oh weve got better reasons than that hamnet thyssen said he and ulric reached over their shoulders and nocked arrows at the same time the enemy warrior seemed astonished that anyone on the frozen steppe would presume to disobey him theyd both let fly before he even started to reach for an arrow he hadnt finished drawing his bow before one shaft caught him in the chest and the other in the face he slid out of the saddle and crashed down in the snow well shot hamnet and ulric shouted at the same time marcovefa pounded hamnet on the back another herdsman rode around from the far side of the flock to find out what was going on seeing his comrade down he wheeled his deer and galloped off as fast as it would run liv pointed at the deer and murmured something suddenly though the deer seemed to be running as hard as ever it was hardly moving at all the warrior of the rulers beat it and cursed it none of which did him any good when the invaders had no shaman with them they were vulnerable to bizogot magic hamnet had seen that before the warrior leaped down from the ensorceled riding deer as the travelers drew near he must have seen he had no hope for escape for he charged them with drawn sword trasamund dismounted and met him bladetoblade the three tusk clan the jarl cried he beat down his foes guard with a few fierce cuts the killing stroke almost took off the enemy fighters head the warrior of the rulers staggered blood gushing from a wound he couldnt hope to stanch after a few lurching steps he crumpled the sword slipping from his fingers if only there were one neck for the lot of them trasamund cleaned his blade in a snowdrift would make things simpler wouldnt it ulric skakki said hamnet thyssen nodded the riding deer shifted nervously half spooked by the shouting and by the stink of blood but the beasts were more nearly tame than so many musk oxen would have been the travelers had little trouble cutting several of them out of the herd and leading them downwind so the smells of their slaughtering wouldnt frighten the others so much maybe we ought to use them for pack animals and slaughter the extra horses audun gilli said they fend for themselves better than horses do up here but we can ride the horses if we have to trasamund was a staunch conservative we dont know how to do that with them and they are beasts of the rulers marcovefa said maybe if they stay alive rulers can use magic to track them audun pursed his lips yes that could be he said i should have thought of it myself and so they slaughtered the deer wrapped the meat they wanted to take in the animals hides and loaded it onto the pack horses then they pressed north up towards sudertorp lake and what had been leaping lynx country but the leaping lynxes these days were as shattered as trasamunds own clan what can we do up here hamnet said what hope have we got of putting a piece of this clan and a chunk of that one together and making an army that can stand up to the rulers i dont know ulric answered but i do know sigvat cant put you in a dungeon up here so that leaves us ahead of the game right there or do you think im wrong your grace he used hamnets title of respect with irony i only wish i did hamnet said they rode on marcovefa looked at the snow she frowned in concentration and maybe in a little pain as she whistled a strange tune in a wailing minor key then she muttered to herself thats not right she said try it again hamnet thyssen told her your magics bound to come back to you sooner or later isnt it he fought not to show his fear well i hope so i dont want to be mindblind the rest of my days she answered mindblind wasnt really a word in raumsdalian which didnt keep hamnet from understanding it and from understanding that he wasnt the only fearful one here marcovefa eyed the drifted snow again she nodded to herself as if to say i can do this then she whistled again the tune was almost the same as it had been before almost but not quite hamnet couldnt have defined the difference but he knew it was there suddenly a vole popped out of the snow it stared at marcovefa with small black beady eyes then as if recognizing her as one of its own kind it scurried towards her her smile blazed brighter than the weak northern sun she stopped whistling the vole let out a highpitched squeak of horror almost turned a somersault spinning around and scooted away she let it go as she turned to hamnet her eyes shone with triumph there she said i did it i called the vole to me good he said would you hunt that way up on top of the glacier sometimes i would if i had to she replied but you see i did a magic not a big magic yet but a magic my head is not ruined not for good god be praised for that hamnet said gravely do you suppose you can call mammoths the same way when you get better he was teasing her but she took him seriously i dont know i never try anything like that up on the glacier no big animals up on the glacier not except for people she bared her teeth maybe she was teasing him back or maybe she was remembering the taste of mans flesh then her grin faded she touched the side of her head still swollen and bruised i have myself back again i have myself back again she made hamnet hear the pause in the middle of the word good he could imagine what that meant to her and he knew what it meant to the fight against the rulers without marcovefa there was no fight against the rulers unless sigvat could somehow mount one from everything hamnet had seen that struck him as unlikely she whistled again another little furry head popped out of the snowbank another ensorceled vole started towards her this time she took it in her hands before relaxing the spell count hamnet wondered if the vole would die of fright it didnt it just twisted loose and ran away not an accident not a happenstance marcovefa said happily i can really do this good hamnet said if any of the rulers stick their heads out of the snow all of a sudden we know just how to take care of them marcovefa laughed hamnet was joking and then again he wasnt shed worked magic but she hadnt worked strong magic if this was the most she could do how could she stand against the rulers and if she couldnt stand against the rulers what was the point to anything suppose we meet the rulers in the ordinary way hamnet persisted what can you do then whatever i have to do i can do marcovefa replied that was encouraging or it would have been had hamnet had more confidence in it but he didnt want to show marcovefa he had no confidence if he did show her that wouldnt it hurt her confidence and confidence that she could beat the rulers was one big advantage she enjoyed over both the bizogots and the raumsdalians shell always thought she could and shed been right most of the time till that slingstone made her wrong at just the wrong moment voles hamnet thyssen muttered if i see any mammoths hiding in the snowdrift i am able to call those too marcovefa said brightly oh good count hamnet said marcovefa couldnt always tell when he was being sarcastic this time she noticed and thought it was funny hamnet went on suppose they arent hiding there suppose theyre just mammothing along could you call them then mammothing is that a word it is now i dont know if i could or not marcovefa answered i tell you this though i want to find out so do i hamnet said if she could call mammoths the way she called voles well what good would it do the rulers to ride them if they wouldnt go where their riders wanted them to sometimes mammoth corpses got buried in floods or caveins and frozen underground for years or even centuries then came to the surface again some of the people who found them that way thought they lived like moles and died when air touched them how much of a difference was there between moles and voles if you were a vole or a mole a lot otherwise i have my magic back marcovefa said nothing else matters count hamnet was inclined to agree with her coming up to the steppe before hamnet had passed smoothly from one bizogot clans territory to the next as often as not riders near the edge of one clans lands or the fierce dogs they had with them would let him know when hed come within the bounds of a new jarls domain now the rulers had shattered the arrangements that prevailed for so long in a broad swath down the center of the frozen plain the invaders had beaten and broken up the clans that had roamed there for so long the rulers had commandeered as many of the herds as they could lay hold of but others still wandered with no one to protect them from lions and shortfaced bears and dire wolves and from hungry bizogots as much on their own as the musk oxen and mammoths and horses were chaos and banditry of course spread far beyond the clans the rulers had actually broken refugees and fugitives went where they would went where they could and turned their swords and bows against the bizogots already holding those grounds and herds some of the clans the rulers hadnt touched got smashed to pieces by their own folk and then they spread disorder farther yet in the midst of such madness and uncertainty a knot of hardbitten travelers who werent afraid to fight had no trouble gathering a following men who wanted to hit back at the invaders but saw no way to do it on their own were glad to join people who did have a plan how does it feel being most of the way towards a king ulric skakki asked hamnet after theyd collected a pretty fair beginning to an army hamnet rolled his eyes how does it feel being out of your head i enjoy it most of the time ulric said easily now answer my question im not a king im not a jarl either im barely even a general hamnet thyssen said if trasamund wanted that slot he could take it i wouldnt say a word this is his country not mine thats why hes standing back and letting you have it ulric said before hamnet could tell him he was crazy again ulric went on up here hes just another bizogot and just another bizogot whos lost to the rulers but you youre just another raumsdalian whos lost to the rulers hamnet broke in ulric skakki shook his head youre a foreigner youre interesting youre exotic you carry hope and other diseases hamnet thyssen said ow ulric wasnt easy to wound with words but he flinched then gathering himself he said well the rulers would agree with you bugger the rulers bugger em with a pine cone count hamnet said thats what were here for the adventurer reminded him i know hamnet said were going to have to hit them if we dont the bizogots will decide were good for nothing theyll ride off and leave us and then we will be good for nothing ulric skakki finished for him well the world has been telling me im good for nothing for a long time maybe its been right all along you never can tell hamnet thyssen glowered at him we havent got much of an army here if we strike at the rulers and lose he shook his head if that happens were ruined we wouldnt be way the demon up here if plenty of people didnt already think we were ruined ulric said so far weve hurt the rulers here on the steppe weve killed their men and slaughtered their animals and have they hurt us have they even touched us they havent and you know it reluctantly hamnet nodded he did know it but knowing it brought no reassurance pinpricks he said weve given them pinpricks and they havent bothered noticing but they will if we hit them hard ulric skakki set his mittened hands on hamnet s shoulders you can stay invisible or you can make a proper enemy the way it looks to me those are your only choices and you cant do both at once so which would you rather what do you think hamnet asked well i hoped i knew ulric skakki answered you do hamnet said grimly ulric nodded and stopped bothering him one of the more sensible things the adventurer ever did for all their bold talk hamnet and ulric didnt lead their growing band across the frozen top of sudertorp lake the way theyd gone north the year before theyd almost died the year before too when magic from the rulers cracked the ice and nearly spilled them into the freezing water maybe marcovefa could have shielded them from a repeat of that fright she seemed sure her sorcery was close to full strength all the same count hamnet didnt want to test her before he had to and despite the confidence she showed she didnt seem eager to test herself either ready yes but not eager when the time comes i will do what wants doing she said till then well each day i am stronger each day my head is clearer thats what i want to hear hamnet said i do not say it because you want to hear it i say it because it is true marcovefa told him all right good he didnt want to quarrel with her he looked across the rolling snowcovered landscape with no trees the bizogot steppe grew boring in winter i wonder if the golden shrine is anywhere near here if it is youd probably heal right away if you went inside we knew of the golden shrine up on top of the glacier too marcovefa said we thought it was up there somewhere up there sometimes we went looking for it but no one ever found it when your ancestors first went up atop the glacier they already knew about the golden shrine hamnet answered most folk say its the oldest thing in the world some say it was there before the glacier first came down from the north eyvind torfinn believes that i think he is a strange man he has no magic in him but he is wise i did not think that could be but it is marcovefa paused he is wise except for the woman he chose she is pretty but you know she was mine once hamnet said i know she was wed to you once yes but she was never yours gudrid is only gudrids well yes hamnet agreed but i didnt know that then and i paid for the lesson gudrid was even prettier in those days too which made the price dearer or at least seem dearer to a man who was younger himself the golden shrine marcovefa seemed willing not to talk about gudrid which suited count hamnet fine we say you find it if you dont expect it if you look for it it is never there her grin was impish we must have looked for it it was never there for us we say the same kinds of things about it hamnet agreed i didnt believe it was there at all till i learned of the lands beyond the glacier now i think maybe there is such a thing but it is where it wants to be not where we want it to be does that make any sense at all more than you know maybe marcovefa said before hamnet could ask her what she meant a scout came galloping back we found them he shouted we found the stinking mammoth turds now lets go kill every cursed one of them the bizogots who formed the bulk formed almost all of hamnets army roared like the predators they were everyone thundered forward hamnet didnt much want a battle just then he had one anyhow now he had to try to lead it if he didnt one thing seemed plain the army wouldnt be his anymore there were things the scout hadnt said how many enemies waited ahead were they ready to fight for that matter count hamnet wondered whether his own army was ready to fight theyd run from the rulers often enough before only one way to find out i see em trasamund bellowed so did hamnet thyssen a line of men on riding deer with the bigger lumps of mammoths anchoring the center of their line they were ready then try to stay out of slingstone range hamnet shouted to marcovefa she gave back what was anything but a military salute then she blew him a kiss he wondered what it meant he wondered if it meant anything hed find out probably sooner than he wanted sooner than he wanted he found the rulers had at least one wizard with them snow leapt up from the ground it took the shapes of wolves and of the fierce great cats from beyond the glacier tigers the rulers called them count hamnet thought they were illusion till one of the snow tigers tore the throat out of a scouts horse and then killed the bizogot too if marcovefa couldnt do anything about that would the magic beasts break up the bizogot charge by themselves or would they terrify the bizogots into turning around and fleeing they werent far from scaring count hamnet into turning around but then they all burst into puffs of steam marcovefa laughed in delight hamnet thought that was joy at having her power back he was delighted that she had it back too give them something to remember you by he yelled marcovefa laughed again oh they will remember me she said maybe it was her joy that made her do what she did next all the rulers riding beasts deer and mammoths alike seemed to go into heat at the same time and into a more fiery heat than any they knew in their proper mating season a mammoth interested in rutting with another mammoth was a mammoth rather spectacularly not interested in carrying warriors of the rulers into battle the same held true for riding deer bucks butted at one another and locked antlers does pushed their way towards the males ignoring the riders trying to push them towards the bizogots some of the enemy fighting men could still use their bows most seemed at least as distracted as their beasts the rulers had no hope fighting with swords and spears those required cooperation between warriors and mounts but they had none only a few slingers made life difficult for the bizogots the band hamnets men had come across didnt seem to be an army on campaign as the one down in raumsdalia had been it was probably a clans worth of men if the rulers used clans the bizogots broke their line with ease why not when their own animals had broken it hamnet sent horsemen straight at the slingers he couldnt do that so neatly as he would have with raumsdalian soldiers the bizogots didnt obey for the sake of obeying as trained troopers would but when he pointed at the slingers and shouted enough bizogots took the hint to do what he wanted done they charged one slingstone hit a horseman in the face and knocked him out of the saddle but the slingers couldnt fight cavalry at close quarters a few who held their ground paid for it the rest broke and ran and the bizogots rode them down too seeing them run told hamnet thyssen what a victory hed gained far more even than raumsdalians the rulers were disciplined warriors losing to men from the herds their contemptuous term for anyone not of their folk was the worst disgrace they knew fleeing from the herds he wondered if theyd so much as imagined such an enormity he pointed bizogots at the rulers wizards too more snow beasts sprang against them maybe those were this clans sorcerous specialty if so it did them no good marcovefa boiled these monsters out of existence as she had the others then count hamnet got to enjoy the spectacle of wizards running for their lives running helped them no more than it had the slingers not even a wizard of the rulers could aim a spell as fast as an archer could aim an arrow and shrieks of agony disrupted the harsh gutturals of the rulers language the enemy commander kept on roaring commands from mammothback till his mammoth consumed by erotical lust plucked him off with its trunk and threw him down hard onto the frozen ground then he shrieked too a shriek that ended with horrible abruptness as a mammoth foot descended on his chest hamnet thyssen was close enough to hear ribs snap and crackle and pop close enough to watch blood splash out to stain the snow he looked away he also rode farther away lest the mammoth decide he and his horse stood in its way too after their leader died a few of the rulers tried to surrender that went against everything the ironsouled invaders were supposed to hold dear count hamnet had seen it happen before even so in the invaders rare defeats the urge to live could corrode even the sternest discipline but the bizogots lust was up too theirs for blood hardly less than that of the rulers beasts for coupling hamnet and ulric skakki both shouted that some of the enemy should be spared trasamund shouted the same thing which surprised hamnet was the jarl finally discovering what a good idea staying practical could be much good it did him if he was his fellow bizogots paid no more attention to him than they did to the foreigners among them more blood dappled the white of the frozen steppe and then it was over there were no more rulers left to kill even trasamund seemed pleased by god thisll give the muskox buggers something to think about he boomed looking around the trampled field the iron stink of blood filled the frosty air well so it will ulric skakki said and the first thing theyll think about is how to do in the bastards who did this to them that struck hamnet thyssen as being altogether too likely but battle fever thrummed in his veins too and he said let them try as long as weve got marcovefa they dont stand a chance ulric mimed a slingstone glancing off someones head then he mimed a slingstone catching someone between the eyes hamnet glared at him not because he was being foolish but because he wasnt it could happen it almost had but it hadnt we can hurt them now he said we can hurt them badly maybe even stop them from getting down into the empire hurrah trasamund said sourly what good does that do my land what good does that do my folk his wave encompassed the whole of the bizogot country if no more warriors or wizards of the rulers can get down into raumsdalia maybe the empire will be able to deal with the ones who are there now count hamnet said that weakens the enemy everywhere not just in the south its all one big fight you know ha easy for you to say trasamund wasnt convinced last summer the bizogots didnt think it was one big fight ulric skakki reminded him they tried to take on the rulers clan by clan and look what that got them trasamund glared at him again not because he was wrong but because he was right you are an impossible pest the jarl growled ulric bowed in the saddle as if at a compliment that made trasamund no happier hamnet thyssen looked around one more time now to make sure liv was all right she wasnt his anymore but but what he asked himself and found no good answer he knew too well he would have done the same thing were gudrid on the field even though she might hope he died in battle there was liv binding up a wound on audun gilli s arm and chanting a healing charm over it catching hamnet s eye she nodded gravely to him he made himself nod back unlike gudrid liv plainly wished him no harm that helped but not enough he forced himself back to matters he could do something about well plunder them he called not that the bizogots werent already tending to that well plunder them and well slaughter their riding deer and i by god will ride off on one of their mammoths trasamund shouted and to hamnet s amazement he did after marcovefa let her spell lapse the mammoths and deer soon calmed down a woolly mammoth let the bizogot jarl clamber aboard and guide it along trasamund whooped with joy and pride he was a boy with a new toy a toy that could kill him if he got the least bit careless but he didnt worry about that not then count hamnet didnt worry about it either for once he didnt worry about anything and wondered why not his gaze slid towards marcovefa she grinned back at him then eyed an enemy corpse and reached for a knife as if to butcher it she was only half joking if that much hamnet didnt care savage or not cannibal or not she gave him hope and when you had hope what else did you need
