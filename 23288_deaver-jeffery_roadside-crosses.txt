world accordingly if you happen to come across a website address in the pages that follow you might wish to type it into your browser and go where it takes you you wont need whats in those websites to enjoy the novel but you may just find a few extra clues that will help you unravel the mystery you might also simply be interestedor disturbedby what you find there what the internet and its cult of anonymity do is to provide a blanket sort of immunity for anybody who wants to say anything about anybody else and it would be difficult in this sense to think of a more morally deformed exploitation of the concept of free speech richard bernstein in the new york times monday chapter out of place the california highway patrol trooper young with bristly yellow hair beneath his crisp hat squinted through the windshield of his crown victoria police interceptor as he cruised south along highway in monterey dunes to the right modest commercial sprawl to the left something was out of place what heading home at pm after his tour had ended he surveyed the road the trooper didnt write a lot of tickets here leaving that to the county deputiesprofessional courtesybut he occasionally lit up somebody in a german or italian car if he was in a mood and this was the route he often took home at this time of day so he knew the highway pretty well therethat was it something colorful a quarter mile ahead sat by the side of the road at the base of one of the hills of sand that cut off the view of monterey bay what could it be he hit his light barprotocoland pulled over onto the right shoulder he parked with the hood of the ford pointed leftward toward traffic so a rearender would shove the car away from not over him and climbed out stuck in the sand just beyond the shoulder was a crossa roadside memorial it was about eighteen inches high and homemade cobbled together out of dark brokenoff branches bound with wire like florists use dark red roses lay in a splashy bouquet at the base a cardboard disk was in the center the date of the accident written on it in blue ink there were no names on the front or back officially these memorials to traffic accident victims were discouraged since people were occasionally injured even killed planting a cross or leaving flowers or stuffed animals usually the memorials were tasteful and poignant this one was spooky what was odd though was that he couldnt remember any accidents along here in fact this was one of the safest stretches of highway in california the roadway becomes an obstacle course south of carmel like that spot of a really sad accident several weeks ago two girls killed coming back from a graduation party but here the highway was three lanes and mostly straight with occasional lazy bends through the old fort ord grounds now a college and the shopping districts the trooper thought about removing the cross but the mourners might return to leave another one and endanger themselves again best just to leave it out of curiosity hed check with his sergeant in the morning and find out what had happened he walked back to his car tossed his hat on the seat and rubbed his crew cut he pulled back into traffic his mind no longer on roadside accidents he was thinking about what his wife would be making for supper about taking the kids to the pool afterward and when was his brother coming to town he looked at the date window on his watch he frowned was that right a glance at his cell phone confirmed that yes today was june that was curious whoever had left the roadside cross had made a mistake he remembered that the date crudely written on the cardboard disk was june tuesday tomorrow maybe the poor mourners whod left the memorial had been so upset theyd jotted the date down wrong then the images of the eerie cross faded though they didnt vanish completely and as the officer headed down the highway home he drove a bit more carefully tuesday chapter the faint lightthe light of a ghost pale greendanced just out of her reach if she could only get to it if she could only reach the ghost shed be safe the glow floating in the dark of the cars trunk dangled tauntingly above her feet which were ducttaped together as were her hands a ghost another piece of tape was pasted over her mouth and she was inhaling stale air through her nose rationing it as if the trunk of her camry held only so much a painful bang as the car hit a pothole she gave a brief muted scream other hints of light intruded occasionally the dull red glow when he hit the brake the turn signal no other illumination from outside the hour was close to am the luminescent ghost rocked back and forth it was the emergency trunk release a glowinthedark hand pull emblazoned with a comical image of a man escaping from the car but it remained just out of reach of her feet tammy foster had forced the crying to stop the sobs had begun just after her attacker came up behind her in the shadowy parking lot of the club slapped tape on her mouth taped her hands behind her back and shoved her into the trunk hed bound her feet as well frozen in panic the seventeenyearold had thought he doesnt want me to see him thats good he doesnt want to kill me he just wants to scare me shed surveyed the trunk spotting the dangling ghost shed tried to grip it with her feet but it slipped out from between her shoes tammy was in good shape soccer and cheerleading but because of the awkward angle she could keep her feet raised for only a few seconds the ghost eluded her the car pressed on with every passing yard she felt more and more despair tammy foster began to cry again dont dont your nosell clog up youll choke she forced herself to stop she was supposed to be home at midnight shed be missed by her motherif she wasnt drunk on the couch pissed about some problem with her latest boyfriend missed by her sister if the girl wasnt online or on the phone which of course she was clank the same sound as earlier the bang of metal as he loaded something into the backseat she thought of some scary movies shed seen gross disgusting ones torture murder involving tools dont think about that tammy focused on the dangling green ghost of the trunk release and heard a new sound the sea finally they stopped and he shut off the engine the lights went out the car rocked as he shifted in the drivers seat what was he doing now she heard the throaty croak of seals nearby they were at a beach which at this time of night around here would be completely deserted one of the car doors opened and closed and a second opened the clank of metal from the backseat again torturetools the door slammed shut hard and tammy foster broke she dissolved into sobs struggling to suck in more lousy air no please please she cried though the words were filtered through the tape and came out as a sort of moan tammy began running through every prayer she could remember as she waited for the click of the trunk the sea crashed the seals hooted she was going to die mommy but thennothing the trunk didnt pop the car door didnt open again she heard no footsteps approaching after three minutes she controlled the crying the panic diminished five minutes passed and he hadnt opened the trunk ten tammy gave a faint mad laugh it was just a scare he wasnt going to kill her or rape her it was a practical joke she was actually smiling beneath the tape when the car rocked ever so slightly her smile faded the camry rocked again a gentle pushpull though stronger than the first time she heard a splash and felt a shudder tammy knew an ocean wave had struck the front end of the car oh my god no hed left the car on the beach with high tide coming in the car settled into the sand as the ocean undermined the tires no one of her worst fears was drowning and being stuck in a confined space like thisit was unthinkable tammy began to kick at the trunk lid but there was of course no one to hear except the seals the water was now sloshing hard against the sides of the toyota the ghost somehow she had to pull the trunk release lever she worked off her shoes and tried again her head pressing hard against the carpet agonizingly lifting her feet toward the glowing pull she got them on either side of it pressed hard her stomach muscles quivering now her legs cramping she eased the ghost downward a tink yes it worked but then she moaned in horror the pull had come away in her feet without opening the trunk she stared at the green ghost lying near her he mustve cut the wire after hed dumped her into the trunk hed cut it the release pull had been dangling in the eyelet no longer connected to the latch cable she was trapped please somebody tammy prayed again to god to a passerby even to her kidnapper who might show her some mercy but the only response was the indifferent gurgle of saltwater as it began seeping into the trunk the peninsula garden hotel is tucked away near highway the venerable route thats a twentymilelong diorama the many faces of monterey county the road meanders west from the nations salad bowlsalinasand skirts the verdant pastures of heaven punchy laguna seca racetrack settlements of corporate offices then dusty monterey and pineandhemlockfilled pacific grove finally the highway deposits those drivers at least those bent on following the complex via from start to finish at legendary seventeen mile drivehome of a common species around here people with money not bad michael oneil said to kathryn dance as they climbed out of his car through narrow glasses with gray frames the woman surveyed the spanish and deco main lodge and halfdozen adjacent buildings the inn was classy though a bit worn and dusty at the cuffs nice i like as they stood surveying the hotel with its distant glimpse of the pacific ocean dance an expert at kinesics body language tried to read oneil the chief deputy in the monterey county sheriffs office investigations division was hard to analyze the solidly built man in his forties with saltandpepper hair was easygoing but quiet unless he knew you even then he was economical of gesture and expression he didnt give a lot away kinesically at the moment though she was reading that he wasnt at all nervous despite the nature of their trip here she on the other hand was kathryn dance a trim woman in her thirties today wore her dark blond hair as she often did in a french braid the feathery tail end bound with a bright blue ribbon her daughter had selected that morning and tied into a careful bow dance was in a long pleated black skirt and matching jacket over a white blouse black ankle boots with twoinch heelsfootwear shed admired for months but been able to resist buying only until they had gone on sale oneil was in one of his three or four civilian configurations chinos and powder blue shirt no tie his jacket was dark blue in a faint plaid pattern the doorman a cheerful latino looked them over with an expression that said you seem like a nice couple welcome i hope you enjoy your stay he opened the door for them dance smiled uncertainly at oneil and they walked through a breezy hallway to the front desk from the main building they wound through the hotel complex looking for the room never thought this would happen oneil said to her dance gave a faint laugh she was amused to realize that her eyes occasionally slipped to doors and windows this was a kinesic response that meant the subject was subconsciously thinking about ways to escapethat is was feeling stress look she said pointing to yet another pool the place seemed to have four like disneyland for adults i hear a lot of rock musicians stay here really she frowned whats wrong its only one story not much fun getting stoned and throwing tvs and furniture out the window this is carmel oneil pointed out the wildest theyd get here is pitching recyclables into the trash dance thought of a comeback line but kept quiet the bantering was making her more nervous she paused beside a palm tree with leaves like sharp weapons where are we the deputy looked at a slip of paper oriented himself and pointed to one of the buildings in the back there oneil and dance paused outside the door he exhaled and lifted an eyebrow guess this is it dance laughed i feel like a teenager the deputy knocked after a short pause the door opened revealing a narrow man hovering near fifty wearing dark slacks and a white shirt and striped tie michael kathryn right on time come on in ernest seybold a career district attorney for los angeles county nodded them into the room inside a court reporter sat beside her threelegged dictation machine another young woman rose and greeted the new arrivals she was seybold said his assistant from la earlier this month dance and oneil had run a case in monterey the convicted cult leader and killer daniel pell had escaped from prison and remained on the peninsula targeting more victims one of the people involved in the case had turned out to be somebody very different from the person dance and her fellow officers had believed the consequences of that involved yet another murder dance adamantly wanted to pursue the perp but there was much pressure not to follow upfrom some very powerful organizations dance wouldnt take no for an answer though and while the monterey prosecutor had declined to handle the case she and oneil learned that the perp had killed earlierin los angeles district attorney seybold who worked regularly with dances organization the california bureau of investigation and was a friend of dances agreed to bring charges in la several witnesses though were in the monterey area including dance and oneil and so seybold had come here for the day to take statements the clandestine nature of the gettogether was due to the perps connections and reputation in fact for the time being they werent even using the killers real name the case was known internally as the people v j doe as they sat seybold said we might have a problem i have to tell you the butterflies dance had felt earlierthat something would go wrong and the case would derailreturned the prosecutor continued the defenses made a motion to dismiss based on immunity i honestly cant tell you what the odds are itll succeed the hearings scheduled for day after tomorrow dance closed her eyes no beside her oneil exhaled in anger all this work if he gets away dance thoughtbut then realized she had nothing to add to that except if he gets away i lose she felt her jaw trembling but seybold said ive got a team putting together the response theyre good the best in the office whatever it takes ernie dance said i want him i want him real bad a lot of people do kathryn well do everything we can if he gets away but i want to proceed as if were going to win he said this confidently which reassured dance somewhat they got started seybold asking dozens of questions about the crimewhat dance and oneil had witnessed and the evidence in the case seybold was a seasoned prosecutor and knew what he was doing after an hour of interviewing them both the wiry man sat back and said he had enough for the time being he was momentarily expecting another witnessa local state trooperwho had also agreed to testify they thanked the prosecutor who agreed to call them the instant the judge ruled in the immunity hearing as dance and oneil walked back to the lobby he slowed a frown on his face what she asked lets play hooky what do you mean he nodded at the beautiful garden restaurant overlooking a canyon with the sea beyond its early when was the last time anybody in a white uniform brought you eggs benedict dance considered what year is it again he smiled come on we wont be that late a glance at her watch i dont know kathryn dance hadnt played hooky in school much less as a senior agent with the cbi then she said to herself whyre you hesitating you love michaels company you get to spend hardly any downtime with him you bet feeling like a teenager again though now in a good way they were seated beside each other at a banquette near the edge of the deck overlooking the hills the early sun was out and it was a clear crisp june morning the waiternot fully uniformed but with a suitably starched white shirtbrought them menus and poured coffee dances eyes strayed to the page on which the restaurant bragged of their famous mimosas no way she thought and glanced up to see oneil looking at exactly the same item they laughed when we get down to la for the grand jury or the trial he said champagne then fair enough it was then that oneils phone trilled he glanced at caller id dance was immediately aware of his body language changingshoulders slightly higher arms closer to his body eyes focused just past the screen she knew whom the call was from even before he said a cheerful hi dear dance deduced from his conversation with his wife anne a professional photographer that a business trip had come up unexpectedly soon and she was checking with her husband about his schedule finally oneil disconnected and they sat in silence for a moment while the atmosphere righted itself and they consulted their menus yep he announced eggs benedict she was going to have the same and glanced up for the waiter but then her phone vibrated she glanced at the text message frowned then read it again aware that her own body orientation was changing quickly heart rate revving shoulders lifted foot tapping on the floor dance sighed and her gesture to the waiter changed from a polite beckon to one of mimicking signing the check chapter the california bureau of investigations westcentral regional headquarters is in a nondescript modern building identical to those of the adjacent insurance companies and software consulting firms all tucked neatly away behind hills and decorated with the elaborate vegetation of central coast california the facility was near the peninsula garden and dance and oneil arrived from the hotel in less than ten minutes minding traffic but not red lights or stop signs climbing out of his car dance slung her purse over her shoulder and hefted her bulging computer bagwhich her daughter had dubbed moms purse annex after the girl had learned what annex meantand she and oneil walked into the building inside they headed immediately to where she knew her team would be assembled her office in the portion of the cbi known as the gals wing or gwowing to the fact that it was populated exclusively by dance fellow agent connie ramirez as well as their assistant maryellen kresbach and grace yuan the cbi administrator who kept the entire building humming like a timepiece the name of the wing derived from an unfortunate comment by an equally unfortunate and now former cbi agent who coined the designation while trying to press his cleverness on a date he was touring around the headquarters everyone on the gw still debated if heor one of his dateshad ever found all the feminine hygiene products dance and ramirez had seeded into his office briefcase and car dance and oneil now greeted maryellen the cheerful and indispensable woman could easily run both a family and the professional lives of her charges without a bat of one of her darkly mascaraed eyelashes she also was the best baker dance had ever met morning maryellen where are we hi kathryn help yourself dance eyed but didnt give in to the chocolate chip cookies in the jar on the womans desk they had to be a biblical sin oneil on the other hand didnt resist best breakfast ive had in weeks eggs benedict maryellen gave a pleased laugh okay i called charles again and left another message honestly she sighed he wasnt picking up tj and rey are inside oh deputy oneil one of your people is here from mcso thanks youre a dear in dances office wiry young tj scanlon was perched in her chair the redheaded agent leapt up hi boss howd the audition go he meant the deposition i was a star then she delivered the bad news about the immunity hearing the agent scowled he too had known the perp and was nearly as adamant as dance about winning a conviction tj was good at his job though he was the most unconventional agent in a law enforcement organization noted for its conventional approach and demeanor today he was wearing jeans a polo shirt and plaid sports coatmadras a pattern on some faded shirts in her fathers storage closet tj owned one tie as far as dance had been able to tell and it was an outlandish jerry garcia model tj suffered from acute nostalgia for the s in his office two lava lamps bubbled merrily away dance and he were only a few years apart but there was a generational gap between them still they clicked professionally with a bit of mentormentee thrown in though tj tended to run solo which was against the grain in the cbi hed been filling in for dances regular partnerstill down in mexico on a complicated extradition case quiet rey carraneo a newcomer to the cbi was about as opposite to tj scanlon as one could be in his late twenties with dark thoughtful features he today wore a gray suit and white shirt on his lean frame he was older in heart than in years since hed been a beat cop in the cowboy town of reno nevada before moving here with his wife for the sake of his ill mother carraneo held a coffee cup in a hand that bore a tiny scar in the y between thumb and forefinger it was where a gang tat had resided not too many years ago dance considered him to be the calmest and most focused of all the younger agents in the office and she sometimes wondered to herself only if his days in the gang contributed to that the deputy from the monterey county sheriffs officetypically crew cut and with a military bearingintroduced himself and explained what had happened a local teenager had been kidnapped from a parking lot in downtown monterey off alvarado early that morning tammy foster had been bound and tossed into her own car trunk the attacker drove her to a beach outside of town and left her to drown in high tide dance shivered at the thought of what it mustve been like to lie cramped and cold as the water rose in the confined space it was her car oneil asked sitting in one of dances chairs and rocking on the back legsdoing exactly what dance told her son not to do she suspected wes had learned the practice from oneil the legs creaked under his weight thats right sir what beach down the coast south of the highlands deserted yeah nobody around no wits witnesses at the club where she got snatched dance asked negative and no security cameras in the parking lot dance and oneil took this in she said so he needed other wheels near where he left her or had an accomplice crime scene found some footprints in the sand headed for the highway above the tide level but the sand was loose no idea of tread or size but definitely only one person oneil asked and no signs of a car pulling off the road to pick him up or one hidden in the bushes nearby no sir our people did find some bicycle tread marks but they were on the shoulder couldve been made that night couldve been a week old no tread match we dont have a bicycle database he added to dance hundreds of people biked along the beach in that area daily motive no robbery no sexual assault looks like he just wanted to kill her slowly dance exhaled a puffy breath any suspects nope dance then looked at tj and what you told me earlier when i called the weird part anything more on that oh the fidgety young agent said you mean the roadside cross the california bureau of investigation has broad jurisdiction but usually is involved only in major crimes like gang activity terrorism threats and significant corruption or economic offenses a single murder in an area where gangland killings occur at least once a week wouldnt attract any special attention but the attack on tammy foster was different the day before the girl had been kidnapped a highway patrol trooper had found a cross like a roadside memorial with the next days date written on it stuck in the sand along highway when the trooper heard of the attack on the girl not far off the same highway he wondered if the cross was an announcement of the perps intentions hed returned and collected it the monterey county sheriffs offices crime scene unit found a tiny bit of rose petal in the trunk where tammy had been left to diea fleck that matched the roses from the bouquet left with the cross since on the surface the attack seemed random and there was no obvious motive dance had to consider the possibility that the perp had more victims in mind oneil now asked evidence from the cross his junior officer grimaced truth be told deputy oneil the highway patrol trooper just tossed it and the flowers in his trunk contaminated afraid so deputy bennington said he did the best he could to process it peter benningtonthe skilled diligent head of the monterey county crime scene lab but didnt find anything not according to the preliminary no prints except the troopers no trace other than sand and dirt the cross was made out of tree branches and florist wire the disk with the date on it was cut out of cardboard looked like the pen he said was generic and the writing was block printing only helpful if we get a sample from a suspect now heres a picture of the cross its pretty creepy kind of like blair witch project you know good movie tj said and dance didnt know if he was being facetious or not they looked at the photo it was creepy the branches like twisted black bones forensics couldnt tell them anything dance had a friend shed worked with not long ago lincoln rhyme a private forensic consultant in new york city despite the fact he was a quadriplegic he was one of the best crime scene specialists in the country she wondered if hed been running the scene would he have found something helpful she suspected he would have but perhaps the most universal rule in police work was this you go with what youve got she noticed something in the picture the roses oneil got her meaning the stems are cut the same length right so they probably came from a store not clipped from somebodys yard tj said but boss you can buy roses about a thousand places on the peninsula im not saying its leading us to his doorstep dance said im saying its a fact we might be able to use and dont jump to conclusions they mightve been stolen she felt grumpy hoped it didnt come off that way gotcha boss where exactly was the cross highway one just south of marina he touched a location on dances wall map any witnesses to leaving the cross dance now asked the deputy no maam not according to the chp and there are no cameras along that stretch of highway were still looking any stores oneil asked just as dance took a breath to ask the identical question stores oneil was looking at the map on the east side of the highway in those strip malls some of them have to have security cameras maybe one was pointed toward the spot at least we could get a make and model of the carif he was in one tj dance said check that out you got it boss theres a good java house there one of my favorites im so pleased a shadow appeared in her doorway ah didnt know we were convening here charles overby the recently appointed agent in charge of this cbi branch walked into her office in his midfifties tanned the pearshaped man was athletic enough to get out on the golf or tennis courts several times a week but not so spry to keep up a long volley without losing his breath ive been in my office forwell quite some time dance ignored tjs subtle glance at his wristwatch she suspected that overby had rolled in a few minutes ago charles she said morning maybe i forgot to mention where wed be meeting sorry hello michael a nod toward tj too whom overby sometimes gazed at curiously as if hed never met the junior agentthough that might have just been disapproval of tjs fashion choices dance had in fact informed overby of the meeting on the drive here from the peninsula garden hotel shed left a message on his voice mail giving him the troubling news of the immunity hearing in la and telling him of the plan to get together here in her office maryellen had told him about the meeting too but the cbi chief hadnt responded dance hadnt bothered to call back since overby usually didnt care much for the tactical side of running cases she wouldnt have been surprised if hed declined attending this meeting altogether he wanted the big picture a recent favorite phrase tj had once referred to him as charles overview dance had hurt her belly laughing well this girlinthetrunk thingthe reporters are calling already ive been stalling they hate that brief me ah reporters that explained the mans interest dance told him what they knew at this point and what their plans were think hes going to try it again thats what the anchors are saying thats what theyre speculating dance corrected delicately since we dont know why he attacked her in the first place tammy foster we cant say oneil said and the cross is connected it was left as a message the flowers match forensically yes ouch i just hope it doesnt turn into a summer of sam thing awhats that charles dance asked that guy in new york leaving notes shooting people oh that was a movie tj was their reference librarian of popular culture spike lee the killer was son of sam i know overby said quickly just making a pun son and summer we dont have any evidence one way or the other we dont know anything yet really overby was nodding he never liked not having answers for the press for his bosses in sacramento that made him edgy which in turn made everybody else edgy too when his predecessor stan fishburne had had to retire unexpectedly on a medical and overby had assumed the job dismay was the general mood fishburne was the agents advocate hed take on anybody he needed to in supporting them overby had a different style very different i got a call from the ag already their ultimate boss made the news in sacramento cnn too ill have to call him back i wish we had something specific we should know more soon whatre the odds that it was just a prank gone bad like hazing the pledges fraternity or sorority thing we all did that in college didnt we dance and oneil hadnt been greek she doubted tj had been and rey carraneo had gotten his bachelors in criminal justice at night while working two jobs pretty grim for a practical joke oneil said well lets keep it as an option i just want to make sure that we stay away from panic that wont help anything downplay any serialactor angle and dont mention the cross were still reeling from that case earlier in the month the pell thing he blinked how did the deposition go by the way a delay had he not listened to her message at all thats good good dance was still furious about the motion to dismiss overby blinked i mean it frees you up to run this roadside cross case thinking about her old boss nostalgia can be such sweet pain what are the next steps overby asked tjs checking out the security cameras at the stores and car dealerships near where the cross was left she turned to carraneo and rey could you canvass around the parking lot where tammy was abducted yes maam whatre you working on now michael at mcso overby asked running a gang killing then the container case oh that the peninsula had been largely immune to terrorist threats there were no major seaports here only fishing docks and the airport was small and had good security but a month or so ago a shipping container had been smuggled off a cargo ship from indonesia docked in oakland and loaded on a truck headed south toward la a report suggested that it had gotten as far as salinas where possibly the contents had been removed hidden and then transferred to other trucks for forward routing those contents mightve been contrabanddrugs weaponsor as another credible intelligence report went human beings sneaking into the country indonesia had the largest islamic population in the world and a number of dangerous extremist cells homeland security was understandably concerned but oneil added i can put that on hold for a day or two good overby said relieved that the roadside cross case would be taskforced he was forever looking for ways to spread the risk if an investigation went bad even if it meant sharing the glory dance was simply pleased she and oneil would be working together oneil said ill get the final crime scene report from peter bennington oneils background wasnt specific to forensic science but the solid dogged cop relied on traditional techniques for solving crimes research canvassing and crime scene analysis occasionally headbutting whatever his concoction of techniques though the senior detective was good at his job he had one of the highest arrestand more importantconviction records in the history of the office dance glanced at her watch and ill go interview the witness overby was silent for a moment witness i didnt know there was one dance didnt tell him that that very information too was in the message shed left her boss yep there is she said and slung her purse over her shoulder heading out of the door chapter oh thats sad the woman said her husband behind the wheel of their ford suv which hed just paid to fill glanced at her he was in a bad mood because of the gas prices and because hed just had a tantalizing view of pebble beach golf course which he couldnt afford to play even if the wife would let him one thing he definitely didnt want to hear was something sad still hed been married for twenty years and so he asked her what maybe a little more pointedly than he intended she didnt notice or pay attention to his tone there he looked ahead but she was just gazing out of the windshield at this stretch of deserted highway winding through the woods she wasnt pointing at anything in particular that made him even more irritated wonder what happened he was about to snap to what when he saw what she was talking about and he felt instantly guilty stuck in the sand ahead of them about thirty yards away was one of those memorials at the site of a car accident it was a cross kind of a crude thing sitting atop some flowers dark red roses is sad he echoed thinking of their childrentwo teenagers who still scared the hell out of him every time they got behind the wheel knowing how hed feel if anything happened to them in an accident he regretted his initial snippiness he shook his head glancing at his wifes troubled face they drove past the homemade cross she whispered my god it just happened it did yep its got todays date on it he shivered and they drove on toward a nearby beach that somebody had recommended for its walking trails he mused something odd whats that dear the speed limits thirtyfive along here you wouldnt think somebodyd wipe out so bad that theyd die his wife shrugged kids probably drinking and driving the cross sure put everything in perspective come on buddy you could be sitting back in portland crunching numbers and wondering what kind of insanity leo will come up with at the next team rally meeting here you are in the most beautiful part of the state of california with five days of vacation left and you couldnt come close to par at pebble beach in a million years quit your moaning he told himself he put his hand on his wifes knee and drove on toward the beach not even minding that fog had suddenly turned the morning gray driving along holman highway kathryn dance called her children whom her father stuart was driving to their respective day camps with the earlymorning meeting at the hotel dance had arranged for wes and maggietwelve and tento spend the night with their grandparents hey mom maggie said can we go to rosies for dinner tonight well have to see ive got a big case we made noodles for the spaghetti for dinner last night grandma and me and we used flour and eggs and water grandpa said we were making them from scratch what does from scratch mean from all the ingredients you dont buy them in a box like i know that i mean what does scratch mean dont say like and i dont know well look it up okay ill see you soon sweetie love you put your brother on hey mom wes launched into a monologue about the tennis match planned for today wes was dance suspected just starting the downhill coast into adolescence sometimes he was her little boy sometimes a distant teenager his father had died two years ago and only now was the boy sliding out from under the weight of that sorrow maggie though younger was more resilient is michael still going out on his boat this weekend im sure he is that rocks oneil had invited the boy to go fishing this saturday along with michaels young son tyler his wife anne rarely went out on the boat and though dance did from time to time seasickness made her a reluctant sailor she then spoke briefly to her father thanking him for babysitting the children and mentioned that the new case would be taking up a fair amount of time stuart dance was the perfect grandfatherthe semiretired marine biologist could make his own hours and truly loved spending time with the children nor did he mind playing chauffeur he did however have a meeting today at the monterey bay aquarium but assured his daughter that hed drop the children off with their grandmother after camp dance would pick them up from her later every day dance thanked fate or the gods that she had loving family nearby her heart went out to single mothers with little support she slowed turned at the light and pulled into the parking lot of monterey bay hospital studying a crowd of people behind a row of blue sawhorse barriers more protesters than yesterday and yesterday had seen more than the day before mbh was a famed institution one of the best medical centers in the region and one of the most idyllic set in a pine forest dance knew the place well shed given birth to her children here sat with her father as he recovered from major surgery shed identified her husbands body in the hospitals morgue and she herself had recently been attacked herean incident related to the protest dance was now watching as part of the daniel pell case dance had sent a young monterey county deputy to guard the prisoner in the county courthouse in salinas the convict had escaped and in the process had attacked and severely burned the deputy juan millar whod been brought here to intensive care that had been such a hard timefor his confused sorrowful family for michael oneil and for his fellow officers at the mcso for dance too it was while she was visiting juan that his distraught brother julio had assaulted her enraged that she was trying to take a statement from his semiconscious sibling dance had been more startled than hurt by the attack and had chosen not to pursue a case against the hysterical brother a few days after juan was admitted hed died at first it seemed that the death was a result of the extensive burns but then it was discovered that somebody had taken his lifea mercy killing dance was saddened by the death but juans injuries were so severe that his future would have been nothing but pain and medical procedures juans condition had also troubled dances mother edie a nurse at the hospital dance recalled standing in her kitchen her mother nearby gazing into the distance something was troubling her deeply and she soon told dance what shed been checking on juan when the man had swum to consciousness and looked at her with imploring eyes hed whispered kill me presumably hed delivered this plea to anybody whod come to visit or tend to him soon after that someone had fulfilled his wish no one knew the identity of the person who had combined the drugs in the iv drip to end juans life the death was now officially a criminal investigationbeing handled by the monterey county sheriffs office but it wasnt being investigated very hard doctors reported that it would have been highly unlikely for the deputy to live for more than a month or two the death was clearly a humane act even if criminal but the case had become a cause célèbre for prolifers the protesters that dance was now watching in the parking lot held posters emblazoned with crosses and pictures of jesus and of terry schiavo the comatose woman in florida whose righttodie case the us congress itself became entwined in the placards being waved about in front of monterey bay hospital decried the horrors of euthanasia and apparently because everyone was already assembled and in a protesting mood abortion they were mostly members of life first based in phoenix theyd arrived within days of the young officers death dance wondered if any of them caught on to the irony of protesting death outside a hospital probably not they didnt seem like folks with a sense of humor dance greeted the head of security a tall africanamerican standing outside the main entrance morning henry they keep coming it looks like morning agent dance a former cop henry bascomb liked using departmental titles he gave a smirk nodding their way like rabbits whos the ringleader in the center of the crowd was a scrawny balding man with wattles beneath his pointy chin he was in clerical garb thats the head the minister bascomb told her reverend r samuel fisk hes pretty famous came all the way from arizona r samuel fisk very ministerialsounding name she commented beside the reverend stood a burly man with curly red hair and a buttoned dark suit a bodyguard dance guessed life is sacred somebody called aiming the comment to one of the news trucks nearby sacred the crowd took up killers fisk shouted his voice surprisingly resonant for such a scarecrow though it wasnt directed at her dance felt a chill and flashed back to the incident in the icu when enraged julio millar had grabbed her from behind as michael oneil and another companion intervened killers the protesters took up the chant killers killers dance guessed theyd be hoarse later in the day good luck she told the security chief who rolled his eyes uncertainly inside dance glanced around half expecting to see her mother then she got directions from reception and hurried down a corridor to the room where shed find the witness in the roadside cross case when she stepped into the open doorway the blond teenage girl inside lying in the elaborate hospital bed looked up hi tammy im kathryn dance smiling at the girl you mind if i come in chapter although tammy foster had been left to drown in the trunk the attacker had made a miscalculation had he parked farther from shore the tide would have been high enough to engulf the entire car dooming the poor girl to a terrible death but as it happened the car had gotten bogged down in loose sand not far out and the flowing tide had filled the camrys trunk with only six inches of water at about am an airline employee on his way to work saw the glint from the car rescue workers got to the girl half conscious from exposure bordering on hypothermia and raced her to the hospital so dance now asked how you feeling okay i guess she was athletic and pretty but pale tammy had an equine face straight perfectly tinted blond hair and a pert nose that dance guessed had started life with a somewhat different slope her quick glance at a small cosmetic bag suggested to dance that she rarely went out in public without makeup dances badge appeared tammy glanced at it youre looking pretty good all things considered it was so cold tammy said ive never been so cold in my life im still pretty freaked im sure you are the girls attention swerved to the tv screen a soap opera was on dance and maggie watched them from time to time usually when the girl was home sick from school you could miss months and still come back and figure out the story perfectly dance sat down and looked at the balloons and flowers on a nearby table instinctively searching for red roses or religious gifts or cards emblazoned with crosses there were none how long are you going to be in the hospital im getting out today probably maybe tomorrow they said howre the doctors cute a laugh where do you go to school robert louis stevenson senior yeah in the fall to put the girl at ease dance made small talk asking about whether she was in summer school if shed thought about what college she wanted to attend her family sports you have any vacations plans we do now she said after this my mom and sister and me are going to visit my grandmother in florida next week there was exasperation in her voice and dance could tell that the last thing the girl wanted to do was go to florida with the family tammy you can imagine we really want to find whoever did this to you asshole dance lifted an agreeing eyebrow tell me what happened tammy explained about being at a club and leaving just after midnight she was in the parking lot when somebody came up from behind taped her mouth hands and feet threw her in the trunk and then drove to the beach he just left me there to like drown the girls eyes were hollow dance empathetic by naturea gift from her mothercould feel the horror herself a hurting tickle down her spine did you know the attacker the girl shook her head but i know what happened whats that gangs he was in a gang yeah everybody knows about it to get into a gang you have to kill somebody and if youre in a latino gang you have to kill a white girl thosere the rules you think the perp was latino yeah im sure he was i didnt see his face but got a look at his hand it was darker you know not black but he definitely wasnt a white guy how big was he not tall about fivesix but really really strong oh something else i think last night i said it was just one guy but i remembered this morning there were two of them you saw two of them more i could feel somebody else nearby you know how that happens could it have been a woman oh yeah maybe i dont know like i was saying i was pretty freaked out did anybody touch you no not that way just to put tape on me and throw me in the trunk her eyes flashed with anger do you remember anything about the drive no i was too scared i think i heard some clanks or something some noise from inside the car not the trunk no like metal or something i thought he put it in the car after he got me in the trunk i saw this movie one of the saw movies and i thought maybe he was going to use whatever it was to torture me the bike dance was thinking recalling the tread marks at the beach hed brought a bicycle with him for his escape she suggested this but tammy said that wasnt it there was no way to get a bike in the backseat she added gravely and it didnt sound like a bike okay tammy dance adjusted her glasses and kept looking at the girl who glanced at the flowers and cards and stuffed animals the girl added look at everything people gave me that bear there isnt he the best hes cute yep so youre thinking it was some latino kids in a gang yeah butwell you know like now its kind of over with over with i mean i didnt get killed just a little wet a laugh as she avoided dances eyes theyre definitely freaking its all over the news ill bet theyre gone i mean maybe even left town it was certainly true that gangs had initiation rites and some involved murder but killings were rarely outside the race or ethnicity of the gang and were most often directed at rival gang members or informants besides what had happened to tammy was too elaborate dance knew from running gang crimes that they were business first time is money and the less spent on extracurricular activities the better dance had already decided that tammy didnt think her attacker was a latino gangbanger at all nor did she believe there were two of them in fact tammy knew more about the perp than she was letting on it was time to get to the truth the process of kinesic analysis in interviewing and interrogation is first to establish a baselinea catalog of behaviors that subjects exhibit when telling the truth where do they put their hands where do they look and how often do they swallow or clear their throats often do they lace their speech with uhm do they tap their feet do they slouch or sit forward do they hesitate before answering once the truthful baseline is determined the kinesic expert will note any deviations from it when the subject is asked questions to which he or she might have reason to answer falsely when most people lie they feel stress and anxiety and try to relieve those unpleasant sensations with gestures or speech patterns that differ from the baseline one of dances favorite quotes came from a man who predated the coining of the term kinesics by a hundred years charles darwin who said repressed emotion almost always comes to the surface in some form of body motion when the subject of the attackers identity had arisen dance observed that the girls body language changed from her baseline she shifted her hips uneasily and a foot bobbed arms and hands are fairly easy for liars to control but were much less aware of the rest of our body especially toes and feet dance also noted other changes in the pitch of the girls voice fingers flipping her hair and blocking gestures touching her mouth and nose tammy also offered unnecessary digressions she rambled and she made overgeneralized statements everybody knows about it typical of someone whos lying convinced that the girl was withholding information kathryn dance now slipped into her analytic mode her approach to getting a subject to be honest consisted of four parts first she asked whats the subjects role in the incident here tammy was a victim and a witness only dance concluded she wasnt a participanteither involved in another crime or staging her own abduction second whats the motive to lie the answer it was pretty clear was that the poor girl was terrified of reprisal this was common and made dances job easier than if tammys motive were to cover up her own criminal behavior the third question whats the subjects general personality type this determination would suggest what approach dance should adopt in pursuing the interrogationshould she for instance be aggressive or gentle work toward problem solving or offer emotional support behave in a friendly manner or detached dance categorized her subjects according to attributes in the myersbriggs personality type indicator which assesses whether someone is an extravert or introvert thinking or feeling sensing or intuitive the distinction between extravert and introvert is about attitude does the subject act first and then assess the results an extravert or reflect before acting introvert information gathering is carried out either by trusting the five senses and verifying data sensing or relying on hunches intuitive decision making occurs by either objective logical analysis thinking or by making choices based on empathy feeling although tammy was pretty athletic and apparently a popular girl her insecuritiesand dance had learned an unstable home lifehad made her an introvert and one who was intuitive and feeling this meant dance couldnt use a blunt approach with the girl tammy would simply stonewalland be traumatized by harsh questioning finally the fourth question an interrogator must ask is what kind of liars personality does the subject have there are several types manipulators or high machiavellians after the italian political philosopher who literally wrote the book on ruthlessness see absolutely nothing wrong with lying they use deceit as a tool to achieve their goals in love business politics or crime and are very very good at deception other types include social liars who lie to entertain adaptors insecure people who lie to make positive impressions and actors who lie for control dance decided tammy was a combination of adaptor and actor her insecurities would make her lie to boost her fragile ego and she would lie to get her way once a kinesic analyst answers these four questions the rest of the process is straightforward she continues questioning the subject noting carefully those queries that elicit stress reactionsindicators of deception then she keeps returning to those questions and related ones probing further closing in on the lie and noting how the subject is handling the increasing levels of stress is she angry in denial depressed or trying to bargain her way out of the situation each of these states requires different tools to force or trick or encourage the subject to finally tell the truth this is what dance did now sitting forward a bit to put herself in a close but not invasive proxemic zoneabout three feet away from tammy this would make her uneasy but not overly threatened dance kept a faint smile on her face and decided not to exchange her grayrimmed glasses for her black framesher predator specswhich she wore to intimidate high mach subjects thats very helpful tammy everything youve said i really appreciate your cooperation the girl smiled but she also glanced at the door dance read guilt but one thing the agent added we have some reports from the crime scene like on csi you know sure i watch it which one do you like the original you know las vegas thats the best i hear dance had never seen the show but from the evidence it doesnt seem like there were two people either in the parking lot or at the beach oh well like i said it was just a like feeling and one question i had that clanking you heard see we didnt find any other car wheel tread marks either so were real curious how he got away lets go back to the bicycle i know you didnt think that was the sound in the car the clanking but any way it could have been you think a bicycle repeating a question is often a sign of deception the subject is trying to buy time to consider the implications of an answer and to make up something credible no it couldnt how could he get it inside tammys denial was too fast and too adamant shed considered a bicycle too but didnt want to admit the possibility for some reason dance lifted an eyebrow oh i dont know one of my neighbors has a camry its a pretty big car the girl blinked she was surprised it seemed that dance knew the make of her car that the agent had done her homework was making tammy uneasy she looked at the window subconsciously she was seeking a route of escape from the unpleasant anxiety dance was on to something she felt her own pulse tap harder maybe i dont know tammy said so he couldve had a bike that might mean he was somebody your age a little younger adults ride bikes sure but you see teenagers with them more hey what do you think about it being somebody in school with you school no way nobody i know would do something like that anybody ever threaten you have any fights with anybody at stevenson i mean brianna crenshaw was pissed when i beat her for cheerleader but she started going out with davey wilcox who i had a crush on so it kind of evened out a choked laugh dance smiled too no it was this gang guy im sure of it her eyes grew wide wait i remember now he made a call probably to the gang leader i could hear him open his phone and he said ella esta en el coche shes in the car dance translated to herself she asked tammy you know what that means something like ive got her in the car youre studying spanish yeah this was all very breathless and told in a voice with a higher pitch than normal her eyes locked onto dances but her hand flicked her hair away and paused to scratch her lip the spanish quotation was a complete lie what im thinking dance began reasonably is that he was just pretending to be a gangbanger to cover up his identity that means there was another reason to attack you like why thats what im hoping you can help me with you get any look at him at all not really he was behind me the whole time and it was really really dark in the parking lot they ought to put lights in i think im going to sue the club my fathers a lawyer in san mateo the angry posturing was meant to deflect dances questioning tammy had seen something maybe as he came up toward you you saw a reflection in the windows the girl was shaking her head no but dance persisted just a glimpse think back its always cold at night here he wouldntve been in shirtsleeves was he wearing a jacket a leather one cloth a sweater maybe a sweatshirt a hoodie tammy said no to all of them but some nos were different from others dance then noticed the girls eyes zip to a bouquet of flowers on the table beside it the getwell card read yo girl get your a out of there soon love j p and the beasty girl kathryn dance looked at herself as a journeyman law enforcer who succeeded largely because of doing her homework and not taking no for an answer occasionally though her mind did a curious jump shed pack in the facts and impressions and suddenly thered be an unexpected leapa deduction or conclusion that seemed to arise as if by magic a to b to x this happened now seeing tammy look at the flowers eyes troubled the agent took a chance see tammy we know that whoever attacked you also left a roadside crossas a message of some sort the girls eyes grew wide gotcha dance thought she does know about the cross she continued her improvised script and messages like that are always sent by people who know the victims ii heard him speaking spanish dance knew this was a lie but shed learned that with subjects who had a personality type like tammys she needed to leave them an escape route or theyd shut down completely she said agreeably oh im sure you did but i think he was trying to cover up his identity he wanted to fool you tammy was miserable the poor thing who terrified her so much first of all tammy let me reassure you that well protect you whoever did this wont get near you again im going to have a policeman stay outside your door here and well have one at your house too until we catch the person who did this relief in her eyes heres a thought what about a stalker youre very beautiful ill bet you have to be pretty careful a smilevery cautious but pleased nonetheless at the compliment anybody been hassling you the young patient hesitated were close were really close but tammy backed away no dance did too have you had any problems with people in your family this was a possibility shed checked her parents were divorcedafter a tough courtroom battleand her older brother lived away from home an uncle had a domestic abuse charge but tammys eyes made it clear that relatives probably werent behind the attack dance continued to fish you have any trouble with anybody youve been emailing maybe somebody you know online through facebook or myspace that happens a lot nowadays no really im not online that much she was flicking fingernail against fingernail the equivalent of wringing hands im sorry to push tammy its just so important to make sure this doesnt happen again then dance saw something that struck her like a slap in the girls eyes was a recognition responsea faint lifting of the brows and lids it meant that tammy was afraid that this would happen againbut since shed have her police guard the implication was that the attacker was a threat to others too the girl swallowed she was clearly in the denial phase of stress reaction which meant she was hunkered down defenses raised high it was somebody i didnt know i swear to god a deception flag i swear the deity reference too it was as if she were shouting im lying i want to tell the truth but im afraid dance said okay tammy i believe you look im really really tired i think maybe i dont want to say anything else until my mom gets here dance smiled of course tammy she rose and handed the girl one of her business cards if you could think about it a bit more and let us know anything that occurs to you im sorry im like not all that helpful eyes down contrite dance could see that the girl had used pouting and insincere selfdeprecation in the past the technique mixed with a bit of flirt would work with boys and her father women wouldnt let her get away with it still dance played to her no no youve been very helpful gosh honey look at all youve been through get some rest and put on some sitcoms a nod at the tv theyre good for the soul walking out the door dance reflected another few hours and she might have gotten the girl to tell the truth though she wasnt sure tammy was clearly terrified besides however talented the interrogator sometimes subjects simply would not tell what they knew not that it mattered kathryn dance believed shed learned all the information she needed a to b to x chapter in the lobby of the hospital dance used a pay phoneno mobiles allowedand called in a deputy to guard tammy fosters room she then went to reception and had her mother paged three minutes later edie dance surprised her daughter by approaching not from her station at cardiac care but from the intensive care wing hi mom katie said the stocky woman with short gray hair and round glasses around her neck was an abalone and jade pendant that shed made herself i heard about the attackthat girl in the car shes upstairs i know i just interviewed her shell be okay i think thats the word how did your meeting go this morning dance grimaced a setback it looks like the defense is trying to get the case dismissed on immunity doesnt surprise me was the cold response edie dance was never hesitant to state her opinions she had met the suspect and when she learned what hed done shed grown furiousan emotion evident to dance in the womans calm visage and faint smile never raising her voice but eyes of steel if looks could kill dance remembered thinking about her mother when she was young but ernie seybolds a bulldog hows michael edie dance had always liked oneil fine were running this case together she explained about the roadside cross no katie leaving a cross before somebody dies as a message dance nodded but she noted that her mothers attention continued to be drawn outside her face was troubled youd think theyd have more important things to do that reverend gave a speech the other day fire and brimstone and the hatred in their faces its vile have you seen juans parents edie dance had spent some time comforting the burned officers family his mother in particular she had known that juan millar probably wouldnt survive but shed done everything she could to make the shocked and bewildered couple understand that he was getting the best care possible edie had told her daughter that the womans emotional pain was as great as her sons physical agony no they havent been back julio has he was here this morning he was why maybe collecting his brothers personal effects i dont know her voice faded he was just staring at the room where juan died has there been an inquiry our board of ethics was looking into it and a few policemen have been here some county deputies but when they look at the reportand see the pictures of his injuriesnobodys actually that upset that he died it really was merciful did julio say anything to you when he was here today no he didnt talk to anybody you ask me hes a bit scary and i couldnt help but remember what he did to you he was temporarily insane dance said well thats no excuse for attacking my daughter edie said with a staunch smile then her eyes slipped out the glass doors and examined the protesters once more a dark look she said i better get back to my station if its okay could dad bring wes and maggie over here later hes got a meeting at the aquarium ill pick them up of course honey ill park em in the kids play area edie dance headed off once more glancing outside her visage was angry and troubled it seemed to say youve got no business being here disrupting our work dance left the hospital with a glance toward reverend r samuel fisk and his bodyguard or whoever the big man was theyd joined several other protesters clasped hands and lowered their heads in prayer tammys computer dance said to michael oneil he lifted an eyebrow its got the answer well maybe not the answer but an answer to who attacked her they were sipping coffee as they sat outside at whole foods in del monte center an outdoor plaza anchored by macys she once calculated that shed bought at least fifty pairs of shoes herefootwear her tranquilizer in fairness though that otherwise embarrassing number of purchases had taken place over a few years often but not always on sale online stalker oneil asked the food they ate wasnt poached eggs with delicate hollandaise sauce and parsley garnish but a shared raisin bagel with lowfat cream cheese in a little foil envelope maybe or a former boyfriend who threatened her or somebody she met on a social networking site but im sure she knows his identity if not him personally im leaning toward somebody from her school stevenson she wouldnt say though nope claimed it was a latino gangbanger oneil laughed a lot of fake insurance claims started with a hispanic in a mask broke into my jewelry store or two africanamericans wearing masks pulled guns and stole my rolex no description but i think he was wearing a sweatshirt a hoodie she gave a different negation response when i mentioned that her computer oneil mused hefting his heavy briefcase onto the table and opening it he consulted a printout the good news weve got it in evidence a laptop it was in the backseat of her car and the bad news is it went for a swim in the pacific ocean significant seawater damage he quoted dance was discouraged well have to send it to sacramento or the fbi up in san jose itll take weeks to get back they watched a hummingbird brave the crowds to hover for breakfast at a red hanging plant oneil said heres a thought i was talking to a friend of mine in the bureau up there hed just been to a presentation on computer crime one of the speakers was locala professor in santa cruz uc right one of dances alma maters he said the guy was pretty sharp and he volunteered to help if they ever needed him whats his background all i know is he got out of silicon valley and started to teach at least therere no bursting bubbles in education you want me to see if i can get his name sure oneil lifted a stack of business cards from his attaché case which was as neatly organized as his boat he found one and made a call in three minutes hed tracked down his friend and had a brief conversation the attack had already attracted the fbis attention dance deduced oneil jotted down a name and thanked the agent hanging up he handed the slip to dance dr jonathan boling below it was a number what can it hurtwhos got the laptop itself in our evidence locker ill call and tell them to release it dance unholstered her cell phone and called boling got his voice mail and left a message she continued to tell oneil about tammy mentioning that much of the girls emotional response was from her fear that the attacker would strike againand maybe target others just what we were worried about oneil said running a thick hand through his saltandpepper hair she also was giving off signals of guilt dance said because she mightve been partly responsible for what happened thats what im thinking in any case i really want to get inside that computer a glance at her watch unreasonably she was irritated that this jonathan boling hadnt returned her call of three minutes before she asked oneil any more leads on the evidence nope he told her what peter bennington had reported about the crime scene that the wood in the cross was from oak trees of which there were about a million or two on the peninsula the green florist wire binding the two branches was common and untraceable the cardboard was cut from the back of a pad of cheap notebook paper sold in thousands of stores the ink couldnt be sourced either the roses couldnt be traced to a particular store or other location dance told him the theory of the bicycle oneil was one step ahead though he added that theyd reexamined the lot where the girl had been kidnapped and the beach where the car was left and found more bicycle tread marks none identifiable but they were fresh suggesting that this was the perps likely means of transport but the tread marks werent distinctive enough to trace dances phone rangthe warner brothers looney tunes theme which her children had programmed in as a practical joke oneil smiled dance glanced at the caller id screen it read j boling she lifted an eyebrow thinkingagain unreasonablyit was about time chapter the noise outside a snap from behind the house brought back an old fear that she was being watched not like at the mall or the beach she wasnt afraid of leering kids or perverts that was irritating or flatteringdepending naturally on the kid or the perv no what terrified kelley morgan was some thing staring at her from outside the window of her bedroom snap a second sound sitting at the desk in her room kelley felt a shivering so sudden and intense that her skin stung her fingers were frozen pausing above the computer keyboard look she told herself then no dont finally jesus youre seventeen get over it kelley forced herself to turn around and risk a peek out the window she saw gray sky above green and brown plants and rocks and sand nobody and nothing forget about it the girl physique slim and brunette hair dense would be a senior in high school next fall she had a drivers license shed surfed maverick beach she was going skydiving on her eighteenth birthday with her boyfriend no kelley morgan didnt spook easily but she had one intense fear windows the terror was from when she was a little girl maybe nine or ten and living in this same house her mother read all these overpriced home design magazines and thought curtains were totally out and would mess up the clean lines of their modern house not a big deal really except that kelley had seen some stupid tv show about the abominable snowman or some monster like that it showed this cg animation of the creature as it walked up to a cabin and peered through the window scaring the hell out of the people in bed didnt matter that it was cheesy computer graphics or that she knew there wasnt any such thing in real life that was all it took one tv show for years afterward kelley would lie in bed sweating head covered by her blanket afraid to look for fear of what shed see afraid not to for fear shed have no warning of itwhatever it wasclimbing through the window ghosts zombies vampires and werewolves didnt exist she told herself but all shed need to do was read a stephenie meyers twilight book and bang the fear would come back and stephen king forget about it now older and not putting up with as much of her parents weirdness as she used to shed gone to home depot and bought curtains for her room and installed them herself screw her mothers taste in décor kelley kept the curtains drawn at night but they were open at the moment it being daytime with pale light and a cool summer breeze wafting in then another snap outside was it closer that image of the effing creature from the tv show just never went away and neither did the fear it injected into her veins the yeti the abominable snowman at her window staring staring a churning now gripped her in the belly like the time shed tried that liquid fast then gone back to solid foods snap she risked another peek the blank window yawned at her enough she returned to her computer reading some comments on the ourworld social networking site about that poor girl from stevenson high tammy whod been attacked last nightjesus thrown into a trunk and left to drown raped or at least molested everybody was saying most of the postings were sympathetic but some were cruel and those totally pissed kelley off she was staring at one now okay tammys going to be all right and thank god but i have to say one thing imho she brought it on herself she has got to learn not to walk around like a slutcat from the eighties with the eyeliner and where does she get those dresses she knows what the guys are thinking what did she expect anongurl kelley banged out a response omg how can you say that she was almost killed and anybody who says a woman asks to be raped is a mindless lser u should be ashamed bellakelley she wondered if the original poster would reply hitting back leaning toward the computer kelley heard yet another noise outside thats it she said aloud she rose but didnt go to the window instead she walked out of her room and into the kitchen peeking outside didnt see anythingor did she was there a shadow in the canyon behind the shrubs at the back of the property none of her family was home her parents working her brother at practice laughing uneasily to herself it was less scary for her to go outside and meet a hulking pervert facetoface than to see him looking into her window kelley glanced at the magnetic knife rack the blades were totally sharp debated but she left the weapons where they were instead she held her iphone up to her ear and walked outside hi ginny yeah i heard something outside im just going to go see the conversation was pretend but heor itwouldnt know that no ill keep talking just in case theres some asshole out there talking loud the door opened onto the side yard she headed toward the back then approaching the corner she slowed finally she stepped tentatively into the backyard empty at the end of the property beyond a thick barrier of plants the ground dropped away steeply into county landa shallow canyon filled with brush and some jogging trails so hows it going yeahyeah sweet way sweet okay dont overdo it she thought your acting sucks kelley eased to the row of foliage and peered through it into the canyon she thought she saw someone moving away from the house then not too far away she saw some kid in sweats on a bike taking one of the trails that was a shortcut between pacific grove and monterey he turned left and vanished behind a hill kelley put the phone away she started to return to the house when she noticed something out of place in the back planting beds a little dot of color red she walked over to it and picked up the flower petal a rose kelley let the crescent flutter back to the ground she returned to the house a pause looking back no one no animals not a single abominable snowman or werewolf she stepped inside and froze gasping in front of her ten feet away a human silhouette was approaching features indistinct because of the backlighting from the living room who the figure stopped a laugh jesus kel you are so freaked you lookgimme your phone i want a picture her brother ricky reached for her iphone get out kelley said grimacing and twisting away from his outstretched hand thought you had practice needed my sweats hey you hear about that girl in the trunk she goes to stevenson yeah ive seen her tammy foster she hot the lanky sixteenyearold with a mop of brown hair that matched her own headed for the refrigerator and grabbed a power drink ricky youre so gross uhhuh so is she oh she hated brothers when you leave lock the door ricky screwed his face into a huge frown why whod wanna molest you lock it like okay she shot him a dark look which he missed completely kelley continued to her room and sat down at the computer again yep anongurl had posted an attack on kelley for defending tammy foster okay bitch youre going down i am gonna own you so bad kelley morgan began to type professor jonathan boling was in his forties dance estimated not tall a few inches over her height with a frame that suggested either a tolerance for exercise or a disdain for junk food straight brownish hair similar to dances though she suspected that he didnt sneak a box of clairol into his shopping cart at safeway every couple of weeks well he said looking around the halls as she escorted him from the lobby to her office at the california bureau of investigation this isnt quite what i pictured not like csi did everybody in the universe watch that show boling wore a digital timex on one wrist and a braided bracelet on the otherperhaps symbolizing support for something or another dance thought about her children who would cover their wrists with so many colored bands she was never sure what the latest causes were in jeans and a black polo shirt he was handsome in a subdued national public radio kind of way his brown eyes were steady and he seemed fast with a smile dance decided he could have any grad student he set his sights on she asked you ever been in a law enforcement office before well sure he said clearing his throat and giving off odd kinesic signals then a smile but they dropped the charges i mean what else could they do when jimmy hoffas body never turned up she couldnt help but laugh oh you poor grad students beware i thought you consulted with police ive offered to at the end of my lectures to law enforcement agencies and security companies but nobodys taken me up on it until now youre my maiden voyage ill try not to disappoint they arrived in her office and sat across from each other at her battered coffee table boling said im happy to help however i can but im not sure exactly what i can do a bolt of sunlight fell across his loafers and he glanced down noticed that one sock was black and one navy blue he laughed without embarrassment in another era dance would have deduced that he was single nowadays with two busy working partners fashion glitches like this were inadmissible evidence he didnt however wear a wedding ring i have a hardware and software background but for serious technical advice im afraid im over the legal age limit and i dont speak hindi he told her that hed gotten joint degrees in literature and engineering at stanford admittedly an odd combination and after a bit of bumming around the world had ended up in silicon valley doing systems design for some of the big computer companies exciting time he said but he added eventually hed been turned off by the greed it was like an oil rush everybody was asking how could they get rich by convincing people they had these needs that computers could fill i thought maybe we should look at it the other way find out what needs people actually had and then ask how computers could help them a cocked head as between their position and mine i lost bigtime so i took some stock money quit bummed around again i ended up in santa cruz met somebody decided to stay and tried teaching loved it that was almost ten years ago im still there dance told him that after a stint as a reporter shed gone back to collegethe same school where he taught she studied communications and psychology their time had coincided briefly but they didnt know anyone in common he taught several courses including the literature of science fiction as well as a class called computers and society and in the grad school boling taught what he described as some boring technical courses sort of math sort of engineering he also consulted for corporations dance interviewed people in many different professions the majority radioed clear signals of stress when speaking of their jobs which indicated either anxiety because of the demands of the work or more often depression about itas boling had earlier when speaking about silicon valley but his kinesic behavior now when discussing his present career was stress free he continued to downplay his technical skill though and dance was disappointed he seemed smart and more than willing to helphed driven down here on a moments noticeand she would have liked to use his services but to get into tammy fosters computer it sounded like theyd need more of a handson tech person at least she hoped he could recommend someone maryellen kresbach came in with a tray of coffee and cookies attractive she resembled a countrywestern singer with her coiffed brown hair and red kevlar fingernails the guard desk called somebodys got a computer from michaels office good you can bring it up maryellen paused for a moment and dance had an amusing idea that the woman was checking out boling as romantic fodder her assistant had been waging a nonetoosubtle campaign to find dance a husband when the woman eyed bolings naked left ring finger and lifted her brow at dance the agent flashed her an exasperated glance which was duly noted and summarily ignored boling called his thanks and after pouring three sugars into his coffee dug into the cookies and ate two good no better than good she bakes them herself really people do that they dont all come out of a keebler bag dance went for half a cookie and enjoyed a sip of coffee though she was caffeinated enough from her earlier meeting with michael oneil let me tell you whats going on she explained to boling about the attack on tammy foster then said and we have to get into her laptop boling nodded understandingly ah the one that went for a swim in the pacific ocean its toast he corrected with the water more likely its oatmealif were keeping to breakfast food metaphors just then a young mcso deputy stepped into dances office carrying a large paper bag goodlooking and eager though more cute than handsome he had bright blue eyes and for a moment he seemed about to salute agent dance thats right im david reinhold crime scene at the sheriffs office she nodded a greeting nice to meet you thanks for bringing that over you bet anything i can do he and boling shook hands then the trim officer in a perfectly pressed uniform handed dance the paper bag i didnt put it in plastic wanted it to breathe get as much moisture out as we could thanks boling said and i took the liberty of taking the battery out the young deputy said he held up a sealed metal tube its a lithiumion i thought if water got inside there could be a fire risk boling nodded clearly impressed good thinking dance had no clue what he was talking about boling noticed her frown and explained that some lithium batteries under certain circumstances could burst into flames when exposed to water you a geek boling asked him the deputy replied not really just stuff you pick up you know he held out a receipt for dance to sign and then pointed out the chainofcustody card attached to the bag itself if theres anything else i can do let me know he handed her a business card she thanked him and the young man retreated dance reached inside the bag and extracted tammys laptop it was pink what a color boling said shaking his head he turned it over and examined the back dance asked him so do you know somebody who could get it running and take a look at her files sure me oh i thought you said you werent that much of a tech anymore thats not tech not by todays standards he smiled again its like rotating your tires on a car only i need a couple of tools we dont have a lab here nothing as sophisticated as you probably need well that depends i see you collect shoes her closet door was open and boling mustve glanced inside where a dozen pairs sat more or less ordered on the floorfor those nights when she went out after work without stopping at home she gave a laugh busted he continued how bout personal care appliances personal care i need a hair dryer she chuckled sadly all my beauty aids are at home then we better go shopping chapter jon boling needed a bit more than a hair dryer as it turned out though not much their shopping spree had yielded a conair a set of miniature tools and a metal box called an enclosurea threebyfiveinch rectangle from which sprouted a wire that ended in a usb plug these items now sat on dances coffee table in her office at the cbi boling surveyed tammy fosters designer laptop i can take it apart im not going to screw up any evidence am i its been dusted for prints all we found were tammys go ahead and do what you wantshes not a suspect besides she lied to me so shes in no position to complain pink he said again as if this was a shocking breach of propriety he turned the machine over and with a tiny phillipshead screwdriver had the panel off the back in a few minutes he then extracted a small metalandplastic rectangle the hard drive he explained by next year thisll be considered huge were going to flash memory in central processing units no hard drivesno moving parts at all the subject seemed to excite him but he sensed a lecture was a digression inappropriate at the moment boling fell silent and examined the drive closely he didnt seem to wear contacts dance whod worn glasses since girlhood had a mild attack of eye envy the professor then gently rattled the drive beside his ear okay he set it on the table okay he grinned unpacked the hair dryer plugged it in and wafted a stream of balmy heat over the drive shouldnt be long i dont think its wet but we cant take the chance electricity and water equal uhoh with his free hand he sipped the coffee he mused we professorsre very envious of the private sector you know private sectorthats latin for actually making money he nodded at the cup take starbucks coffee was a pretty good idea for a franchise i keep looking for the next big one but all i could think of were things like house o pickles and jerky world beveragesre the best but all the good onesre taken maybe a milk bar dance suggested you could call it elsies his eyes brightened or how bout just an udder place that was really bad she said as they shared a brief laugh when he finished drying the hard drive he slipped it into the enclosure he then plugged the usb connection into his own laptop which was a somber gray apparently the shade computers should be im curious what youre doing she was watching his sure fingers pound the keys many of the letters were worn off he didnt need to see them to type the water wouldve shorted out the computer itself but the hard drive should be okay inside im going to turn it into a readable drive after a few minutes he looked up and smiled nope its good as new dance scooted her chair closer to his she glanced at the screen and saw that windows explorer was reading tammys hard drive as local disk g itll have everything on ither emails the websites shes browsed her favorite places records of her instant messages even deleted data its not encrypted or passwordprotectedwhich by the way tells me that her parents are very uninvolved in her life kids whose folks keep a close eye on them learn to use all kinds of tricks for privacy which i by the way am pretty good at cracking he unplugged the disk from his computer and handed it and the cable to her its all yours just plug it in and read to your hearts content he shrugged my first assignment for the policeshort but sweet with a good friend kathryn dance owned and operated a website devoted to homemade and traditional music the site was pretty sophisticated technically but dance knew little of the hardware and software her friends husband handled that side of the business she now said to boling you know if youre not too busy any chance you could stay around for a little help me search it boling hesitated well if you have plans how much time are we talking ive got to be in napa on friday night family reunion sort of thing dance said oh nothing that long a few hours a day at the most eyes brightening again id love to puzzles are an important food group to me now what would i be looking for any clues as to the identity of tammys attacker oh da vinci code lets hope its not as tricky and that whatever we find wont get us excommunicated im interested in any communications that seem threatening disputes fights comments about stalkers would instant messages be there fragments we can probably reconstruct a lot of them boling plugged the drive back into his computer and leaned forward then social networking sites dance said anything to do with roadside memorials or crosses memorials she explained we think he left a roadside cross to announce the attack thats pretty sick the professors fingers snapped over the keys as he typed he asked why do you think her computers the answer dance explained about the interview with tammy foster you picked up all that just from her body language thats right she told him about the three ways humans communicate first through verbal contentwhat we say thats the meaning of the words themselves but content is not only the least reliable and most easily faked its actually only a small portion of the way we send messages to each other the second and third are much more important verbal qualityhow we say the words that would be things like pitch of voice how fast we talk whether we pause and use uhm frequently and then third kinesicsour bodys behavior gestures glances breathing posture mannerisms the last two are what interviewers are most interested in since theyre much more revealing than speech content he was smiling dance lifted an eyebrow boling explained you sound as excited about your work as you and your flash memory a nod yep theyre amazing little guyseven the pink ones boling continued to type and scroll through page after page of the guts of tammys computer speaking softly typical rambling of a teenage girl boys clothes makeup parties a little bit about school movies and musicno threats he scrolled quickly through various screens so far negative on the emails at least the ones for the past two weeks i can go back and check the earlier ones if i need to now tammys in all the big social networking sitesfacebook myspace ourworld second life though boling was offline he could pull up and view recent pages tammy had read wait wait okay he was sitting forward tense what is it she was almost drowned thats right a few weeks ago she and some of her friends started a discussion in ourworld about what scared them the most one of tammys big fears was drowning dances mouth tightened maybe he picked the means of death specifically for her in a surprisingly vehement tone boling said we give away too much information about ourselves online way too much you know the term escribitionist nope a term for blogging about yourself a grimacing smile tells it pretty well doesnt it and then theres dooce thats new too a verb as in ive been dooced it means getting fired because of what you posted on your blogwhether facts about yourself or your boss or job a woman in utah coined it she posted some things about her employer and got laid off dooce comes from a misspelling of dude by the way oh and then theres predoocing which is you apply for a job and the interviewer asks you you ever write anything about your former boss in a blog of course they already know the answer theyre waiting to see if youre honest and if you have posted anything bad you were knocked out of contention before you brushed your teeth the morning of the interview too much information way too much boling continued to type lightning fast finally he said ah think ive got something what tammy posted a comment on a blog a few days ago her screen name is tamf boling spun the computer around for dance to look at reply to chilton posted by tamf the driver is effing weird i mean dangerous time after cheerleader practice he was hanging out outside our locker room like he was trying to look inside and get pictures on his phone i go up to him and im like whatre you doing here and he looks at me like he was going to kill me hes a total frk i know a girl who goes to deleted with us and she told me the driver grabbed her boobs only shes afraid to say anything because she thinks hell come get her or start shooting people like in virginia tech boling added whats interesting is that she posted that in a part of the blog called roadside crosses dances heart rate pumped up a bit she asked whos the driver dont know the names deleted in all the posts a blog hmm right boling gave a brief laugh and said mushrooms what blogs are the mushrooms of the internet theyre sprouting up everywhere a few years ago everybody in silicon valley was wondering what would be the next big thing in the dotcom world well it turned out to be not a revolutionary new type of hardware or software but online content games social networking sitesand blogs you cant write about computers now without studying them the one tammy posted to was the chilton report dance shrugged never heard of it i have its local but its well known in blogging circles its like a californiabased matt drudge only more fringe jim chiltons a bit of a character he continued to read lets go online and check it out dance got her own laptop from her desk whats the url she asked boling gave it to her httpwwwthechiltonreportcom the professor tugged his chair closer and together they read the homepage the chilton report the moral voice of america a collection of musings about where this countrys going wrongand where its going right dance chuckled where its going right clever hes moral majority conservative i take it boling shook his head from what i know hes more cutandpaste she lifted an eyebrow i mean that he picks and chooses his causes hes more right than left but hell take on anybody who falls short of his standards of morality or judgment or intelligence thats one of the points of blogs of course to stir things up controversy sells below was a greeting to the readers dear reader whether youve ended up here because youre a subscriber or a fan or simply

a section about personal news she glanced over the listings on the home front go team im happy to say that after this weekends game the older boys team is go jayhawks now parents listen to me your youngsters should give up baseball and football for soccer which is the safest and healthiest team sport there is see the chilton report of april for my comments about sports injuries among children

wonderful children welcome home donald heroes hats off to the brave firefighters of monterey county pat and i happened to be downtown on alvarado last tuesday when calls for help rang out and smoke sprouted from a construction site flames blocked the exitwith two construction workers trapped on the upper floors within minutes two dozen firemen andwomen were on the scene and a fire truck had stretched its ladder to the roof the men were plucked from harms way and the flames were extinguished no injuries minimal damage in most of our lives bravery involves little more than arguing politics or at the most physical snorkeling at fancy resorts or mountain biking how rarely are we called on to exhibit true couragethe way the men and women of monterey county fire and rescue do every single day without a moments hesitation or complaint bravo to you all accompanying this posting was a dramatic photo of a fire truck in downtown monterey typical of blogs boling said personal information gossip people like to read that dance also clicked on a link called monterey she was taken to a page that extolled our home the beautiful and historic monterey peninsula featuring artistic photos of the shoreline and boats near cannery row and fishermans wharf there were a number of links to local sights another link led them to maps of the area including one that depicted her town pacific grove boling said this is all gingerbread lets look at the content of the blogthats where well find the clues he frowned do you call them clues or evidence you can call em broccoli if it helps us find the perp lets see what the veggies reveal he gave her another url httpwwwthechiltonreportcomhtmljunehtml this was the crux of the blog chiltons miniessays boling explained chiltons the op the original poster which if youre interested is derived from og original gangsta for the leaders of gangs like bloods and crips anyway he uploads his commentary and then leaves it there for people to respond to they agree or disagree sometimes they go off on tangents the original comment by chilton dance noticed remained at the top and below were the replies mostly people replied directly to the bloggers comment but sometimes they responded to other posters each separate article and all the related posts are called a thread boling explained sometimes the threads can go on for months or years dance began skimming under the clever heading hypochristcy chilton attacked the very man dance had just seen at the hospital the reverend fisk and the life first movement fisk it seemed had once said that murdering abortion doctors was justified chilton wrote that he was adamantly against abortion but condemned fisk for the statement two of fisks defenders crimsoninchrist and lukeb viciously attacked chilton the former said the blogger himself should be crucified with the reference to the color in his name dance wondered if crimsoninchrist was the ministers large redheaded bodyguard shed seen earlier at the hospital protest the power to the people thread was an exposé about a california state representativebrandon klevinger who was head of the nuclear facilities planning committee chilton had found out that klevinger had gone on a golfing junket with a developer who was proposing a new nuclear plant near mendocino when it would have been cheaper and more efficient to build it closer to sacramento in desalinateand devastate the blogger took on a plan to build a desalination plant near the carmel river the comment included a personal attack on the man behind the project arnold brubaker painted by chilton as an interloper from scottsdale arizona a man with a sketchy past and possible underworld connections two of the postings represented the citizens two positions on the desalination issue reply to chilton posted by lyndon strickland i have to say youve opened my eyes on this issue had no idea that somebodys ramrodding this through i reviewed the filed proposal at the county planning office and must say that though i am an attorney familiar with environmental issues it was one of the most obfuscatory documents ive ever tried to wade through i think we need considerably more transparency in order to have meaningful debate on this matter reply to chilton posted by howard skelton do you know that america will run out of freshwater by and percent of the earths water is salt water only an idiot would not take advantage of that we need desalination for our survival if were to continue to maintain our position as the most productive and efficient country in the world in the yellow brick road thread chilton talked about a project by the state department of transportationcaltrans a new highway was being built from highway through salinas and on to hollister through farm country chilton was questioning the lightning speed with which the project had been approved as well as the meandering route which would benefit some farmers far more than others he hinted at payoffs chiltons social conservative side shone through in just say no a thread condemning a proposal for increased sex education in middle schools chilton called for abstinence a similar message could be found in caught in the actnot about a married state court judge caught leaving a motel with a young clerk half his age chilton was incensed at the recent development that the judge had received a wrist slap from the judicial ethics committee he felt the man should have been removed from the bench and disbarred kathryn dance then came to the crucial thread beneath a sad picture of crosses flowers and a stuffed animal roadside crosses posted by chilton i recently drove past the spot on highway where two roadside crosses and some bright bouquets sit they marked the site of that terrible accident on june where two girls died following a graduation party lives endedand lives of loved ones and friends changed forever i realized that i hadnt heard much about any police investigation into the crash i made some calls and found thered been no arrests no citations were even issued that struck me as odd now no ticket means a determination that the drivera high school student so no nameswas not to blame so then what was the cause of the accident as i drove along the road i noticed it was windswept and sandy and had no lights or guardrails near the spot where the car veered off the road a caution sign was weathered and would have been hard to see in the dark the accident occurred around midnight there was no drainage i could see pools of standing water on the shoulder and on the highway itself why didnt the police do a thorough accident reconstruction they have people on staff who do that ive learned why didnt caltrans immediately send a team to examine the surface of the road the grading the markings i could find no record of any such examination maybe the road is as safe as can be expected but is it fair to uswhose children regularly drive that stretch of highwayfor the authorities to dismiss the tragedy so quickly it seems to me that their attention has faded quicker than the flowers sitting sorrowfully beneath those roadside crosses reply to chilton posted by ronald kestler if you look at the budget situation in monterey county and in the state in general you will find that one area taking the brunt of our economic woes is adequate warning measures along highrisk highways my son was killed in an accident along highway because the curve sign had become covered with mud it would have been an easy thing for state workers to find and clean it but did they do this no their neglect was inexcusable thank you mr chilton for calling attention to this problem reply to chilton posted by a concerned citizen highway workers make obscene amounts of money and sit on their fat deleted all day long youve seen them everybody has standing by the road not doing anything when they could be fixing dangerous highways and making sure were safe another example of our tax dollars not at work reply to chilton posted by robert garfield california department of transportation i wish to assure you and your readers that the safety of our citizens is caltranss number one priority we make every effort to maintain the highways of our state in good repair the portion of road where the accident youre referring to occurred is like all highways under state control regularly inspected no violations or unsafe conditions were found we urge all drivers to remember that highway safety in california is everyones responsibility reply to chilton posted by tim concord your comment is epic win chilton the police will get away with murder if we let them i was pulled over on sixtyeight because im africanamerican the police made me sit on the ground for half an hour before they let me go and they wouldnt tell me what id done wrong except for a light that was out the government should be protecting lives not dissing innocent citizens thank you reply to chilton posted by ariel on friday me and my friend went to see the place where it happened and we were crying when we saw the crosses and flowers there we were sitting there and we looked all over the highway and there were no police there i mean none just after it happened where were the police and maybe it was there were no warning signs or the road was slippery but it looked pretty safe to me even tho it was sandy thats true reply to chilton posted by simstud i drive that stretch of highway all the time and its not the most dangerous place in the world so what im wondering is did the police really look at who was behind the wheel i know the driver from school and i dont think hes the best driver in the world reply to simstud posted by footballrulz dude not the best driver in the world h to break it to you but the driver is a total frk and a luser he cant drive i dont even think he has a license why didnt the cops find that out too busy going for dounuts and coffee lol reply to chilton posted by mitcht chilton youre always trashing the government which is total win but in this case forget the road its fine that guy from caltrans said so ive drove down there a hundred times and if you missed that curve because your drunk or stoned if the police deleted up its because they didnt look at the driver close enough hes a nb and scary too simstud owns this thread reply to chilton posted by amydancer this is weird cause my parents read the report but i dont usually so its weird that im here but i heard around school what youd posted about the accident and so i logged on i read everything and i think youre one hundred percent right and what that other poster said too everybody is innocent until proven guilty but i dont understand why the police just dropped the investigation somebody who knows the driver was telling me that he was up all night before the party i mean hours playing computer games imho he fell asleep driving and another thingthose gamers think theyre hot deleted behind the wheel bc they play those driving games in the arcades but its not the same thing reply to chilton posted by arthur standish federal funds for road maintenance have decreased consistently over the years while the budget for us military operations and foreign aid has quadrupled perhaps we should be more concerned about the lives of our citizens than those of people in other countries reply to chilton posted by tamf the driver is effing weird i mean dangerous time after cheerleader practice he was hanging out outside our locker room like he was trying to look inside and get pictures on his phone i go up to him and im like whatre you doing here and he looks at me like he was going to kill me hes a total frk i know a girl who goes to deleted with us and she told me the driver grabbed her boobs only shes afraid to say anything because she thinks hell come get her or start shooting people like in virginia tech reply to chilton posted by boardtodeath i heard somebody who knows a dude was at the party that night and he saw the driver before he got in the car and he was walking around all deleted up and thats why they crashed it was the police lost the breathaliser results and it was embarrassing so they had to let him go and thats word reply to chilton posted by sarafromcarmel i dont think its fair what everybody in this thread is saying we dont know the facts the crash was a terrible tragedy and the police didnt press charges so we have to go with that think what the drivers going through he was in my chemistry class and he never bothered anybody he was pretty smart and helped our table team a lot ill bet he feels real bad about those girls hes got to live with that for the rest of his life i feel sorry for him reply to sarafromcarmel posted by anonymous sara u r a lame deleted if he was driving the car then he did something that made those girls die how can you say he didnt jesus its people like you who let hitler gas the jews and bush go into iraq why dont you call the driver up and have him take you for a nice ride ill come put a cross at your deleteding grave you deleted reply to chilton posted by legend the drivers brother is retarded and it might look bad for the police to arrest the driver cause of all this political correct stuff which makes me sick also they should check out the girls purses i mean the girls in the crash because i heard he ripped them off before the ambulances got there his families so poor that they cant even afford a washer and drier ive seen him and his mom and his deletedup little brother at the laundromat on billings all the time who goes to laundromats lusers thats who reply to chilton posted by sexygurl my best friend is a junior at deleted with the driver and she was talking to somebody who was at the party where the girls who died were the driver was sitting in a corner with his sweats hood up staring at everybody and talking to himself and somebody found him in the kitchen just looking at the knives everybody was like what the hells he doing here why did he come reply to chilton posted by jake u totally own it chilton yeah the driver deleteded up look at the luser his life is epic fail hes always faking hes sick in pe class to get out of working out he only goes to the gym to hang around in the locker room and stare at everybodys deleted he is totally gay somebody told me that reply to chilton posted by curlyjen me and my friends were talking and last week somebody saw the driver on lighthouse doing donuts in a car he stole from his grandmother without permission he was trying to get deleted to show her thong like shed care lol and when she ignored him he started wacking off right in front of her right there on lighthouse at the same time he was driving he definitely was doing the same thing that night he crashed reply to chilton posted by anonymous i go to deleted im a sophomore and i know him and everybody knows about him imho i mean hes all right he games a lot but so what i play soccer a lot that doesnt make me a killer reply to anonymous posted by billvan deleted you deleted if you know so much whats your sauce oh genius you dont even have the balls to post under your real name afraid hed come and deleted you up the deleted reply to chilton posted by bellakelley u r so right me and my friend were at that party on the where it happened and the driver was coming on to deleted and they were like just go away but he didnt he followed them out the door when they were leaving but we have ourselves to blame too for not doing anything all of us who were there we all knew the driver is a luser and perv and we should have called the police or somebody when they left i had this bad feeling like in ghost whisperer and look what happened reply to chilton posted by anonymous somebody goes into columbine or virginia tech with a gun and theyre criminals but when the driver kills somebody with a car nobody does anything about it something is very messed up here reply to chilton posted by wizardone i think we need a time out some poster dissed the driver because he didnt like sports and he played games whats the bfd there are millions of people who dont play sports but like games i dont know the driver real good but were in the same class at deleted he isnt a bad dude at all everybodys dissing him but does anybody here actually know him whatever happened he didnt hurt anybody on purpose and we all know people who do everyday imho he feels bad about what happened the police didnt arrest him because duh he didnt do anything illegal reply to wizardone posted by halfpipe another gamerlamer look at the name lzr foad wizard reply to chilton posted by archenemy the driver is a total phrk in his locker at school he has pictures of the dds from columbine and virginia tech and those dead bodies from the concentration camps he walks around in some chp ass hoodie trying to look kewl but hes a luser on roids thats all hell ever be the driver if your reading this dd and not hanging with the elves and fairies remember we own u why dont you u just do us all a favor and blow youre deleteding brains out your death epic win chapter kathryn dance sat back shaking her head a lot of hormones there she said to jon boling she was troubled by the viciousness of the blog postsand most of them written by young people boling scrolled back to the original post look what happened chilton makes a simple observation about a fatal accident all he does is question whether the road was safely maintained but look at how the responding posts arc they go from discussing what chilton brought uphighway safetythen move on to government finances and then to the kid who was driving even though he apparently didnt do anything wrong the posters get more and more agitated as they attack him and finally the blog turns into a barroom brawl among the posters themselves like the game of telephone by the time the message moves along its distorted i heard somebody knows somebody who a friend of mine told me she scanned the pages again one thing i noticed chilton doesnt fight back look at the post about reverend fisk and the righttolife group reply to chilton posted by crimsoninchrist you are a sinner who cannot comprehend the goodness within the heart of rev r samuel fisk he has devoted his life to christ and all of his works while you do nothing but pander to the masses for your own pleasure and profit your misreading of the great reverends views is pathetic and libelous you should be nailed up on a cross yourself boling told her no the serious bloggers dont argue back chilton will give a reasoned response but flame warsattacks among postersget out of control and become personal the postings become about the attack not the substance of the topic thats one of the problems with blogs in person people would never feud like this the anonymity of the blogs mean the fights go on for days or weeks dance looked through the text so the boy is a student she recalled her deduction from the interview with tammy foster chilton deleted his name and the name of the school but its got to be robert louis stevenson where tammy goes boling tapped the screen and theres her post she was one of the first to say something about the boy and everyone else jumped on board after that maybe the post was the source of the guilt dance had picked up on during the interview if this boy was behind the attack then tammy as dance and oneil had speculated would feel partly responsible for the assault on her shed brought it on herself and perhaps guilty too if he went on to hurt someone else this explained why tammy wouldnt like the suggestion that her abductor had a bike in the car that would lead dance to consider a younger suspecta student whose identity the girl didnt want to reveal because she still considered him a threat its all so vicious dance said nodding at the screen did you hear about the litter boy who happened in kyoto a few years ago japan a teenage boy tossed a fast food wrapper and soda cup on the ground in a park somebody shot a picture of the kid doing it on their cell phone and uploaded it to his friends next thing it started appearing on blogs and social networking sites all over the country cybervigilantes tracked him down they got his name and address and posted the info online it spread to thousands of blogs the whole thing became a witch hunt people began showing up at his housethrowing trash in the yard he nearly killed himselfthat kind of dishonor is significant in japan bolings tonal quality and body language revealed anger critics say oh its just words or pictures but they can be weapons too they can cause just as much damage as fists and frankly i think the scars last longer dance said i dont get some of the vocabulary in the posts he laughed oh in blogs and bulletin boards and social networking sites its in to misspell abbreviate and make up words sauce for source moar for more imho is in my humble opinion do i dare ask foad oh he said a polite valediction to your note it means fuck off and die all caps of course is the same as shouting and what is phrk thats leetspeak for freak leetspeak its a sort of language thats been created by teens over the past few years you only see it with keyboarded text numbers and symbols take the place of letters and spellings are altered leetspeak comes from elite as in the best and the choicest it can be incomprehensible to us old folks but anybody whos mastered it can write and read it as fast as we do english why do kids use it because its creative and unconventionaland cool which by the way you should spell kewl the spelling and grammar are awful true but it doesnt mean the posters are necessarily stupid or uneducated its just the convention nowadays and speed is important as long as the reader can understand what youre saying you can be as careless as you want dance said i wonder who the boy is i guess i could call chp about the accident chilton refers to oh ill find it the online world is huge but its also small ive got tammys social networking site here she spends most of her time in one called ourworld its bigger than facebook and myspace its got a hundred thirty million members a hundred thirty million yep bigger than most countries boling was squinting as he typed okay im in her account just do a little crossreferencing there got him that fast yep his names travis brigham youre right hes a junior at robert louis stevenson high in monterey going to be a senior this fall lives in pacific grove where dance and her children lived im looking over some of the postings in ourworld about the accident looks like he was driving a car back from a party and lost control two girls were killed another one ended up in the hospital he wasnt badly injured no charges were filedthere was some question about the condition of the road itd been raining that sure i remember it parents always recall fatal car crashes involving youngsters and of course she felt a sting of memory from several years ago the highway patrol officer calling her at home asking if she was fbi agent bill swensons wife why was he asking shed wondered im sorry to tell you agent danceim afraid theres been an accident she now pushed the thought away and said innocent but hes still getting vilified but innocence is boring boling said wryly its no fun to post about that he indicated the blog what youve got here are vengeful angels whats that a category of cyberbullies vengeful angels are vigilantes theyre attacking travis because they think he got away with somethingsince he wasnt arrested after the accident they dont believe or trust the police another category is the power hungrytheyre closest to typical schoolyard bullies they need to control others by pushing them around then there are the mean girls they bully because well theyre little shits girls mostly whore bored and post cruel things for the fun of it it borders on sadism a tinge of anger again in bolings voice bullyingits a real problem and its getting worse the latest statistics are that thirtyfive percent of kids have been bullied or threatened online most of them multiple times he fell silent and his eyes narrowed what jon interesting that theres one thing we dont see whats that travis fighting back in the blog flaming the people who attacked him maybe he doesnt know about it boling gave a thin laugh oh believe me he wouldve known about the attacks five minutes after the first post in the chilton thread whys it significant hes not posting one of the most persistent categories of cyberbullying is called revenge of the nerds or the victims of retaliators those are people whove been bullied and are fighting back the social stigma of being outed or bullied or humiliated at that age is overwhelming i guarantee hes furious and hes hurt and he wants to get even those feelings have to come out somehow you get the implication dance understood it suggests that he is the one who attacked tammy if hes not going after them online its all the more likely hed be inclined to get them in real life a troubled glance at the screen ariel bellakelley sexygurl legend archenemythey all posted attacks on him which means theyre all at riskif hes the one would it be hard for him to get their names and addresses some sure short of hacking into routers and servers the anonymous postings of course but a lot of them would be as easy to find as my getting his name all hed need would be a few high school yearbooks or class directories access to ourworld facebook or myspace oh and everybodys favoritegoogle dance noted a shadow had fallen over them and jonathan boling was looking past her michael oneil stepped into the office dance was relieved to see him they shared smiles the professor stood dance introduced them the two men shook hands boling said so i have you to thank for my first outing as a cop if thank is the right word oneil said with a wry smile they all sat at the coffee table and dance told the deputy what theyd foundand what they suspected that tammy might have been attacked because shed posted a comment on a blog about a high school student whod been responsible for a car crash was that the accident on one a couple of weeks ago about five miles south of carmel right boling said the boys name is travis brigham and hes a student at robert louis stevenson where the victims went so hes a person of interest at least and its possiblewhat we were afraid of oneil asked dance he wants to keep going very likely cyberbullying pushes people over the edge ive seen it happen dozens of times oneil put his feet on the coffee table and rocked back in the chair two years ago shed bet him ten dollars that someday hed fall over backward so far she had yet to collect he asked dance anything more on witnesses dance explained that tj hadnt reported back yet about the security camera near the highway where the first cross had been left nor had rey responded about witnesses near the club where tammy had been abducted oneil said that there hadnt been any breakthroughs with the physical evidence only one thingcrime scene found a gray fiber cotton on the cross he added that the lab in salinas couldnt match it to a specific database other than to report that it was probably from clothing not from carpet or furniture thats all nothing else no prints tread marks oneil shrugged the perps either very smart or very lucky dance walked to her desk and went into the state databases of warrants and records she squinted over the screen and read travis alan brigham age seventeen drivers license puts him at four oh eight henderson road she pushed her glasses up on her nose as she read interesting hes got a record then she shook her head no sorry my mistake its not him its samuel brigham at the same address hes fifteen juvie record arrested twice on peeping once on misdemeanor assault both dismissed subject to psych treatment looks like hes a brother but travis no hes clean she called traviss dmv picture up on the screen a darkhaired boy with eyes closely set together beneath thick brows stared at the camera he wasnt smiling id like to find out more about the accident oneil said dance placed a call to the local office of the highway patrol the official name for california s state police after a few minutes of being transferred around she ended up with a sergeant brodsky put the call on speaker and asked about the accident brodsky slipped immediately into the tone you hear when police take the stand at trial emotionally flat precise it was just before midnight on saturday june nine four juveniles three female one male were heading north on highway one about three miles south of carmel highlands near garrapata state beach reserve the male was driving the vehicle was a latemodel nissan altima it appears that the car was traveling at about fortyfive he missed a curve skidded and went over a cliff the girls in the back werent wearing their seat belts they died instantly the girl in the passenger seat had a concussion she was in the hospital for a few days the driver was admitted examined and released whatd travis say happened dance asked just lost control itd rained earlier there was water on the highway he changed lanes and went into a skid it was one of the girls cars and the tires werent the best he wasnt speeding and he tested negative for alcohol and controlled substances the girl who survived corroborated his story a defensive echo sounded in his voice there was a reason we didnt charge him you know whatever anybody said about the investigation so hed read the blog too dance deduced you going to reopen the investigation brodsky asked warily no this is about that attack monday night the girl in the trunk oh that the boy did it you think possibly wouldnt surprise me not one bit why do you say that sometimes you get a feeling travis was dangerous had eyes just like the kids at columbine how could he possibly know the visage of the killers in that horrific murder spree then brodsky added he was a fan of theirs you know the shooters had pictures up in his locker did he know that independently or from the blog dance recalled that someone had mentioned it in the roadside crosses thread did you think he was a threat oneil asked brodsky when you interviewed him yes sir kept my cuffs handy the whole time hes a big kid and wore this hooded sweatshirt just stared at me freaky at this reference to the garment dance recalled what tammy had given away about the attacker wearing a hoodie she thanked the officer and they hung up after a moment she looked over at boling jon any insights you can give us about travis from the postings boling reflected for a moment i do have a thought if hes a gamer like theyre saying that fact could be significant oneil asked you mean by playing those games hes programmed to be violent we saw something on discovery channel about that the other night but jon boling shook his head thats a popular theme in the media but if hes gone through relatively normal childhood developmental stages then i wouldnt worry too much about that yes some children can become numb to the consequences of violence if theyre continually exposed in certain waysgenerally visualtoo early but at the worst that just desensitizes you it doesnt make you dangerous the tendency to violence in young people almost always comes from rage not watching movies or tv no im speaking of something else when i say that gaming probably affects travis fundamentally its a change were seeing throughout society now among young people he could be losing the distinction between the synthetic world and the real world synthetic world its a term i got from edward castronovas book on the subject the synthetic world is the life of online games and alternative reality websites like second life theyre fantasy worlds you enter through your computeror pda or some other digital device people in our generation usually draw a clear distinction between the synthetic world and the real one the real world is where you have dinner with your family or play softball or go out on a date after you log out of the synthetic world and turn off the computer but younger peopleand nowadays i mean people in their twenties and even early thirtiesdont see that distinction more and more the synth worlds are becoming real to them in fact there was a study recently that showed nearly a fifth of the players in one online game felt that the real world was only a place to eat and sleep that the synthetic world was their true residence this surprised dance boling smiled at her apparently naive expression oh an average gamer can easily spend thirty hours a week in the synth world and its not unusual for people to spend twice that there are hundreds of millions of people who have some involvement in the synth world and tens of millions who spend much of their day there and were not talking pacman or pong the level of realism in the synthetic world is astonishing youthrough an avatar a character that represents youinhabit a world thats as complex as what were living in right now child psychologists have studied how people create avatars players actually use parenting skills subconsciously to form their characters economists have studied games too you have to learn skills to support yourself or youll starve to death in most of the games you earn money payable in game currency but that currency actually trades against the dollar or pound or euro on ebayin their gaming category you can buy and sell virtual itemslike magic wands weapons or clothing or houses or even avatars themselvesin realworld money in japan not too long ago some gamers sued hackers who stole virtual items from their synth world homes they won the case boling leaned forward and dance again noticed the sparkle in his eyes the enthusiasm in his voice one of the best examples of the synth and real worlds coinciding is in a famous online game world of warcraft the designers created a disease as a debufferthats a condition that reduces the health or power of characters it was called corrupted blood it would weaken powerful characters and kill the ones who werent so strong but something odd happened nobodys quite sure how but the disease got out of control and spread on its own it became a virtual black plague the designers never intended that to happen it could be stopped only when the infected characters died out or adapted to it the centers for disease control in atlanta heard about it and had a team study the spread of the virus they used it as a model for realworld epidemiology boling sat back i could go on and on about the synth world its a fascinating subject but my point is that whether or not travis is desensitized to violence the real question is which world does he inhabit most the synth or the real if its synth then he runs his life according to a whole different set of rules and we dont know what those are revenge against cyberbulliesor anyone who humiliates himcould be perfectly accepted it could be encouraged maybe even required the comparison is to a paranoid schizophrenic who kills someone because he genuinely believes that the victim is a threat to the world he isnt doing anything wrong in fact to him killing you is heroic travis who knows what hes thinking just remember its possible that attacking a cyberbully like tammy foster meant no more to him than swatting a fly dance considered this and said to oneil do we go talk to him or not deciding when to initially interview a suspect was always tricky travis would probably not yet think he was a suspect speaking to him now would catch him off guard and might make him blurt out statements that could be used against him he might even confess on the other hand he could destroy evidence or flee debating what finally decided it for her was a simple memory the look in tammy fosters eyesthe fear of reprisal and the fear that the perp would attack someone else she knew they had to move fast yep lets go see him chapter the brigham family lived in a scabby bungalow whose yard was strewn with car parts and old appliances half dismantled green garbage bags out of which flowed trash and rotting leaves sat amid broken toys and tools a scruffy cat stared cautiously out from a nest of vines beneath an overgrown hedgerow it was too lazy or full to care about a pudgy gray rat that skittered past oneil parked in the gravel drive forty feet or so away from the house and he and dance climbed out of his unmarked mcso car they studied the area it was like a scene from the rural south vegetation thick no other houses in sight dereliction the debilitated state of the house and the pungent aroma suggesting a nearby and inefficient sewer or a swamp explained how the family could afford such secluded property in this highpriced part of the state as they started toward the house she found her hand dangling near her pistol butt her jacket unbuttoned she was spooked alert still it was a shock when the boy attacked them they had just passed a patch of anemic reedy grass beside the lopsided detached garage when she turned to oneil and found the deputy stiffen as he looked past her his arm rose and gripped her jacket pulling her forward to the ground michael she cried the rock sailed over her head missing her by inches and crashed through a garage window another followed a moment later oneil had to duck fast to avoid getting hit he crashed into a narrow tree you all right he asked quickly a nod you see where it was from no they were scanning the thicket of woods bordering the property there she called pointing at the boy in sweats and a stocking cap who was staring at them he turned and fled dance debated only a moment neither of them had radios this hadnt been planned as a tactical mission and to return to oneils car to call in a pursuit to dispatch would have taken too long they had a chance to catch travis now and instinctively they went after him sprinting forward cbi agents learn basic handtohand combat skillsthough most dance included had never been in a fistfight they also are required to have physical fitness checkups every so often dance was in fair shape though not thanks to the cbis regimen but to her treks into the wilderness to track down music for her website despite the impractical outfitblack skirt suit and blouseshe now eased ahead of michael oneil as they pushed fast into the woods in pursuit of the boy who was moving just a little faster oneil had his cell phone out and was breathlessly calling in a request for backup they were both gasping hard and dance wondered how dispatch could understand him the boy vanished for a moment and the officers slowed then dance cried look spotting him emerge from bushes about fifty feet away weapon she gasped he held something dark in his hand cant tell could have been a gun though maybe a pipe or a knife either way he vanished into a dense part of the woods beyond which dance could just see a glimmer of a green pond probably the source of the stench oneil glanced at her she sighed and nodded simultaneously they drew their glocks they pushed forward again dance and oneil had worked a number of cases together and fell instinctively into a symbiotic mode on an investigation but they were at their best when solving intellectual puzzles not playing soldier she had to remind herself finger off the trigger never cross in front of your partners weapon and lift your muzzle if he crosses in front of you fire only if threatened check your backdrop shoot in bursts of three count your rounds dance hated this yet it was a chance to stop the roadside cross attacker picturing tammy fosters terrified eyes dance rushed through the woods the boy vanished again and she and oneil pulled up where two paths diverged travis had probably taken onethe vegetation was very thick here impassible in parts oneil silently pointed left then right raising an eyebrow flip a coin she thought angry and unsettled that shed have to separate from oneil she nodded toward the left they began easing carefully down their respective routes dance was moving through the thickets thinking how unsuited she was to this role her world was one of words and expressions and nuances of gesture not tactical work like this she knew how people got hurt how they died stepping out of the zones they were in harmony with a sense of foreboding filled her stop she told herself find michael go back to the car and wait for backup too late just then dance heard a rustling at her feet and glanced down to see that the boy hiding in the bushes next to her had flung a large branch in her way it caught her foot as she tried to jump over it and she went down hard struggling to keep from falling dance rolled onto her side which had the effect of saving her wrist and another consequence the boxy black glock flew from her hand and vanished into the bushes only seconds later dance heard the rustle of bushes once more as the boy apparently waiting to make certain she was alone charged out of the bushes careless michael oneil thought angrily he was running in the direction of dances cry but realized now he had no idea where she was they should have stayed together careless to split up yes it made senseto cover as much ground as they couldbut while hed been in several firefights and a couple of street pursuits kathryn dance had not if anything happened to her in the distance sirens sounded growing louder the backup was getting closer oneil slowed to a walk listening carefully maybe the rustle of bushes nearby maybe not careless too because travis would know this area perfectly it was literally his backyard hed know where to hide what paths to escape down the gun weighing nothing in his large hand swung ahead of oneil as he looked for the attacker frantic pushing ahead another twenty feet finally he had to risk some noise kathryn he called in a whisper nothing louder kathryn the wind rustled brush and trees then michael here a choked sound from nearby he raced toward her words then he found her ahead of him on a path on her hands and knees her head down he heard gasping was she wounded had travis struck her with a pipe stabbed her oneil had to suppress his overwhelming urge to tend to her see how badly hurt she was he knew procedures he ran closer stood over her his eyes scanning swiveling around looking for a target at last some distance away he saw traviss back vanish hes gone dance said pulling her weapon from a thicket of bushes and rising to her feet headed that way you hurt sore thats all she did seem to be unharmed but she was dusting at her suit in a way that was troubling to him she was uncharacteristically shaken disoriented he could hardly blame her but kathryn dance had always been a bulwark he could count on a standard he measured his own behavior against her gestures reminded him that they were out of their element here that this case wasnt a typical gangbanger hit or a weapons smuggling ring cruising up and down the what happened he asked tripped me then took off michael it wasnt travis what i got a fast look at him he was blond dance grimaced at a tear in her skirt then gave up on the clothing she started scanning the ground he dropped something okay there she picked it up a can of spray paint whats this all about he wondered aloud she tucked the gun away in her hip holster and turned back toward the house lets go find out they arrived back at the brigham house simultaneously with the backuptwo pacific grove town police cars a longtime resident dance knew the officers and waved hello they joined her and oneil you all right kathryn one cop asked noting her disheveled hair and dusty skirt fine she filled them in on the attack and pursuit one officer used his shouldermounted motorola to report the incident dance and oneil had no sooner gotten to the house when a womans voice called out from behind the screen did you get him the door opened and the speaker stepped out on the porch in her forties dance guessed she had a round figure and her face was moonish she wore painfully taut jeans and a billowy gray blouse with a triangle of stain on the belly kathryn dance noted that the womans cream pumps were hopelessly limp and scuffed from bearing her weight from inattention too dance and oneil identified themselves the woman was sonia brigham and she was traviss mother did you get him she persisted do you know who he was why he attacked us he wasnt attacking you sonia said he probably didnt even see you he was going for the windows theyve already got three of em one of the pacific grove officers explained the brighamsve been the target of vandalism lately you said he dance said do you know who he was not that particular one theres a bunch of them bunch oneil asked theyre coming by all the time throwing rocks bricks painting stuff on the house and garage thats what weve been living with a contemptuous wave of the hand presumably toward where the vandal had disappeared after everybody started saying those bad things about travis the other day somebody threw a brick through the living room window nearly hit my younger son and look she pointed to green spray paint graffiti on the side of a large lopsided shed in the side yard about fifty feet away killr leetspeak dance noted dance handed the spray paint to one of the pacific grove officers who said theyd follow up on it she described the boywho looked like one of five hundred high school students in the area they took a brief statement from both dance and oneil as well as traviss mother then climbed back into their cars and left theyre after my boy and he didnt do anything its like the goddamn ku klux klan that brick nearly hit sammy hes a little troubled he went crazy had an episode vengeful angels dance reflected though the bullying was no longer cyber it had moved from the synth world into the real a roundfaced teenager appeared on the porch his wary smile made him look slow but his eyes seemed fully comprehending as he took them in what is it what is it his voice was urgent its okay sammy go back inside you go to your room whore they you go on back to your room you stay inside dont go to the pond i want to go to the pond not now somebody was out there he ambled off into the house michael oneil said mrs brigham there was a crime last night an attempted murder the victim was someone whod posted a comment against travis on a blog oh that chilton crap sonia spat out between yellow teeth that had aged even faster than the womans face thats what started it all somebody should throw a brick through his window now everybodys ganging up on our boy and he didnt do anything why does everybody think he did they said he stole my mothers car and was driving it on lighthouse you know exposing himself well my mother sold her car four years ago thats how much they know then sonia had a thought and the seesaw returned to the side of wariness oh wait that girl in the trunk going to be drowned thats right well ill tell you right now my boy wouldnta done anything like that i swear to god youre not going to arrest him are you she looked panicked dance wondered too panicked did she in fact suspect her son wed just like to talk to him the woman was suddenly uneasy my husband isnt home you alone is fine both parents arent necessary but dance could see that the problem was that she didnt want the responsibility well trav isnt here either will he be back soon he works parttime at bagel express for pocket money his shifts in a little while hell have to come back here to pick up his uniform where is he now a shrug sometimes he goes to this video game place she fell silent probably thinking she shouldnt be saying anything my husband will be back soon dance noted again the tone with which sonia delivered those words my husband was travis out last night around midnight no offered fast are you sure dance asked with a crisp tone sonia had just exhibited aversionlooking awayand blocking touching her nose a gesture dance had not observed earlier sonia swallowed probably he was here im not exactly sure i went to bed early travis stays up till all hours he mightve gone out but i didnt hear anything and your husband shed noted the singular pronoun regarding her bedtime was he here around that time he plays poker some i think he was at a game oneil was saying we really need to his words braked to a halt as a tall lanky teenager shoulders and stance wide appeared from the side yard his black jeans were faded patches of gray showing and an olivedrab combat jacket covered a black sweatshirt it didnt have a hood dance noted he stopped suddenly blinking in surprise at the visitors a glance at the unmarked cbi car which any viewer of a cop show on tv in the last ten years would instantly recognize for what it was dance noted in the boys posture and expression the typical reaction of someone spotting law enforcers whether they were guilty or innocent cautionand thinking quickly travis honey come over here he remained where he was and dance sensed oneil tensing but a second foot pursuit wasnt needed expressionless the boy slouched forward to join them thesere police officers his mother said they want to talk to you i guess what about his voice was casual agreeable he stood with his long arms dangling at his side his hands were dirty and there was grit under his nails his hair seemed washed though she supposed he did this regularly to combat the sprinkling of acne on his face she and oneil said hello to the boy and offered their ids he studied them for a long moment buying time dance wondered somebody else was here sonia said to her son she nodded at the graffiti broke a couple more windows travis took this news from his mother without emotion he asked sammy he didnt see oneil asked you mind if we go inside he shrugged and they walked into the house which smelled of mold and cigarette smoke the place was ordered but grimy the mismatched furniture seemed secondhand slipcovers worn and pine legs sloughing off varnish dim pictures covered the walls mostly decorative dance could see part of a national geographic magazine logo just below the frame of a picture of venice a few were of the family the two boys and one or two of sonia when she was younger sammy appeared as before big moving quickly grinning again travis he charged toward his sibling did you bring me ms here you go travis dug into his pocket and handed the boy a packet of m ms yea sammy opened the package carefully looked inside then gazed at his brother the pond was nice today was it yeah sammy returned to his room clutching the candy in his hand travis said he doesnt look good did he take his pills his mother looked away they dad wouldnt get the prescription refilled because the price went up right he doesnt think they do that much good they do a lot of good mom you know how he gets when he doesnt take them dance glanced into sammys room and saw that the boys desk was covered with complicated electronic components parts of computers and toolsalong with toys for children much younger he was reading a japanese graphic novel as he slouched in a chair the boy glanced up and stared at dance intently studying her he gave a faint smile and nodded toward the book dance smiled back at the cryptic gesture he returned to reading his lips moved she noticed on a hall table a laundry basket filled with clothes she tapped oneils arm and glanced at a gray sweatshirt sitting on the top it was a hoodie oneil nodded how are you feeling dance asked travis after the accident okay i guess it mustve been terrible yeah but you werent hurt bad not really the airbag you know and i wasnt going that fast trish and van a grimace if theyd had their seat belts on they wouldve been fine sonia repeated his father should be home anytime now oneil continued evenly just have a few questions then he stepped back to the corner of the living room leaving the questioning to dance she asked what grade are you in just finished junior year robert louis stevenson right yeah whatre you studying i dont know stuff i like computer science and math spanish just you know what everybodys taking hows stevenson its okay better than monterey public or junipero he was answering agreeably looking directly into her eyes at junipero serra school uniforms were required dance supposed that more than stern jesuits and long homework assignments the dress code was the most hated aspect of the place howre the gangs hes not in a gang his mother said almost as if she wished he were they all ignored her not bad travis responded they leave us alone not like salinas the point of these questions wasnt social dance was asking them to determine the boys baseline behavior after a few minutes of these harmless inquiries dance had a good feel for the boys nondeceptive mode now she was ready to ask about the assault travis you know tammy foster dont you the girl in the trunk it was on the news she goes to stevenson she and me dont talk or anything maybe we had a class together freshman year he then looked dance straight in the eye his hand occasionally strayed across his face but she wasnt sure whether it was a blocking gesture signifying deception or because he was ashamed of the acne she posted some stuff about me in the chilton report it wasnt true what did she say dance asked though she recalled the post about his trying to take pictures of the girls locker room after cheerleading practice the boy hesitated as if wondering if she was trying to trap him she said i was taking pictures you know of the girls his face grew dark but i was just on the phone you know talking really his mother interjected bobll be home any minute now i might rather wait but dance felt a certain urgency to keep going she knew without doubt that if sonia wanted to wait for her husband the man would put a fast end to the interview travis asked is she going to be okay tammy looks like it he glanced at the scarred coffee table where an empty but smudged ashtray rested dance didnt think shed seen an ashtray in a living room for years you think i did it tried to hurt her how easily his dark eyes set deep beneath those brows held hers no were just talking to everybody who might have information about the situation situation he asked where were you last night between eleven and one another sweep of the hair i went to the game shed about tenthirty whats that this place where you can play video games like an arcade i kind of hang there some you know where it is its by kinkos it used to be that old movie theater but that got torn down and they put it in its not the best the connections arent so good but its the only one thats open late dance noted the rambling she asked you were alone there were like other kids there but i was playing alone i thought you were here sonia said a shrug i was here i went out i couldnt sleep at the game shed were you online dance asked like no i was playing pinball not rpg not what roleplaying games for shooter and pinball and driving games you dont go online he said this patiently though he seemed surprised she didnt know the distinction so you werent logged on thats what im saying how long were you there his mother had taken on the interrogation i dont know an hour two what do those games cost fifty cents a dollar every few minutes so that was sonias agenda money if you play good it lets you keep on going cost me three dollars for the whole night i used money i made and i got some food too and a couple of red bulls travis can you think of anybody who saw you there i dont know maybe ill have to think about it eyes studying the floor good and what time did you come home onethirty maybe two i dont know she asked more questions about monday night and then about school and his classmates she wasnt able to decide whether or not he was telling the truth since he wasnt deviating much from his baseline she thought again about what jon boling had told her about the synth world if travis was mentally there not in the real world baseline analysis might be useless maybe a whole different set of rules applied to people like travis brigham then the mothers eyes flickered toward the doorway the boys too dance and oneil turned to see a large man enter tall and broad he was wearing workmens overalls streaked in dirt central coast landscaping embroidered on his chest he looked at everybody in the room slowly dark eyes still and unfriendly beneath a fringe of thick brown hair bob these are police theyre not here with the report for the insurance are they no they you have a warrant theyre here to im talking to her a nod at dance im agent dance with the california bureau of investigation she offered an id he didnt look at and this is senior deputy oneil monterey county sheriffs office were asking your son a few questions about a crime there was no crime it was an accident those girls died in an accident thats all that happened were here about something else someone whod posted a message about travis was attacked oh that blog bullshit he growled that chilton is a danger to society hes like a fucking poisonous snake he turned to his wife joey down at the dock nearly got hisself popped in the mouth the stuff he was saying about me egging on the other boys just cause im his father they dont read the newspaper they dont read newsweek but they read that chilton crap somebody should his voice faded he turned toward his son i told you not to say anything to anybody without we have a lawyer did i tell you that you say the wrong fucking thing to the wrong person and we get sued and they take the house away and half my paycheck for the rest of my life he lowered his voice and your brother goes into a home mr brigham were not here about the accident oneil reminded him were investigating the assault last night doesnt matter does it things get written down and go into the record he seemed more concerned about responsibility for the accident than that his son might get arrested for attempted murder ignoring them completely he said to his wife whyd you let em in this aint nazi germany not yet you can tell em to shove it i thought no you didnt you didnt think at all to oneil now ill ask you to leave and if you come back it better be with a warrant dad sammy cried racing from his bedroom startling dance its working i wanta show you he was holding up a circuit board from which wires sprouted brighams gruffness vanished instantly he hugged the younger son and said kindly well look at it later after supper dance was watching traviss eyes which grew still at the display of affection toward his younger brother okay sammy hesitated then went out the back door and clomped down the porch and headed toward the shed stay close sonia called dance noted that she hadnt told her husband about the vandalism that had just occurred shed be afraid of delivering bad news she did however say of sammy maybe he should be on his pills eyes everywhere but at her husband theyre a ripoff what they cost werent you listening to me and whats the point if he stays home all day but he doesnt stay home all day thats because travis dont watch him like he should the boy listened passively apparently unmoved by the criticism oneil said to bob brigham a serious crime was committed we need to talk to everyone who might be involved and your son is involved can you confirm he was at the game shed last night i was out but thats none of your business and listen up my boy didnt have nothing to do with any attacks you stayings trespassing isnt it he lifted a bushy eyebrow as he lit a cigarette waved the match out and dropped it accurately into the ashtray and you he snapped to travis youre going to be late for work the boy went into his bedroom dance was frustrated he was their prime suspect but she simply couldnt tell what was going on in traviss mind the boy returned carrying a brownandbeigestriped uniform jacket on a hanger he rolled it up and stuffed it into his backpack no brigham barked your mother ironed it put it on dont crumple it up like that i dont want to wear it now show some respect to your mother after all her work its a bagel shop who cares thats not the point put it on do what im telling you the boy stiffened dance gave an audible gasp seeing traviss face eyes widening shoulders rising his lips drew back like those of a snarling animal travis raged to his father its a stupid fucking uniform i wear it on the street and they laugh at me the father leaned forward you do not ever talk to me that way and never in front of other people i get laughed at enough im not going to wear it you dont have any fucking idea dance saw the boys frantic eyes flicker around the room and settle on the ashtray a possible weapon oneil noticed this too and tensed in case a fight was about to break out travis had become somebody else entirely possessed with anger the tendency to violence in young people almost always comes from rage not watching movies or tv i didnt do anything wrong travis growled wheeled around and pushed through the screen door letting it snap back loudly he hurried into the side yard grabbed his bike which was leaning against a broken fence and walked it down a path through the woods bordering the backyard you two thanks for fucking up our day now get out with neutraltoned goodbyes dance and oneil headed for the door sonia offering a timid glance of apology traviss father strode into the kitchen dance heard the refrigerator door open a bottle fizzed open outside she asked howd you do not bad i think oneil offered and held up a tiny tuft of gray hed tugged it off the sweatshirt in the laundry basket when hed stepped away to let dance take over the questioning they sat in the front seat of oneils cruiser the doors slammed simultaneously ill drop the fiber off with peter bennington it wouldnt be admissiblethey had no warrantbut it would at least tell them that travis was the likely suspect if it matches put him under surveillance she asked a nod ill stop by the bagel shop if his bikes outside i can get a soil sample from the treads i think a magistrated go with a warrant if the dirt matches the beach scene he looked dances way gut feeling you think he did it dance debated all i can say is that i only got clear deception signals twice when first when he said he was at the game shed last night and the second time when he said he didnt do anything wrong chapter dance returned to her office at the cbi she smiled at jon boling he reciprocated but then his face grew grim he nodded at his computer more postings about travis on the chilton report attacking him and then other posts attacking the attackers its an allout flame war and i know you wanted to keep the connection between the roadside cross case and the attack secret but somebody caught on how on earth dance asked angrily boling shrugged he nodded to a recent posting reply to chilton posted by brittanym is anybody watching the news somebody left a cross and then went out and attacked that girl whats that all about omg ill bet its the driver subsequent postings suggested tammy was attacked by travis because shed posted a critical comment in the chilton report and he had become the roadside cross killer even though tammy had survived great we try to keep it secret and we get outed by a teenage girl named brittany did you see him boling asked yes you think hes the one i wish i could say im leaning toward it she explained her theory that it was hard to read travis because he was living more in the synth world than the real and he was masking his kinesic responses i will say theres a huge amount of anger there how bout we take a walk jon theres somebody i want you to meet a few minutes later they arrived at charles overbys office on the phone as he often was her boss gestured dance and boling in with a glance of curiosity at the professor the agentincharge hung up they made the connection the press did hes now the roadside cross killer brittanym dance said charles this is professor jonathan boling hes been helping us a hearty handshake have you now what area computers thats your profession consultant overby let this hang like a balsawood glider over the trio for a moment dance spotted her cue and was about to say that boling was volunteering his time when the professor said i teach mostly but yes i do some consulting agent overby its really how i make most of my money you know academia pays next to nothing but as a consultant i can charge up to three hundred an hour ah overby looked stricken per hour really boling held a straight face for exactly the right length of time before adding but i get a real kick out of volunteering for free to help organizations like yours so im tearing up my bill in your case dance nearly had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing boling she decided could have been a good psychologist hed deduced overbys prissy frugality in ten seconds flat defused itand slipped in a joke for her benefit dance notedsince she was the only member of the audience its getting hysterical kathryn weve had a dozen reports of killers wandering around in backyards a couple of peopleve already taken some shots at intruders thinking its him oh and thereve been a couple more reports of crosses dance was alarmed more overby held up a hand they were all real memorials apparently accidents that had happened in the past few weeks none with prospective dates on them but the press is all over it even sacramento s heard he nodded at the phone presumably indicating a call from their bossthe director of the cbi possibly even his boss the attorney general so where are we dance brought him up to date on travis the incidents at his parents house her take on the boy definitely a person of interest but you didnt bring him in overby asked no probable cause michaels checking out some physical evidence right now to link him to the scene and no other suspects no how the hell is a kid doing this a kid riding around on a bicycle dance pointed out that local gangs centered primarily in and around salinas had terrorized people for years and many of them had members much younger than travis boling added and one thing weve found out about him hes very active in computer games young people who are good at them learn very sophisticated combat and evasion techniques one of the things military recruiters always ask is how much the applicants game everything else being equal theyd take a gamer over another kid any day overby asked motive dance then explained to her boss that if travis was the killer his motive was probably revenge based on cyberbullying cyberbullying overby said gravely i was just reading up on that you were dance asked yep there was a good article in usa today last weekend its become a popular topic boling said did dance detect slight dismay about the sources that informed the head of a regional office of the cbi thats enough to turn him to violence overby asked boling continued nodding hes being pushed over the edge the postings and the rumors have spread and its become physical bullying too somebodys put up a youtube video about him they got him in a happy slap vid a what its a cyberbullying technique somebody came up to travis at burger king and pushed him he stumbledit was embarrassingand one of the other kids was waiting to record it on a cell phone then they uploaded it its been viewed two hundred thousand times so far it was then that a slightly built unsmiling man stepped out of the conference room across the hall and into the doorway of overbys office he noted the visitors and ignored them charles he said in a baritone ohkathryn this is robert harper overby said from the ags office in san francisco special agent dance the man walked into the room and shook her hand firmly but kept a distance as if shed think he was coming on to her and jon overby tried to recall boling harper gave the professor a distracted glance said nothing to him the man from san francisco had an unrevealing face and perfectly trimmed black hair he wore a conservative navy blue suit and white shirt a redandblue striped tie on his lapel was an american flag pin his cuffs were perfectly starched though she noticed a few stray gray threads at the ends a professional states attorney long after his colleagues had gone into private practice and were making buckets of money she put him in his early fifties what brings you to monterey she asked caseload evaluations offering nothing more robert harper seemed to be one of those people who if he had nothing to say was comfortable with silence dance believed too she recognized in his face an intensity a sense of devotion to his mission akin to what shed seen in the reverend fisks face at the hospital protest though how much of a mission caseload analysis would entail was a mystery to her he turned his attention to her briefly she was used to being looked over but usually by suspects harpers perusal was unsettling it was as if she held the key to an important mystery for him then he said to overby im going to be outside for a few minutes charles if you could keep the door to the conference room locked id appreciate it sure anything else you need just let me know a chilly nod then harper was gone fishing a phone from his pocket whats the story with him dance asked special prosecutor from sacramento had a call from upstairs the attorney general to cooperate he wants to know about our caseload maybe something bigs going down and he needs to see how busy we are he spent some time at the sheriffs office too wish hed go back and bug them fellows a cold fish dont know what to say to him tried some jokes they fell flat but dance was thinking about the tammy foster case robert harper was gone from her mind she and boling returned to her office and shed just sat down at her desk when oneil called she was pleased she guessed hed have the results of the analysis of the bike tread dirt and the gray fiber from the sweatshirt kathryn we have a problem his voice was troubled go on well first peter says the gray fiber they found in the cross it matches what we found at traviss so he is the one whatd the magistrate say about the warrant didnt get that far traviss on the run what he didnt show up for work or he did show upthere were fresh bike tread marks behind the place he snuck into the back room stole some bagels and some cash from the purse of one of the workersand a butchers knife then he disappeared i called his parents but they havent heard from him and claim they dont have any idea where he might go where are you in my office im going to put out a detain alert on him us salinas san benito surrounding counties dance rocked back furious with herself why hadnt she planned better and had somebody follow the boy when he left his house shed managed to establish his guiltand simultaneously let him slip through her fingers and hell now shed have to tell overby what had happened but you didnt bring him in theres something else when i was at the bagel place i looked up the alley theres that deli near safeway sure i know it they have a flower stand on the side of the building roses she said exactly i talked to the owner oneils voice went flat yesterday somebody snuck up to the place and stole all the bouquets of red roses she understood now why he was sounding so grave allhow many did he take a slight pause a dozen it looks like hes just getting started chapter dances phone rang a glance at caller id tj was just about to call you didnt have any luck with security cameras but theres a sale on blue mountain jamaican coffee at java house three pounds for the price of two still sets you back close to fifty bucks but that coffee is the best she made no response to his banter he noticed it whats up boss change of plans tj she told him about travis brigham the forensics match and the dozen stolen bouquets hes on the run boss hes planning more yep i want you to get to bagel express talk to his friends anybody who knows him find out where he might go people he might be staying with favorite places sure ill get right on it dance then called rey carraneo who was having no luck in his search for witnesses near the parking lot where tammy foster had been abducted she briefed him as well and told him to head over to the game shed to find any leads to where the boy mightve gone after hanging up dance sat back a frustrating sense of helplessness came over her she needed witnesses people to interview this was a skill she was born to one she enjoyed and was good at but now the case slogged along in the world of evidence and speculation she glanced at the printouts of the chilton report i think we better start contacting the potential victims and warning them are people attacking him in the social sites too myspace facebook ourworld she asked boling its not as big a story in those theyre international sites the chilton report is local so thats where ninety percent of the attacks on travis are ill tell you one thing that would help getting the internet addresses of the posters if we could get those we can contact their service providers and find their physical addresses it would save a lot of time how have to be from chilton himself or his webmaster jon can you tell me anything about him thatll help me persuade him to cooperate if he balks i know about his blog boling responded but not much about him personally other than the bio in the report itself but id be happy to do some detective work his eyes had taken on the sparkle shed seen earlier he turned back to his computer puzzles while the professor was lost in his homework assignment dance took a call from oneil a crime scene team had searched the alley behind bagel express and found traces of sand and dirt where the tread marks showed travis had left his bike they matched the sandy soil where tammys car had been left on the beach he added that an mcso team had canvassed the area but nobody had seen him oneil told her too that hed gotten a half dozen other officers from highway patrol to join in the manhunt they were coming in from watsonville they disconnected and dance slumped back in her chair after a few minutes boling said that hed gotten some background on chilton from the blog itself and from other research he called up the homepage again which had the bio chilton himself had written httpwwwthechiltonreportcom scrolling down dance began to skim the blog while boling offered james david chilton fortythree years old married to patrizia brisbane two boys ten and twelve lives in carmel but he also has property in hollister vacation house it looks like and some income property around san jose they inherited it when the wifes father died a few years ago now the most interesting thing i found out about chilton is that hes always had a quirky habit hed write letters letters letters to the editor letters to his congressmen op ed pieces he started with snail mailbefore the internet really took offthen emails hes written thousands of them rants criticism praise compliments political commentary you name it he was quoted as saying one of his favorite books was herzog the saul bellow novel about a man obsessed with writing letters basically chiltons message was about upholding moral values exposing corruption extolling politicians who do good trashing the ones who dontexactly what his blog does now i found a lot of them online then it seems he found out about the blogosphere he started the chilton report about five years ago now before i go on it might be helpful to know a little history of blogs sure the term comes from weblog which was coined by a computer guru in nineteen ninetyseven jorn barger he wrote an online diary about his travels and what hed been looking at on the web now peopled been recording their thoughts online for years but what made blogs distinctive was the concept of links thats the key to a blog youre reading something and you come to that underlined or boldface reference in the text and click on it and that takes you someplace else linking is called hypertext the http in a website address it stands for hypertext transfer protocol thats the software that lets you create links in my opinion it was one of the most significant aspects of the internet maybe the most significant well once hypertext became common blogs started to take off people who could write code in htmlhypertext markup language the computer language of linkscould create their own blogs pretty easily but more and more people wanted in and not everybody was tech savvy so companies came up with programs that anybody well almost anybody could use to create linked blogs withpitas blogger and groksoup were the early ones dozens of others followed and now all you have to do is have an account with google or yahoo and poof you can make a blog combine that with the bargain price of data storage nowadaysand getting cheaper every minuteand youve got the blogosphere bolings narrative was animated and ordered hed be a great professor she reflected now before nineeleven boling explained blogs were mostly computeroriented they were written by tech people for tech people after september eleventh though a new type of blog appeared they were called war blogs after the attacks and the afghanistan and iraq wars those bloggers werent interested in technology they were interested in politics economics society the world i describe the distinction this way while prenineeleven blogs were innerdirectedtoward the internet itselfthe war blogs are outerdirected those bloggers look at themselves as journalists part of whats known as the new media they want press credentials just like cnn and washington post reporters and they want to be taken seriously jim chilton is the quintessential war blogger he doesnt care about the internet per se or the tech world except to the extent it lets him get his message out he writes about the real world now the two sidesthe original bloggers and the war bloggersconstantly battle for the numberone spot in the blogosphere its a contest she asked amused to them it is they cant coexist sure but its an egodriven world and theyll do anything they can to be top of the heap and that means two things one having as many subscribers as possible and two more importanthaving as many other blogs as possible include links to yours incestuous very now you asked what could i tell you to get chiltons cooperation well you have to remember that the chilton report is the real thing its important and influential you notice that one of the early posts in the roadside crosses thread was from an executive at caltrans he wanted to defend their inspection of the highway that tells me that government officials and ceos read the blog regularly and get pretty damn upset if chilton says anything bad about them the report leans toward local issues but local in this case is california which isnt really local at all everybody in the world keeps an eye on us they either love or hate the state but they all read about it also chilton himselfs emerged as a serious journalist he works his sources he writes well hes reasonable and he picks real issueshes not sensationalist i searched for britney spears and paris hilton in his blog going back four years and neither name came up dance had to be impressed with that hes not a parttimer either three years ago he began to work on the report fulltime and he campaigns it hard what does that mean campaign boling scrolled down to the on the home front thread on the homepage httpwwwthechiltonreportcom were going global am pleased to report that the report has been getting raves from around the world its been selected as one of the lead blogs in a new rss feed well call it really simple syndication that will link thousands of other blogs websites and bulletin boards throughout the world kudos to you my readers for making the report as popular as it is rss is another next big thing it actually stands for rdf site syndicationrdf is resource description framework if youre interested and theres no reason for you to be rss is a way of customizing and consolidating updated material from blogs and websites and podcasts look at your browser at the top is a little orange square with a dot in the corner and two curved lines ive seen it thats your rss feeds chilton is trying hard to get picked up by other bloggers and websites thats important to him and its important to you too because it tells us something about him hes got an ego i can stroke yep thats one thing to remember im also thinking of something else you can try with him something more nefarious i like nefarious youll want to somehow hint that his helping you will be good publicity for the blog itll get the name of the report around in the mainstream media also you could hint that you or somebody at cbi could be a source for information in the future boling nodded at the screen where the blog glowed i mean first and foremost hes an investigative reporter he appreciates sources okay good idea ill try it a smile of course the other thing he might do is consider your request an invasion of journalistic ethics in which case hell slam the door in your face dance looked at the screen these blogstheyre a whole different world oh that they are and were just beginning to comprehend the power they havehow theyre changing the way we get information and form opinions there are probably sixty million of them now that many yep and they do great thingsthey prefilter information so you dont have to google your way through millions of sites theyre a community of likeminded people they can be funny creative and like the chilton report they police society and keep us honest but theres a dark side too propagating rumors dance said thats one thing yes and another problem is what i said earlier about tammy they encourage people to be careless people feel protected online and in the synth world life seems anonymous posting under a nym or nica screen nameso you give away all sorts of information about yourself but remember every single fact about youor liethat you post or somebody posts about you is there forever it will never ever go away boling continued but i feel the biggest problem is that people tend not to question the accuracy of the reporting blogs give an impression of authenticitythe informations more democratic and honest because it comes from the people not from big media but my pointand its earned me plenty of black eyes in academia and in the blogosphereis that thats bullshit the new york times is a forprofit corporation but is a thousand times more objective than most blogs theres very little accountability online holocaust denials nineeleven conspiracies racism they all thrive thanks to blogs they take on an authenticity some weirdo at a cocktail party doesnt have when he spouts off that israel and the cia were behind the trade towers attack dance returned to her desk and lifted her phone i think ill put all your research to use jon lets see what happens james chiltons house was in an upscale area of carmel the yard close to an acre and filled with trimmed but hodgepodge gardens which suggested that husband wife or both spent plenty of weekend hours extracting weeds and inserting plants rather than paying pros to do it dance gazed at the outside décor enviously gardening though much appreciated wasnt one of her skills maggie said that if plants didnt have roots theyd run when her mother stepped into the garden the house was an expansive ranch about forty years old and squatted at the back of the property dance estimated six bedrooms their cars were a lexus sedan and a nissan quest sitting in a large garage filled with plenty of sports equipment which unlike similar articles in dances garage actually appeared well used she had to laugh at the bumper stickers on chiltons vehicles they echoed headlines from his blog one against the desalination plant and one against the sex education proposal left and right democrat and republican hes more cutandpaste there was another car here too in the drive a visitor probably since the taurus bore the subtle decal of a rental car company dance parked and walked to the front door rang the bell footsteps grew louder and she was greeted by a brunette woman in her early forties slender wearing designer jeans and a white blouse the collar turned up a thick daniel yurman knotted necklace in silver was at her throat the shoes dance couldnt help but identify came from italy and were knockouts the agent identified herself proffering her id i called earlier to see mr chilton the womans face eased into the hint of a frown that typically forms when one meets law enforcers her name was patriziashe pronounced it patreetsia jims just finishing up a meeting ill go tell him youre here thank you come on in she led dance to a homey den the walls covered with pictures of family then disappeared into the house for a moment patrizia returned hell be just a moment thank you these are your boys dance was pointing at a picture of patrizia a lanky balding man she took to be chilton and two darkhaired boys who reminded her of wes they were all smiling at the camera the woman proudly said jim and chet chiltons wife continued through the photos from the pictures of the woman in her youthat carmel beach point lobos the mission dance guessed she was a native patrizia explained that yes she was in fact shed grown up in this very house my father had been living here alone for years when he passed about three years ago jim and i moved in dance liked the idea of a family home passed down from generation to generation she reflected that michael oneils parents still lived in the oceanview house where he and his siblings had grown up with his father suffering from senility his mother was thinking of selling the place and moving into a retirement community but oneil was determined to keep the property in the family as patrizia was pointing out photos that displayed the familys exhausting athletic accomplishmentsgolf soccer tennis triathlonsdance heard voices in the front hall she turned to see two men chiltonshe recognized him from the pictureswore a baseball cap green polo shirt and chinos blondish hair eased in tufts from under the hat he was tall and apparently in good shape with only a bit of belly swelling above his belt he was speaking to another man sandyhaired wearing jeans a white shirt and a brown sports coat dance started toward them but chilton quickly ushered the man out of the door her kinesic reading was that he didnt want the visitor whoever he was to know that a law enforcement agent had come to see him patrizia repeated hell just be a minute but dance sidestepped her and continued into the hall sensing the wife stiffen protective of her husband still an interviewer has to take immediate charge of the situation subjects cant set the rules but by the time dance got to the front door chilton was back and the rental car heading off gravel crunching under tires his green eyessimilar to her shadeturned their attention her way they shook hands and she read in the bloggers face tanned and freckled curiosity and a certain defiance more than wariness another flash of the id could we talk somewhere for a few minutes mr chilton my office sure he led her up the hall the room they entered was modest and a mess filled with towers of magazines and clippings and computer printouts underscoring what shed learned from jon boling the officer revealed that indeed the reporters game was changing small rooms in houses and apartments just like this were replacing citydesk rooms of newspapers dance was amused to see a cup of tea beside his computerthe scent of chamomile filled the room no cigarettes coffee or whisky for todays hardedged journalists apparently they sat and he lifted his eyebrow so hes been complaining has he but im curious why the police why not a civil suit hows that dance was confused chilton rocked back in his chair removed his cap rubbed his balding head and slipped the hat back on he was irritated oh he bitches about libel but its not defamation if its true besides even if what i wrote was false which it isnt libels not a crime in this country would be in stalinist russia but its not here yet so whyre you involved his eyes were keen and probing his mannerisms intense dance could imagine how it might soon get tiring to spend much time in his presence im not sure what you mean arent you here because of arnie brubaker no whos that hes the man who wants to destroy our shoreline by putting in that desalination plant she recalled the blog postings in the chilton report critical of the plant and the bumper sticker no this has nothing to do with that chiltons forehead crinkled hed love to stop me i thought maybe hed trumped up some criminal complaint but sorry i was making assumptions the defensiveness in his face relaxed its just well brubakers really apain dance wondered what the intended descriptive of the developer was going to have been excuse me patrizia appeared in the doorway and brought her husband a fresh cup of tea she asked dance if shed like anything she was smiling now but still eyed the agent suspiciously thanks no chilton nodded at the tea and charmingly winked his thanks to his wife she left and closed the door behind her so what can i do for you your blog about the roadside crosses oh the car accident he regarded dance closely some of the defensiveness was back she could read the stress in his posture ive been following the news that girl was attacked the press is saying because she posted something on the blog the posters are starting to say the same thing you want the boys name no we have it is he the one who tried to drown her it seems so chilton said quickly i didnt attack him my point was did the police drop the ball on the investigation and did caltrans adequately maintain the road i said up front that he wasnt to blame and i censored his name it didnt take long for a mob to form and find out who he is chiltons mouth twisted hed taken the comment as criticism of him or the blog which it wasnt but he conceded that does happen well what can i do for you we have reason to believe that travis brigham may be considering attacking other people who posted comments against him are you sure no but we have to consider its a possibility chilton grimaced i mean cant you arrest him were looking for him now we arent sure where he is i see chilton said this slowly and dance could see from his lifted shoulders and the tension in his neck he was wondering what exactly she wanted the agent considered jon bolings advice and said now your blog is known all over the world its very respected thats one of the reasons so many people are posting on it the flash of pleasure in his eyes was faint but obvious to dance it told her that even obvious flattery went down very well with james chilton but the problem is that all the posters attacking travis are potential targets and the numbers increasing every hour the report has one of the highest hit ratings in the country its the mostread blog in california im not surprised i really enjoy it keeping an eye on her own mannerisms so as not to telegraph the deception thank you a full smile joined the eye crinkle but see what were facing every time somebody posts to the roadside crosses thread they become a possible target some of those people are completely anonymous some are out of the area but some are nearby and were afraid travis will find out their identities and then hell go after them too oh chilton said his smile vanishing his quick mind made the leap and youre here for their internet addresses for their protection i cant give those out but these people are at risk this country operates on the principle of separation of media and state as if this flippant recitation skewered her argument that girl was thrown into a trunk and left to drown travis could be planning another attack right now chilton held up a finger shushing her like a schoolteacher its a slippery slope agent dance who do you work for your ultimate boss the attorney general okay well say i give you the addresses of posters on the roadside crosses thread then next month you come back and ask for the address of a whistleblower who was fired by the attorney general for oh lets pick harassment or maybe you want the address of somebody who posted a comment critical of the governor or the president orhow bout thissomeone who says something favorable about alqaeda you say to me you gave me the information last time why not again there wont be an again you say that but as if government employees lied with every breath does this boy know youre after him yes then hes run off somewhere wouldnt you think hes not going to show himself by attacking somebody else not if the police are looking for him his voice was stern hers was reasonable as she continued slowly still you know mr chilton sometimes life is about compromises she let this comment linger he cocked an eyebrow waiting if you gave us the addressesjust of the locals who wrote the most vicious posts about traviswed really appreciate it maybewell maybe we could do something to help you if you ever needed a hand like what thinking again about bolings suggestions she said wed be happy to issue a statement about your cooperation good publicity chilton considered this but then frowned no if i were to help you itd probably be best not to mention it she was pleased he was negotiating okay i can understand that but maybe theres something else we could do really what thinking about another suggestion the professor had made she said maybe well if you need any contacts in the california law enforcement agencies sources highup ones he leaned forward eyes flaring so you are trying to bribe me i thought so just had to draw you out a little got you agent dance she sat back as if shed been slapped chilton continued appealing to my public spirit is one thing this he waved his hand at her is distasteful and corrupt if you ask me its the kind of maneuvering i expose in my blog every day of course the other thing he might do is consider your request an invasion of journalistic ethics in which case hell slam the door in your face tammy foster was almost killed there could be others im very sorry for that but the report is too important to jeopardize and if people think they cant post anonymously itll change the integrity of the entire blog id like you to reconsider the bloggers strident facade faded that man i was meeting with when you got here she nodded gregory ashton he said this with some intensity the way people will when speaking about someone significant to them but who have no meaning to you chilton noted the blank expression he continued hes starting a new network of blogs and websites one of the biggest in the world ill be at the flagship level hes spending millions to promote it this was the issue that boling had explained to her ashton must have been the one behind the rss feed chilton was referring to in the were going global posting that expands the scope of the report exponentially i can take on problems around the world aids in africa human rights violations in indonesia atrocities in kashmir environmental disasters in brazil but if word were to get out that i gave away the internet address of my posters that could put the sanctity of the report at risk dance was frustrated though part of her as a former journalist grudgingly understood chilton wasnt resisting out of greed or ego but from a genuine passion for his readers though that hardly helped her out people could die she persisted this question has come up before agent dance the responsibility of bloggers he stiffened slightly a few years ago i did an exclusive post about a wellknown writer who i found out had plagiarized some passages from another novelist he claimed it was an accident and begged me not to run the story but i ran it anyway he started drinking again and his life fell apart was that my goal god no but either the rules exist or they dont why should he get away with cheating when you and i dont i did a blog about a deacon from san francisco who was head of an antigay movementand it turned out a closet homosexual i had to expose the hypocrisy he looked right into dances eyes and the man killed himself because of what i wrote killed himself i live with that every day but did i do the right thing yes if travis attacks somebody else then ill feel terrible about that too but were dealing with bigger issues here agent dance i was a reporter too she said you were crime reporter im against censorship completely were not talking about the same thing im not telling you to change your postings i just want to know the names of people whove posted so we can protect them cant do it the flint was back in his voice he looked at his watch she knew the interview was over he rose still one last shot no one will ever know well say we found out through other means escorting her to the door chilton gave a genuine laugh secrets in the blogosphere agent dance do you know how fast word spreads in todays worldat the speed of light chapter as she drove along the highway kathryn dance called jon boling how did it go he asked brightly what was that phrase that was in the blog about travis one of the kids posted it epic something oh less cheer now epic fail yeah that describes it pretty well i tried for the goodpublicity approach but he went for door number two the fascists trammeling free press with a touch of the world needs me ouch sorry about that bad call it was worth a shot but i think youd better start trying to get as many names as you can on your own i already have just in case chilton gave you the boot i should have some names soon oh did he say hed get even in a blog posting about you for suggesting it she chuckled came close the headline wouldve been cbi agent in attempted bribe i doubt he willyoure small potatoes nothing personal but with hundreds of thousands of people reading what he writes he sure does have the power to make you worry then bolings voice grew somber i should tell you the postings are getting worse some of the posters are saying theyve seen travis doing devil worship sacrificing animals and there are stories about him groping other students girls and boys all sounds bogus to me though its like theyre trying to oneup each other the stories are getting more outlandish rumors the one thing thats a recurring reference which makes me think theres some truth in it is the online roleplaying games theyre talking about the kid being obsessed with fighting and death especially with swords and knives and slashing his victims hes slipped into the synthetic world seems that way after they disconnected dance turned up the volume on her ipod touchshe was listening to badi assad the beautiful brazilian guitarist and singer it was illegal to listen through the ear buds while driving but running the music through the speakers in a cop car didnt produce the most faithful sound quality and she needed a serious dose of soulcomforting music dance felt the urgency to pursue the case but she was a mother too and shed always balanced her two worlds shed now pick up her children from her mothers care at the hospital spend a little time with them and drop them off at her parents house where stuart dance would resume babysitting after he returned from his meeting at the aquarium and she would head back to the cbi to continue the hunt for travis brigham she continued the drive in the big unmarked cvpiher police interceptor ford it handled like a combination race car and tank not that dance had ever pushed the vehicle to its limits she wasnt a natural driver and though shed taken the required highspeedpursuit course in sacramento couldnt picture herself actually chasing another driver along the winding roads of central california with this thought an image from the blog came to mindthe photo of the roadside crosses at the site of the terrible accident on highway on june the tragedy that had set all of this subsequent horror in motion she now pulled up in the hospital lot and noticed several california highway patrol cars and two unmarkeds parked in front of the hospital she couldnt remember a report about any police action involving injuries climbing from the car she observed a change in the protesters for one thing there were more of them three dozen or so and theyd been joined by two more news crews also she noticed they were boisterous waving their placards and crosses like sports fans smiling chanting dance noticed that the reverend fisk was being approached by several men shaking his hands in sequence his redhaired minder was carefully scanning the parking lot and then dance froze gasping walking out the front door of the hospital were wes and maggiefaces grimaccompanied by an africanamerican woman in a navy blue suit she was directing them to one of the unmarked sedans robert harper the special prosecutor shed met outside charles overbys office emerged and behind him walked dances mother edie dance was flanked by two large uniformed chp troopers and she was in handcuffs dance jogged forward mom twelveyearold wes shouted and ran across the parking lot pulling his sister after him wait you cant do that shouted the woman whod been accompanying them she started forward fast dance knelt embracing her son and daughter the womans stern voice resounded across the parking lot were taking the children youre not taking anybody dance growled then turned again to her children are you all right they arrested grandma maggie said tears welling her chestnut braid hung limply over her shoulder where it had jumped in the run ill talk to them in a minute dance rose youre not hurt are you no lean wes nearly as tall as his mother said in a shaky voice they just that woman and the police they just came and got us and said theyre taking us someplace i dont know where i dont want to leave you mommy maggie clung to her tightly dance reassured her daughter nobodys taking you anywhere okay go get in the car the woman in the blue suit approached and said in a low tone maam im afraid and found herself talking to dances cbi identification card and shield thrust close to her face the children are going with me dance said the woman read the id unimpressed its procedure you understand its for their own good well get it all sorted out and if everything checks out the children are going with me im a social worker with monterey county child services her own id appeared dance was thinking that there were probably negotiations that should be going on at the moment but still she pulled her handcuffs out of her back holster in a smooth motion and swung them open like a large crab claw listen to me im their mother you know my identity you know theirs now back off or im arresting you under california penal code section twoohseven observing this the tv reporters seemed to stiffen as one like a lizard sensing the approach of an oblivious beetle cameras swung their way the woman turned toward robert harper who seemed to debate he glanced at the reporters and apparently decided that in this situation bad publicity was worse than no publicity he nodded dance smiled to her children hitching the cuffs away and walked them to her car its going to be okay dont worry this is just a big mixup she closed the door locking it with the remote she stormed past the social worker who was glaring back with sleek defiant eyes and approached her mother who was being eased into the back of a squad car honey edie dance exclaimed mom whats you cant talk to the prisoner harper said she whirled and faced harper who was exactly her height dont play games with me whats this all about he regarded her calmly shes being taken to the county lockup for processing and a bail hearing shes been arrested and informed of her rights i have no obligation to say anything to you the cameras continued to pick up every second of the drama edie dance called they said i killed juan millar please be quiet mrs dance the agent raged at harper that caseload evaluation it was just bullshit right harper easily ignored her dances cell phone rang and she stepped aside to answer it dad katie i just

agent dance i dont want to remind you again no talking to the prisoner she ignored harper and dont say a word to anyone she warned her mother i hope were not going to have a security problem here the prosecutor said stiffly dance glared back silently defying him to make good on his threat whatever it might be then she glanced at the chp troopers nearby one of whom shed worked with his eyes avoided hers everybody was in harpers pocket on this one she turned and strode back toward her car but diverted to the woman social worker dance stood close those children have cell phones im number two on speed dial right after nineoneone and i guarantee they told you im a law enforcement officer why the fuck didnt you call me the woman blinked and reared back you cant talk to me that way why the fuck

you had this job thats none of your business well ill tell you miss therere two answers either not long enough or way too long you cant but dance was gone by then and climbing back into her car grinding the starter shed never shut the engine off when shed arrived mom maggie asked weeping with heartbreaking whimpers whats going to happen to grandma dance wasnt going to put on a false facade for the children shed learned as a parent that in the end it was better to confront pain and fear rather than to deny or defer them but she had to struggle to keep panic from her voice your grandmothers going to see a judge and i hope shell be home soon then were going to find out whats happened we just dont know yet shed take the children to the home of her best friend martine christensen with whom she operated her music website i dont like that man wes said who mr harper i dont like him either dance said i want to go to the courthouse with you maggie said no mags i dont know how long im going to be there dance glanced back and gave a reassuring smile to the children seeing their wan forlorn faces she grew all the angrier at robert harper dance plugged in her phones handsfree mike thought for a moment and called the best defense lawyer she could think of george sheedy had once spent four hours trying to discredit dance on the witness stand hed come close to winning a verdict of not guilty for a salinas gang leader who clearly was but the good guys had won and the punk got life after the trial sheedy had come up to dance and shaken her hand complimenting her on the solid job shed done testifying shed told him too that shed been impressed by his skill as her call was being transferred to sheedy she noticed that the cameramen continued to record the excitement every one of them focused on the car in which her mother sat handcuffed they looked like insurgents firing rocket launchers at shellshocked troops calm now after the intruder in the backyard turned out not to be the abominable snowman kelley morgan was concentrating on her hair the teenager was never far from her curlers her hair was the most frustrating thing in the world a little humidity and it went all frizzy pissed her off sooo much she had to meet juanita and trey and toni on alvarado in forty minutes and they were such great friends that if she was more than ten minutes late theyd ditch her she lost track of time writing a post on bris town hall board on ourworld about tammy foster then kelleyd looked up into the mirror and realized that the damp air had turned the strands into this total creature so she logged off and attacked the brunette tangles somebody had once posted on a local bloganonymously of course kelley morganwhats with her hair its like shes a mushroom i dont like girls with shaved heads but she should go for that look lol yikes why dosnt she get a clue kelley had sobbed paralyzed at the terrible words which cut her like a razor that post was the reason shed defended tammy on ourworld and flamed anongurl who she did end up owning bigtime even now thinking of the cruel post about her hair she shivered with shame and anger never mind that jamie said he loved everything about her the posting had devastated her and made her hypersensitive about the subject and had cost her countless hours since that april post she hadnt once gone outside without battling the do into shape okay get to work girl she rose from her desk and went to her dressing table and plugged in the heated rollers they gave her split ends but at least the heat tamed the worst of the renegade tresses she flicked the dressing table light on and sat down stripped off her blouse and tossed it onto the floor then pulled two tank tops over her bra liking the look of the three straps red pink and black tested the curlers a few more minutes almost right she started to brush it was soooo unfair pretty face nice boobs great ass and this effing hair she happened to glance at her computer and saw an instant message from a friend check out tcr i mean now kelley laughed trish was so exclamation point usually she didnt read the chilton reportit was more politics than she cared aboutbut shed put it on her rss feed after chilton had begun posting about the accident on june under the roadside crosses thread kelley had been at the party that night and just before caitlin and the other girls left had seen travis brigham arguing with caitlin she swung to the keyboard and typed dont xplode y trish responded chilton took out names but people are saying travis attacked tammy kelley typed is this win or r u guessing the response win win travis is pissed bc she flamed him in the blog read it the driver travis and the victim tammy sick to her stomach kelley began pounding the keys calling up the chilton report and plowing through the roadside crosses thread toward the end she read reply to chilton posted by brittanym is anybody watching the news somebody left a cross and then went out and attacked that girl whats that all about omg ill bet its the driver reply to chilton posted by ct where the deleted are the police i heard that that girl in the trunk was raped and had crosses carved on her then he left her in the trunk to drown just because she dissed himthe driver i mean i just looked at the news and he hasnt been arrested yet why not reply to chilton posted by anonymous me and my friends were near the beach where the victim was found and they heard the police talking about this cross they were like he left it as a warning for people to shut up the victim was attacked and raped because she dissed the driver here i mean what she wrote in the blog listen if you flamed him here and youre not using proxies or posting anon youre totally deleted hes going to get you reply to chilton posted by anonymous i know a dd where the driver goes to game and he was saying that the driver was saying he was going to get everybody who was posting stuff about him he planned to cut their throats like terrorists do on arab tv hey cops the driver is the roadside cross killer and thats word nogod no kelley thought back to what shed posted about travis whatd she said would the boy be mad at her she frantically scrolled up and found her post reply to chilton posted by bellakelley u r so right me and my friend were at that party on the where it happened and the driver was coming on to deleted and they were like just go away but he didnt he followed them out the door when they were leaving but we have ourselves to blame too for not doing anything all of us who were there we all knew the driver is a luser and perv and we should have called the police or somebody when they left i had this bad feeling like in ghost whisperer and look what happened why why did i say that i was all leave tammy alone dont flame people online and then i went and said something about travis shit now hes going to get me too is that what id heard outside earlier maybe he really was outside and when my brother showed up that scared him off kelley thought of the bicyclist shed seen hell travis rode a bike all the time a lot of kids at school made fun of him because he couldnt afford a car dismayed angry scared kelley was staring at the posts on the screen of the computer when she heard a noise behind her a snap like earlier another she turned a wrenching scream poured from kelley morgans lips a facethe most frightening face shed ever seenwas staring at her from the window kelleys rational thinking stopped cold she dropped to her knees feeling the warm liquid gush between her legs as she lost control of her bladder a pain spurted in her chest spread to her jaw her nose eyes she nearly stopped breathing the face motionless staring with its huge black eyes scarred skin slits for the nose the mouth sewn shut and bloody the pure horror from her childhood fears flooded through her no no no sobbing like a baby kelley was scrabbling away as fast as she could and as far as she could she slammed into the wall and sprawled stunned on the carpet eyes staring black eyes staring right at her no jeans drenched with pee stomach churning kelley crawled desperately toward the door the eyes the mouth with the bloody stitching in it the yeti the abominable snowman somewhere in that portion of her mind that still worked she knew it was only a mask tied to the crape myrtle tree outside the window but that didnt lessen the fear it ignited within herthe rawest of her childhood fears and she knew too what it meant travis brigham was here hed come to kill her just like hed tried to kill tammy foster kelley finally managed to climb to her feet and stumbled to her door run get the fuck out in the hall she turned toward the front door shit it was open her brother hadnt locked it at all travis was here in the house should she just sprint through the living room as she stood frozen in fear he got her from behind his arm snaking around her throat she struggleduntil he jammed a gun against her temple sobbing please no travis perv he whispered luser im sorry im sorry i didnt mean it as he dragged her backward toward the basement door she felt his arm flex harder until her pleas and the choking grew softer and softer and the glare from the spotless living room window turned gray and then went black kathryn dance was no stranger to the american justice system she had been in magistrates offices and courtrooms as a crime journalist a jury consultant a law enforcement officer but shed never been the relative of the accused after leaving the hospital shed dropped the children off at martines and called her sister betsey who lived with her husband down in santa barbara bet theres a problem with mom what tell me what happened thered been a rare edge in the voice of the otherwise flighty woman younger than dance by several years betsey had curly angelic hair and flitted from career to career like a butterfly testing out flowers dance had run through the details she knew ill call her now betsey had announced shes in detention theyve got her phone therell be a bail hearing soon well know more then im coming up it might be better later sure of course oh katie how serious is this dance had hesitated she recalled harpers still determined eyes missionarys eyes finally shed said it could be bad after theyd disconnected dance had continued here to the magistrates office at the courthouse where she now sat with her father the lean whitehaired man was even paler than usual hed learned the hard way of the dangers a marine biologist faces in the ocean sun and was now a sunscreen and hat addict his arm was around her shoulders edie had spent an hour in the holding cellthe intake area in which many of dances collars had been booked dance knew the procedures well all personal effects were confiscated you went through the warrant check and the inputting of information and you sat in a cell surrounded by other arrestees and then you waited and waited finally you were brought here into the magistrates chilly impersonal room for a bail hearing dance and her father were surrounded by dozens of family members of arrestees most of the accused here some in street clothes some in red monterey county jumpsuits were young latino men dance recognized plenty of gang tats some were sullen whites scruffier than the latinos with worse teeth and hair in the back sat the public defenders the bail bondsmen too waiting to pick up their percent from the carcasses dance lifted her eyes to her mother as she was brought in it broke her heart to see the woman in handcuffs she wasnt in a jumpsuit but her hair normally perfectly done was in a shambles her homemade necklace had been taken from her upon processing her wedding and engagement rings too her eyes were red lawyers milled about some not much spiffier than their clients only edie dances attorney was in a suit that had been shaped by a tailor after purchase george sheedy had been practicing criminal law on the central coast for two decades he had abundant gray hair a trapezoidal figure with broad shoulders and a bass voice that would have done a stunning version of old man river after the brief phone conversation with sheedy from the car dance had immediately called michael oneil whod been shocked at the news she then called the monterey county prosecutor alonzo sandy sandoval i just heard about it kathryn sandoval muttered angrily im being straight with you weve had mcso looking into the millar death sure but i had no idea thats what harper was in town for and a public arrest he was bitter that was inexcusable if the ag insisted on a prosecution i wouldve had her surrender with you bringing her in dance believed him she and sandy had worked together for years and had put a lot of bad people in jail thanks in part to mutual trust but im sorry kathryn monterey has nothing to do with the case its in harpers and sacramento s hands now shed thanked him and hung up but at least she had been able to get her mothers bail hearing handled quickly under california law the time of the hearing is at the magistrates discretion in some places like riverside and los angeles prisoners are often in a cell for twelve hours before they appear in front of the magistrate since the case was murder it was possible the magistrate might not set bail at all leaving that to the discretion of the judge at the arraignment which in california would have to occur within a few days the door to the outer hallway kept opening and dance noticed that many of the recent arrivals were wearing media identification cards around their necks no cameras were allowed but there were plenty of pads of paper a circus the clerk called out edith barbara dance and somber and redeyed and still cuffed her mother rose sheedy joined her a jailor was beside them this session was devoted exclusively to the bail pleas were entered later at the arraignment harper asked that edie be held without bail which didnt surprise dance her father stiffened at the prosecutors harsh words which made edie out to be a dangerous jack kevorkian who if released on bail would target other patients for death and then flee to canada stuart gasped hearing his wife spoken about in this way its okay dad his daughter whispered thats just the way they talk though the words broke her heart too george sheedy argued articulately for an or releaseon edies own recognizance pointing to her lack of a criminal record and to her roots in the community the magistrate a quickeyed latino who had met kathryn dance exuded considerable stress which she could easily read in his posture and facial expressions he wouldnt want this case at all hed have loyalty to dance who was a reasonable law officer cooperative but he would also be aware that harper was a big name from the big city and the magistrate would be very aware of the media too the arguments continued dance the law enforcer found herself looking back to earlier that month reliving the circumstances of the officers death trying to match facts with facts whom had she seen in the hospital around the time juan millar died what exactly were the means of death where had her mother been she now glanced up and found edie staring at her dance gave a pale smile edies face was expressionless the woman turned back to sheedy in the end the magistrate compromised he set the bail at a half million dollars which wasnt atypical for a murder but also wasnt overly burdensome edie and stuart werent wealthy but they owned their house outright since it was in carmel not far from the beach it had to be worth two million they could put it up as security harper took the news stoicallyhis face unsmiling his posture upright but relaxed dances reading was that he was completely stress free despite the setback he reminded her of the killer in los angeles j doe one of the reasons shed had such a hard time spotting that perps deception was that a highly driven focused person reveals and feels little distress when lying in the name of his cause this certainly defined robert harper edie was hustled back to the cell and stuart rose and went to see the clerk to arrange for the bail as harper buttoned his jacket and walked toward the door his face a mask dance intercepted him why are you doing this he regarded her coolly said nothing she continued you couldve let monterey county handle the case whyd you come down from san francisco whats your agenda she was speaking loudly enough for the reporters nearby to hear harper said evenly i cant discuss this with you why my mother i have nothing to say and he pushed through the door and onto the steps of the courthouse where he paused to address the pressto whom he apparently had plenty to say dance returned to a hard bench to await her father and mother ten minutes later george sheedy and stuart dance joined her she asked her father it went okay yes he answered in a hollow voice how soon will she be out stuart looked at sheedy who said ten minutes maybe less thank you he shook the lawyers hand dance nodded her gratitude to sheedy who told them he was returning to the office and would get started on the defense immediately after hed gone dance asked her father what did they take from the house dad i dont know the neighbor said they seemed most interested in the garage lets get out of here i hate this place they walked out into the hallway several reporters saw dance and approached agent dance one woman asked is it troubling to know your mothers been arrested for murder well theres some cuttingedge interviewing she wanted to fire back with something sarcastic but she remembered the numberone rule in media relations assume everything you say in a reporters presence will appear on the six oclock news or on tomorrows front page she smiled theres no doubt in my mind that this is a terrible misunderstanding my mother has been a nurse for years shes devoted herself to saving lives not taking them did you know that she signed a petition supporting jack kevorkian and assisted suicide no dance didnt know that and she wondered how had the press come by the information so fast her reply youll have to ask her about that but petitioning to change the law isnt the same as breaking it it was then that her phone sounded it was oneil she stepped away to take the call michael shes getting out on bail she told him there was a moments pause good thank god dance realized he was calling about something else and something that was serious what is it michael theyve found another cross a real memorial or with a future date today and its identical to the first one branches and florist wire her eyes closed in despair not again then oneil said but listen weve got a witness a guy who saw travis leave it he mightve seen where he went or saw something about him thatll tell us where hes hiding can you interview him another pause then ill be there in ten minutes oneil gave her the address they disconnected dance turned to her father dad i cant stay im so sorry he turned his handsome distraught face toward his daughter what they found another cross the boys going after somebody else it looks like today but theres a witness i have to interview them of course you do yet he sounded uncertain he was going through a nightmare at the momentnearly as bad as her mothersand hed want his daughter with her expertise and her connections nearby but she couldnt get images of tammy foster out of her mind lying in the trunk the water rising higher images of travis brighams eyes too cold and dark beneath their abundant brows as he gazed at his father as if his character in a game armed with knife or sword was debating stepping out of the synth world and into the real to slaughter the man she had to go and now im sorry she hugged her father your mother will understand dance ran to her car and started the engine as she was pulling out of the parking lot she glanced in the rearview mirror and saw her mother emerge from the door to the lockup edie stared at her daughters departure the womans eyes were still her face revealing no emotion dances foot slipped to the brake but then she pressed down once more on the accelerator and hit the grille flashers your mother will understand no she wont dance thought she absolutely wont chapter after all these years in the area kathryn dance had never quite grown used to the peninsula fog it was like a shapeshiftera character out of the fantasy books that wes liked sometimes it was wisps that hugged the ground and swept past you like ghosts other times it was smoke squatting in depressions of land and highway obscuring everything most often it was a thick cotton bedspread floating several hundred feet in the air mimicking cloud and ominously darkening everything below it this was the breed of fog today the gloom thickened as dance listening to raquy and the cavemen a north african group known for their percussion drove along a quiet road running through state land between carmel and pacific grove the landscape was mostly woods untended filled with pine scrub oak eucalyptus and maple joined by tangles of brush she drove through the police line ignoring the reporters and camera crews were they here for the crime or because of her mother dance wondered cynically she parked greeted the deputies nearby and joined michael oneil they began walking toward the cordonedoff shoulder where the second cross had been found hows your mother doing oneil asked not good dance was so glad he was here emotion swelled like a balloon within her and she couldnt speak for a moment as the image of her mother in handcuffs and the runin with the social worker about her children surfaced the senior deputy couldnt help but give a faint smile saw you on tv tv who was the woman the one who looked like oprah you were about to arrest her dance sighed they got that on camera you lookedhe searched for a wordimposing she was taking the kids to social services oneil looked shocked it was harper tactics he nearly got his flunky collared though oh i wouldve pushed the button on that one she added ive got sheedy on the case george good tough you need tough oh and then overby let harper into cbi to go through my files no i think he was looking to see if i suppressed evidence or tinkered with the files about the juan millar case overby said he went through your offices files too mcso he asked dance could read his anger like a red highway flare did overby know harper was making a case against edie i dont know at the least he shouldve thought what the hell is this guy from san francisco prowling around in our files for caseload evaluations ridiculous her own fury swelled again and with effort she finally managed to bank it they approached the spot where the cross was planted on the shoulder of the road the memorial was like the earlier one brokenoff branches bound with wire and a cardboard disk with todays date on it at the base was another bouquet of red roses she couldnt help but think whose murder would this one represent and ten more waiting this cross had been left on a deserted stretch of barely paved road about a mile from the water not highly traveled this route was a littleknown shortcut to highway ironically this was one of the roads that would lead to that new highway that chilton had written about in his blog standing on a side road near the cross was the witness a businessman in his forties to look at him into real estate or insurance dance guessed he was round his belly carrying his blue dress shirt well over a tired belt his hair had receded and she saw sun freckles on his round forehead and balding crown he stood beside a honda accord that had seen better days they approached and oneil said to her this is ken pfister she shook his hand the deputy said he was going to supervise the crime scene search and headed across the street tell me what you saw mr pfister travis travis brigham did you know it was him a nod i saw his picture online when i was at lunch about a half hour ago thats how i recognized him could you tell me exactly what you saw she asked and when okay it was around eleven this morning i had a meeting in carmel i run an allstate agency he said this proudly got that one right she thought i left about tenforty and was driving back to monterey took this shortcut itll be nice when that new highways open wont it she smiled noncommittally not a smile really and i pulled off onto that side roadhe gesturedto make some phone calls he gave a broad smile never drive and talk thats my rule dances lifted eyebrow prodded him to continue i looked out my windshield and i saw him walking along the shoulder from that direction he didnt see me he was kind of shuffling his feet it seemed like he was talking to himself what was he wearing one of those hooded sweatshirts like the kids have ah the hoodie what color was it i dont remember jacket slacks sorry i wasnt paying much attention i didnt know who he was at that pointi hadnt heard about the roadside cross stuff all i knew was that he was weird and scary he was carrying that cross and he had a dead animal an animal a nod yeah a squirrel or groundhog or something it had its throat cut he gestured with his finger at his own neck dance hated any atrocities committed against animals still she kept her voice even as she asked had he just killed it i dont think so there wasnt much blood okay then what happened then he looks up and down the road and when he doesnt see anybody he opens his backpack and oh he had a backpack thats right what color was it uhm black im pretty sure and he takes a shovel out a little one the sort that youd use on a camping trip and he opens it up and digs a hole and then puts the cross in the ground thenthis is really weird he goes through this ritual he walks around the cross three times and it looks like hes chanting chanting thats right muttering things i cant hear what and then he picks up the squirrel and walks around the cross again five timesi was counting three and fivemaybe it was a message a clue if somebody could figure it out after the da vinci code dance had observed a lot of witnesses tended to decrypt their observations rather than just say what theyd seen anyway he opened his backpack again and pulled out this stone and a knife he used the stone to sharpen the blade then he held the knife over the squirrel i thought he was going to cut it up but he didnt i saw his lips moving again then he wrapped the body up in some kind of weird yellow paper like parchment and put it in the backpack then it looked like he said one last thing and went up the road the way he came loping you know like an animal and what did you do then i left and went on to a few more meetings i went back to the office thats when i went online and saw the news about the boy i saw his picture i freaked out i called nineoneone right away dance gestured michael oneil over michael this is interesting mr pfisters been real helpful oneil nodded his thanks now could you tell deputy oneil here what you saw sure pfister explained again about pulling over to make calls the boy had a dead animal of some sort a squirrel i think he walked around in a circle three times without the body then he plants the cross and walks around it five times he was talking to himself it was weird like a different language and then he wrapped the squirrel up in this parchment paper and held the knife over it he said something else in that weird language again then he left interesting oneil said youre right kathryn it was then that dance pulled off her palepinkframed glasses and polished them and subtly swapped them for a pair with severe black frames oneil caught on immediately that she was putting on her predator specs and stepped back dance moved closer to pfister well into his personal proxemic zone immediately she could see he felt a sense of threat good now ken i know youre lying and i need you to tell me the truth lying he blinked in shock thats right pfisterd been pretty good at his deception but certain comments and behaviors had tipped her off her suspicions arose initially because of contentbased analysis considering what he said rather than how he said it some of his explanations sounded too incredible to be true claiming he didnt know who the boy was and that hed never heard about the roadside cross attackwhen he seemed to go online regularly to get news claiming travis was wearing a hoodie which several of the posters to the chilton report had said but not remembering the colorpeople tend to remember the hues of clothing far better than the garments themselves pfister had also paused frequentlyliars often do this as they try to craft credible deceptive lines and hed used at least one illustrator gesturethe finger at the throat people use these subconsciously to reinforce spurious statements so suspicious dance had then used a shorthand technique to test for deception in determining if somebodys lying an interviewer will ask to hear his story several times one whos telling the truth may edit the narrative some and remember things forgotten the first time through but the chronology of events will always be the same a liar though often forgets the sequence of occurrences within his fictional narrative this happened with pfister in retelling the story to oneil hed mixed up when the boy had planted the cross also while honest witnesses may recall new facts during the second telling theyll rarely contradict the first version initially pfister had said that travis was whispering and that he couldnt hear the words the second version included the detail that he couldnt understand the words which were weird implying that he had heard them dance concluded without a doubt that pfister was fabricating in other circumstances dance would have handled the interrogation more subtly tricked the witness into revealing the truth but this was a man whose liars personalityshe assessed him as a social deceiverand slippery personal attitude would mean a long bout of tough interviewing to get to the truth she didnt have time the second cross containing todays date meant that travis might be planning the next attack right now so ken youre real close to going to jail what no dance didnt mind a bit of double teaming she glanced at oneil who said you sure are and we need the truth oh please look but he offered nothing for their examination i didnt lie really everything i told you is true this was different from assuring her that hed actually seen what he said he had why did the guilty always think they were so clever she asked did you witness what you told me under her laser gaze pfister looked away his shoulders slumped no but its all true i know it how can you she asked because i read that somebody saw him doing what i told you on this blog the chilton report her eyes slipped to oneils his expression matched hers she asked why did you lie he lifted his hands i wanted to make people aware of the danger i thought people should be more careful with this psycho out there they should take more precautions especially with their children we have to be careful with our children you know dance noted the hand gesture heard the slight hitch in his throat she knew his liars mannerisms by now ken we have no time for this oneil unleashed his handcuffs no no i the head dropped in complete surrender i made some bad business deals my loans got called and i cant pay them so i he sighed so you lied to be a hero get some publicity oneils face registered disgust as he glanced at the news crews cordoned off fifty yards away pfister began to protest then his hand drooped yes im sorry oneil jotted something in his notebook ill have to speak to the prosecutor about this oh pleaseim sorry so you didnt see him at all but you knew somebody had just left the cross and you knew who it was okay i had an idea i mean yes i knew why did you wait hours before telling us she snapped ii was afraid maybe he was still waiting around here oneil asked in a low ominous voice it didnt occur to you that telling all that crap about ritual sacrifices mightve sent us in the wrong direction i thought you knew all those things anyway the stories were in that blog they have to be true dont they dance said patiently okay ken lets start over sure anything were you really in that meeting yes maam he was so deeply into the last stage of emotional response in interrogationacceptance and confessionthat she nearly laughed he was now the epitome of cooperation and what happened then okay i was driving along and i pulled off on the side road here he pointed emphatically at his feet when i made the turn there wasnt any cross i made a couple of phone calls then turned around and drove back to the intersection i waited for traffic and looked up the road there it was he pointed again this time at the cross i didnt see him at all the hoodie and everything i got that from the blog all i can say is that i didnt pass anybody on the shoulder so he mustve come out of the woods and yeah i knew what it meant the cross and it scared the shit out of me the killer had just been there right in front of me a sour laugh i locked the doors so fast ive never done anything brave in my life not like my father he was a fireman volunteer this happened often with kathryn dance the most important aspect of interrogation and interviewing is to be a good listener nonjudgmental and aware because she honed this skill daily witnessesand suspects tootended to look at her as a therapist poor ken pfister was confessing but hed have to lie down on somebody elses couch it wasnt her job to explore his demons oneil was looking into the trees based on what pfister had originally told them the officers were searching the shoulder we better check out the woods an ominous glance at pfister at least that might be helpful he called several deputies after him and they headed across the road to search in the forest the traffic you waited for she asked pfister could the driver have seen anything i dont know maybe if travis was still there theyd have a better view than me you get a license number make no it was dark a van or truck but i remember it was official official yeah it said state on the back which organization i didnt see honest that could be helpful theyd contact all the california agencies that mightve had vehicles in the area good he seemed ecstatic at the faint praise all right youre free to go now ken but remember theres still an open complaint against you yes sure absolutely look im really sorry i didnt mean anything bad he scurried off as she crossed the road to join oneil and the team searching the woods she watched the pathetic businessman climb into his dinged car the stories were in that blog they have to be true dont they she wanted to die kelley morgan was silently asking that her prayers be answered the fumes were choking her her vision was going her lungs stung eyes and nose were inflamed the pain but more horrifying than that was the thought of what was happening to her the terrible changes to her skin and face from the chemicals her thoughts were fuzzy she had no memory of travis dragging her down the stairs shed come back to consciousness here in her fathers darkened wine cellar in the basement chained to a pipe her mouth taped her neck aching from where hed half strangled her and choking fiercely from whatever hed poured onto the floor the chemical now burning her eyes her nose her throat choking choking kelley tried to scream it was pointless with the tape covering her face besides there was nobody to hear her family was out wouldnt be back till much later the pain raging shed tried to kick the copper pipe away from the wall but the metal wouldnt give kill me kelley understood what travis brigham was doing he couldve strangled her to deathjust kept going another few minutes or shot her but that wasnt good enough for him no the luser and perv was getting even by destroying her looks the fumes would eat away her eyelashes and brows destroy her smooth skin probably even make her hair fall out he didnt want her to die no he wanted to turn her into a monster the geeky kid face all broken out the luser the pervhe wanted to turn her into what he was kill me travis why didnt you just kill me she thought of the mask thats why hed left it it was a message about what shed look like when the chemicals were done her head drooped her arms she slumped against the wall i want to die she began to inhale deeply through her stinging nose everything began to fade the pain was going her thoughts the choking the stinging in her eyes the tears drifting away light going dark deeper breathe deeper breathe the poison in and yeah it was working thank you the pain was growing less the worry less warm relief replaced vanishing consciousness and her last thought before the darkness grew complete was that at last she was going to be safe from her fears forever as she stood beside the roadside cross staring down at the flowers dance was startled by her trilling phoneno cartoon music now shed put the ringer back on default a glance at caller id tj boss another cross i just heard yeah todays date too oh man today yep whatd you find im at bagel express weird but nobody here really knows anything about travis they said he showed up for work but kept to himself didnt socialize didnt say much just left he talked to one kid here about online games some but thats it and nobodys got any idea where he might go oh and his boss said that he was going to fire travis anyway ever since the blog postings hes been getting threats himself business is down customersre afraid to come in all right get back to the office i need you to call all the state agencies who mightve had vehicles in the area this morning no make or tag probably dark but search for anything she told him what pfister had seen check with parks caltrans fisheries environment everybody you can think of and find out if travis has a cell phone and who the provider is see if they can trace it i meant to do that earlier they disconnected dance called her mother no answer she tried her father and the man picked up on the second ring katie shes okay yes were at the house but were packing up what stuart said the protesters from the hospital they found out where we live theyre picketing outside no dance was furious he said grimly interesting to watch your neighbors leave for work and find a dozen people with signs calling you a murderer one of the posters was quite clever it said dance of death you have to give them credit oh dad and somebody taped a poster of jesus on the front door he was being crucified i think theyre blaming edie for that too i can get you a room anonymously at the inn we use for witnesses george sheedys already gotten us a room under a fake name stuart said i dont know how you feel about it honey but i think your momd love to see the kids shes worried about how scared they got when the police came into the hospital thats a great idea ill pick them up from martines and bring them to you whenre you checking in twenty minutes he gave her the address can i talk to her shes on the phone honey with betsey you can see her when you drop the kids off sheedys coming over about the case they disconnected oneil returned from the woods she asked you find anything some footprints that arent helpful a little bit of tracea gray fiber like the one we found earlier and a shred of brown paper an oat flake or grain of some kind could be from a bagel i was thinking peters waiting for it now hell get us the analysis as soon as he can thats great for the case against him but what we need now is something to tell us where hes hiding and the other question whos he about to attack next as dance lifted her phone to call jon boling the ring tone sounded she gave a faint smile at the coincidence his name showed in caller id jon she answered as she listened to his words her smile quickly faded chapter kathryn dance climbed out of her crown vic in front of kelley morgans house the monterey county crime scene people were here along with a dozen other state and town law enforcement officers reporters too plenty of them most asking about the whereabouts of travis brigham why exactly hadnt the cbi or the mcso or the monterey city police or anybody arrested him yet how hard could it be to find a seventeenyearold who paraded around dressed like the columbine and virginia tech killers who carried knives and machetes sacrificed animals in bizarre rituals and left roadside crosses on public highways hes very active in computer games young people who are good at them learn very sophisticated combat and evasion techniques dance ignored them all and pushed on under the police cordon she arrived at one of the ambulances the one nearest the house a young intense medic with slickedback dark hair climbed out of the back door he closed it and then pounded on the side the boxy vehicle containing kelley her mother and brother raced off to the emergency room dance joined michael oneil and the tech how is she still unconscious weve got her on a portable ventilator a shrug shes unresponsive well just have to wait and see it was a near miracle that theyd saved kelley at all and jonathan boling was to thank at the news that a second cross had been located the professor had gone into a frenzy of work to identify the posters critical of travis in the chilton report by correlating posting nicsnicknamesand information from social networking sites and other sources hed even compared grammar word choice and spelling styles in the report posts to those in networking sites and comments in high school yearbooks to identify anonymous posters hed enlisted his students too theyd finally managed to find a dozen names of people in the area whod posted the blog replies most critical of travis his call a half hour ago was to give dance their names shed immediately ordered tj rey carraneo and big al stemple to start calling and warning them they might be at risk one of the posters bellakelley the screen name for kelley morgan was unaccounted for her mother said she was supposed to be meeting with friends but hadnt shown up stemple had led a tactical team to her house dance glanced at him now sitting on the front steps the huge shavedheaded man hovering around forty was the closest thing that the cbi had to a cowboy he knew his weaponry he loved tactical situations and he was pathologically quiet except when it came to talking about fishing and hunting accordingly he and dance had had very few social conversations stemples bulky frame was leaning against the banister of the front porch as he breathed into an oxygen mask attached to a green tank the tech nodded stemples way hes okay did his good deed for the year travis had her chained to a water pipe al ripped the pipe out with his bare hands problem was it took him ten minutes he sucked in a lot of fumes you okay al dance called stemple said something through the mask mostly he looked bored dance also read irritation in his eyesprobably that he hadnt gotten to shoot the perp the tech then said to oneil and dance theres something you oughta know kelley was conscious for a minute or two when we got her out she told me that travis has a gun gun hes armed dance and oneil shared a troubled gaze thats what she said i lost her after that didnt say anything else oh no an unstable adolescent with a firearm nothing was worse in dances opinion oneil called in the information about the weapon to mcso who in turn would relay it to all the officers involved in the search for travis what was the gas dance asked the tech as they walked to another ambulance we arent sure it was definitely toxic the crime scene unit was searching carefully for evidence while a team canvassed the neighborhood for witnesses everyone on the block was concerned everyone was sympathetic but they were also terrified no accounts were forthcoming but perhaps there simply were no witnesses bike tread marks in the canyon behind the house suggested how the boy might have snuck up unnoticed to attack kelley morgan one crime scene officer arrived carrying what turned out to be an eerie mask in a clear evidence bag what the hells that oneil asked it was tied to a tree outside her bedroom window pointing in it was handmade from papiermâché painted white and gray bony spikes like horns extended from the skull the eyes were huge and black the narrow lips were sewn shut bloody to freak her out the poor thing imagine looking out your window and seeing that dance actually shivered as oneil took a call dance phoned boling jon how is she the professor asked eagerly in a coma we dont know how shell be but at least we saved her lifeyou saved her life thank you it was rey too and my students still i mean it we cant thank you enough any leads to travis some she declined to tell him about the eerie mask her phone buzzed call waiting ive got to go keep looking for names jon im on the case he said smiling she rang off the line with boling and answered tj hows the girl doing we dont know not good whatd you find no luck boss about eighteen vans trucks suvs or cars registered to the state were in the area this morning but the ones ive been able to track down they werent near where the cross was left and traviss phone the cell provider says hes taken out the battery or destroyed it they cant trace it thanks ive got a couple more jobs theres a mask the perp left here mask ski mask no its ritual looks like im going to have crime scene upload a picture of it before they take it to salinas see if you can source it and get the word out to everybody hes armed oh man boss keeps gettin better and better i want to know if thereve been any reports of stolen weapons in the county and find out if the father or any relatives have registered firearms check the database maybe we can id the weapon sureoh wanta say heard about your mother the young mans voice had grown even more sober anything i can do thanks tj just find out about the mask and the gun after they hung up she examined the mask thinking could the rumors have been true was travis into some type of ritualistic practice here shed been skeptical of the posters on the blog but maybe shed been making a mistake by not paying attention to them tj called back within minutes thered been no stolen guns reported in the past two weeks hed also looked through the states firearms database california liberally allows the purchase of pistols but all sales must be through a licensed dealer and recorded robert brigham traviss father owned a colt revolver caliber after she disconnected dance noticed oneil his face still looking into the distance she walked up to him michael what is it got to get back to the office something urgent on another case the homeland security thing she asked referring to the indonesian container case he nodded ive got to get in right away ill call you as soon as i know more his face was grave okay good luck he grimaced then turned quickly and walked to his car dance felt concernand emptinesswatching him go what was so urgent and why she thought bitterly had it struck now just when she needed him with her she called rey carraneo thanks for the work with jon boling what did you find at the game shed well he wasnt there last night he lied about that like you were saying but as for friendshe doesnt really hang out with people there hed just go play games and then leave anybody covering for him thats not my impression dance then told the young agent to meet her at kelley morgans house sure oh and rey one thing yes maam i need you to pick up something from the supply room at hq sure what body armor for both of us approaching the brigham house carraneo beside her kathryn dance wiped her palm on her dark slacks touched the grip of her glock i dont want to use it she thought not on a boy it wasnt likely that travis was here mcso had been running surveillance on the place since the boy had vanished from the bagel shop still he could have snuck back in and dance was reflecting if it came to a firefight shed shoot if she had to the rationale was simple shed kill another human being for the sake of her own children she wouldnt let them grow up without any parent at all the body armor chafed but gave her some confidence she forced herself to stop patting the velcro tabs with two county deputies behind them they stepped onto the spongy front porch keeping as far from the windows as possible the family car was in the driveway the landscape service truck too a pickup with hollies and rose bushes in the bed in a whisper she briefed carraneo and the other officers about the younger brother sammy hes big and hell seem unstable but he probably isnt dangerous use nonlethal if it comes down to it yes maam carraneo was wary but calm she sent the deputies to the back of the property and the cbi agents flanked the front door lets do it she banged on the rotting wood bureau of investigation we have a warrant open the door please another pounding bureau of investigation open up hands near their weapons an interminable moment later as she was about to knock again the door opened and sonia brigham stood there staring with eyes wide shed been crying mrs brigham is travis here i please is travis home its important that you tell us no really we have a warrant to collect his belongings handing her the bluebacked document dance entered carraneo behind her the living room was empty she noticed both boys doors were open she saw no sign of sammy and glanced into his room noting elaborate charts filled with handdrawn pictures she wondered if he was trying to write his own comic or japanese manga is your other son here sammy hes out playing down by the pond please do you know anything about travis has anybody seen him a creak from the kitchen her hand dropped to her gun bob brigham appeared in the kitchen doorway he was holding a can of beer back again he muttered with his voice faded as he snatched the warrant away from his wife and made a pretense of reading it he looked at rey carraneo as if he were a busboy dance asked have you heard from travis eyes swiveling around the house nope but you cant be blaming us for what hes up to sonia snapped he didnt do anything dance said im afraid that the girl today who was attacked identified him sonia began to protest but fell silent and futilely fought tears dance and carraneo searched the house carefully it didnt take long no sign the boy had been here recently we know you own a pistol mr brigham could you check to see if its missing his eyes narrowed as if he were considering the implications of this its in my glove compartment in a lockbox which california law required in a household where children under eighteen lived loaded uhhuh he looked defensive we do a lot of landscaping in salinas the gangs you know could you see if its still there hes not going to take my gun he wouldnt dare hed get a whipping like he wouldnt believe could you check please the man gave her a look of disbelief then he stepped outside dance motioned carraneo to follow him dance looked at the wall and noticed a few pictures of the family she was struck by a much happierlooking and much younger sonia brigham standing behind the counter at a booth at the monterey county fairgrounds she was thin and pretty maybe shed run the concession before shed gotten married maybe thats where she and brigham had met the woman asked is the girl all right the one who got attacked we dont know tears dotted her eyes hes got problems he gets mad some butthis has to be a terrible mistake i know it denial was the most intractable of emotional responses to hardship tough as a walnut shell traviss father accompanied by the young agent returned to the living room bob brighams ruddy face was troubled its gone dance sighed and you wouldnt have it anyplace else he shook his head avoided sonias face timidly she said what good comes of a gun he ignored her dance asked when travis was younger were there places hed go no the father said he was always disappearing but who knows where he went how about his friends brigham snapped doesnt have any hes always online with that computer of his all the time echoed his wife softly all the time call us if he contacts you dont try to get him to surrender dont take the gun away just call us its for his own good sure she said we will hell do what i say exactly what i say bob shhhh were going through his room now dance said is that all right sonia was nodding at the warrant they can take whatever the fuck they want anything thatll help find him before he gets us into more trouble brigham lit a cigarette and dropped the match into the ashtray a smoking arc sonias face sank as she realized shed become her sons sole advocate dance pulled her radio off her hip called the deputies outside one of them radioed back that hed found something the young officer arrived he held up a lockbox in a latexgloved hand it had been smashed open was in some bushes behind the house and this too an empty box of remington special rounds thats it the father muttered mine the house was eerily quiet the agents walked into traviss room pulling on her gloves dance said to carraneo i want to see if we can find anything about friends addresses places he might like to hang out they searched through the effluence of a teenagers roomclothes comics dvds manga anime games computer parts notebooks sketchpads she noticed there was little music and nothing at all about sports dance blinked as she looked through a notebook the boy had done a drawing of a mask identical to the one outside kelley morgans window even the small sketch chilled her hidden away in a drawer were tubes of clearasil and books about remedies for acne diet and medication and even dermabrasion to remove scarring though traviss problem was less serious than with many teens it was probably what he saw as a major reason he was an outcast dance continued to search under the bed she found a strongbox it was locked but she had seen a key in the top desk drawer it worked in the box expecting drugs or porn she was surprised at the contents stacks of cash carraneo was looking over her shoulder hmm about four thousand dollars the bills were crisp and ordered as if hed gotten them from a bank or an atm not from buyers in drug deals dance added the box to the evidence theyd take back not only did she not want to fund traviss escape if he came back for it but she didnt doubt that his father would pilfer the money in an instant if he found the stash theres this carraneo said he was holding up printouts of pictures mostly candids of pretty girls about high school age taken around robert louis stevenson high school none obscene or taken up the girls skirts though or of locker rooms or bathrooms stepping outside the room dance asked sonia do you know who they are neither parent did she turned back to the pictures she realized that shed seen one of the girls beforein a news story about the june crash caitlin gardner the girl whod survived the photo was more formal than the othersthe pretty girl looking off to the side smiling blandly dance turned the thin glossy rectangle of paper over and noted a portion of a picture of a sports team on the other side travis had cut the picture out of a yearbook had he asked caitlin for a picture and been refused or had he been too shy even to ask the agents searched for a half hour but found no clues as to where travis might be no phone numbers email addresses or friends names he kept no address book or calendar dance wanted to see what was on his laptop she opened the lid it was in hibernate mode and booted up immediately she wasnt surprised when it asked for a password dance asked the boys father do you have any idea what the code is like hed tell us he gestured at the computer now thats the problem right there you know thats what went wrong playing all those games all the violence they shoot people and cut them up do all kinds of shit sonia seemed to reach a breaking point well you played soldier when you were growing up i know you did all boys play games like that it doesnt mean they turn into killers that was a different time he muttered it was better healthier we only played killing indians and viet cong not normal people carrying the laptop notebooks strongbox and hundreds of pages of printouts and notes and pictures dance and carraneo walked to the door did you ever think about one thing sonia asked dance paused turned that even if he did it went after those girls that maybe it wasnt his fault all those terrible things that they said about him just pushed him over the edge they attacked him with those words those hateful words and my travis never said a single word against any one of them she controlled her tears hes the victim here chapter on the highway to salinas not far from beautiful laguna seca racecourse kathryn dance braked her unmarked ford to a halt in front of a construction worker holding a portable stop sign two large bulldozers slowly traversed the highway in front of her shooting ruddy dust into the air she was on the phone with deputy david reinhold the young officer whod delivered tammy fosters computer to her and boling rey carraneo had sped to the mcso crime scene unit in salinas and dropped traviss dell off for processing into evidence ive logged it in reinhold told her and run it for prints and other trace oh and it probably wasnt necessary agent dance but i ran a nitrate swab for explosives too computers were occasionally boobytrappednot as ied weapons but to destroy compromising data contained in the files good deputy the officer certainly had initiative she recalled his quick blue eyes and his smart decision to pull out the battery of tammys computer some of the prints are traviss the young deputy said but there are others too i ran them a half dozen were from samuel brigham the boys brother right and a few others no match in aifis but i can tell you theyre larger probably male dance wondered if the boys father had tried to get inside reinhold said im happy to try to crack into the system if you want ive taken some courses appreciate it but im having jonathan bolingyou met him in my officehandle that sure agent dance whatever youd like where are you im out now but you can have it delivered to the cbi have agent scanlon take custody hell sign the card and receipt ill do it right now kathryn they disconnected and she looked around impatiently waiting for the construction flagman to allow her through she was surprised to see the area dug up so completelydozens of trucks and roadgrading equipment were tearing apart the ground shed driven here just last week and the work hadnt yet begun this was the big highway project that chilton had written about in the blog the shortcut to highway in the thread titled yellow brick road suggesting goldand wondering if somebody was profiting illegally on the project she noted that the equipment belonged to clint avery construction one of the largest companies on the peninsula the workers here were large men working hard sweaty they were mostly white which was unusual much of the labor on the peninsula was performed by latino workers one of them looked at her solemnlyrecognizing her car for an unmarked law enforcement vehiclebut he made no special effort to speed her through finally at his leisure he waved the traffic on his eyes looking over dance closely it seemed to her she left the extensive roadwork behind and cruised down the highway and onto side streets until she came to central coast college where summer session was under way a student pointed out caitlin gardner sitting at a picnic bench with several other girls who hovered around her protectively caitlin was pretty and blond and sported a ponytail tasteful studs and hoops decorated both ears she resembled any one of the hundreds of coeds here after leaving the brighams dance had called the gardner house and learned from caitlins mother that the girl was taking some college courses here for credit at robert louis stevenson high where shed start her senior year in a few months caitlins eyes dance noticed were focused away and then her gaze shifted to dance not knowing who she wasprobably thinking she was another reportershe began to gather her books two of the other girls followed their friends troubled eyes and rose in a phalanx to give cover so caitlin could escape but they then noticed dances body armor and weapon and grew cautious pausing caitlin dance called the girl stopped dance approached and showed her id introduced herself id like to talk to you shes pretty tired a friend said and upset dance smiled to caitlin she said im sure you are but its important that i talk to you if you dont mind she shouldnt even be in school another girl said but shes taking classes out of respect to trish and vanessa thats good of you dance wondered how attending summer school honored the dead the curious icons of adolescents the first friend said firmly caitlins like really really dance turned to the frizzyhaired brunette her personality brittle lost the smile and said bluntly im speaking to caitlin the girl fell silent caitlin mumbled i guess come on over here dance said pleasantly caitlin followed her across the lawn and they sat at another picnic table she clutched her book bag to her chest and was looking around the campus nervously her foot bobbed and she tugged at an earlobe she appeared terrified even more so than tammy dance tried to put her at ease so summer school yeah my friends and me better than working or sitting home the last word has been delivered in a tone that suggested a fair amount of parental hassle whatre you studying chemistry and biology thats a good way to ruin your summer she laughed its not so bad im kinda good at science headed for med school im hoping where oh i dont know yet probably berkeley undergrad then ill see i spent time up there great town yeah whatd you study dance smiled and said music in fact she hadnt taken a single class on that campus of the university of california shed been a buskera musician playing guitar and singing for money on the streets of berkeley very little money in her case so how you doing with all of this caitlins eyes went flat she muttered not so great i mean its so terrible the accident that was one thing but then what happened to tammy and kelleythat was awful how is she kelley we dont know yet still in a coma one of the friends had overheard and called travis bought this poison gas online like from neonazis true or rumor dance said caitlin hes disappeared hes hiding somewhere and we have to find him before he causes more harm how well did you know him not too good we had a class or two together id see him in the halls sometimes thats all suddenly she started in panic and her eyes jumped to a nearby stand of bushes a boy was pushing his way through them he looked around retrieved a football and then returned into the foliage for the field on the other side travis had a crush on you right dance pressed on no she said and dance deduced that the girl did in fact think this she could tell from the rise in the pitch of her voice one of the few indicators of deception that can be read without the benefit of doing a prior baseline not just a little maybe he did but a lot of boysyou know what its like her eyes did a sweep of dancemeaning boys mightve had a crush on you too even if it was a long long time ago did you two talk sometimes about assignments thats all did he ever mention anyplace he liked to hang out at not really nothing like specific he said there were some neat places he liked to go near the water mostly the shore reminded him of some places in this game he played this was something that he liked the ocean he could be hiding out in one of the shorefront parks maybe point lobos in this land of temperate climate he could easily survive with a waterproof sleeping bag does he have any friends he might be staying with really i dont know him real well but he didnt have any friends i ever saw not like my girlfriends and me he was like online all the time he was smart and everything but he wasnt into school even at lunch or study period hed just sit outside with his computer and if he could hack into a signal hed go online are you scared of him caitlin well yeah as if it was obvious but you havent said anything bad about him on the chilton report or social networking sites have you no what was the girl so upset about dance couldnt read her emotions which were extreme more than just fear why havent you posted anything about him like i dont go there its bullshit because you feel sorry for him yeah caitlin frantically played with one of the four studs in her left ear because what the girl was very upset now tension bursting tears dotted her eyes she whispered because its my fault what happened what do you mean the accident its my fault go on caitlin see there was this guy at the party a guy i kind of like mike dangelo at the party right and he was totally ignoring me hanging out with this other girl brianna rubbing her back you know right in front of me i wanted to make him jealous so i walked up to travis and was hanging out with him i gave him my car keys right in front of mike and asked him to take me home i was like oh lets drop trish and vanessa off and then you and me can hang out and you thought it would make mike feel bad she nodded tearfully it was so stupid but he was acting like such a shit flirting with brianna her shoulders were arched in tension i shouldntve but i was so hurt if i hadnt done that nothing wouldve happened this explained why travis had been driving that night all to make another boy jealous the girls explanation also suggested a whole new scenario maybe on the drive back travis had realized that he was being used by caitlin or maybe he was angry at her for having a crush on mike had he intentionally crashed the car murdersuicidean impulsive gesture not unheard of when it came to young love so hes got to be mad at me what im going to do is put an officer outside your house really sure its still early at summer school right you dont have any tests coming up do you no we just started well why dont you head home now you think yeah and stay there until we find him dance took down the girls address if you can think of anything moreabout where he might beplease let me know sure the girl took dances card together they walked back to her crew floating through her ears was the haunting quena flute of jorge cumbo with the south american group urubamba the music calmed her and it was with some regret that dance pulled into the monterey bay hospital parking lot parked and paused the music of the protesters only about half remained the reverend fisk and his redheaded bodyguard were absent probably trying to track down her mother dance walked inside several nurses and doctors came up to express their sympathytwo nurses wept openly when they saw their coworkers daughter she walked downstairs to the office of the head of security the room was empty she glanced up the hall toward the intensive care unit she headed in that direction and pushed through the door dance blinked as she turned to the room where juan millar had died it was cordoned off with yellow police tape signs read do not enter crime scene it was harpers doing she reflected angrily this was idiocy there were only five intensive care rooms down herethree were occupiedand the prosecutor had sealed one of them what if two more patients were admitted and whats more she thought the crime had taken place nearly a month ago the room occupied by presumably a dozen patients since then not to mention cleaned by fastidious crews there couldnt possibly be more evidence to collect grandstanding and public relations she started away and nearly ran right into juan millars brother julio the man who had attacked her earlier in the month the dark compact man in a dark suit pulled up short eyes fixed on her he was carrying a folder of papers which sagged in his hand as he stared at dance only four or five feet away dance tensed and stepped back slightly to give her time to get to her pepper spray or cuffs if he came at her again she was prepared to defend herself though she could imagine what the media would do with the story of the daughter of a suspected mercy killer macing the brother of the euthanized victim but julio simply stared at her with a curious looknot of anger or hate but almost amusement at the coincidence of running into her he whispered your motherhow could she the words sounded rehearsed as if hed been waiting for the chance to recite them dance began to speak but julio clearly expected no response he walked slowly out of the door that led to the back exit and that was it no harsh words no threats no violence how could she her heart pounding furiously from the bewildering confrontation she recalled that her mother had said julio had been here earlier dance wondered why he was back now with a last glance at the police tape dance left the icu and walked to the office of the head of security oh agent dance henry bascomb said blinking she smiled a greeting theyve got the room taped off you were back there he asked dance immediately noted the stress in the mans posture and voice he was thinking quickly and he was uneasy what was that about dance wondered sealed off she repeated yeah thats right maam maam dance nearly laughed at the formal word she oneil bascomb and some of his former deputy buddies had shared beer and quesadillas down on fishermans wharf a few months ago she decided to get to the nut of it ive only got a minute or two henry its about my mothers case hows she doing dance was thinking i dont know any better than you do henry she said not great give her my best ill do that now id like to see the employee and front desk logs of who was at the hospital when juan died sure only he didnt mean sure at all he meant what he said next but the thing is i cant whys that henry ive been told i cant let you see anything no paperwork were not even supposed to be talking to you whose orders the board bascomb said tentatively and dance continued prodding well it was mr harper that prosecutor he talked to the board and the chief of staff but thats discoverable information the defense attorney has a right to it oh i know that but he said thats how youll have to get it i dont want to take it just look through it henry there was absolutely nothing illegal about her looking through the material and it wouldnt ultimately affect the case because what was contained in the logs and signin sheets would come out eventually bascombs face revealed how torn he was i understand but i cant not unless theres a subpoena harper had spoken to the security chief for one purpose only to bully dance and her family im sorry he said sheepishly no thats okay henry did he give you a reason no he said this too quickly and dance could easily see eye aversion that differed from what she knew of the mans baseline behavior what did he say henry a pause she leaned toward him the guard looked down he saidhe said he didnt trust you and he didnt like you dance stoked her smile as best she could well thats the good news i suppose hes the last person in the world id want a thumbsup from the time was now pm from the hospital lot dance called the office and learned thered been no significant developments in the hunt for travis brigham the highway patrol and sheriffs office were running a manhunt focusing on the traditional locales and sources for information about runaways and juvenile fugitives his school and classmates and the shopping malls that his transportation was limited to a bike was helpful in theory but hadnt led to any sightings rey carraneo had learned little from traviss rambling notes and drawings but was still sifting through them for leads to the boys whereabouts tj was trying to track down the source of the mask and calling the potential victims from the blog since dance had learned from caitlin that travis liked the shore she gave him the added task of contacting the parks department and alerting them that the boy might be hiding out somewhere in the thousands of square acres of state land in the area okay boss he said wearily revealing not fatigue but the same hopelessness that she felt she then spoke to jon boling i got the boys computer that deputy dropped it off reinhold he sure knows his stuff when it comes to computers he shows initiative hell go places you having any luck no travis is smart hes not relying on your basic password protection alone hes got some proprietary encryption programs that have locked his drive we may not be able to crack it but ive called an associate at school if anybody can get inside they can hmm dance thought how genderneutral associate and they dance translated the words as young gorgeous female grad student probably blond and voluptuous boling added in techspeak that a brute force attack was under way via an uplink to a supercomputer at ucsanta cruz the system might crack the code within the next hour really she asked brightly or i was going to say within the next two or three hundred years it depends dance thanked him and told him to head home for the evening he sounded disappointed and after explaining that he had no plans for that night said hed continue to search for the names of posters who might be at risk she then collected the children from martines and they all drove to the inn where her parents were hiding out as she drove she was recalling the incidents surrounding young juan millars death but in truth she hadnt focused on them much at the time the manhunt had demanded all her attention daniel pellthe cult leader killer and vicious manipulatorand his partner a woman equally dangerous had remained on the peninsula after his escape to stalk and murder new victims dance and oneil had worked nonstop pursuing them and juan millars death had not occupied her thoughts other than to engender a piercing remorse for the part though small shed played in it if shed guessed that her mother might have become entwined in the case she would have been much more attentive ten minutes later dance parked the car in the gravel lot of the inn maggie offered wow bouncing on the seat as she examined the place yeah neat though wes was more subdued the quaint cottagepart of the luxurious carmel innwas one of a dozen standalone cabins separate from the main building theres a pool maggie cried i want to go swimming sorry i forgot your suits dance nearly suggested edie and stuart could take them shopping for swimwear but then recalled that her mother shouldnt be out in publicnot with reverend fisk and his birds of prey on the loose ill bring them by tomorrow and hey wes theres a tennis court you can practice with grandpa okay they climbed out dance collecting their suitcases which shed packed earlier the children would be staying here tonight with their grandparents they walked along the path bordered with vines and low green chickandhen succulents which ones theirs maggie asked bouncing along the trail dance pointed it out and the girl launched herself forward fast she hit the buzzer and a moment later just as dance and wes arrived the door opened and edie smiled at her grandchildren and let them inside grandma maggie called this is cool its very nice come on in edie gave a smile to dance who tried to read it but the expression was as informative as a blank page stuart hugged the children wes asked you okay grandma im absolutely fine howre martine and steve okay the boy said the twins and i built a mountain out of pillows maggie said with caves youll have to tell me all about it dance saw they had a visitor distinguished defense attorney george sheedy rose and stepped forward shaking dances hand and saying hello in his basso profundo voice a briefcase was open on the coffee table in the sitting area of the suite and yellow pads and printouts sat in cluttered stacks the lawyer said hello to the children he was courteous but from his posture and expression dance could tell immediately that the conversation shed interrupted was a hard one wes regarded sheedy suspiciously after edie dispensed treats to the children they headed outside to a playground stay with your sister dance commanded okay come on the boy said to maggie and juggling juice boxes and cookies they left dance glanced out the window and noted that she could see the playground from here the pool was behind a locked gate with children you could never be too vigilant edie and stuart returned to the couch three cups of coffee rested largely untouched on a low driftwood table her mother would have instinctively prepared them the moment sheedy arrived the lawyer asked about the case and the hunt for travis brigham dance gave sketchy answerswhich in fact were the best she could offer and that girl kelley morgan still unconscious it seems stuart shook his head the subject of the roadside cross attacks was tucked away and sheedy glanced at edie and stuart eyebrow raised dances father said you can tell her go ahead everything sheedy explained were tipping to what harpers game plan seems to be hes very conservative hes very religious and hes on record as opposing the death with dignity act the proposal cropped up every so often in california it was a statute like oregon s that would allow physicians to assist people who wished to end their lives like abortion it was a controversial topic and the pros and cons were highly polarized presently in california if somebody helped a person commit suicide that assistance was considered a felony so he wants to make an example of edie the case isnt about assisted suicideyour mother tells me that juan was too badly injured to administer the drugs to himself but harper wants to send a message that the state will seek tough penalties against anybody who helps with a suicide his meaning dont support the law because das will be looking real closely at each case one step out of line and doctors or anybody helping someone die will get prosecuted hard the distinguished voice continued grimly speaking to dance that means hes not interested in plea bargains he wants to go to trial and run a big splashy public relationsdriven contest now in this instance because somebody killed juan that makes it murder first degree dance said she knew the penal code the way some people knew the joy of cooking sheedy nodded because its premeditated and millar was a law enforcement officer but not special circumstances dance said looking at her mothers pale face special circumstances would allow for the death penalty but for that punishment to apply millar would have had tove been on duty at the time he was killed but sheedy said scoffing believe it or not hes considering that how how can he possibly be dance asked heatedly because millar was never officially signed out of his tour hes playing a technicality like that dance snapped in disgust is harper mad stuart muttered no hes driven and hes selfrighteous which is scarier than being mad hell get better publicity with a capital case and thats what he wants dont worry there is no way youd be convicted of special circumstance murder he said turning toward edie but i think hes going to start there still murder one was harrowing enough that could mean twentyfive years in prison for edie the lawyer continued now for our defense justification doesnt apply or mistake or selfdefense ending the mans pain and suffering would be relevant at sentencing but if the jury believed you intended to end his life however merciful your motive they would have to find you guilty of firstdegree murder the defense then dance said is on the facts exactly first we attack the autopsy and the cause of death the coroners conclusion was that millar died because the morphine drip was open too far and that an antihistamine had been added to the solution that led to respiratory and then cardiac failure well get experts to say that this was wrong he died of natural causes as a result of the fire the drugs were irrelevant second we assert that edie didnt do it at all somebody else administered the drugs either intentionally to kill him or by mistake we want to try to find people who mightve been aroundsomebody who mightve seen the killer or somebody who might be the killer what about it edie was anybody near icu around the time juan died the woman replied there were some nurses down on that wing but that was all his family was gone and there were no visitors well ill keep looking into it sheedys face was growing grave now we come to the big problem the medication that was added to the iv was diphenhydramine the antihistamine edie said in the police raid on your house they recovered a bottle of a brandname version of diphenhydramine the bottle was empty what stuart gasped it was found in the garage hidden under some rags impossible and a syringe with a small bit of dried morphine on it the same brand of morphine that was in juan millars iv drip edie muttered i didnt put it there of course i didnt we know that mom the lawyer added apparently no fingerprints or significant trace dance said the perp planted it which is what well try to prove either he or she intended to kill millar or did it by mistake in either case they hid the bottle and syringe in your garage to shift the blame edie was frowning she looked at her daughter remember earlier in the month just after juan died i told you i heard a noise outside it was coming from the garage ill bet somebody was there thats right dance agreed though she couldnt actually recall itthe manhunt for daniel pell had occupied all her thoughts then of course dance fell silent what well one thing well have to work around id stationed a deputy outside their housefor security harper will want to know why he didnt see anything or edie said we should find out if he did see the intruder right dance said quickly she gave sheedy the name of the deputy ill check that out too he added the only other thing we have is a report that the patient told you kill me and you told several people that there are witnesses right edie said sounding defensive her eyes slipping to dance the agent suddenly had a terrible thought would she be called to testify against her mother she felt physically ill at this idea she said but she wouldnt tell anybody that if she were really intent on killing somebody true but remember harper is going for splash not for logic a quote like thatwell lets hope harper doesnt find out about it he rose when i hear from the experts and get details of the autopsy report ill let you know are there any questions edies face revealed that yes she had about a thousand but she merely shook her head its not hopeless edie the evidence in the garage is troublesome but well do the best we can with that sheedy gathered up his papers organized them and put them into his briefcase he shook everyones hand and gave reassuring smiles to them all stuart saw him to the door the floor creaking under his solid weight dance too rose she said to her mother are you sure the kids wont be too much i can take them back to martines no no ive been looking forward to seeing them she pulled on a sweater in fact i think ill go outside and visit dance briefly embraced her feeling stiffness in her mothers shoulders for an awkward moment the women held each others eyes then edie stepped outside dance hugged her father too why dont you come over for dinner tomorrow she asked him well see really itd be good for mom for you everybody ill talk to her about it dance headed back to the office where she spent the next few hours coordinating stakeouts of the possible victims houses and of the brighams residence deploying the manpower as best she could and running the frustratingly hopeless search for the boy who was proving to be as invisible as the electrons making up the vicious messages that had sent him on his deadly quest comfort pulling up to her house in pacific grove at pm dance felt a tiny shiver of relief after this long long day she was so glad to be home the classic victorian was dark green with gray banisters shutters and trimit was in the northwestern part of pacific grove if the time of year the wind and your attitude about leaning over a shaky railing coincided you could see the ocean walking into the small entryway she flicked the light on and locked the door behind her the dogs charged up to greet her dylan a blackandtan german shepherd and patsy a dainty flatcoat retriever they were named respectively for the greatest folkrock songwriter and for the greatest countrywestern vocalist in the past hundred years dance reviewed emails but there were no new developments in the case in the kitchen spacious but equipped with appliances from a different decade she poured a glass of wine and foraged for some leftovers settling on half a turkey sandwich that hadnt been resident in the fridge for too long she fed the dogs and then let them out into the back but as she was about to return to her computer she jumped at the raucous fuss they made barking and charging down the stairs they did this sometimes when a squirrel or cat had had the poor judgment to come for a visit but that was rare at this time of night dance set the wineglass down and tapping the butt of her glock walked out onto the deck she gasped a cross lay on the ground about forty feet away from the house no drawing the gun she grabbed a flashlight called the dogs to her and swept the beam into the backyard it was a narrow space but extended for fifty feet behind the house and was filled with monkey flowers scrub oak and maple trees asters lupine potato vines clover and renegade grass the only flora that did well here thrived on sandy soil and shade she saw no one though there were places where an intruder could remain hidden from the deck dance hurried down the stairs into the dimness and looked around at the dozen of unsettling shadows cast by branches rocking in the wind pausing then moving slowly her eyes on the paths and the dogs which tracked around the yard edgy wary their tense gait and dylans raised hackles were unsettling she approached the corner of the yard slowly looking for movement listening for footsteps when she heard and saw no signs of an intruder she shined the flashlight onto the ground it seemed to be a cross but up close dance couldnt tell if it had been left intentionally or been created by falling branches it wasnt bound with wire and there were no flowers but the back gate was a few feet away which though locked could easily have been vaulted by a seventeenyearold boy travis brigham she recalled knew her name and could easily find where she lived she walked in a slow circle around the cross were those footsteps beside it in the trampled grass she couldnt tell the uncertainty was almost more troubling than if the cross had been left as a threat dance returned to the house stuffing her weapon in the holster she locked up and stepped into the living room filled with furniture as mismatched as that in travis brighams house but nicer and homier no leather or chrome mostly overstuffed upholstered in rusts and earth colors all purchased during shopping trips with her late husband dropping onto the sofa dance noticed a missed call she flipped eagerly to the log it was from jon boling not her mother boling was reporting that the associate had had no luck as yet with cracking the pass code the supercomputer would be running all night and hed let dance know the progress in the morning or if she wanted she could call back hed be up late dance debated about callingfelt an urge tobut then decided to keep the line free in case her mother called she then phoned the mcso got the senior deputy on duty and requested a crime scene run to collect the cross she told him where it was located he said hed get somebody there in the morning she then showered despite the steamy water she kept shivering as an unfortunately persistent image lodged in her thoughts the mask from kelley morgans house the black eyes the sewnshut mouth when she climbed into bed her glock was three feet away on the bedside table unholstered and loaded with a full clip and one in the bedroomthe chamber she closed her eyes but as exhausted as she was she couldnt sleep and it wasnt the pursuit of travis brigham that was keeping her awake nor the scare earlier not even the image of that damn mask no the source of her keen restlessness was a simple comment that kept looping over and over in her mind her mothers response to sheedys question about witnesses in the icu the night that juan millar was killed there were some nurses down on that wing but that was all his family was gone and there were no visitors dance couldnt recall for certain but she was almost positive that when shed mentioned the deputys death to her mother just after it happened edie had acted surprised by the news shed told her daughter that shed been so busy on her own wing that she hadnt gone down to the icu that night if edie hadnt been in intensive care that night as shed claimed then how could she be so certain it was deserted wednesday chapter at in the morning kathryn dance walked into her office and smiled to see jon boling in toolarge latex gloves tapping on the keyboard of traviss computer i know what im doing i watch ncis he grinned i like it better than csi hey boss we need a tv show about us tj said from a table hed dragged into the corner his workstation for his search for the origins of the eerie mask from the kelley morgan scene i like that boling picked up on the joke a show about kinesics sure you could call it the body reader can i be a special guest star though she was hardly in a humorous mood dance laughed tj said i get to be the handsome young sidekick whos always flirting with the gorgeous girl agents can we hire some gorgeous girl agents boss not that you arent but you know what i mean howre we doing boling explained that the supercomputer linked to traviss hadnt had any luck cracking the boys pass code one hour or three hundred years nothing to do but keep waiting he pulled off the gloves and returned to tracking down the identities of posters who might be at risk and rey dance glanced at quiet rey carraneo who still was going through the many pages of notes and sketches theyd found in traviss bedroom lot of gobbledygook maam carraneo said the anglo word very stiff in a latino mouth languages i dont recognize numbers doodles spaceships trees with faces in them aliens and pictures of bodies cut open hearts and organs kids pretty messed up any places at all hes mentioned sure the agent said they just dont seem to be on earth here are some more names boling handed her a sheet of paper with another six names and addresses of posters dance looked up the phone numbers in the state database and called to warn them that travis presented a threat it was then that her computer pinged with an incoming email she read it surprised to see the sender michael oneil he mustve been real busy he rarely sent her messages preferring to talk to her in person k hate to say but the container situation is heating up big time tsa and homeland sec are getting worried ill still help you out on the travis brigham caseride herd on forensics and drop in when i canbut this onell take up most of my time sorry m the case involving the shipping container from indonesia apparently he couldnt put it on hold any longer dance was fiercely disappointed why now she sighed in frustration a twinge of loneliness too she realized that between the los angeles homicide case against j doe and the roadside crosses situation she and oneil had seen each other almost daily for the past week that was more on average than shed seen her husband she really wanted his expertise in the pursuit of travis brigham and she wasnt ashamed to admit that she simply wanted his company too funny how just talking sharing thoughts and speculations was such an elixir but his case was clearly important and that was enough for her she typed a fast reply good luck miss you backspaced deleting the final two words and the punctuation she rewrote good luck stay in touch then he was gone from her mind dance had a small tv in the office it was on now and she happened to glance at it she blinked in shock on the screen at the moment was a wooden cross did it have to do with the case had they found another one then the camera panned on and settled on the reverend r samuel fisk it was a report on the euthanasia protestwhich now she realized with a sinking heart had shifted to focus on her mother the cross was in the hand of a protester she turned up the volume a reporter was asking fisk if hed actually called for the murder of abortion doctors as the chilton report had said with eyes that struck her as icy and calculating the man of the cloth gazed back at the camera and said that his words had been twisted by the liberal media she recalled the fisk quotation in the report she couldnt think of a clearer call to murder shed be curious to see if chilton posted a followup she muted the set she and the cbi had their own problems with the media through leaks scanners and that magical way the press learns details about cases the story about the crosses as prelude to murder and that a teenage student was the suspect had gone public calls about the mask killer the social network killer the roadside cross killer were now flooding the cbi lines despite the fact that travis hadnt managed actually to kill the two intended victimsand that no social networking sites were directly involved the calls kept coming in even the mediahungry head of the cbi was as tj cleverly and carelessly put it overbywhelmed kathryn dance spun around in her chair and gazed out the window at a gnarled trunk that had started as two trees and had grown through pressure and accommodation into one stronger than either alone an impressive knot was visible just outside the window and she often rested her eyes on it a form of meditation now she had no time for reflection she called peter bennington at mcso forensics about the scenes at the second cross and kelley morgans house the roses left with the second cross were bound with the same type of rubber bands used by the deli near where travis used to work but they revealed no trace that was helpful the fiber that michael oneil had gotten from the gray hooded sweatshirt in the brighams laundry basket was indeed almost identical to the fiber found near the second cross and the tiny scrap of brown paper from the woods ken pfister had pointed out was most likely from an m m packagecandy that she knew travis bought the grain trace from the scene was associated with that used in oatbran bagels at bagel express at kelley morgans house the boy had shed no trace or physical evidence except a bit of red rose petal that matched the bouquet with cross number two the mask was homemade but the paste and paper and ink used in its construction were generic and unsourceable the gas that had been used in the attempt to murder kelley morgan was chlorinethe same that had been used in world war i to such devastating effect dance told bennington theres a report he got it from a neonazi site she explained about what shed learned from caitlins friend the crime lab boss chuckled doubt it it was probably from somebodys kitchen what he used household cleaners the deputy explained that a few simple substances could make the gas they were available in any grocery or convenience store but we didnt find any containers or anything that would let us determine the source nothing at the scene or nearby had given them clues as to where the boy might be hiding out and david stopped by your house a little bit ago dance hesitated not sure whom he was speaking of david reinhold he works in the cs unit oh the young eager deputy he collected the branches left in your backyard but we still cant tell if they were left intentionally or it was a coincidence no other trace he said he got up early i left the house at seven bennington laughed just two months ago he was writing speeding tickets with the highway patrol and now i think hes got his eye on my job dance thanked the crime scene head and disconnected stung with frustration dance found herself looking at the photo of the mask it was just plain awfulcruel and unsettling she picked up her phone and called the hospital identified herself she asked about kelley morgans condition it was unchanged a nurse told her still in a coma shed probably live but none of the staff was willing to speculate about whether shed return to consciousnessor if so whether shed regain a normal life sighing kathryn dance hung up and got angry she swept the phone up again found a number in her notebook and with a heavy finger punched the keypad hard tj nearby watched the stabbing he tapped jon boling on the arm and whispered uhoh james chilton answered on the third ring this is kathryn dance the bureau of investigation a brief pause chilton would be recalling meeting herand wondering why she was contacting him again agent dance yes i heard there was another incident thats right why im calling mr chilton the only way we were able to save the victima high school girlwas by tracing her screen name it took a long time and a lot of people to find out who she was and where she lived we got to her house about a half hour before she died we saved her but shes in a coma and might not recover im so sorry and it looks like the attacks are going to continue she explained about the stolen bouquets twelve of them his voice registered dismay hes not going to stop until hes killed everybody whos attacked him in your blog im going to ask you again will you please give us the internet addresses of the people whove posted no goddammit dance shivered in rage because if i did it would be a breach of trust i cant betray my readers that again she muttered listen to me please agent dance just hear me out but what i will dowrite this down my hosting platform is central california internet services theyre in san jose he gave her the address and phone number as well as a personal contact ill call them right now and tell them i wont object to their giving you the addresses of everybody whos posted if they want a warrant thats their business but i wont fight it she paused she wasnt sure of the technical implications but she thought hed just agreed to what shed asked for while saving some journalistic face wellthank you they hung up and dance called to boling i think we can get the ip addresses what chiltons had a change of heart sweet he said smiling and seemed like a boy whod just been told his fatherd gotten tickets to a playoff game dance gave it a few minutes and called the hosting company she was skeptical both that chilton had called and the service itself would give up the information without a court battle but to her surprise the representative she spoke with said oh mr chilton just called ive got the ip addresses of the posters ive okayed forwarding them to a dotgov location she smiled broadly and gave the hosting employee her email address theyre on their way ill go back to the blog every few hours or so and get the addresses of the new posters youre a lifesaverliterally the man said grimly this is about that boy whos getting even with people right the satanist is it true they found biological weapons in his locker brother dance thought the rumors were spreading faster than the mission hills fire a few years ago were not sure whats happening at this point always noncommittal they disconnected and a few minutes later her computer dinged with incoming mail got it dance said to boling he rose and walked behind her put his hand on her chair back leaning forward she smelled subtle aftershave pleasant okay good of course you know those are the raw computer addresses weve got to contact all the providers and find out names and physical addresses ill get right on it she printed out the listit contained about thirty individuals namesand handed it to him he disappeared back into his corner of the lair and hunkered down in front of his computer may have something boss tj had been posting pictures of the mask on the web and in blogs and asking if anybody knew its source he ran his hand through his curly red hair pat me on the back whats the story the mask is of some character in a computer game a glance at the mask qetzal what thats his name or its name a demon who kills people with these beams from its eyes and it can only moan because somebody laced up the lips dance asked so its getting even with people who have the ability to communicate didnt really run a dr phil on him boss tj said fair enough she smiled the game tj continued is dimensionquest its a morpeg boling announced without looking up from his own computer whats that dimensionquest is an mmorpgmassively multiplayer online roleplaying game i call them morpegs and dq is one of the most popular helpful to us i dont know yet well see when we get into traviss computer dance liked the professors confidence when not if she sat back pulled out her cell phone and called her mother still no answer finally she tried her father hey katie dad hows mom she never called me oh a hesitation shes upset of course i think shes just not in the mood to talk to anybody dance wondered how long her mothers conversation had been with dances sister betsey last night has sheedy said anything else no hes doing some research he said dad mom didnt say anything did she when she was arrested to the police or to harper the prosecutor no good she felt an urge to ask him to put her mother on the phone but she didnt want the rejection if she said no dance said brightly you are coming over for dinner tonight right he assured her they would though his tone really meant that theyd try i love you dad tell mom too bye katie they hung up dance stared at the phone for a few minutes then she strode up the hall and into her bosss office entering without knocking overby was just hanging up he nodded at the phone kathryn any leads in the morgan girls attack something about biochemicals news nine called she closed the door overby eyed her uneasily no biological weapons charles it was just rumors dance ran through the leads the mask the state vehicle caitlin gardners report that travis liked the seashore the household chemicals and chiltons cooperating he gave the internet addresses of the posters thats good overbys phone rang he glanced at it but let his assistant pick up charles did you know my mother was going to be arrested he blinked ino of course not whatd harper tell you that he was checking the caseloads starch in his words defensive what i said yesterday she couldnt tell if he was lying and she understood why dance was breaking the oldest rule in kinesic interrogation she was being emotional when that happened all her skills fell by the wayside she had no idea if her boss had betrayed her or not he was looking through our files to see if id altered anything about the millar situation oh i doubt that the tension in the room hummed then it vanished as overby gave a reassuring smile ah youre worrying too much kathryn therell be an investigation and the case will all go away you dont have a thing to worry about did he know something eagerly she asked why do you say that charles he looked surprised because shes innocent of course your motherd never hurt anyone you know that dance returned to the gals wing to the office of her fellow agent connie ramirez the short voluptuous latina with black black hair always sprayed meticulously in place was the most decorated agent in the regional office and one of the most recognized in the entire cbi the fortyyearold agent had been offered executive positions with cbi headquarters in sacramentothe fbi had sought her out toobut her family had come out of the local lettuce and artichoke fields and nothing was going to displace her from blood the agents desk was the antithesis of dancesorganized and tidy framed citations hung on the walls but the biggest photos were of her children three strapping boys and ramirez and her husband hey con hows your mom doing you can imagine thiss such nonsense she said with a faint trace of a melodious accent actually why im here need a favor a big one whatever i can do you know that ive got sheedy on board ah the copbuster but i dont want to wait for discovery to get some of the details i asked henry for the hospitals visitor sheets the day juan died but hes stonewalling what henry youre his friend harpers got him scared ramirez nodded knowingly you want me to try if you can you bet ill get over there as soon as i finish interviewing this witness she tapped a folder for a big drug case she was running youre the best the latina agent grew solemn i know how id feel if it was my mother id go down there and rip harpers throat out dance gave a wan smile at the petite womans declaration as she headed for her office her phone trilled she glanced at sheriffs office on caller id hoping it was oneil it wasnt agent dance the deputy identified himself have to tell you chp called in ive got some bad news chapter james chilton was taking a break from ridding the world of corruption and depravity he was helping a friend move after the call from the mcso kathryn dance had rung up chilton at his home and been directed by patrizia to this modest beige california ranch house on the outskirts of monterey dance parked near a large uhaul truck plucked the ipod ear buds out and climbed from her car in jeans and a tshirt sweating chilton was wrangling a large armchair up the stairs and into the house a man with corporatetrimmed hair and wearing shorts and a sweatlimp polo shirt was carting a stack of boxes behind the blogger a realtors sign in the front yard diagonally reported sold chilton came out the front door and walked two steps to the gravel path bordered by small boulders and potted plants he joined dance wiped his forehead and being so sweaty and streaked with dust and dirt nodded in lieu of shaking her hand pat called you wanted to see me agent dance is this about the internet addresses no weve got them thanks this is something else the other man joined them fixing dance with a pleasant curious gaze chilton introduced them the man was donald hawken familiar then dance recalled the name appeared in chiltons blogin on the home front the personal section she believed not one of the controversial posts hawken was returning to monterey from san diego moving day it looks like she said chilton explained agent dance is investigating that case involving the posts on the report hawken tanned and toned frowned sympathetically and i understand there was another girl attacked we were listening to the news dance remained circumspect as always about giving away information even to concerned citizens the blogger explained that the chiltons and hawken and his first wife had been close friends a few years ago the women had hosted dinner parties the men had golfed regularlyat the anemic pacific grove course and on flush days at pebble beach about three years ago the hawkens had moved to san diego but he had recently remarried was selling his company and coming back here could i talk to you for a minute dance asked chilton as hawken returned to the uhaul the blogger and dance walked to her crown vic he cocked his head and waited breathing hard from lugging the furniture into the house i just got a call from the sheriffs office the highway patrol found another cross with todays date on it his face fell oh no and the boy no idea of his whereabouts hes disappeared and it looks like hes armed i heard on the news chilton said grimacing howd he get a gun stole it from his father chiltons face tightened angrily those second amendment peoplei took them on last year ive never had so many death threats in my life dance got to the crux of her mission mr chilton i want you to suspend your blog what until we catch him chilton laughed thats absurd have you read the postings its my blog of course i read them the posters are getting even more vicious dont give travis any more fodder absolutely not im not going to be cowed into silence but travis is getting the names of victims from the blog hes reading up on them finding their deepest fears their vulnerabilities hes tracking down where they live people shouldnt be writing about themselves on public internet pages i did a whole blog about that too be that as it may they are posting dance tried to control her frustration please work with us i have been working with you thats as far as im willing to go what can it hurt to take it down for a few days and if you dont find him by then put it up again or you come to me and say a few more then a few more at least stop taking posts on that thread he wont get any more names he can target as victims itll make our job easier repression never leads to anything good he muttered staring right into her eyes the missionary was back kathryn dance gave up on the jon boling strategy to coddle chiltons ego she snapped angrily youre making these bullshit grand pronouncements freedom truth repression this boy is trying to kill people jesus christ look at it for what it is take the damn politics out of it chilton calmly replied my job is to keep an open forum for public opinion thats the first amendment i know youre going to remind me that you were a reporter too and you cooperated if the police wanted some help but see thats the difference you were beholden to big money to the advertisers to whoevers pocket your bosses were in im not beholden to anybody im not asking you to stop reporting on the crimes write away to your hearts content just dont accept any more posts nobodys adding facts anyway these people are just venting and half of what they say is just plain wrong its rumors speculation rants and their thoughts arent valid he asked but not angrily in fact he seemed to be enjoying the debate their opinions dont count only the articulate and the educatedand the moderateare allowed to comment well welcome to the new world of journalism agent dance the free exchange of ideas see its not about your big newspapers anymore your bill oreillys your keith olbermanns its about the people no im not suspending the blog and im not locking any threads he glanced at hawken who was wrestling another armchair out of the back of the uhaul chilton said to her now if youll excuse me and he strode to the truck looking she decided just like some martyr on his way to the firing squad having just delivered a rant about a cause he though nobody else fervently believed in like everyone else on the peninsulaanybody over age six and with any access to the media that islyndon strickland was very aware of the roadside cross case and like a lot of people who read the chilton report he was angry the fortyoneyearold lawyer climbed out of his car and locked the door he was going for his daily lunchtime run along a path near seventeen mile drive the beautiful road that leads from pacific grove to carmel winding past movie stars and business executives vacation houses and pebble beach golf course he heard the sounds of construction for that new highway heading east to salinas and the farmland it was progressing fast strickland represented several small homeowners whose property had been taken by eminent domain to make way for the road hed been up against the state and against massive avery construction itselfand their armada of big legal guns not unexpectedly hed lost the trial just last week but the judge had stayed the destruction of his clients houses pending appeal the lead defense counsel from san francisco had been livid lyndon strickland on the other hand had been ecstatic the fog was coming up the weather chill and he had the jogging path to himself as he started to run angry strickland had read what people were saying in james chiltons blog travis brigham was a crazy boy who idolized the shooters at columbine and virginia tech who stalked girls in the night whod half asphyxiated his own brother sammy and left him retarded whod intentionally driven a car off the cliff a few weeks ago in some weird suicidemurder ritual killing two girls how the hell had everybody missed the danger signs the boy mustve displayed his parents his teachersfriends the image of the mask hed seen online that morning still gave him the creeps a chill coursed through his body only partly from the damp air the mask killer and now the kid was out there hiding in the hills of monterey county picking off one by one the people whod posted negative things about him strickland read the chilton report frequently it was on his rss feed near the top he disagreed with chilton on some issues but the blogger was always reasonable and always made solid intellectual arguments in support of his positions for instance although chilton was adamantly opposed to abortion hed posted a comment against that wacko reverend fisk whod called for the murder of abortion doctors strickland whod often represented planned parenthood and other prochoice organizations had been impressed with chiltons balanced stance the blogger was also opposed to the desalination plant as was strickland who was meeting with a potential new clientan environmental group interested in hiring him to sue to stop the plant from going forward hed just posted a reply supporting the blogger strickland now headed up the small hill that was the hardest part of his jog the route was downhill from there sweating heart poundingand feeling the exhilaration of the exercise as he crested the hill something caught his eye a splash of red off the jogging path and a flurry of motion near to the ground what was it he wondered he circled back paused his stopwatch and walked slowly through the rocks to where he saw a sprinkling of crimson out of place in the sandy soil dotted with brown and green plants his heart continued to slam in his chest though now out of fear not exertion he thought immediately about travis brigham but the boy was targeting only those whod attacked him online strickland had said nothing about him at all relax still as he detoured along the trail toward the commotion and spots of red strickland pulled his cell phone from his pocket ready to push if there was any threat he squinted looking down as he approached the clearing what was he looking at shit he muttered freezing on the ground were hunks of flesh sitting amid a scattering of rose petals three huge ugly birdsvultures he guessedwere ripping the tissue apart frantic hungry a bloody bone sat nearby too several crows were hopping close cautiously grabbing a bit then retreating strickland squinted leaning forward as he noted something else in the center of the frenzy noa cross had been scraped into the sandy soil he understood that travis brigham was around here somewhere heart trilling the lawyer scanned the bushes and trees and dunes he could be hiding anywhere and suddenly it didnt make any difference that lyndon strickland had never posted anything about the boy as an image of that terrifying mask the boy had left as an emblem of his attack lodged in his mind strickland turned and started to flee back to the path he got a mere ten feet before he heard someone push out of the bushes and begin running fast his way chapter jon boling sat in dances office on her sagging couch the sleeves of his dark blue striped shirt were rolled up and he had two phones going at once as he stared at printouts of chiltons blog he was working to find the physical addresses from the internet data that the hosting service had provided crooking a samsung between ear and shoulder he jotted information and called out got another one sexygurl is kimberly rankin onetwoeight forest pacific grove dance took the details down and phoned to warn the girland her parentsof the danger and to insist bluntly that she stop posting to the report and to tell her friends to stop too hows that chilton boling was studying the computer screen in front of him dance looked over and saw that he was frowning what is it she asked the first posts responding in the roadside crosses thread were mostly local classmates and people around the peninsula now people from all over the countryhell from all over the worldare chiming in theyre really going after himand the highway patrol or the police toofor not following up on the accident and theyre dissing the cbi too us yep somebody reported that a cbi agent went to interview travis at home but didnt detain him how do they even know michael and i were there he gestured at the computer the nature of the beast information spreads people in warsaw buenos aires new zealand dance returned to the crime scene report of the most recent roadside cross on a quiet road in a lightly inhabited part of north monterey no witnesses and little had been found at the scene aside from the same sort of trace discovered at the earlier scenes linking travis to the crime but there was one discovery that might prove helpful soil samples revealed some sand that wasnt generally found in the immediate vicinity of the cross it couldnt however be sourced to a particular location and all the while she reviewed these details she couldnt help but think who is the next victim is travis getting close and what terrible technique is he going to use this time to frighten and to kill he seemed to favor lingering deaths as if in compensation for prolonged suffering hed been through at the hands of the cyberbullies boling said ive got another name he called it out to dance who jotted it down thanks she said smiling you owe me a junior gman badge as boling cocked his head and bent toward his notes once more he said something else softly perhaps it was her imagination but it almost sounded as if hed started to say or maybe dinner but swallowed the words before they fully escaped imagination she decided and turned back to her phone boling sat back thats all of them for now the other posters arent in the area or they have untraceable addresses but if we cant find them travis cant either he stretched and leaned back not your typical day in the world of academia is it dance asked not exactly he cast a wry look her way is this a typical day in the world of law enforcement uhm no its not i guess thats the good news her phone buzzed she noted the internal cbi extension tj boss as had happened on more than one occasion recently the young agents typically irreverent attitude was absent have you heard dances heart gave a bit of a flip when she saw michael oneil at the crime scene hey she said thought id lost you he gave a faint startle reaction to that then said juggling both cases but a crime scenehe nodded toward a fluttering ribbon of police tapehas priority thanks jon boling joined them dance had asked the professor to accompany her shed supposed there were several ways in which he could be helpful mostly she wanted him here to bounce ideas off of since michael oneil shed believed wouldnt be present what happened she asked the senior deputy left a little diorama to scare him a glance up the trail and then chased him down here and shot him it seemed to dance that oneil was going to give more details but pulled back probably because of bolings presence where the deputy pointed the body wasnt visible from here ill show you the initial scene he led them along the jogging path about two hundred yards up a shallow hill they found a short trail that led to a clearing they ducked under yellow tape and saw rose petals on the ground and a cross carved in the sandy dirt there were bits of flesh scattered around and bloodstains too a bone claw marks in the dirt from vultures and crows it seemed oneil said its animal the crime scene people say probably beef storebought my guess is the vic was jogging up the trail back there saw the fuss and then took a look he got spooked and ran travis got him halfway down the hill whats his name lyndon strickland hes a lawyer lives nearby dance squinted wait strickland i think he posted something on the blog boling opened his backpack and pulled out a dozen sheets of paper copies of the blog pages yep but not in roadside crosses he posted a reply about the desalination plant hes supporting chilton he handed her the printout reply to chilton posted by lyndon strickland i have to say youve opened my eyes on this issue had no idea that somebodys ramrodding this through i reviewed the filed proposal at the county planning office and must say that though i am an attorney familiar with environmental issues it was one of the most obfuscatory documents ive ever tried to wade through i think we need considerably more transparency in order to have meaningful debate on this matter dance asked how did travis know hed be here its so deserted boling said these are jogging trails ill bet strickland posted to a bulletin board or blog that he likes running here we give away too much information about ourselves online way too much oneil asked why would the boy kill him boling seemed to be considering something what jon dance asked its just a thought but remember that travis is into those computer games dance explained to oneil about the massively multiplayer online roleplaying games that travis played the professor continued one aspect of the game is growth your character develops and grows your conquests expand you have to do that otherwise you wont succeed following that classic pattern i think travis might be expanding his pool of targets first it was people who directly attacked him now hes included somebody who supports chilton even if he has nothing to do with the roadside crosses thread boling cocked his head looking at the bits of meat and the claw marks in the sandy ground thats an exponential increase in the number of possible victims itll mean dozens more are at risk now ill start checking out the internet addresses of anyone whos posted anything even faintly supportive of chilton more discouraging news were going to examine the body now jon dance said you should head back to the car sure boling looked relieved that he didnt have to participate in this part of the job dance and oneil hiked through the dunes to where the body had been found hows the terrorist thing going the container case the senior deputy gave a wan laugh moving along you get homeland security involved fbi customs its a quagmire whats that line you rise to the level of your own unhappiness sometimes id like to be back in a police interceptor handing out tickets its level of incompetence and no youd hate being back in patrol true he paused hows your mother holding up that question again dance was about to put on a sunny face but then remembered to whom she was speaking she lowered her voice michael she hasnt called me when they found pfister and the second cross i just left the courthouse i didnt even say anything to her shes hurt i know she is you found her a lawyerone of the best on the peninsula and he got her released right yes youve done everything you can dont worry about it shes probably distancing herself from you for the sake of this case maybe eyeing her he laughed again but you dont believe that youre convinced shes mad at you that she thinks youve let her down dance was remembering times in her childhood when at some affront real or imagined the staunch woman would turn cold and distant it was only in partial humor that dances father occasionally referred to his wife as the staff sergeant mothers and daughters oneil mused out loud as if he knew exactly what shed been thinking when they reached the body dance nodded at the men from the coroners office who were setting a green body bag beside the corpse the photographer had just finished up strickland lay on his belly in jogging attire now bloody hed been shot from behind once in the back once in the head and then theres this one of the medics tugged the sweatshirt up revealing an image carved into the mans back a crude approximation of a face which mightve been the mask qetzal the demon from dimensionquest this is probably what oneil was reluctant to mention in front of boling dance shook her head postmortem right any witnesses none an mcso deputy said theres that highway construction site about a half mile from here they heard the shots and called it in but nobody saw anything one of the crime scene officers called didnt find any significant physical evidence sir oneil nodded and together he and dance returned to their cars dance noticed boling was standing beside his audi hands clasped in front of him and his shoulders seemed raised slightly sure signs of tension murder scenes will do that to you she said thanks for coming out here jon this was above and beyond the call of duty but it was helpful to get your thoughts sure he sounded as if he was tyring to be stoic she wondered if hed ever been to a crime scene her phone rang she noticed charles overbys name and number on caller id shed called earlier and told him about this killing now shed have to tell him that the victim hadnt been guilty of cyberbullying but was a true innocent bystander this would throw the area into even more panic charles kathryn youre at the latest scene right it looks like did you catch the boy no but well you can give me the details later somethings come up get here as soon as you can chapter so this is the kathryn dance a big ruddy hand encircled hers holding it until the bucket of propriety had been filled and then releasing odd she noted he hadnt put as much emphasis on the article as youd expect not the kathryn dance more like so this is the agent or this is the chair but she ignored the curious descriptive since kinesic analysis wasnt a priority at the moment the man wasnt a suspect but was as it turned out connected to the cbis boss of bosses resembling a college linebacker gone into politics or business fiftyish hamilton royce worked in the attorney generals office in sacramento he returned to his chairthey were in charles overbys officeand dance too sat royce explained that he was an ombudsman dance glanced at overby itchily squinting toward royce out of deference or curiosity or probably both he didnt offer anything else to flesh out the visitors job descriptionor mission dance was still angry about her bosss carelessness if not malfeasance in suborning robert harpers covert operation in the cbi file room because shes innocent of course your motherd never hurt anyone you know that dance kept her attention on royce we hear good things about you in sacramento i understand your expertise is body language the broadshouldered man with dark sweptback hair was wearing a slick suit its color a blue just the regal side of navy and therefore suggestive of a uniform im just an investigator i tend to use kinesics more than a lot of people ah there she goes charles selling herself short you said shed do that dance offered a cautious smile and wondered what exactly overby had said and how cautious hed been in offering or withholding praise of an employee evidence for job and raise reviews of course her bosss face remained neutral how hard life can be when youre unsure royce continued jovially so you could look me over and tell me what im thinking just because of how i cross my arms where i look whether i blush or not tip to my secrets its a little more complicated than that she said pleasantly ah in fact shed already come up with a tentative personality typing he was a thinking sensing extravert and probably had a machiavellian liars personality accordingly dance was wary well we do hear good things about you that case earlier in the month that crazy man on the peninsula here that was a tough one you nailed the fellow though we caught some lucky breaks no no overby interrupted quickly no breaks no lucky she outthought him and dance realized by saying luck shed suggested a criticism of herself the cbis monterey office and overby and what do you do exactly hamilton she wasnt going for a statusdefining mr not in a situation like this oh jack of all trades a troubleshooter if there are problems involving state agencies the governors office the assembly even the courts i look into it write a report a smile a lot of reports i hope they get read you never know this didnt seem to answer her question she looked at her watch a gesture that royce noticed but that overby did not as shed intended hamilton is here about the chilton case overby said then looked at the man from sacramento to make sure that was all right back to dance brief us he said like a ship captain sure charles dance replied wryly noting both his tone and the fact overby had said the chilton case shed been thinking of the attacks as the roadside cross case or the travis brigham case now she had an inkling as to why royce was here she explained about the murder of lyndon stricklandthe mechanics of the killing and how he figured in the chilton blog royce frowned so hes expanding his possible targets we think so yes evidence sure theres some but nothing specific that leads to where travis is hiding out weve got a joint chp and sheriffs office task force running a manhunt she shook her head theyre not making much progress he doesnt drivehes on a bikeand hes staying underground she looked at royce our consultant thinks hes using evasion techniques he learned in online games to stay out of sight who jon boling a professor from ucsanta cruz hes very helpful and hes volunteering his time no charge to us overby slipped in smoothly as if the words were oiled about this blog royce said slowly how does that figure in exactly dance explained some postings have set the boy off he was cyberbullied so he snapped were doing everything we can to find him overby said he cant be far its a small peninsula royce hadnt given much away but dance could see from his focused eyes he was not only sizing up the travis brigham situation but was neatly folding it into his purpose here which he finally got down to kathryn theres a concern in sacramento about this case i have to tell you everybodys nervous its got teenagers computers social networking now a weapons involved you cant help but think virginia tech and columbine apparently those boys from colorado were his idols rumor i dont know if thats true or not it was posted on the blog by someone who might or might not have known him and from the flutter of eyebrow and twitch of lip she realized she might have just played into his hand with people like hamilton royce you never could be sure if all was straightforward or if you were fencing this blogi was talking to the ag about it were worried that as long as people are posting its like gasoline on the flames you know what i mean like an avalanche well mixing my metaphors but you get the idea what we were thinking wouldnt it be better for the blog to shut down ive actually asked chilton to do that oh you have overby asked the question and what did he say emphatically no freedom of the press royce scoffed its just a blog its not the chronicle or wall street journal he doesnt feel that way dance then asked has anybody from the ags office contacted him no if the request came from sacramento were worried that hed post something about us bringing the subject up and thatd spread to the newspapers and tv repression censorship and those labels might rub off on the governor and some congressmen no we cant do that well he refused dance repeated i was just wondering royce began slowly his gaze keenly strafing dance if there was anything youve found about him something to help persuade him stick or carrot she asked quickly royce couldnt help but laugh savvy people apparently impressed him he doesnt seem like the carrot sort from what youve told me meaning a bribe wouldnt work which dance knew was true having tried one but neither did chilton seem susceptible to threats in fact he seemed like the sort whod relish them and post something in his blog about any that were made besides though she didnt like chilton and thought he was arrogant and selfrighteous using something shed learned in an investigation to intimidate the man into silence didnt sit well in any case dance could honestly answer i havent found a thing james chilton himself is a small part of the case he didnt even post anything about the boyand he deleted traviss name the point of the roadside crosses thread was to criticize the police and highway department it was the readers who started to attack the boy so theres nothing incriminating nothing we can use use odd choice of verb no ah too bad royce did seem disappointed overby noticed too and looked disappointed himself overby said keep on it kathryn her voice was a crawl were working fullout to find the perp charles of course sure but in the whole scope of the case his sentence dwindled what she asked sharply the anger about robert harper was resurfacing watch it she warned herself overby smiled in a way that bore only a loose resemblance to a smile in the whole scope of the case it would be helpful to everybody if chilton could be persuaded to stop the blog helpful to us and to sacramento not to mention saving the lives of people whove posted comments exactly royce said were worried about more victims of course the ag and royce would worry about that but theyd also worry about the bad press against the state for not doing everything to stop the killer to end the meeting and get back to work dance simply agreed if i see anything you can use charles ill let you know royces eyes flickered overby missed the irony completely and smiled good it was then that her phone vibrated with a text message she read the screen and gave a faint gasp and looked up at overby royce asked what is it dance said james chilton was just attacked i have to go chapter dance hurried into emergency admitting at monterey bay hospital she found tj looking troubled in the middle of the lobby boss he said exhaling hard relieved to see her how is he hell be okay did you get travis it wasnt the boy who did it tj said at that moment the double doors to the emergency room swung open and james chilton a bandage on his cheek strode out he attacked me chilton was pointing at a ruddyfaced solidly built man in a suit he sat beside the window a large county deputy stood over him without a greeting chilton pointed to him and snapped to dance arrest him meanwhile the man leapt to his feet him i want him in jail the deputy muttered mr brubaker please sit down he spoke forcefully enough so that the man hesitated delivered a glare to chilton then dropped back into the fiberglass seat the officer then joined dance and told her what had happened a half hour before arnold brubaker had been on the grounds of his proposed desalination plant with a survey crew hed found chilton taking pictures of animal habitats there he tried to grab the bloggers camera and shoved chilton to the ground the surveyors called the police the injury dance assessed didnt seem serious still chilton seemed possessed that man is raping the peninsula hes destroying our natural resources our flora and fauna not to mention destroying an ohlone burial ground the ohlone indians were the first inhabitants of this part of california we arent building anywhere near the tribal land brubaker yelled that was a rumor and completely untrue but the traffic in and out of the area is going to and were spending millions to relocate animal populations and both of you dance snapped quiet chilton however had his momentum going he broke my camera too just like the nazis brubaker replied with a cold smile james i believe you broke the law first by trespassing on private property didnt the nazis do that too i have a right to report on the destruction of our resources and i okay dance snapped no more they fell silent as she got the details of the various offenses from the deputy finally she approached chilton you trespassed on private property thats a crime i shhh and you mr brubaker assaulted mr chilton which is illegal unless youre in imminent danger of physical harm from a trespasser your remedy was to call the police brubaker fumed but he nodded he seemed upset that all hed done was bang chiltons cheek the bandage was quite small the situation is that youre guilty of minor offenses and if you want to complain ill make arrests but itll be both of you one for criminal trespass and one for assault and battery well redfaced brubaker began to whine but he your answers dance asked with an ominous calm that made him shut up immediately chilton nodded with a grimace all right finally with frustration evident in his face brubaker muttered to dance okay fine but its not fair seven days a week for the past year working to help eliminate drought thats been my life and he sits in that office of his and tears me down without even looking at the facts people see what he says in that blog and think its true and how can i compete with that write a blog of my own who has time brubaker delivered a dramatic sigh and headed out the main door after hed gone chilton said to dance hes not building the plant out of the goodness of his heart theres money to be made and thats his only concern and i have researched the story his voice fell silent as she turned to him and he noticed her somber expression james you might not have heard the news lyndon strickland was just murdered by travis brigham chilton remained still for a moment lyndon strickland the lawyer are you sure im afraid so the bloggers eyes were sweeping the floor of the emergency room greenandwhite tile mopped clean but scuffed by years of anxious heels and soles but lyndon posted in the desalination thread not roadside crosses no travis wouldnt have any complaint with him its somebody else lyndond made a lot of people upset he was a plaintiffs lawyer and was always taking on controversial causes the evidence doesnt leave any doubt it was travis but why we think because his post supported you doesnt matter that it was a different blog thread we think travis is expanding his pool of targets chilton greeted this with grim silence then asked just because he posted something agreeing with me she nodded and that leads me to something else ive been worried about that travis might be after you but what argument does he have with me i havent said a word about him she continued hes targeted somebody whos supporting you and the extension of that is that hes angry with you too you really think so i think we cant afford to dismiss it but my familys ive ordered a car stationed outside your house a deputy from the sheriffs office thank youthank you ill tell pat and the boys to be on the lookout for anything odd youre all right she nodded at the bandage its nothing you need a ride home pats coming to pick me up dance started outside oh and for gods sake leave brubaker alone chiltons eyes narrowed but do you know the effects that plant is going to have he fell silent and held up two hands in surrender okay okay ill stay off his property thank you dance walked outside and turned her phone back on it rang thirty seconds later michael oneil she was comforted to see his number pop up hey i just heard a report chilton he was attacked hes fine she explained what had happened trespassing serves him right i called the office theyre getting the crime scene report back from the strickland shooting i pushed em to get it done fast but nothing really helpful jumps out thanks dance then lowered her voiceamusing herself because she did soand told oneil about the curious encounter with hamilton royce great too many cooks screwing up the broth id like to put them in the broth dance muttered and turn up the heat and this royce wants to shut down the blog yep worried about the public relations is my take oneil offered i almost feel sorry for chilton spend ten minutes with him youll feel different the deputy chuckled i was going to call you anyway michael ive asked mom and dad over tonight for dinner she needs the support love it if you could come she added you and anne and the kids a pause ill try im really swamped on this container case and anne went up to san francisco a gallerys going to be hanging a show of her recent photos really thats impressive dance recalled the onesided conversation yesterday about anne oneils impending trip at their attempted breakfast after meeting with ernie seybold dance had several opinions about the woman the most unblemished of which had to do with her talent as a photographer they disconnected and dance continued toward her car unraveling the ipod ear buds she needed a hit of music she was scrolling through tunes trying to decide on latino or celtic when her phone buzzed caller id announced jonathan boling hi she said its all over the cbi here chilton was attacked what happened is he all right she gave him the details he was relieved nobody had been hurt seriously but she could tell from his voice quality that he had some news for her she fell silent and he asked kathryn you near the office i wasnt planning on heading back ive got to pick up the kids and work from home for a while she didnt tell him that she wanted to avoid hamilton royce and overby why couple things ive got names of posters whove supported chilton the good news i suppose is that there arent a lot but thats typical in blogs more people are contrarians than supporters email me the list and ill start calling them from home what else well have traviss computer cracked in the next hour or so really oh thats great tiffany or bambi was a pretty good hacker apparently im going to mirror his disk on a separate drive i thought youd want to see it you bet dance had a thought you have plans tonight no ive put my cat burglary plans on hold while im helping you guys bring the computer over to my house im having my mother and father and a few friends over for dinner well sure she gave him the address and a time they disconnected as dance stood beside her car in the hospital parking lot she noticed several aides and nurses leaving for the day they were staring at her dance knew several of them and smiled one or two nodded in greeting but the response was tepid if not chill of course she realized theyd be thinking im looking at the daughter of a woman who might have committed murder chapter ill carry the groceries maggie announced as dances pathfinder squealed to a stop in front of their house the girl had been feeling independent lately she grabbed the largest bag there were four of them after picking up the children at martines theyd stopped at safeway for a shopping frenzy if everyone shed invited showed up the dinner party would include nearly a dozen people among them youngsters with serious appetites listing under the weight of two bags gripped in one handan olderbrother thingwes asked his mother whens grandma coming over in a little while i hope theres a chance she might not come no she said shes coming dance gave a confused smile you talked to her yeah she called me at camp me too maggie offered so shed called to reassure the children she was all right but dances face flushed why hadnt she called her well its great shell be able to make it they carried the bags inside dance went into her bedroom accompanied by patsy she glanced at the gun lockbox travis was expanding his targets and he knew she was one of the officers pursuing him and she couldnt forget the possible threatthe crossin her backyard last night dance decided to keep the weapon with her everfastidious about weapons in a household with children though she locked the black gun away for a few minutes to take a shower she stripped off her clothes energetically and stepped into the stream of hot watertrying unsuccessfully to flush away the residue of the day she dressed in jeans and an oversize blouse not tucked in to obscure the weapon which sat against the small of her back uncomfortable yet a comfort then she hurried into the kitchen she fed the dogs and put out a small brushfire between the children who were sniping over their predinner tasks dance stayed patientshe knew they were upset about the incident at the hospital yesterday maggies job was to unpack the groceries while wes straightened up for guests dance continued to be amazed at how cluttered a house could become even though only three people lived there she thought now as she often did about the time when the population was four and glanced at her wedding picture bill swenson prematurely gray lean and with an easy smile looked out at the camera with his arm around her then she went into the den booted up her computer and emailed overby about the assault on chilton and the confrontation with brubaker she wasnt in the mood to talk to him then dance retrieved jon bolings email with the names of people whod posted comments favorable to chilton over the past months seventeen could be worse she supposed she spent the next hour finding the numbers of those within a hundred miles and calling to warn them they might be in danger she weathered their criticism some of it searing about the cbi and the police not being able to stop travis brigham dance logged on to that days chilton report httpwwwthechiltonreportcom she scrolled through all the threads noting that new posts had appeared in nearly all of them the latest contributors to the reverend fisk and the desalination threads were taking their respective causes seriouslyand with intensifying anger but none of their posts compared to the vicious comments in the roadside crosses thread most of them unleashing undiluted fury at each other as much as at travis some of them were curiously worded some seemed to be probing for information some seemed to be outright threats she got the feeling that there were clues as to where travis was hidingpossibly even tidbits of facts that might suggest whom he was going to attack next was travis actually one of the posters hiding behind a fake identity or the common pseudonym anonymous she read the exchanges carefully and decided that perhaps there were clues but the answer eluded her kathryn dance comfortable with analyzing the spoken word could come to no solid conclusions as she read the frustratingly silent shouts and mutters finally she logged off an email from michael oneil arrived he gave her the discouraging news that the immunity hearing in the j doe case had been pushed back to friday the prosecutor ernie seybold felt that the judges willingness to go along with the defenses request for the extension was a bad sign she grimaced at the news and was disappointed that he hadnt called to give her the news over the phone neither had he mentioned anything about whether he and the children would come over tonight dance began to organize the meal she didnt have much skill in the kitchen as she was the first to admit but she knew which stores had the most talented preparedfood departments the meal would be fine listening to the soft braying of a video game from wess room maggies keyboard scales dance found herself staring into the backyard recalling the image of her mothers face yesterday afternoon as her daughter deserted her to see about the second roadside cross your mother will understand no she wont hovering over the containers of brisket green beans caesar salad salmon and twicebaked potatoes dance remembered that time three weeks agoher mother standing in this very kitchen and reporting about juan millar in the icu with edies face feeling his pain shed told her daughter what hed whispered to her kill me the doorbell now drew her from that disquieting thought she deduced who had arrivedmost friends and family just climbed the back deck stairs and entered the kitchen without ringing or knocking she opened the front door to see jon boling standing on the porch he wore that nowfamiliar comfortable smile and was juggling a small shopping bag and a large laptop case hed changed into black jeans and a dark striped collared shirt hi he nodded and followed her into the kitchen the dogs bounded up boling crouched and hugged them as they doubleteamed him okay guys outside dance commanded she flung milk bones out the back door and the dogs charged down the steps and into the backyard boling stood wiped his face from the licks and laughed he reached into the shopping bag i decided to bring sugar for a hostess gift sugar two versions fermented he extracted a bottle of caymus conundrum white wine nice and baked a bag of cookies emerged i remembered the way you looked at them in the office when your assistant was trying to fatten me up caught that did you dance laughed youd be a good kinesic interviewer we have to be observant his eyes were excited she could see got something to show you can we sit down somewhere she directed him into the living room where boling unpacked yet another laptop a big one a brand she didnt recognize irv did it he announced irv irving wepler the associate i was telling you about one of my grad students so not bambi or tiff everything on traviss laptop is in here now he began typing in an instant the screen came to life dance didnt know computers could respond so quickly from the other room maggie hit a sour note on the keyboard sorry dance winced c sharp boling said without looking up from the screen dance was surprised you a musician no no but i have perfect pitch just a fluke and i dont know what to do with it no musical talent whatsoever not like you me she hadnt told him her avocation a shrug thought it might not be a bad idea to check you out i didnt expect you to have more google hits as a songcatcher than a cop oh can i say cop so far its not a politically incorrect term dance went on to explain that she was a failed folksinger but had found musical redemption in the project that she and martine christensen operateda website called american tunes the name echoing paul simons evocative anthem to the country from the s the site was a lifesaver for dance who often had to dwell in some very dark places because of her work there was nothing like music to pull her safely out of the minds of the criminals she pursued although the common term was songcatcher dance told him the job description was technically folklorist alan lomax was the most famoushed roam the hinterland of america collecting traditional music for the library of congress in the midtwentieth century dance too traveled around the country when she could to collect music though not lomaxs mountain blues and bluegrass todays homegrown american songs were african afropop cajun latino caribbean nova scotian east indian and asian american tunes helped the musicians copyright their original material offered the music for sale via download and distributed to them the money listeners paid boling seemed interested he too it seemed trekked into the wilderness once or twice a month hed been a serious rock climber at one time he explained but had given that up gravity he said is nonnegotiable then he nodded toward the bedroom that was the source of the music son or daughter daughter the only strings my sons familiar with come on a tennis racket shes good thank you dance said with some pride she had worked hard to encourage maggie she practiced with the girl and more timeconsuming chauffeured her to and from piano lessons and recitals boling typed and a colorful page popped up on the laptops screen but then his body language changed suddenly she noticed he was looking over her shoulder toward the doorway dance should have guessed shed heard the keyboard fall silent thirty seconds before then boling was smiling hi im jon i work with your mom wearing a backward baseball cap maggie was standing in the doorway hello hats in the house dance reminded off it came maggie walked right up to boling im maggie nothing shy about my girl dance reflected as the tenyearold pumped his hand good grip the professor told her and good touch on the keyboard the girl beamed you play anything cds and downloads thats it dance looked up and wasnt surprised to see twelveyearold wes appear too looking their way he was hanging back in the doorway and he wasnt smiling her stomach did a flip after his fathers death wes could be counted on to take a dislike to the men that his mom saw sociallysensing them her therapist said as a threat to their family and to his fathers memory the only man he really liked was michael oneilin part because the doctor theorized the deputy was married and thus no risk the boys attitude was hard for dance whod been a widow for two years and at times felt a terrible longing for a romantic companion she wanted to date she wanted to meet somebody and knew it would be good for the children but whenever she went out wes became sullen and moody shed spent hours reassuring him that he and his sister came first she planned out tactics to ease the boy comfortably into meeting her dates and sometimes simply laid down the law and told him she wouldnt tolerate any attitude nothing had worked very well and it didnt help that his hostility toward her most recent potential partner had turned out to be far more insightful than her own judgment she resolved after that to listen to what her children had to say and watch how they reacted she motioned him over he joined them this is mr boling hi wes hi they shook hands wes a bit shy as always dance was about to add quickly that she knew boling through work to reassure wes and defuse any potential awkwardness but before she could say anything wess eyes flashed as he gazed at the computer screen sweet dq she regarded the splashy graphics of the dimensionquest computer game homepage which boling had apparently extracted from traviss computer are you guys playing the boy seemed astonished no no i just wanted to show your mother something you know morpegs wes like definitely wes dance murmured i mean sure she doesnt like me to say like smiling boling asked you play dq i dont know it so well naw its kind of wizardy you know im more into trinity oh man boling said with some boyish and genuine reverence in his voice the graphics kick butt he turned to dance and said its sf but that wasnt much of an explanation what mom science fiction scifi no no you cant say that its sf eyes rolling broadly ceilingward i stand corrected wess face scrunched up but with trinity you definitely need two gig of ram and at least two on your video card otherwise its like he winced otherwise its so slow i mean youve got your beams ready to shootand the screen hangs its the worst ram on the desktop i hacked together at work boling asked coyly three wes asked five and four on the video card wes mimicked a brief faint nooooo that is sooo sweet how much storage two t no way two tera bytes dance laughed feeling huge relief that there wasnt any tension between them but she said wes ive never seen you play trinity we dont have it loaded on our computer here do we she was very restrictive about what the children played on their computers and the websites they visited but she couldnt oversee them percent of the time no you dont let me he said without any added meaning or resentment i play at martines with the twins dance was shocked the children of martine christensen and steven cahill were younger than wes and maggie wes laughed mom exasperated no with steve hes got all the patches and codes that made sense steve who described himself as a green geek ran the technical side of american tunes is it violent dance asked boling not wes the professor and the boy shared a conspiratorial look well she persisted not really wes said what does that mean exactly asked the law enforcement agent okay you can sort of blow up spaceships and planets boling said wes added but not like violentviolent you know right the professor assured her nothing like resident evil or manhunt or gears of war wes added i mean there you can chainsaw people what dance was appalled have you ever played it no he protested right on the edge of credibility billy sojack at school has it he told us about it make sure you dont all right i wont anyway the boy added with another glance at boling you dont have to use a chain saw i never want you to play that game or the others that mr boling mentioned she said this in her best mother voice okay geez mom promise yeah the look at boling said she just gets this way sometimes the two males then launched into a discussion of other games and technical issues whose meaning dance couldnt even guess at but she was happy to see this boling of course was no romantic interest but it was such a relief that she didnt have to worry about conflicts especially tonightthe evening would be stressful enough boling didnt talk down to the boy nor did he try to impress him they seemed like peers of different ages having fun talking feeling neglected maggie barged in with mr boling do you have kids mags dance interjected dont ask personal questions when youve just met somebody thats all right no i dont maggie she nodded taking in the information the issue dance understood wasnt about possible playmates she was really inquiring about his marital status the girl was ready to marry off her mother faster than maryellen kresbach from the office provided maggie was best womanno retro maid of honor for dances independent daughter it was then that voices sounded from the kitchen edie and stuart had arrived they walked inside and joined dance and the children grams maggie called and charged toward her how are you edies face blossomed into a genuine smileor nearly so dance assessed wes his face glowing with relief too ran to her as well though stingy with hugs for mom lately the boy wrapped his arms around his grandmother and squeezed tight of the two children hed taken the arrest incident at the hospital closer to heart katie stuart said chasing down crazed felons and you still had time to cook well somebody had time to cook she replied with a smile and a glance at the safeway shopping bags hiding near the trash can ecstatic to see her mother dance embraced her how are you fine dear dear not a good sign but she was here at least thats what counted edie turned back to the children and was enthusiastically telling them about a tv show shed just seen on extreme home makeovers dances mother was brilliant at dispensing comfort and rather than talk directly about what happened at the hospitalwhich would only trouble them moreshe reassured the kids by saying nothing about the incident and chatting away about inconsequential things dance introduced her parents to jon boling im a hired gun he said kathryn made the mistake of asking my advice and shes stuck with me now they talked about where in santa cruz he lived how long hed been in the area and the colleges hed taught at boling was interested to learn that stuart still worked parttime at the famous monterey bay aquarium the professor went often and had just taken his niece and nephew there i did some teaching too stuart dance offered when he learned bolings career i was pretty comfortable in academia id done a lot of research into sharks boling laughed hard wine was dispensedbolings conundrum white blend first but then boling mustve sensed a wind shift and he excused himself to head back to the computer i dont get to eat unless i finish my homework ill see you in a bit why dont you go out back dance told him pointing to the deck ill join you in a minute after hed collected the computer and wandered outside edie said nice young man very helpful thanks to him we saved one of the victims dance stepped to the refrigerator to put the wine away as she did emotion took the reins and she blurted softly to her mother im sorry i had to leave the courtroom so fast mom they found another roadside cross there was a witness i had to interview her mothers voice revealed no trace of sarcasm when she said thats all right katie im sure it was important and that poor man today lyndon strickland the lawyer he was well known yes he was dance noted the shift of subject sued the state i think consumer advocate mom whatve you heard from sheedy edie dance blinked not tonight katie we wont talk about it tonight sure dance felt like a chastised child whatever you want will michael be here hes going to try annes in san francisco so hes juggling kids and working on another big case oh well hope he can make it and how is anne edie asked coolly she believed that oneils wifes mothering skills left a lot to be desired and any failures there were a classa misdemeanor to edie dance bordering on felony fine i imagine havent seen her for a while dance wondered again if in fact michael would show up you talked to betsey she asked her mother yes shes coming up this weekend she can stay with me if its not inconvenient edie offered why would it be inconvenient her mother replied you might be busy with this case of yours thats your priority now katie you go visit with your friend maggie and ill get things started mags come on and help me in the kitchen yea grandma and stu brought a dvd he thinks wes would like sports bloopers you boys go put that on her husband took the cue and wandered to the flatscreen tv calling wes over dance stood helplessly for a moment hands at her sides watching her mother retreat as she chatted happily with her granddaughter then dance stepped outside she found boling at an unsteady table on the deck near the back door under an amber light he was looking around this is pretty nice i call it the deck she laughed capital d it was here that kathryn dance spent much of her timeby herself and with the children dogs and those connected to her through blood or through friendship the gray pressuretreated structure twenty by thirty feet and eight feet above the backyard extended along the back of the house it was filled with unsteady lawn chairs loungers and tables illumination came from tiny christmas lights wall lamps some amber globes a sink tables and a large refrigerator sat on the uneven planks anemic plants in chipped pots bird feeders and weathered metal and ceramic hangings from the garden departments of chain stores made up the eclectic decorations dance would often come home to find colleagues from the cbi or mcso or highway patrol sitting on the deck enjoying beverages from the battered fridge it didnt matter if she was home or not provided the rules were observed never disrupt the kids studying or the familys sleep keep the crudeness down and stay out of the house itself unless invited dance loved the deck which was a site for breakfasts dinner parties and more formal occasions shed been married here and shed hosted the memorial service for her husband on the gray warped timbers dance now sat on the wicker love seat beside boling who was hunched forward over the large laptop he looked around and said ive got a deck too but if we were talking constellations yoursd be deck major mined be deck minor she laughed boling nodded at the computer there was very little i found about the local area or traviss friends much less than youd normally see in a teens computer the real world doesnt figure much in traviss life he spends most of his time in the synth on websites and blogs and bulletin boards and of course playing his morpegs dance was disappointed all the effort to hack into the computer and it wasnt going to be as helpful as shed hoped and as for his time in the synth world most of that is in dimensionquest he nodded at the screen i did some research its the biggest online roleplaying game in the world there are about twelve million subscribers to that one bigger than the population of new york city boling described it as a combination of lord of the rings star wars and second lifethe social interaction site where you create imaginary lives for yourself as near as i can tell he was on dq between four and ten hours a day a day oh thats typical for a morpeg player he chuckled some are even worse theres a dimensionquest twelvestep program in the real world to help people get over their addiction to the game seriously oh yes he sat forward now theres nothing in his computer about places hed go or his friends but ive found something that might be helpful whats that him who well travis himself chapter dance blinked waiting for a punch line but jon boling was serious you found him where in aetheria the fictional land in dimensionquest hes online not now but he has been recently can you find out where he is in real life from that theres no way of knowing we cant trace him i called the gaming companytheyre in englandand talked to some executives dimensionquests servers are in india and at any given moment there are a million people online and since we have his computer that means hes using a friends dance said or hes at a public terminal or hes borrowed or stolen a computer and is logging on through a wifi spot but whenever hes online we know hes standing still and we have a chance to find him in theory yes boling agreed why is he still playing he must know were looking for him like i was saying hes addicted a nod at the computer are you sure its travis has to be i got into his folders in the game and found a list of avatars hes created to represent himself then i had a few of my students go online and look for those names hes been logging on and off today the characters name is strykerwith a y hes in the category of thunderer which makes him a warrior a killer basically one of my studentsa girl whos played dimensionquest for a few yearsfound him about an hour ago he was roaming around the countryside just killing people she watched him slaughter a whole family men women and children and then he corpse camped whats that in these games when you kill another character they lose power points and whatever theyre carrying with them but theyre not permanently dead avatars come to life again after a few minutes but theyre in a weakened state until they can start to regain power corpse camping is when you kill a victim and just wait nearby for them to come back to life then you kill them again when they have no defenses its very bad form and most players dont do it its like killing a wounded soldier on the battlefield but travis apparently does it regularly dance stared at the homepage of dimensionquest an elaborate graphic of foggy glens towering mountains fantastical cities turbulent oceans and mythical creatures warriors heroes wizards villains too including qetzal the spiky demon with the sewnshut mouth wide eyes chillingly staring at her a bit of that nightmare world had coalesced here on earth smack within her jurisdiction boling tapped his cell phone on his belt irvs monitoring the game he wrote a botan automated computer programthatll tell him when strykers online hell call or im me the instant travis logs on dance glanced into the kitchen and saw her mother staring out the window her palms were clenched now what i was thinking boling continued tracing is out but if we can find him online and watch him maybe we can learn something about him where he is who he knows how watching his instant messages thats how players communicate in dq but theres nothing we can do until he logs on again he sat back they sipped wine in silence which was suddenly broken as wes called mom from the doorway dance jumped and found herself easing away from boling as she turned toward her son when do we eat as soon as martine and steve get here the boy retreated to the tv and dance and boling walked inside carting wine and the computer the professor replaced the unit in his bag and then snagged a bowl of pretzels from the island in the kitchen he headed into the living room and offered the bowl to wes and stu emergency rations to keep our strength up yea the boy cried grabbing a handful then said grandpa go back to that fumble so mr boling can see it dance helped her mother and daughter finish setting out the food buffet style on the island in the kitchen she and edie talked about the weather about the dogs about the children about stuart which led to the aquarium which led to a water referendum which led to a half dozen other trivial subjects all of which had one thing in common they were as far away from the subject of the arrest of edie dance as could be she watched wes jon boling and her father sitting together in the living room with the sports show on the screen they all laughed hard when a receiver crashed into a gatorade tank and drenched a cameraman and were digging into the pretzels and dip as if dinner were an empty promise dance had to smile at the homey comforting scene then she glanced down at her cell phone disappointed that michael oneil hadnt called as she was setting the table on the deck the other guests arrived martine christensen and her husband steven cahill climbed the stairs their nineyearold twin boys in tow delighting wes and maggie they also brought with them a longhaired tawny puppy a briard named raye the couple greeted edie dance warmly avoiding any mention of the cases either the roadside cross attacks or the one involving edie hey girlfriend longhaired martine said to dance winking and passed her a dangerouslooking homemade chocolate cake dance and martine had been best friends ever since the woman had decided to singlehandedly wrest dance from the addictive lethargy of widowhood and force her back into life as if moving from the synth world back to the real dance now reflected she hugged steven who promptly vanished into the den to join the menfolk his birkenstocks flapping in time to his long ponytail the adults had wine while the children held an impromptu dog show in the backyard raye had apparently been doing his homework and was literally running circles around patsy and dylan doing tricks and leaping over benches martine said he was a star in his obedience and agility classes maggie appeared and said she wanted to take their dogs to school too well see dance told her soon candles were lit sweaters distributed and everybody was sitting around the table food steaming in the false autumn of a monterey evening conversation was whirling as fast as the wine flowed wes was whispering jokes to the twins who giggled not because of the punch lines but because an older boy was spending time whispering jokes to them edie was laughing at something martine said and for the first time in two days kathryn dance felt the gloom fade travis brigham hamilton royce james chiltonand the dark knightrobert harperslipped from the forefront of her thoughts and she began to think that life might eventually right itself jon boling turned out to be quite social and fit right in though he hadnt known a single soul there before today he and steven the computer programmer had much to talk about though wes kept injecting himself into the conversation everyone studiously avoided talking about edies problem which meant that current affairs and politics took center stage dance was amused to note that the first subjects to come up were ones chilton had written about the desalination plant and the new highway to salinas steve martine and edie were adamantly opposed to the plant i suppose dance said but weve all lived here for a long time a glance at her parents arent you tired of the droughts martine said she doubted the water produced by the desalination plant would benefit them itll be sold to rich cities in arizona and nevada somebodyll make billions and we wont see a drop after that they debated the highway the group was divided on this as well dance said itd come in handy for the cbi and sheriffs office if were running cases in the fields north of salinas but that costoverrun issue is a problem what overrun stuart asked dance was surprised to see everyone looking at her blankly she explained what shed learned by reading the chilton report that the blogger had uncovered some possible malfeasance i hadnt heard about that martine said i was so busy reading about the roadside crosses that i didnt pay much attention but im sure going to look into it now ill tell you she was the most political of dances friends ill check out the blog after dinner dance asked maggie to bring out her keyboard for a brief concert the group retired to the living room more wine was passed around boling lounged back in a deep armchair joined by raye the briard martine laughedraye was a bit bigger than a lapdogbut the professor insisted the puppy stay maggie plugged in and with the gravity of a recital pianist sat down and played four songs from her suzuki book three simple arrangements of pieces by mozart beethoven and clementi she hardly missed a note everyone applauded and then went for cake coffee and more wine finally around steve and martine said they wanted to get the twins to bed and they headed out the door with the children maggie was already making plans to enter dylan and patsy in rayes dog classes edie gave a distant smile we should go too its been a long day mom stay for a while have another glass of wine no no im exhausted katie come on stu i want to go home dance received a distracted embrace from her mother and her comfort from earlier diminished call me later disappointed at their quick retreat she watched the taillights disappear up the road then she told the children to say good night to boling the professor smiled and shook their hands and dance sent them off to wash up wes appeared a few minutes later with a dvd ghost in the shell a japanese anime science fiction tale involving computers here mr boling this is pretty sweet you can borrow it if you want dance was astonished that her son was behaving so well with a man probably he recognized boling as a business associate of his mothers not a love interest still hed been known to grow defensive even around her coworkers well thanks wes ive written about anime but ive never seen this one really nope ill bring it back in good shape whenever night the boy hurried back to his room leaving the two of them together but only for a moment a second later maggie appeared with a gift of her own this is my recital she handed him a cd in a jewel box the one you were talking about at dinner boling asked where mr stone burped during the mozart yeah can i borrow it you can have it i have about a million of them mom made them well thanks maggie ill burn it on my ipod the girl actually blushed unusual for her she charged off you dont have to dance whispered oh no i will shes a great girl he slipped the disk into his computer bag and looked over the anime that wes had lent him dance lowered her voice again how many times have you seen it he chuckled ghost in the shell twenty thirty timesalong with the two sequels damn you can even spot the white lies appreciate your doing that it means a lot to him i could tell he was excited im surprised you dont have children you seem to understand them no that never worked out but if you want children it definitely helps to have a woman in your life im one of those men you have to be careful of dont you say that all you girls careful of whys that never date a man over forty whos never been married i think nowadays whatever works works i just never met anybody i wanted to settle down with dance noted the flicker of an eyebrow and a faint fluctuation of pitch she let those observations float away boling began youre his eyes dipped to her left hand where a gray pearl ring encircled the heart finger im a widow dance said oh gosh im sorry car crash she said feeling only a hint of the familiar sorrow terrible and kathryn dance said nothing more about her husband and the accident for no reason other than she preferred not to talk about them any longer so youre a real bachelor hmm i guess i am now theres a word you havent heard forabout a century she went to the kitchen to retrieve more wine instinctively grabbing a redsince that was michael oneils favoritethen remembered that boling liked white she filled their glasses halfway up they chatted about life on the peninsulahis mountainbiking trips and hikes his professional life was far too sedentary for him so boling would often jump into his old pickup truck and head out to the mountains or a state park ill do some biking this weekend itll be some sanity in an island of madness he then told her more about the family gettogether hed mentioned earlier napa right his brow wrinkled in a cute and charming way my family ishow do i put this a family hit the nail on the head he said laughing two parents healthy two siblings i get along with a majority of the time though i like their children better assorted uncles and aunts itll be fine lot of wine lot of food sunsetsbut not a lot of those thank goodness two tops thats sort of the way weekends work again a silence fell between them comfortable dance felt no rush to fill it but the peace was broken just then as bolings cell phone hiccuped he looked at the screen immediately his body language had shifted to high alert travis is online lets go chapter under bolings keystrokes the dimensionquest homepage loaded almost instantly the screen dissolved and a welcome box appeared below it was apparently the rating of the game by an organization referred to as ersb teen blood suggestive themes alcohol violence then with his selfassured typing jon boling took them to aetheria it was an odd experience avatarssome fantastical creatures some humanwandered around a clearing in a forest of massive trees their names were in balloons above the characters most of them were fighting but some just walked ran or rode horses or other creatures some flew on their own dance was surprised to see that everyone moved nimbly and that the facial expressions were true to life the graphics were astonishing nearly movie quality which made the combat and its vicious excessive bloodletting all the more harrowing dance found herself sitting forward knee bobbinga classic indication of stress she gasped when one warrior beheaded another right in front of them there are real people guiding them one or two are npcthosere nonplayer characters that the game itself creates but nearly all of the others are avatars of people who could be anywhere cape town mexico new york russia the majority of the players are men but therere a lot of women too and the average age isnt as young as youd think teenage to late twenties mostly but plenty of older players they could be boys or girls or middleaged men black white disabled athletes lawyers dishwashers in the synth world you can be whoever you want to be in front of them another warrior easily killed his opponent blood spurted in a geyser boling grunted theyre not all equal though survival depends on who practices the most and who has the most powerpower you earn by fighting and killing its a vicious cycle literally dance tapped the screen and pointed to the back of a woman avatar in the foreground thats you one of my students avatars im logging in through her account the name above her was greenleaf there he is boling said his shoulder brushing hers as he leaned forward he was pointing at traviss avatar stryker who was about a hundred feet away from greenleaf stryker was a tough muscular man dance couldnt help but notice that while many other characters had beards or ruddy leathery skin traviss avatar was unblemished and his skin as smooth as a babys she thought of the boys concerns about acne you can be whoever you want to be strykera thunderer she recalledwas clearly the dominant warrior here people would look his way and turn and leave several people engaged himonce two at the same time he easily killed them both one time he stunned a huge avatar a troll or similar beast with a ray then as it lay shaking on the ground travis directed his avatar to plunge a knife into its chest dance gasped stryker bent down and seemed to reach inside the body whats he doing looting the corpse boling noted dances furrowed brow and added everyone does it you have to the bodies might have something valuable and if youve defeated them youve earned the right if these were the values that travis had learned in the synth world it was a wonder he hadnt snapped sooner she couldnt help but wonder and where was the boy now in the real world at a starbucks wifi location with the hood over his head and sunglasses on so he wouldnt be recognized ten miles from here one mile he wasnt at the game shed she knew that after learning that he spent time there dance had ordered surveillance on the place as she watched traviss avatar engage and easily kill dozens of creatureswomen and men and animalsshe found herself instinctively drawing on her skills as a kinesics expert she knew of course that computer software was controlling the boys movement and posture yet she was already seeing that his avatar moved with more grace and fluidity than most in combat he didnt flail away randomly as some of the characters did he took his time he withdrew a bit and then struck when his opponents were disoriented several fast blows or stabs laterand the character was dead he stayed alert always looking around him this was a clue perhaps to the boys strategy of life planning the attacks out carefully learning all he could about his victims attacking fast analyzing the body language of a computer avatar she reflected what an odd case this was i want to talk to him to travis i mean to stryker right get closer boling hesitated i dont know the navigation commands very well but i think i can walk all right go ahead using the keypad boling maneuvered greenleaf closer to where stryker was hunched over the body of the creature hed just killed looting it as soon as she was within attack distance stryker sensed dances avatars approach and leapt up his sword in one hand an elaborate shield in the other strykers eyes gazed out of the screen eyes dark as the demon qetzals how do i send a message boling clicked on a button at the bottom of the screen and a box opened just like any instant message now type your message and hit return remember use abbreviations and leetspeak if you can the easiest thing to do is just substitute the number three for e and four for a dance took a deep breath her hands were shaking as she stared at the animated face of the killer stryker u r gd the words appeared in a balloon over greenleafs head as the avatar approached who r u stryker stood back gripping a sword im just some lusr boling told her not bad but forget grammar and punctuation no caps no periods question marks are okay dance continued saw u fight u r elt her breath was coming fast tension rose within her excellent boling whispered what is your realm whats he mean dance asked feeling a sprinkle of panic i think hes asking for your country or the guild youre in thered be hundreds of them i dont know any in this game tell him youre a newbie he spelled it thats somebody new to a game but who wants to learn just newbie play for fun thought u could tch there was a pause u mean u r sum nb whats that dance asked newbies just a beginner a nb is a loser somebody whos egotistical and incompetent its an insult travis has been called a nb a lot online lol him but say youre not your really want to learn from him lol but no dd i wnt to learn r u hot dance asked boling is he coming on to me i dont know its an odd question under the circumstances sorta people tell me u board funny shit hes catching on that theres a delay in your keyboarding hes suspicious change the subject back to him like really wnt to learn what can u tch me a pause then thing dance typed whats that another hesitation then words appeared in the balloon traviss avatar die and though dance felt an instinct to slam an arrow key or slide the touchpad to lift an arm and protect herself there was no time traviss avatar moved in fast he swung his sword again and again striking her in the upper lefthand corner of the screen a box popped up showing two figures solid white the headings stryker was above the one on the left and greenleaf on the right no she whispered as travis slashed away the white filling the greenleaf outline began to empty boling said thats your life force bleeding out fight back you have a sword there he tapped the screen put the cursor on it and left click with the mouse filled with unreasonable but feverish panic she began clicking stryker easily deflected her avatars wild blows as greenleafs power slipped away on the gauge the avatar dropped to her knees soon the sword fell to the ground she was on her back arms and legs splayed helpless dance felt as vulnerable as she ever had in real life you dont have much power left boling said theres nothing you can do the gauge was nearly drained stryker stopped hacking at greenleafs body he moved closer and looked into the computer monitor who r u came the words popping up in the instant message i am greenleaf y did u kill me who r u boling said all caps hes shouting hes mad pleez dances hands were shaking and her chest was constricted it was as if these werent bits of electronic data but real people shed plunged wholly into the synth world travis then directed stryker to step forward and drive his sword into greenleafs abdomen blood spurted and the gauge in the upper lefthand corner was replaced with a message you are dead oh dance cried her sweaty hands quivered and her breath stuttered in and out over her dry lips traviss avatar stared at the screen chillingly then turned and began to run into the forest without a pause he swiped his sword across the neck of an avatar whose back was turned and lopped off the creatures head he then vanished he didnt wait to loot the corpse hes escaping he wants to get away fast he thinks somethings up boling moved closer to dancenow it was their legs that brushed i want to see something he began to type another box appeared it said stryker is not online dance felt a painful chill rattling through her ice along her spine sitting back her shoulder against jon bolings she was thinking if travis had logged off maybe hed left the location where hed been online and where was he going into hiding or was he intent on continuing his hunt in the real world lying in bed the hour closing in on midnight two sounds confused the wind stroking the trees outside her bedroom window and surf on rocks a mile away at asilomar and along the road to lovers point beside her she felt warmth against her leg and exhaled breath soft in sleep tickled her neck she was unable to join in the bliss of unconsciousness however kathryn dance was as awake as if it were noon in her mind a series of thoughts spun past one would rise to the top for a time then roll on like on wheel of fortune the subject the clicker settled on most frequently was travis brigham of course in her years of being a crime reporter and a jury consultant and a law enforcement agent dance had come to believe that the tendency toward evil could be found in the geneslike daniel pell the cult leader and killer shed pursued recentlyor could be acquired j doe in los angeles for instance whose murderous inclinations had come later in life dance wondered where travis fell on the spectrum he was a troubled dangerous young man but he was also someone else a teenager yearning to be normalto have clear skin to have a popular girl like him was it inevitable from birth that hed slip into this life of rage or had he begun like any other boy yet been so battered by circumstancehis abusive father troubled brother gawky physique solitary nature bad complexionthat his anger couldnt burn away as it did in most of us like midmorning fog for a long thick moment pity and loathing were balanced within her then she saw traviss avatar staring her down and lifting his sword like really wnt to learn what can u tch me die next to her the warm body shifted slightly and she wondered if she was giving off minuscule tensions that disturbed sleep she was trying to remain motionless but that as a kinesics expert she knew was impossible asleep or waking if our brain functioned our bodies moved the wheel spun on her mother and the euthanasia case now paused at the top though shed asked edie to call when they got back to the inn she hadnt this hurt but didnt surprise dance then the wheel spun again and the j doe case in los angeles paused at the apogee what would come of the immunity hearing would it be delayed again and the ultimate outcome ernie seybold was good but was he good enough dance honestly didnt know this musing in turn led to thoughts of michael oneil she understood there were reasons that he hadnt been able to be here tonight but his not calling that was unusual the other case dance laughed at the jealousy she occasionally tried to picture herself and oneil together had he not been married to svelte and exotic anne on the one hand it was too easy theyd spent days together on cases and the hours moved by seamlessly the conversation flowed the humor yet they also disagreed sometimes to the point of anger but she believed their passionate disagreements only added to what they had together whatever that was her thoughts wheeled on unstoppable click click click at least until they stopped at professor jonathan boling and beside her the soft breathing became a soft rattle okay thats it dance said rolling onto her other side patsy the flatcoat retriever stopped snoring as she awoke and lifted her head off the pillow on the floor dance commanded the dog stood assessed that no food or ball playing figured in the deal and leapt off the bed to join her companion dylan on the shabby rug they used as a futon leaving dance once more alone in bed jon boling she reflected then decided perhaps it was better not to spend much time on him not just yet in any case at that moment her musings vanished as the mobile phone by the bed sitting next to her weapon trilled instantly she flipped the light on shoved her glasses on her nose and laughed seeing the caller id jon she said kathryn boling said im sorry to call so late its okay i wasnt asleep whats up stryker no but theres something you have to see the blogthe chilton report you better go online now in her sweats the dogs nearby dance was sitting in the living room all the lights off though moonlight and a shaft of streetlight painted iridescent swatches of bluewhite on the pine floor her glock pressed against her spine the heavy gun tugging down the limp elastic waistband of her sweats the computer finished its interminable loading of the software okay he said look over the latest posting of the blog he gave her the url httpwwwthechiltonreportcomhtmljuneupdatehtml she blinked in surprise what bolling told her travis hacked the report how the professor gave a cold laugh hes a teenager thats how dance shivered as she read travis had posted a message over the beginning of the june blog to the left was a crude drawing of the creature qetzal from dimensionquest around the eerie face its lips sewn shut and bloody were cryptic numbers and words beside it was a text posting in large bold letters it was even more troubling than the picture half english half leetspeak i will own u alli win u failu r dadvry of upostd by travisdq she didnt need a translator for this one below this was another picture the awkward color rendering showed a teenage girl or woman lying on her back mouth open in a scream as a hand plunged a sword into her chest blood spurted skyward that pictureits disgusting jon after a pause kathryn he said in a soft voice do you notice anything about it as she studied the awkward drawing dance gave a gasp the victim had brownish hair pulled back in a ponytail and was wearing a white blouse and black skirt on her belt was a darkened area on the hip which could have been a weapon holster the outfit was similar to what dance had been wearing when shed met travis yesterday its me she whispered to boling the professor said nothing was the picture old maybe a fantasy about the death of a girl or woman whod slighted travis somehow in the past or had he drawn it today despite the fact he was on the run from the police dance had a chilling image of the boy hovering over the paper with pencil and crayon creating this crude depiction of a synth world death he hoped to make real the wind is a persistent aspect of the monterey peninsula usually bracing sometimes weak or tentative but never absent day and night it churns the bluegray ocean which false to its name is never calm one of the windiest places for miles around is china cove at the south end of point lobos state park the chill steady breath from the ocean numbs the skin of hikers and picnics are a dicey proposition if paper plates and cups figure as the dishware seabirds here labor even to stay in place if they aim into the breeze now nearly midnight the wind is fickle surging and vanishing and at its strongest it kicks up towering gray spumes of seawater it rustles the scrub oak it bends the pine it flattens the grasses but one thing thats immune to the wind tonight is a small artifact on the seaside shoulder of highway its a cross about two feet high and made of black branches in the middle is a torn cardboard disk with tomorrows date penned in blue sitting at the base weighted down by stones is a bouquet of red roses at times petals fly off and skitter across the highway but the cross itself doesnt flutter or bend clearly it was driven deep into the sandy dirt by the roadside with powerful blows its creator adamant that it remain upright and visible for all to see thursday chapter kathryn dance tj scanlon and jon boling were in her office the time was am and theyd been there for close to two hours chilton had removed traviss threat and the two pictures from the thread but boling had downloaded them and made copies u r dad vry of u and the pictures too jon boling said it might be possible to trace the posting a grimace but only if chilton cooperates is there anything in the picture of qetzalthose numbers and codes and words anything that might help boling said that they were mostly about the game and had probably been made a long time ago in any case even the puzzlemaster could find no clues in the weird notations the others in the room scrupulously avoided commenting that the second picture of the stabbing bore a resemblance to dance herself she was about to phone the blogger when she got a call barking a laugh as she looked at caller id she picked up yes mr chilton boling looked at her with an ironic gaze i dont know if you saw we did your blog got hacked the server had good security the boys got to be smart a pause then the blogger continued i wanted to let you know we tried to trace the hack hes using a proxy site somewhere in scandinavia ive called some friends over there and theyre pretty certain they know what the company is i have the name and their address phone number too its outside of stockholm will they cooperate chilton said proxy services rarely do unless theres a warrant thats why people use them of course an international warrant would be a nightmare procedurally and dance had never known one to be served earlier than two or three weeks after it was issued sometimes the foreign authorities ignored them altogether but it was something give me the information ill try chilton did i appreciate your doing this and theres something else whats that are you in the blog now i can be read what i just posted a few minutes ago she logged on httpwwwthechiltonreportcomhtmljunehtml first was an apology to the readers surprising dance with its humility then came an open letter to travis brigham this is a personal plea travis now that your name is public i hope you wont mind my using it my job is to report the news to ask questions not to get involved in the stories i report on but i have to get involved now please travis theres been enough trouble dont make it worse for yourself its not too late to put an end to this terrible situation think of your family think of your future pleasecall the police give yourself up there are people who want to help you dance said thats brilliant james travis might even contact you about surrendering and ive frozen the thread nobody else can post to it he was silent for a moment that pictureit was terrible welcome to the real world chilton she thanked him and they hung up she scrolled to the end of the roadside crosses thread and read the most recentand apparently lastposts although some seemed to have been posted from overseas she once again couldnt help wondering if they contained clues that might help her find travis or anticipate his next moves but she could draw no conclusions from the cryptic postings dance logged off and told tj and boling about what chilton had written boling wasnt sure it would have much effectthe boy in his assessment was past reasoning with but well hope dance doled out assignments tj retreated to his chair at the coffee table to contact the scandinavian proxy and boling to his corner to check out the names of possible victims from a new batch of internet addressesincluding those whod posted to threads other than roadside crosses hed identified thirteen more charles overby in a politicians blue suit and white shirt stepped into dances office his greeting kathrynsay kathryn whats this about the kid posting threats right charles were trying to find out where he hacked in from six reporters have already called me and a couple of them got my home phone number ive put them off but i cant wait anymore im holding a press conference in twenty minutes what can i tell them that the investigation is continuing were getting some manpower help from san benito for the search thereve been sightings but nothings panned out hamilton called me too hes pretty upset sacramentos hamilton royce of the tooblue suit the quick eyes and the ruddy complexion agent in charge overby had had a rather eventful morning it seemed anything more chiltons stopped the posts on the thread and asked travis to surrender anything tech i mean well hes helping us trace the boys uploads good so were doing something he meant something the viewers of primetime tv would appreciate as opposed to the sweaty unstylish police work theyd been engaged in the last fortyeight hours dance caught bolings eye which said he too was taken aback by the comment they looked away from each other immediately before a shared look of shock bloomed overby glanced at his watch all right my turn in the barrel he wandered off to the press conference does he know what that expression means boling asked her about the barrel i dont know myself tj gave a chortling laugh but said nothing he smiled at boling who said its a joke i wont repeat it involves horny sailors out to sea for a long time thanks for not sharing dance dropped into her desk chair sipped the coffee that had materialized and what the hell went for half of the doughnut that also had appeared as a gift from the gods has traviswell strykerbeen back online she called to jon boling nope havent heard from irv but hell be sure to let us know i dont think hes ever slept hes got red bull in his veins dance picked up the phone and called peter bennington at mcso forensics for the latest information on the evidence the gist was that while there was by now plenty of evidence to get a murder conviction against travis there were no leads as to where he might be hiding out except those traces of soil theyd found earliera location different from that where the cross had been left david reinhold that eager young deputy from the sheriffs office had taken it on himself to collect samples from around traviss house the dirt didnt match sandy soilso helpful dance reflected cynically in an area that boasted more than fifteen miles of the most beautiful beaches and dunes in the state despite his ability to report that the cbi was doing something techie charles overby got tboned at the press conference the tv in dances office was on and they were able to watch the crash live dances briefing to overby had been accurate except for one small detail albeit one she hadnt known agent overby a reporter asked what are you doing to protect the community in light of the new cross deer in the headlights uhoh tj whispered shocked dance looked from him to boling then back to the screen the reporter continued that shed heard a report a half hour earlier on a radio scanner carmel police had found another cross with todays date june near china cove on highway overby sputtered in response i was briefed just before coming here by the agent in charge of the case and she apparently wasnt aware of it there were two senior women agents in the monterey office of the cbi it would be easy to find out who the she in question was oh you son of a bitch charles she heard another reporter ask agent overby what do you say to the fact that the town the whole peninsulas in a panic thereve been reports of homeowners shooting at innocent people who happen to walk into their yards a pause well thats not good oh brother dance shut the tv off she called the mcso and learned that yes another cross with todays date had been found near china cove a bouquet of red roses too crime scene was collecting the evidence and searching the area there were no witnesses agent dance the deputy added after she hung up dance turned to tj what do the swedes tell us tj had phoned the proxy service company and left two urgent messages they had not returned his call yet despite it being a business day in stockholm and only past lunchtime five minutes later overby stormed into the office another cross another cross what the hell happened i just found out about it myself charles how the hell did they hear the press scanners contacts the way they always find out what were doing overby rubbed his tanned forehead skin flakes drifted well where are we with it michaels people are running the scene if theres evidence theyll let us know if theres evidence hes a teenager charles not a pro hes going to leave some clues thatll lead us to where hes hiding sooner or later but if he left a cross that means hes also going to try to kill somebody today were contacting as many people as we can find who might be at risk and the computer tracing whats going on there tj said the companys not calling us back weve got legal putting together a foreign warrant request the head of the office grimaced thats just great wheres the proxy sweden theyre better than the bulgarians overby said but itll be a month before they even get around to responding send the request to cover our asses but dont waste time on it yes sir overby stormed off fishing his mobile out of his pocket dance snagged her own phone and called rey carraneo and albert stemple into her office when they arrived she announced im tired of being on the defensive here i want to pick the top five or six potential victimsthe ones whove posted the most vicious attacks on travis and the posters whore the most supportive of chilton were going to get them out of the area and then set up surveillance at their houses or apartments hes got a new victim in mind and when he shows up i want him to get one big goddamn surprise lets get on it chapter hows he holding up lily hawken asked her husband donald james hes not saying much but its got to be tough on him patrizia too im sure they were in the den of their new house in monterey unpacking unpacking unpacking the petite blonde stood in the middle of the room feet apart slightly looking down at two plastic bags of drapes what do you think hawken was a bit overwhelmed at the moment and couldnt care less about window treatments but his wife of nine months and three days had taken on much of the burden of the move from san diego and so he set down the tools he was using to assemble the coffee table and looked from the red to the rust and back again the ones on the left remaining ready to retreat at a moments notice if that was the wrong answer but it was apparently correct thats where i was leaning she said and the police have a guard at his house they think the boy is going to attack him hawken resumed assembling the table ikea damn they have some pretty clever designers he doesnt think so but you know jim even if he did hes not the sort to head for the hills then he reflected that lily didnt really know james chilton at all she hadnt even met him yet it was only through what hed told her that she had an understanding of his friend just as he knew about many aspects of her life from conversation and hint and deduction such was life under these circumstancessecond marriages for both of them he coming out of mourning lily recovering from a tough divorce theyd met through friends and had started dating wary at first theyd realized almost simultaneously how starved for intimacy and affection they were hawken a man who hadnt believed that he would ever get married again proposed after six monthson the gritty rooftop beach bar of the w hotel in downtown san diego because he couldnt wait to plot out a more suitable setting lily though had described the event as the most romantic thing she could think of the large diamond ring on a white ribbon slipped over the neck of her anchor steam bottle helped and here they were starting a new life back in monterey donald hawken assessed his situation and decided that he was happy boyishly happy friends had told him that a second marriage after losing a spouse was different as a widower he would have changed fundamentally he wouldnt be capable of that adolescent feeling permeating every cell of his being thered be companionship thered be moments of passion but the relationship would essentially be a friendship wrong it was adolescent and more hed had an intense consuming marriage to sarah who was sultry and beautiful and a woman one could be intensely in love with as hawken had been but his love for lily was just as strong and okay hed finally gotten to the point where he could admit that the sex was better with lilyin the sense that it was far more comfortable in bed sarah had been well formidable to put it mildly hawken now nearly smiled at some memories he wondered how lily would feel about jim and pat chilton hawken had told her how theyd been such close friends the couples getting together frequently attending their kids school and sports events parties barbecueshed noticed lilys smile shift slightly when hed told her about this past but hed reassured her that in a way jim chilton was a stranger to him too hawken had been so depressed after sarahs death that hed lost contact with nearly all his friends but now he was returning to life he and lily would finish getting the house ready and then collect the children who were staying with their grandparents in encinitas and his life would settle back into the pleasant routine on the peninsula he remembered from years before hed reconnect with his best friend jim chilton rejoin the country club see all his friends again yes this was the right move but a cloud had appeared small temporary he was sure but a blemish nonetheless by coming to the place that had been his and sarahs home it was as if hed resurrected a part of her the memories popped like fireworks here in monterey sarah being the thoughtful hostess the passionate art collector the shrewd businesswoman here sarah being the sultry energetic and consuming lover here sarah intrepidly donning a wetsuit and swimming in the harsh ocean climbing out chilled and exhilaratedunlike her last swim near la jolla not climbing out of the water at all but wafting into the shore limp eyes open and unseeing her skin matching the water temperature degree for degree at this thought hawkens heart now added an extra beat or two then he took several deep breaths and slipped the memories away want a hand he glanced at lily and the drapes his wife paused then set down her work she approached took his hand and put it on the v of skin below her throat she kissed him hard they smiled at each other and his wife returned to the windows hawken finished the glassandchrome table and dragged it in front of the couch honey the tape measure was drooping in lilys hand and she was looking out the back window what i think somebodys out there where in the backyard i dont know if its our property its on the other side of the hedge then its definitely somebody elses yard your dollar doesnt buy you much dirt here on the central coast of california hes just standing there looking at the house probably wondering if a rockandroll band or druggies are moving in she climbed down a step just standing there she repeated i dont know honey its a little spooky hawken walked to the window and looked out from this perspective he couldnt see much but it was clear that a figure was peering through the bushes he wore a gray sweatshirt with the hood pulled up maybe the neighbors kid theyre always curious about people moving in wondering if we have kids their age i was lily wasnt saying anything he could sense her discomfort as she stood with her narrow hips cocked frowning eyes framed by blond hair flecked with movingcartoncardboard dust time for the chivalry part hawken walked into the kitchen and pulled open the back door the visitor was gone he stepped out farther then heard his wife call honey alarmed hawken turned and sped back inside lily still on the ladder was pointing out another window the visitor had moved into the side yarddefinitely on their property now though still obscured by plantings damnit who the hell is he he glanced at the phone but decided not to call what if it was the neighbor or the neighbors son that would pretty much ruin any chance for a friendship forever when he looked back the figure was gone lily climbed off the ladder where is he he just vanished fast no idea they gazed out the windows scanning no sign of him this was far spookier not being able to see him i think we should hawkens voice stopped with a gasp as lily cried a gunhes got a gun don she was staring out a front window her husband grabbed his phone calling to his wife the door lock it lily lunged but she was too late the door was already swinging wide lily screamed and don hawken pulled her to the floor beneath him in a noble but he understood useless gesture to save the life of his bride chapter ours of opera sitting in kathryn dances office alone now jonathan boling was cruising through travis brighams computer in a frantic pursuit of the meaning of the code ours of opera he was sitting forward typing fast thinking that if dance had been here the kinesics expert within her could have drawn some fast conclusions from his posture and the focus of his eyes he was a dog scenting prey jon boling was on to something dance and the others were out at the moment setting up surveillance boling had remained in her office to prowl through the boys computer hed found a clue and was now trying to locate more data that would let him crack the code ours of opera what did it mean a curious aspect of computers is that these crazy plastic and metal boxes contain ghosts a computer hard drive is like a network of secret passages and corridors leading farther and farther into the architecture of computer memory its possiblewith considerable difficultyto exorcise these hallways and rid them of the ghosts of data past but usually most bits of information weve created or acquired remain forever invisible and fragmented boling was now wandering these hallways using a program one of his students had hacked together reading the scraps of data lodged in obscure places like the wisps of souls inhabiting a haunted house thinking of ghosts put him in mind of the dvd kathryn dances son had lent him last night ghost in the shell he reflected on the nice time hed had at her house how much hed enjoyed meeting her friends and family the children especially maggie was adorable and funny and would he knew without a doubt become a woman every bit as formidable as her mother wes was more laidback he was easy to talk to and brilliant boling often speculated about what his own children would have been like if hed settled down with cassie he thought of her now hoped she was enjoying her life in china recalled the weeks prior to her leaving and withdrew his generous wishes about contentment in asia then boling put thoughts of cassandra aside and concentrated on his ghost hunt in the computer he was getting close to something important in that shred of binary code that translated into the english letters ours of opera bolings puzzleloving mind which could often be counted on to come up with curious leaps of logic and insight automatically concluded that those words were fragments of hours of operation travis had looked at that phrase online just before hed vanished the implication of this was that perhaps just perhaps these words referred to a location the boy was interested in but computers dont store related data in the same place the code for ours of opera might be found in a spooky closet in the basement while the name of whatever they referred to could be in a hallway in the attic part of the physical address in one place the rest in another the brain of a computer is constantly making decisions about breaking up the data and storing bits and pieces in places that make sense to it but are incomprehensible to a layperson and so boling was following the trail strolling through the dark corridors filled with spooks he didnt think hed been this engaged in a project for months maybe years jonathan boling enjoyed university work he was curious by nature and he liked the challenge of research and writing the stimulating conversations with fellow faculty members and with his students getting young people excited about learning seeing the eyes of a student intensify suddenly when random facts coalesced into understanding was pure pleasure to him but at the moment those satisfactions and victories seemed minor now he was on a mission to save lives and nothing else mattered to him but unlocking the code ours of opera he looked at another storeroom in the haunted house nothing but jumbled bits and bytes another false lead more typing nothing boling stretched and a joint popped loudly come on travis why were you interested in this place what appealed to you about it and do you still go there does a friend work there do you buy something from its shelves display cases aisles ten more minutes give up no way then he strolled into a new part of the haunted house he blinked and gave a laugh like joining pieces of a jigsaw puzzle the answer to the code ours of opera materialized as he gazed at the name of the place its relationship to travis brigham was ridiculously obvious the professor was angry at himself for not deducing it even without the digital clue looking up the address he pulled his phone off his belt and called kathryn dance it rang four times and went to voice mail he was about to leave a message but then he looked at his notes the place wasnt far from where he was right now no more than fifteen minutes he flipped the phone shut with a soft snap and stood pulled on his jacket with an involuntary glance at the picture of dance and her children dogs front and center he stepped out of her office and headed for the front door of the cbi aware that what he was about to do was possibly a very bad idea jon boling left the synth world to continue his quest in the real its clear rey carraneo told kathryn dance as he returned to the living room where she stood over donald and lily hawken dances pistol was in her hand as she was looking vigilantly out the windows and into the rooms of the small house the couple shaken and unsmiling sat on a new couch the factory plastic wrap still covering it dance replaced her glock she hadnt expected the boy to be insidehed been hiding in the side yard and had appeared to flee when the police arrivedbut traviss expertise at the game of dimensionquest his skill at combat made her wonder if the teenager had somehow seemed to escape but had actually slipped inside the door opened and massive albert stemple stuck his head in nup hes gone the man was wheezingboth from the pursuit and from the residual effects of the gas at kelley morgans house got the deputy lookin up and down the streets and we got a half dozen more cars on the way somebody saw somebody in a hooded sweatshirt on a bicycle heading through the alleys making for downtown i called it in but he shrugged then the bulky agent vanished and his boots clomped down the steps as he went to join in the manhunt dance carraneo stemple and the mcso deputy had arrived ten minutes ago as theyd been meeting with likely targets an idea had occurred to dance she thought about jon bolings theory that expanding his targets travis might include people merely mentioned favorably in the blog even if they hadnt posted dance had gone to the site once again and read through the blogs homepage httpwwwthechiltonreportcom one name that stood out was donald hawken an old friend of james chiltons who was mentioned in the on the home front section hawken might be the victim for whom travis had left the cross on the windswept stretch of highway so theyd driven to the mans house their purpose to get hawken and his wife out of danger and set up surveillance at the house but upon arriving dance had seen a figure in a hood possibly holding a gun lurking in the bushes to the side of the ranch shed sent albert stemple and the mcso deputy after the intruder and rey carraneo with dance behind him barged into the house guns drawn to protect hawken and his wife they were still badly shaken theyd assumed carraneo was the killer when the plainclothes agent had burst through the door his weapon high dances motorola crackled and she answered it was stemple again im in the backyard got a cross carved into this patch of dirt and rose petals scattered around it roger that al lily closed her eyes lowered her head to her husbands shoulder four or five minutes dance was thinking if wed gotten here just that much later the couple would be dead why us hawken asked we didnt do anything to him we didnt post we dont even know him dance explained about the boys expanding his targets you mean anybody even mentioned in the blogs at risk seems that way dozens of police had descended on the area within minutes but the calls coming in made clear that travis was nowhere to be found how the hell does a kid on a bicycle get away dance thought frustrated he just vanishes where somebodys basement an abandoned construction site outside the first of the press cars were beginning to arrive the vans with the dishes atop the cameramen prodding their equipment to life about to stoke the panic in town that much hotter more police showed up too including several bicycle patrol officers dance now asked hawken you still have your house in the san diego area lily replied its on the market hasnt sold yet id like you to go back there well he said theres no furniture its in storage you have people you can stay with my parents donalds children are staying with them now then go back there until we find travis i guess we could lily said you go hawken said to her im not leaving jim theres nothing you can do to help him dance said there sure is i can give him moral support this is a terrible time he needs friends dance continued im sure he appreciates your loyalty but look at what just happened that boy knows where you live and he obviously wants to hurt you you might catch him in a half hour we might not i really have to insist mr hawken the man showed a bit of businessmans steel i wont leave him then the edge left his voice as he added i have to explain something the smallest of glances at his wife a pause then my first wife sarah died a couple of years ago im sorry the dismissive shrug that dance knew oh so well jim dropped everything he was at my door within the hour he stayed by me and the children for a week helped us and sarahs family with everything food the funeral arrangements he even took turns with the housework and laundry i was paralyzed i just couldnt do anything i think he mightve saved my life back then he certainly saved my sanity again dance couldnt suppress the memories of the months after her own spouses deathwhen martine christensen much like chilton had been there for her dance would never have hurt herself not with the children but there were plenty of times when yes she thought she might go mad she understood donald hawkens loyalty im not leaving the man repeated firmly theres no point in asking then he hugged his wife but you go back i want you to leave without a moments hesitation lily said no im staying with you dance noted the look adoration contentment resolveher own heart flipped as she thought he lost his first spouse recovered and found love again it can happen dance thought see then she closed the door on her own life all right she agreed reluctantly but youre leaving here right now find a hotel and stay there stay out of sight and were going to put a guard on you thats fine it was then that a car screeched to a stop in front of the house a voice shouting in alarm she and carraneo stepped out onto the porch sokay albert stemple said his voice a lazy drawl minus the southern accent only chilton the blogger had apparently heard the news and hurried over he raced up the steps what happened dance was surprised to hear panic in his voice shed detected anger pettiness arrogance earlier but never this sound are they all right fine she said travis was here but donalds fine his wife too what happened the collar of the bloggers jacket was askew hawken and lily stepped outside jim chilton ran forward and embraced his friend are you all right yes yes the police got here in time did you catch him chilton asked no dance said expecting chilton to launch into criticism for their not capturing the boy but he took her hand firmly and gripped it thank you thank you you saved them thank you she nodded awkwardly and released his hand then chilton turned to lily with a smile of curiosity dance deduced that theyd never met before not in person hawken introduced them now and chilton gave lily a warm embrace im so sorry about this i never not in a million years thought it would affect you who would have hawken asked with a rueful smile chilton said to his friend with an introduction to the monterey peninsula like this shes not going to want to stay shes going to move back tomorrow lily finally cracked a fragile smile i would except weve already bought the drapes a nod at the house chilton laughed shes funny don why doesnt she stay and you go back to san diego afraid youre stuck with both of us chilton then grew serious you have to leave until this is over dance said ive been trying to talk them into that were not leaving don chilton began but hawken laughed nodding at dance i have police permission she agreed were going to hide out in a hotel like bonnie and clyde but no buts buddy were here you cant get rid of us now chilton opened his mouth to object but then noted lilys wry grin she said you dont want to be telling this girl what to do jim the blogger gave another laugh and said fair enough thank you get to a hotel stay there in a day or two thisll all be over with thingsll get back to normal hawken said i havent seen pat and the boys since i left over three years dance eyed the blogger something else about him was different her impression was that she was seeing for the first time his human side as if this neartragedy had pulled him yet further from the synth world into the real the crusader was at least temporarily absent she left them to their reminiscences and walked around back a voice from the bushes startled her hello she looked behind her to see the young deputy whod been helping them out david reinhold deputy he grinned call me david i heard he was here you almost nailed him close not close enough he was carrying several battered metal suitcases stenciled with mcsocsu on the side sorry i couldnt tell anything for certain about those branches in your backyardthat cross i couldnt tell either probably it was just a fluke if i trimmed the trees like i should it never wouldve happened his bright eyes glanced her way you have a nice house thanks despite the messy backyard no its real comfortablelooking she asked the deputy and how bout you david you live in monterey i did had a roommate but he left so i had to move to marina well appreciate your efforts ill put in a good word with michael oneil really kathryn thatd be great he glowed reinhold turned away and began cordoning off the backyard dance stared at what was in the center of the yellow tape trapezoid the cross etched into the dirt and the sprinkling of petals from there her eyes rose and took in the sweeping decline from the heights of monterey down to the bay where a sliver of water could be seen it was a panoramic view beautiful but today it seemed as disturbing as the terrible mask of qetzal the demon in dimensionquest youre out there somewhere travis where where chapter playing cop tracking down travis the way jack bauer chased terrorists jon boling had a lead the possible location from which travis had sent the blog posting of the mask drawing and the horrific stabbing of the woman who looked a bit like kathryn dance the place where the boy would be playing his precious dimensionquest the hours of operation hed found in the ghostly corridors of traviss computer referred to lighthouse arcade a video and computer gaming center in new monterey the boy would be taking a risk going out in public of course considering the manhunt but if he picked his routes carefully wore sunglasses and a cap and something other than the hoodie the tv reports were depicting him in well he could probably move around with some freedom besides when it came to online gaming and morpegs an addict had no choice but to risk detection boling piloted his audi off the highway and onto del monte then lighthouse and headed into the neighborhood where the arcade was located he was enjoying a certain exhilaration here he was a fortyoneyearold professor who lived largely by his brain hed never thought of himself as suffering from an absence of bravery hed done some rock climbing scuba diving downhill skiing then too the world of ideas carried risk of harmto careers and reputations and contentment hed battled it out with fellow professors he also had been a victim of vicious online attacks much like those against travis though with better spelling grammar and punctuation most recently hed been attacked for taking a stand against file sharing of copyrighted material he hadnt expected the viciousness of the attacks he was trouncedcalled a fucking capitalist a bitch whore of big business boling particularly liked professor of mass destruction some colleagues actually stopped talking to him but the harm hed experienced of course was nothing compared with what kathryn dance and her fellow officers risked day after day and which he himself was now risking he reflected playing cop boling realized that hed been helpful to kathryn and the others he was pleased about that and pleased at their recognition of his contribution but being so close to the action hearing the phone calls watching kathryns face as she took down information about the crimes seeing her hand absently stroke the black gun on her hiphe felt a longing to participate and anything else jon he wryly asked himself well okay maybe he was trying to impress her absurd but hed felt a bit of jealousy seeing her and michael oneil connect youre acting like a goddamn teenager still something about her lit the fuse boling had never been able to explain itwho could reallywhen that connection occurred and it happened fast or never dance was single he was too hed gotten over cassie okay pretty much over was kathryn getting close to dating again he believed hed gotten a few signals from her but what did he know he had none of her skillbody language more to the point he was a man a species genetically fitted with persistent oblivion boling now parked his gray a near lighthouse arcade on a side street in that netherworld north of pacific grove he remembered when this strip of small businesses and smaller apartments dubbed new monterey had been a minihaight ashbury tucked between a brawling army town and a religious retreat pacific groves lovers point was named for lovers of jesus not one another now the area was as bland as a strip mall in omaha or seattle the lighthouse arcade was dim and shabby and smelled well gamya pun he couldnt wait to share with her he surveyed the surreal place the playersmost of them boyssat at terminals staring at the screens teasing joysticks and pounding on keyboards the playing stations had high curving walls covered with black sounddampening material and the chairs were comfortable highbacked leather models everything a young man would need for a digital experience was here in addition to the computers and keyboards there were noisecancelling headsets microphones touch pads input devices like car steering wheels and airplane yokes threed glasses and banks of sockets for power usb firewire audiovisual and more obscure connections some had wii devices boling had written about the latest trend in gaming total immersion pods which had originated in japan where kids would sit for hours and hours in a dark private space completely sealed off from the real world to play computer games this was a logical development in a country known for hikikomori or withdrawal an increasingly common lifestyle in which young people boys and men mostly became recluses never leaving their rooms for months or years at a time living exclusively through their computers the noise was disorienting a cacophony of digitally generated soundsexplosions gunshots animal cries eerie shrieks and laughsand an ocean of indistinguishable human voices speaking into microphones to fellow gamers somewhere in the world responses rattled from speakers occasionally cries and expletives would issue hoarsely from the throats of desperate players as they died or realized a tactical mistake the lighthouse arcade typical of thousands around the globe represented the last outpost of the real world before you plunged into the synth boling felt a vibration on his hip he looked down at his mobile the message from irv his grad student read stryker logged on five minutes ago in dq as if hed been slapped boling looked around was travis here because of the enclosures it was impossible to see more than one or two stations at a time at the counter a longhaired clerk sat oblivious to the noise he was reading a science fiction novel boling approached im looking for a kid a teenager the clerk lifted an ironic eyebrow im looking for a tree in a forest yeah hes playing dimensionquest did you sign somebody in about five minutes ago theres no signin you use with tokens you can buy em here or from a machine the clerk was looking boling over carefully you his father no just want to find him i can look over the servers find out if anybodys logged onto dq now you could yeah great but the kid wasnt making any moves to check the servers he was just staring at boling through a frame of unclean hair ah got it were negotiating sweet very privateeyeish boling thought a moment later two twenties vanished into the pocket of the kids unwashed jeans his avatars name is stryker if that helps boling told him a grunt be back in a minute he vanished onto the floor boling saw him emerge on the far side of the room and walk toward the back office five minutes later he returned somebody named stryker yeah hes playing dq just logged on station fortythree its over there thanks uh the clerk went back to his sf novel boling thinking frantically what should he do have the clerk evacuate the arcade no then travis would catch on he should just call but he better see if the boy was alone would he have his gun with him he had a fantasy of walking past casually ripping the gun from the boys belt and covering him till the police arrived no dont do that under any circumstances palms sweating boling slowly walked toward station he took a fast look around the corner the computer had the aetherian landscape on the screen but the chair was empty nobody was in the aisles though station was empty but at a girl with short green hair was playing a martial arts game boling walked up to her excuse me the girl was delivering crippling blows to an opponent finally the creature fell over dead and her avatar climbed on top of the body and pulled its head off like yeah she didnt glance up the boy who was just here playing dq where is he like i dont know jimmy walked past and said something and he left a minute ago whos jimmy you know the clerk goddamn i just paid forty dollars to that shit to tip off travis some cop i am boling glared at the clerk who remained conspicuously lost in his novel the professor slammed through the exit door and sprinted outside his eyes accustomed to the darkness stung he paused in the alleyway squinting left and right then caught a glimpse of a young man walking quickly away head down dont do anything stupid he told himself he pulled his blackberry from its holster ahead of him the boy broke into a run after exactly one second of debate jon boling did too chapter hamilton royce the ombudsman from the attorney generals office in sacramento disconnected the phone it drooped in his hand as he reflected on the conversation hed just hada conversation conducted in the language known as political and corporate euphemism he lingered in the halls of the cbi considering options finally he returned to charles overbys office the agentincharge was sitting back in his chair watching a press report about the case streaming on his computer how the police had come close to catching the killer at the house of a friend of the bloggers but had missed him and hed escaped possibly to terrorize more people on the monterey peninsula royce reflected that simply reporting that the police had saved the friend didnt have quite the staytunedorelse veneer of the approach the network had chosen to take overby typed and a different station came up the special report anchor apparently preferred travis to be the video game killer rather than defining him by masks or roadside crosses he went on to describe how the boy tormented his victims before he killed them never mind that only one person had died or that the bastard got shot in the back of the head fleeing which would tend to minimize the torment finally he said well charles theyre getting more concerned the ag he lifted his phone like he was showing a shield during a bust were all pretty concerned overby echoed the whole peninsulas concerned its really our priority now like i was saying his face was cloudy but is sacramento having a problem with how were handling the case not per se royce let this nonresponse buzz around overbys head like a strident hornet were doing everything we can i like that agent of yours dance oh shes topnotch nothing gets by her a leisurely nod a thoughtful nod the ag feels bad about those victims i feel bad about them royce poured sympathy into his voice and tried to recall the last time he really felt bad probably when he missed his daughters emergency appendectomy because he was in bed with his mistress a tragedy i know im sounding like a broken record but i really do feel that that blog is the problem it is overby agreed its the eye of the hurricane which is calm and frames a beautiful blue sky royce corrected silently the cbi chief offered well kathryn did get chilton to post a plea for the boy to come in and he gave us some details about the servera proxy in scandinavia i understand its justas long as that blogs up its a reminder that the job isnt getting done meaning by you i keep coming back to that question about something helpful to us something about chilton kathryn said shed keep an eye peeled shes busy i wonder if theres something in what shes already found i dont really want to deflect agent dance from the case i wonder if i should take a gander you you wouldnt mind would you charles if i just took a peek at the files i could bring perspective my impression actually is that kathryns maybe too kind too kind you were sharp charles to hire her the agent in charge accepted this compliment though royce knew kathryn dance had predated overbys presence in the cbi here by four years he continued clever you saw she was an antidote to the cynicism of old roosters like you and me but the price of that is a certainnaïveté you think shes got something on chilton and doesnt know it could be overby was looking tense well ill apologize for her put it down to distraction why dont we her mothers case not focusing up to par shes doing the best she can hamilton royce was known for his ruthlessness but he would never have sold out a loyal member of his team with a comment like that he reflected that it was almost impressive to see the top three darker qualities of human nature displayed so boldly cowardice pettiness and betrayal is she in let me find out overby made a call and spoke to someone who royce deduced was dances assistant he hung up shes still at the crime scene at the hawken house so then ill just have a looksee but then royce seemed to have a thought of course probably better if i werent disturbed heres an idea ill call her assistant back ask her to do something run an errand there are always reports needing to get copied or i know get her input about workload and hours it would make sense for me to take her pulse im that kind of boss shed never suspect anythings out of the ordinary royce left overbys office walked down corridors whose routes hed memorized and paused near dances he waited in the hallway until he saw that the assistantan efficientlooking woman named maryellentook a call then with a perplexed frown she stood and headed up the corridor leaving hamilton royce free to plunder when he got to the end of the alley jon boling paused and looked to the right down a side street in the direction that travis had disappeared from here the ground descended toward monterey bay and was filled with small singlefamily bungalows beige and tan apartment buildings and abundant groundcover though lighthouse avenue behind him was ripe with traffic the side road was empty thick fog had come up and the scenery was gray well now that the kid had gotten away he thought kathryn dance wasnt likely to be very impressed with his detection work he called and reported that hed seen travis brigham and gave his location the dispatcher reported that a police car would be at the arcade in five minutes okay that was enough of the adolescent behavior he told himself his skill was academia teaching intellectual analysis the world of ideas not action he turned around to head back to the arcade to meet the police car but then a thought occurred to him that this quest of his maybe wasnt so out of character after all maybe it was less a case of silly masculine preening than an acknowledgment of a legitimate aspect of his nature answering questions unraveling mysteries solving puzzles exactly what jonathan boling had always done understanding society the human heart and mind one more block what could it hurt the police were on their way maybe hed find somebody on the street whod noticed the boy get into a car or climb through a window of a nearby house the professor turned back and started down the gray gritty alley toward the water he wondered when hed see kathryn again soon he hoped it was in fact the image of her green eyes that was prominently in his mind when the boy leapt out from behind the dumpster three feet away and got boling in a neck lock smelling unwashed clothing and adolescent sweat he choked as the silver blade of the knife began its leisurely transit to his throat chapter speaking on her phone kathryn dance sped up to the front of james chiltons house in carmel parking she said thanks again to the caller and hung up she parked and walked up to the monterey county sheriffs office car in which a deputy sat on guard detail she approached him hey miguel agent dance how you doing everythings quiet here good mr chiltons back isnt he yes do me a favor you bet get out of the car and just stand here maybe lean against the door so people can get a good look at you something going down im not sure just stay there for a bit whatever happens dont move he seemed uncertain but climbed out of the car dance now walked up to the front door and pushed the buzzer the musician within her detected the slightly flat tone of the final chime chilton opened the door and blinked to see dance is everything okay then after a glance over her shoulder dance pulled her handcuffs out of their holster chilton glanced down what he gasped turn around and put your hands behind your back what is this now just do it this is she took him by the shoulder and turned him around he started to speak but she simply said shh and ratcheted on the cuffs youre under arrest for criminal trespass on private property what whose arnold brubakers landthe site of the desalination plant wait you mean yesterday right you let me go you werent arrested then now you are she recited the miranda warning a dark sedan sped up the street turned and ground along the gravel drive up to the house dance recognized it as a unit of the highway patrol the two officers in the frontbulky menglanced at dance curiously and climbed out they looked over at the county sheriffs office car and deputy miguel herrera who touched his radio on his hip as if wanting to call somebody to see what this was all about together the new arrivals walked toward dance and her prisoner they noted the handcuffs in a perplexed voice dance said whore you well the older of the troopers said chp who are you maam she fished for her wallet in her purse and showed her id to the troopers im kathryn dance cbi what do you want here were here to take james chilton into custody my prisoner yours thats right we just arrested him she shot a glance to herrera wait a minute here chilton barked quiet dance ordered the senior trooper said we have an arrest warrant for james chilton and a warrant to take possession of his computers files business records anything related to the chilton report they displayed the paperwork thats ridiculous chilton said what the fuck is going on here dance repeated bluntly quiet then to the troopers whats the charge criminal trespass at arnold brubakers property thats right she laughed thats what i just arrested him for both of the troopers stared at her then at chilton buying time and then independently they nodded apparently there was in their experience no precedent for anything like this well one of the officers contributed we have a warrant i understand but hes already been arrested and the cbi already has jurisdiction over his files and computers were collecting them in a few minutes this is fucking bullshit chilton blurted sir id watch your language the younger and bigger of the troopers snapped the silence roared then kathryn dance squinted a smile into her face wait whos the one requested the warrant was it hamilton royce thats right the ags office in sacramento oh sure dance was relaxing im sorry thiss a misunderstanding i was the senior officer on the trespass on call but we had an affidavit issue and i had to delay taking him into custody i mentioned it to hamilton he probably thought i was so busy on the roadside cross case that mask killer that thing youre running that sure am freaky it is yep dance agreed then continued hamilton probably figured i was so busy on that one that hed take over on the trespass a disparaging nod of the head but frankly mr chilton pissed me off so much i wanted to finish up the collar myself she gave a conspiratorial smile that the troopers joined in briefly then she continued thiss my fault i shouldve told him let me make a call she pulled her phone off her belt and dialed then cocked her head thiss agent dance she said and explained about her arrest of james chilton silence for a moment ive already collared him weve got the paperwork back at hq sure she nodded good dance said in a conclusory tone and disconnected on the womans voice explaining that the temperature was fiftysix degrees and rain was forecast on the monterey peninsula tomorrow its all set well process him a smile unless you really want to cool your heels at the salinas lockup for four hours nup thats okay agent dance you need any help getting him in the car the big trooper was looking over james chilton as if the blogger weighed a hundred pounds more and was capable of breaking through the cuff chain with a flex of his muscles no thats okay well handle it with a nod the men walked off climbed in their car and left listen to me chilton growled his face red this is bullshit and you know it just relax okay dance turned him around and undid the cuffs whats this all about he was rubbing his wrists i thought you were arresting me i did ive decided to let you go though are you fucking with me no im saving you dance slipped the cuffs back into her holster smiling she waved to a very perplexed herrera he nodded back you were being set up james not long before dance had gotten a call from her assistant maryellen had grown suspicious when charles overby called once to see if dance was in the office and then again to ask her to come to his office to discuss her job satisfaction something hed never done en route to overbys office the woman had stalled and remained in the gals wing hiding in a side corridor hamilton royce slipped into her bosss office after five minutes or so hed then stepped outside and made a cell phone call maryellen had gotten close enough to overhear part of itroyce was calling a magistrate in sacramento who was apparently a friend and asking for an arrest warrant against chilton something to do with trespass maryellen didnt understand the implications of what had happened but she called dance immediately with the news then continued to overbys office dance gave chilton an abbreviated version of the story omitting royces name who was behind it he fumed she knew the blogger would in a posting go after whoever was behind his arrest and she couldnt afford the kind of publicity nightmare that would create im not divulging that all ill say is that some people want your blog suspended until we catch travis why she said sternly for the same reasons i wanted it shut down to keep people from posting and giving travis more targets a faint smile and because it looks bad for the state if were not doing everything we can to protect the publicwhich means shutting you down and stopping the blog is good for the public i expose corruption and problems i dont encourage them then he climbed off the soapbox and you arrested me so they couldnt serve the warrant yep whats going to happen one of two things the troopersll go back home and report to their supervisor that they cant serve the warrant because youre already under arrest and itll go away whats the second thing a collision between excrement and fan dance reflected she said nothing merely shrugged but chilton got it you put yourself on the line for me why i owe you youve been cooperating with us and if you want to know another reason i dont agree with all of your politics but i do agree you have the right to say what you want if youre wrong you can get sued and the courtsll decide but im not going to be part of some vigilante movement to shut you up because people dont like your approach thank you he said and the gratitude was obvious in his eyes they shook hands chilton said better get back online dance returned to the street and thanked miguel herrera the perplexed deputy and returned to her car she called tj and left a message to run a full backgrounder on hamilton royce she wanted to know what kind of enemy shed just made part of which question was apparently about to be answered her phone buzzed and caller id showed overbys number oh well shed guessed all along it would be door number two shit and fan charles kathryn i think we have a bit of a problem hamilton royce is here with me on speaker she was tempted to hold the phone away from her ear agent dance whats this about chilton getting arrested by you and the chp not being able to serve their warrant i didnt have any options no options what do you mean struggling to keep her voice calm she said ive decided i dont want to shut the blog down we know travis reads it chiltons asked him to come in the boy may see that and try to contact the blog maybe negotiate a surrender well kathryn overby sounded desperate on the whole sacramentos thinking its still better to close down the thing dont you agree not really charles now hamilton you went through my files didnt you a land mine of a pause i didnt review anything that wasnt public knowledge doesnt matter it was a breach of professional responsibility it might even be a crime kathryn really overby protested agent dance royce was sounding calm now ignoring overby as efficiently as she was she recalled a common observation during her interrogations a man in control is a dangerous man people are dying and chilton doesnt care and yes its making us all look bad from you to charles to the cbi to sacramento all of us and i dont mind admitting it dance had no interest in the substance of his argument hamilton you try something like this again with or without a warrant and the matterll end up with the attorney general and the governor and the press overby was saying hamilton what she means is i think hes pretty clear on what i mean charles her phone then beeped with a text message from michael oneil ive got to take this she disconnected the call cutting off both her boss and royce she lifted her phone and read the stark words on the screen ktravis spotted in new monterey police lost him but have report of another victim hes dead in carmel near end of cypress hills road west im en route meet you therem she texted yes and ran for the car flicking on the flashing lights which she tended to forget the car even hadinvestigators like her rarely had to play hot pursuitdance sped into the afternoon gloom another victim this attack would have happened not long after theyd foiled the attempt on donald hawken and his wife shed been right the boy probably frustrated that he hadnt been successful had gone on immediately to find another victim she found the turnoff braked hard and eased the long car down the winding country road the vegetation was lush but the overcast leached the color from the plants and gave dance the impression that she was in some otherworldly place like aetheria the land in dimensionquest she pictured the image of stryker in front of her holding his sword comfortably like really wnt to learn what can u tch me die pictured too the boys crude drawing of the blade piercing her chest then a flash caught her eyes white lights and colored ones she drove up and parked beside the other carsmonterey county sheriffs officeand a crime scene van dance climbed out headed into the chaos hey she nodded to michael oneil greatly relieved to see him even if this was only a temporary respite from the other case you check out the scene she asked just got here myself he explained they walked toward where the body lay covered with a dark green tarp yellow police tape starkly marked the spot somebody spotted him she asked an mcso deputy thats right agent dance nineoneone call in new monterey but by the time our people got there he was gone so was the good citizen whos the vic oneil asked he replied i dont know yet it was pretty bad apparently travis used the knife this time not the gun and looks like he took his time the deputy pointed into a grassfilled area about fifty feet away from the road she and oneil walked over the sandy ground in a minute or two they arrived at the tapedoff area where a half dozen uniformed and plainclothes officers were standing and a crime scene officer crouched beside the corpse covered by a green tarp they nodded a greeting to an mcso deputy a round latino man dance had worked with for years whats the word on the vics id she asked a deputys got his wallet the deputy indicated the body theyre checking it out now all we know so far is male forties dance looked around wasnt killed here i assume there were no residences or other buildings nearby nor would the victim have been hiking or jogging herethere were no trails right the officer continued there wasnt much blood looks like the perp drove the body here and dumped it found some tire tracks in the sand were guessing travis boosted the guys own car threw him in the trunk like that first girl tammy only this time he didnt wait for the tide stabbed him to death as soon as weve got the deceaseds id we can put out a call on the wheels youre sure travis did it dance asked the deputy offered youll see and he was tortured looks that way they paused at the crime scene tape about ten feet from the corpse the cs officer in a jumpsuit like a spaceman was taking measurements he glanced up and saw the two officers he nodded a greeting and through his protective goggles lifted an eyebrow you want to see he called yes dance replied wondering if he asked thinking a woman might not be comfortable seeing the carnage yes in this day and age it still happened though in fact she was steeling herself for the sight the nature of her work involved the living mostly shed never grown fully immune to the images of death he began to lift the cover when a voice called from behind her agent dance she glanced back to see another officer in uniform walking up to her he was holding something in his hand yes do you know a jonathan boling jon yes she was staring at a business card in his hand and recalled that somebody had taken the victims wallet to verify id a horrifying thought was the victim jon her mind did one of its leapsa to b to x had the professor learned something from traviss computer or in his search for victims and with dance away decided to investigate by himself please no she glanced briefly at oneil horror in her eyes and lunged for the body hey the cs tech shouted youll contaminate the scene she ignored him and flung back the tarp and gasped with mixed relief and horror she stared down it wasnt boling the lean bearded man in slacks and a white shirt had been repeatedly stabbed one glazed eye was half open a cross was carved into his forehead rose petals red ones were scattered over his body but where did that come from she asked the other deputy nodding at bolings business card her voice shaking i was trying to tell youhes at the road block over there just drove up he wants to see you its urgent ill talk to him in a minute dance inhaled deeply shaken another deputy came up with the dead mans wallet in a plastic bag got the id his names mark watson hes a retired engineer went out to the store a few hours ago never got home who is he oneil asked why was he picked dance dug into her jacket pocket and retrieved the list of everyone mentioned in the blog who might be a potential target he posted in the bloga reply to the power to the people thread about the nuclear plant it doesnt agree or disagree with chilton about the location of the plant its neutral so anybody connected to the blog at all could be at risk now id think so oneil looked her over he touched her arm you okay justkind of a scare she found herself thumbing jon bolings card she told oneil she was going to see what he wanted and began down the path her heart only now returning to a normal beat from the fright at the roadside she found the professor standing beside his car the door open she frowned in the passenger seat was a teenager with spiky hair he was wearing an aerosmith tshirt under a dark brown jacket boling waved to her she was struck by the look of urgency on his face unusual for him and by the intensity of the relief she felt that he was all right which gave way to curiosity when she saw what was stuck in the waistband of his slacks she couldnt tell for certain but it seemed to be the hilt of a large knife chapter dance boling and the teenager were in her office at the cbi jason kepler was a seventeenyearold student in carmel south high and he not travis was stryker travis had created the avatar years ago but hed sold it online to jason along with like a shitload of reputation life points and resources whatever those were dance recalled that boling had told her that players could sell their avatars and other accoutrements of the game the professor explained about his finding a reference in traviss data to the lighthouse arcades hours of operation dance was grateful for the mans brilliant detective work though she was absolutely going to dress him down later for not calling immediately upon learning that the boy was at the arcade and for going after him alone on her desk behind them in an evidence envelope was the kitchen knife that jason had used to threaten boling it was a deadly weapon and he was technically guilty of assault and battery still since boling hadnt actually been injured and the boy had voluntarily handed over the blade to the professor she was probably going to be satisfied with giving the kid a stern warning boling now explained what had happened he himself had been the victim of a sting orchestrated by the young teen who sat before them now tell her what you told me what it is i was worried about travis jason told them wideeyed you dont know what its like seeing somebody whos in your family getting attacked like he was in the blog your family yeah in the game in dq were brothers i mean weve never met or anything but i know him real good never met well sure but not in the real world only in aetheria i wanted to help him but i had to find him first i tried calling and iming and i couldnt get through all i could think of was hanging out at the arcade maybe i could talk him into turning himself in with a knife dance asked his shoulders lifted then sagged i figured it couldnt hurt the boy was skinny and unhealthily pale here it was summer vacation and ironically he probably got outside now far less often than in the fall and winter when hed have to go to school boling took over the narrative jason was in the lighthouse arcade when i got there the manager was a friend of his and when i asked about stryker he pretended to go check out something but instead he told jason about me hey im sorry man i wasnt going to stab you or anything i just wanted to find out who you were and if you had any idea where travis was i didnt know you were with this bureau of investigation thing boling gave a sheepish smile at the impersonationofanofficer part he added that he knew shed want to talk to jason but he thought it best to take him directly to her rather than wait for the city police to show up we just jumped in the car and called tj he told us where you were it was a good decision and only marginally illegal dance now said jason we dont want travis to get hurt either and we dont want him to hurt anybody else what can you tell us about where he might go he could be anywhere hes really smart you know he knows how to live outside in the woods hes an expert the boy noted their confusion and said see dqs a game but its also real i mean youre in the southern mountains it gets like fifty below zero and you have to learn how to stay warm and if you dont youll freeze to death and you have to get food and water and everything you learn what plantsre safe and what animals you can eat and how to cook and store food i mean they have real recipes you have to cook them right in the game or they dont work he laughed thereve been newbies whove tried to play and theyre like all we want to do is fight trolls and demons and they end up starving to death because they couldnt take care of themselves you play with other people dont you could any of them know where travis might be like i asked everybody in the family and nobody knows where he is how many are in your family about twelve of us but him and me are the only ones in california dance was fascinated and you all live together in aetheria yeah i know them better than i know my real brothers he gave a grim laugh and in aetheria they dont beat me up and steal money from me dance was curious you have parents in the real world he shrugged a gesture dance interpreted as meaning sort of she said no in the game some families do we dont he gave a wistful look were happier that way she was smiling you know you and ive met jason the boy looked down yeah i know mr boling told me i kinda killed you sorry i thought you were just some newb who was dissing us because of trav i mean our familywell our whole guild orderhas been totally dissed because of him and all the posts on that blog its happening a lot a raiding party from the north traveled all the way from crystal island to wipe us out we made this allegiance and stopped them but morina was killed she was our sister shes come back but she lost all her resources the skinny boy shrugged i get pushed around a lot you know at school thats why i picked an avatar thats a thunderer a warrior kind of makes me feel better nobody fucks with me there jason one thing that might be helpful if you could give us the strategies travis would use to attack people how hed stalk them weapons anything that might help us figure out how to outthink him but the boy seemed to be troubled you really dont know very much about travis do you dance was about to say they knew all too much but interviewers know when to let the subject take over with a glance at boling she said no i guess we dont i want to show you something jason said standing up where in aetheria kathryn dance once again assumed the identity of the avatar greenleaf who was fully resurrected as jason typed the character appeared on the screen in a forest clearing as before the scenery was beautiful the graphics astonishingly clear dozens of people were wandering around some armed some carrying bags or packs some leading animals this is otovius where travis and me hang out a lot its a nice place you mind he bent forward toward the keys no dance told him go ahead he typed then received a message kiaruya is not logged on bummer whos that boling asked my wife your what dance asked the seventeenyearold he blushed we got married a couple months ago she laughed in astonishment last year i met this girl in the game shes totally cool shes been all the way through the southern mountains by herself she didnt die once and me and her hit it off we went on some quests i proposed well sort of she did but i wanted to too and we got married who is she really some girl in korea but she got a bad grade in a couple of her classes in the real world boling asked yeah so her parents took away her account youre divorced naw just on hold for a while till she gets her math scores up to a b again jason added funny most people who get married in dq stay married in the real world a lot of our parentsre divorced i hope she gets back online soon i miss her he jabbed a finger at the screen anyway lets go to the house under jasons direction dances avatar maneuvered around the landscape past dozens of people and creatures jason led them to a cliff we could walk there but thatd you know take a while you cant pay for a pegasus ride because you havent earned any gold yet but i can give you transport points he began to type its like my dads frequent flier thing he keyboarded some more codes and then had the avatar climb on the winged horse and off they flew the flight was breathtaking they soared over the landscape around thick clouds two suns burned in the azure sky and occasionally other flying creatures would cruise past as did dirigibles and bizarre flying machines below dance saw cities and villages and in a few places fires thosere battles jason said look pretty epic he sounded as if he regretted missing the chance to lop off some heads a minute later they arrived at a seashorethe ocean was bright greenand slowly eased in for a landing on a rolling hillside overlooking the turbulent water dance remembered caitlin saying that travis liked the shoreline because it reminded him of some place in a game he played jason showed her how to dismount the horse and under her own controls she navigated greenleaf toward where jason pointed a cottage thats the house we all built it together like a barn raising in the s dance reflected but travis earned all the money and the supplies he paid for it we hired trolls to do the heavy work he added without a bit of irony when her avatar was at the door jason gave her a verbal password she spoke it into the computers microphone and the door opened they walked inside dance was shocked it was a beautiful spacious house filled with bizarre but cozy furniture out of a dr seuss book there were walkways and stairs that led to various rooms windows of odd shapes a huge burning fireplace a fountain and a large pool a couple of petssome goofy hybrid of a goat and salamanderwalked around croaking its nice jason very nice yeah well we make cool homes in aetheria cause where we live i mean in the real world our places arent so nice you know okay like heres what i wanted to show you go there he directed her past a small pond populated with shimmery green fish her avatar stopped at a large metal door it was barred with several locks jason gave her another pass code and the door slowly openedaccompanied by creaking sound effects she sent greenleaf through the doorway down a flight of stairs and into what looked like a drugstore combined with an emergency room jason looked at dance and noticed she was frowning he said understand not exactly thats what i meant about knowing travis hes not about weapons and battle strategy or any of that hes about this its his healing room healing room dance asked the boy explained travis hated fighting he created stryker as a warrior when he first started playing but he didnt like that thats why he sold him to me hes a healer not a fighter and i mean a healer at the fortyninth level you know how good that makes him hes the best hes awesome a healer thats his avatars name medicusits some foreign language for doctor latin boling said ancient rome jason asked right sweet anyway traviss other professions are herb growing and potion making this is where people come to be treated its like a doctors office doctor dance mused she rose from her desk found the stack of papers theyd taken from traviss room and flipped through them rey carraneo had been rightthe pictures were of cutup bodies but they werent the victims of crimes they were of patients during surgery they were very well done technically accurate jason continued characters from all over aetheria would come to see him even the game designers know about him they asked him for advice in creating npcs hes a total legend hes made thousands of dollars by making these healing potions buffers life regenerators and power spells in real money oh yeah he sells them on ebay like how i bought stryker dance recalled the strongbox theyd found under the boys bed so this was how hed made the cash jason tapped the screen oh and there he was indicating a glass case in which rested a crystal ball on the end of a gold stick thats the scepter of healing it took him like fifty quests to earn it nobody ever got one before in the whole history of dq jason winced he almost lost it once an awestruck expression washed over his face that was one messedup night the boy sounded as if the event were a tragedy in real life what do you mean well medicus and me and some of us in the family were on this quest in the southern mountains whichre like three miles high and really dangerous places we were looking for this magical tree the tree of seeing its called and this was sweet we found the home of ianna the elvish queen who everybodys heard of but never seen shes way famous shes an npc right boling asked yeah he reminded dance a nonplayer character one thats created by the game itself jason seemed offended at the characterization but the algorithm is awesome shes beyond any bot youve ever seen the professor nodded an apologetic concession so were there and just hanging and talking and shes telling us about the tree of seeing and how we can find it and all of a sudden were attacked by this raiding party from the northern forces and everybodys fighting and this asshole shoots the queen with a special arrow shes going to die trav tries to save her but his healing isnt working so he decides to shift were like no man dont do it but he did anyway the boy was speaking with such reverence that dance found herself leaning forward her leg bobbing with tension boling too was staring at him whats that jason go on okay what it is sometimes if somebodys dying you can submit your life to the entities in the high realm its called shifting and the entities start taking your life force and giving it to the person whos dying maybe the person will come back before your life force is gone but it might take all your life force and youll die and theyll die too only when you die because youve shifted you lose everything i mean everything youve done and earned all your points all your resources all your reputation for as long as youve been playing the game they all like just go away if travisd died he wouldve lost the scepter his house his gold his flying horses he would have to start over like a newbie he did that jason nodded it was like way close he was almost out of life force but the queen revived she kissed him that was like epic and then the elves and us got together and kicked some northern force ass man that night rocked it was epic win everybody who plays the game still talks about it dance was nodding okay jason thanks you can log off like you dont want to play anymore you were kind of getting a feel for how to move maybe later the boy tapped the keys and the game closed dance glanced at her watch jon could you take jason back home theres somebody i need to talk to a to b to x chapter id like to see caitlin please youre asked virginia gardner the mother of the girl whod survived the june car crash dance identified herself i spoke to your daughter the other day at summer school oh youre the policewoman you arranged for the guard for cait at the hospital the other day and out in front of our house thats right have you found travis no i is he nearby the woman asked breathlessly looking around no hes not id just like to ask your daughter a few more questions the woman invited dance into the entryway of the huge contemporary house in carmel dance recalled that caitlin was headed for some nice undergrad and medical schools whatever dad or mom did it seemed they could afford the tuition dance surveyed the massive living room there were stark abstracts on the wallstwo huge spiky blackandyellow paintings and one with bloody red splotches she found them troubling to look at she thought how different this was from the cozy feel of traviss and jasons house in the dimensionquest game yeah well we make cool homes in aetheria cause where we live i mean in the real world our places arent so nice you know the girls mother disappeared and a moment later returned with caitlin in jeans and a lime green shell under a tightfitting white sweater hi the teenager said uneasily hello caitlin how you feeling okay hoping youll have a minute or two i have a few followup questions sure i guess can we sit down somewhere we can go in the sunroom mrs gardner said they passed an office and dance saw a university of california diploma on the wall medical school caitlins father the mother and daughter on the couch dance in a straightbacked chair she scooted it closer and said i wanted to give you an update there was another killing today have you heard oh no caitlins mother whispered the girl said nothing she closed her eyes her face framed by limp blond hair seemed to grow paler really the mother whispered angrily ill never see how you could go out with somebody like that mom caitlin whined what do you mean go out christ i never went out with travis i never would somebody like him i just mean hes obviously dangerous caitlin dance interrupted were really desperate to find him were just not having any luck im learning more about him from friends but her mother again those columbine kids please mrs gardner an affronted look but she fell silent i told you everything i could think of the other day just a few more questions i wont be long she scooted the chair closer yet and pulled out a notebook she opened it and flipped through the pages carefully pausing once or twice caitlin was immobile as she stared at the notebook dance smiled looking into the girls eyes now caitlin think back to the night of the party uhhuh something interestings come up i interviewed travis before he ran off i took some notes a nod at the notebook resting on her lap you did you talked to him thats right i didnt pay much attention until id spoken to you and some other people but now im hoping to piece together some clues as to where hes hiding how hard could it be to find caitlins mother began as if she couldnt stop herself but she fell silent under dances stern glance the agent continued now you and travis talked some right that night not really dance was frowning slightly and flipping through her notes the girl added well except when it was time to leave i meant during the party he was hanging by himself mostly dance said on the ride home you did though tapping the notebook yeah talked some i dont remember too much it was all a blur with the crash and all im sure it was but im going to read you a couple of statements and id like you to fill in the details tell me if anything jogs your memory about what travis said on the drive home before the accident i guess dance consulted her notebook okay heres the first one the house was pretty sweet but the driveway freaked me out she looked up i was thinking maybe that meant travis had a fear of heights yeah thats what he was talking about the driveway was on this hillside and we were talking about it travis said hed always had this fear of falling he looked at the driveway and he said why didnt they have a guardrail on it good thats helpful another smile caitlin reciprocated dance returned to the notes and this one i think boats rule ive always wanted one oh that yeah we were talking about fishermans wharf travis really thought itd be cool to sail to santa cruz she looked away i think he wanted to ask me to go with him but he was too shy dance smiled so he might be hiding out on a boat somewhere yeah that could be it i think he said something about how neat it would be to stow away on a boat good heres another one she has more friends than me i only have one or two i could hang out with yeah i remember him saying that i felt sorry for him that he didnt have many friends he talked about it for a while did he mention names anybody he might be staying with think its important the teenager squinted and her hand rubbed her knee then sighed nope thats okay caitlin im sorry a faint pout dance kept the smile on her face she was steeling herself for what was coming next it would be difficultfor the girl for her mother for dance herself but there was no choice she leaned forward caitlin youre not being honest with me the girl blinked what virginia gardner muttered you cant say that to my daughter travis didnt tell me any of those things dance said her voice neutral i made them up you lied the mother snapped no she hadnt not technically shed crafted her words carefully and never said they were actual statements from travis brigham the girl had gone pale the mother grumbled what is this some kind of trap yes that was exactly what it was dance had a theory and she needed to prove it true or false lives were at stake dance ignored the mother and said to caitlin but you were playing along as if travis had said all of those things to you in the car ii was just trying to be helpful i felt bad i didnt know more no caitlin you thought you might very well have talked with him about them in the car but you couldnt remember because you were intoxicated no im going to ask you to leave now the girls mother blurted im not through dance growled shutting up virginia gardner the agent assessed with her science backgroundand her survival skills in this householdcaitlin had a thinking and sensing personality type according to the myersbriggs index she struck dance as probably more introverted than extraverted and though her liars personality would fluctuate she was at the moment an adaptor lying for selfpreservation if dance had had more time she might have drawn the truth out slowly and in more depth but with the myersbriggs typing and caitlins personality of adaptor dance assessed she could push and not have to coddle the way she had with tammy foster you were drinking at the party i caitlin people saw you i had a few drinks sure before coming here i talked to several students who were there they said that you vanessa and trish drank almost a fifth of tequila after you saw mike with brianna wellokay so what youre seventeen her mother raged thats what dance said evenly ive called an accident reconstruction service caitlin theyre going to look over your car at the police impound lot they measure things like seat and rearview mirror adjustment they can tell the height of the driver the girl was completely still though her jaw trembled caitlin its time to tell the truth a lot depends on it other peoples lives are at stake what truth her mother whispered dance kept her eyes on the girl caitlin was driving the car that night not travis no virginia gardner wailed werent you caitlin the teenager said nothing for a minute then her head dropped her chest collapsed dance read pain and defeat through her body her kinesic message was yes her voice breaking caitlin said mike left with that little slut hanging on him and her hand down the back of his jeans i knew they went back to his place to fuck i was going to drive therei was going to all right her mother ordered thats enough be quiet the girl yelled to her mother and started to sob she turned to dance yes i was driving the guilt had finally detonated within her dance continued after the accident travis pulled you into the passenger seat and he got in the drivers he pretended he was driving he did that to save you she thought back to the initial interview with travis i didnt do anything wrong the boys assertion had registered as deceptive to dance but she believed that he meant he was lying about the attack on tammy in fact what hed done wrong was to lie about who was driving the car that night the idea had occurred to dance when she was looking over the house of travismedicusand his family in aetheria the fact that the boy spent virtually every moment he could in the dimensionquest game as a doctor and healer not a killer like stryker made her begin to doubt the boys tendency toward violence and when shed learned that his avatar had been willing to sacrifice his life for the elvish queen she realized that it was possible travis had done the same in the real worldtaking the blame for the car crash so that the girl he admired from afar wouldnt go to jail caitlin tears flowing from her closed eyes pressed back into the couch her body a knot of tension i just lost it we got drunk and i wanted to go find mike and tell him what a shit he was trish and vanessa were more wasted than me so i was going to drive but travis followed me outside and kept trying to stop me he tried to take the keys but i wouldnt let him i was so mad trish and vanessa were in the backseat and travis just jumped in the passenger seat and he was like pull over caitlin come on you cant drive but i was acting like an asshole i just kept going ignoring him and then i dont know what happened we went off the road her voice faded and her expression was one of the most sorrowful and forlorn kathryn dance had ever seen as she whispered and i killed my friends caitlins mother her face white and bewildered eased forward tentatively she put her arm around her daughters shoulders the girl stiffened momentarily and then surrendered sobbing and pressing her head against her mothers chest after a few minutes the woman crying herself looked at dance whats going to happen you and your husband should find a lawyer for caitlin then call the police right away she should surrender voluntarily the sooner the better caitlin wiped her face its hurt so bad lying i was going to say something i really really was but then people started to attack travisall those things they saidand i knew if i told the truth theyd attack me she lowered her head i couldnt do it all those things peopled say about metheyd be up on their site forever more worried about her image than the deaths of her friends but dance wasnt here to expiate the teenagers guilt all shed needed was confirmation of her theory that travis had taken the fall for caitlin she rose and left the mother and daughter offering the briefest of farewells outside jogging toward her car she hit speeddial button threemichael oneil he answered on the second ring thank god the other case wasnt keeping him completely incommunicado hey he sounded tired michael whats wrong hed grown alert apparently her tone told stories too i know youre swamped but any chance i could come by i need to brainstorm ive found something sure what travis brigham isnt the roadside cross killer dance and oneil were in his office in the monterey county sheriffs office in salinas the windows looked out on the courthouse in front of which were two dozen of the life first protesters along with the wattlenecked reverend fisk apparently bored with protesting in front of stuart and edie dances empty house theyd moved to where they stood a chance of getting some publicity fisk was talking to the associate shed seen earlier the brawny redheaded bodyguard dance turned away from the window and joined oneil at his unsteady conference table the place was filled with ordered stacks of files she wondered which were related to the indonesian container case oneil rocked back on two legs of a wooden chair so lets hear it she explained quickly about how the investigation had led to jason and then into the dimensionquest game and ultimately to caitlin gardner and the confession that travis had taken the fall for her infatuation he asked but dance said sure thats part of it but theres something else going on she wants to go to medical school thats important to travis medical school medicine healing in that game he plays dimensionquest travis is a famous healer im thinking one of the reasons he protected her was because of that his avatar is medicus a doctor he feels a connection to her thats a little farfetched dont you think after all its just a game no michael its more than a game the real world and the synth world are getting closer and closer and people like travis are living in both if hes a respected healer in dimensionquest hes not going to be a vindictive killer in the real world so he takes the fall for caitlins crash and whatever people say about him in the blog the last thing in the world he wants is to draw attention to himself by attacking anybody exactly but kelleybefore she passed out she told the medic that it was travis who attacked her dance shook her head im not sure she actually saw him she assumed it was him maybe because she knew shed posted about him and the mask at her window was from the dimensionquest game and the rumors were he was behind the attacks but i think the real killer was wearing a mask or got her from behind how do you deal with the physical evidence planted right itd be easy to read up online about travis to follow him learn about his job at the bagel place his bicycle the fact that he plays dq all the time the killer could have made one of those masks stolen the gun from bob brighams truck planted the trace evidence at the bagel shop and stolen the knife when the employees werent looking oh and something else the m ms the flecks of wrapper at the crime scene right had to be planted travis wouldnt eat chocolate he bought packets for his brother he was worried about his acne he had books in his room about what foods to avoid the real killer didnt know that he mustve seen travis buy m ms at some point and assumed they were a favorite candy so he left some trace of the wrapper at the scene and the sweatshirt fibers there was a posting in the report about the brigham family being so poor that they couldnt afford a washer and dryer and it mentioned which laundromat they went to im sure the real perp read that and staked the place out oneil nodded and stole a hooded sweatshirt when the mother was out or wasnt looking yep and there were some pictures posted in the blog under traviss name oneil hadnt seen the drawings and she described them briefly omitting the fact that the last one bore a resemblance to her dance continued they were crude what an adult would think of a teenagers drawing but i saw some pictures that travis had doneof surgery hes a great artist somebody else drew them it would explain why nobodys been able to find the real killer despite the manhunt he pulls on a hoodie for the attack then throws it and the bicycle in his trunk and drives off down the street like anybody else hell he could be fifty years old or he could be a she now that i think about it exactly the deputy fell silent for a moment his thoughts had apparently arrived at the exact spot where dances awaited hes dead isnt he the deputy asked travis dance sighed at this harsh corollary of her theory its possible but im hoping not i like to think hes just being held somewhere the poor kid was in the wrong place at the wrong time rocking back and forth so to find where the real perp is weve got to figure out whos the intended victim its not somebody who posted an attack on travis they were just set up to mislead us my theory dance offered oneil looked at her with a coy smile whoever the perp is hes really after chilton yep the perp was setting the stage first going after people whod criticized travis then those friendly with chilton and finally the blogger himself somebody who doesnt want to be investigated dance replied or who wants revenge for something hed posted in the past okay all we need to find out is who wants to kill james chilton michael oneil said dance gave a sour laugh the easier question is who doesnt chapter james there was a pause on the other end of the line the blogger said agent dance his voice sounded weary more bad news ive found some evidence that suggests travis isnt leaving the crosses what im not positive but the way things are looking the boy could be a scapegoat and somebodys making it look like hes the killer chilton whispered and he was innocent all along im afraid so dance explained what shed learnedabout who was really behind the wheel of the car on june and about the likelihood of the evidence being planted and i think youre the ultimate target she added me youve posted some pretty inflammatory stories throughout your career and youre writing now about controversial topics i think some peopled be happy to see you stop youve been threatened before i assume plenty of times go back through your blog find the names of everybody whos threatened you who might want to get even for something youve said or whos concerned that youre investigating something now they might not want published pick the most credible suspects and go back a few years sure ill come up with a list but you think im really at risk i do yes he fell silent im worried about pat and the boys do you think we should leave the area maybe go to our vacation house its in hollister or get a hotel room probably the hotels safer youd be on record as owning the other house i can arrange for you to check into one of the motels we use for witnesses itll be under a pseudonym thanks give us a few hours patll get things packed up and well leave right after a meeting i have scheduled good she was about to hang up when chilton said wait agent dance one thing what ive got an ideaof who might be number one on the list im ready to write you wont need a pen and paper chilton replied dance and rey carraneo slowly approached the luxurious house of arnold brubaker the man behind the desalination plant that would according to james chilton destroy the monterey peninsula it was brubaker whom chilton fingered as the numberone choice of suspect either the desalination tsar himself or a person hired by him and dance thought this was likely she was online on the cars computer reading the desalinateand devastate thread on the june posting httpwwwthechiltonreportcomhtmljunehtml from chiltons reporting and the posts dance deduced that the blogger had found out about the mans las vegas connections which suggested organized crime and the mans private real estate dealings which hinted at secrets he might not want exposed ready dance asked carraneo as she logged off the young agent nodded and they climbed from the car she knocked on the door finally the redfaced entrepreneurflushed from the sun not booze dance deducedanswered the knock he was surprised to see visitors he blinked and said nothing for a moment from the hospital youre agent dance this is agent carraneo his eyes zipped behind her looking for backup she wondered and if so for her backup or brubakers own she felt a trickle of fear people who kill for money were the most ruthless in her estimation were following up on that incident with mr chilton you mind if i ask you a few questions what that prick filed charges after all i thought we no no charges can we come in the man remained suspicious his eyes avoiding dances he nodded them inside and blurted hes crazy you know i mean i think hes certifiable dance gave a noncommittal smile with another glance outside brubaker closed the door he locked it they walked through the house impersonal many rooms empty of furniture dance believed she heard a creak from nearby then another from a different room was the house settling or did brubaker have assistants here assistants or muscle they walked into an office filled with papers blueprints pictures photographs legal documents a carefully constructed scale model of the desalination plant took up one of the tables brubaker lifted several huge bound reports off chairs and gestured them to sit he did too behind a large desk dance noticed certificates on the wall there were also pictures of brubaker with powerfullooking men in suitspoliticians or other businesspeople interrogators love office walls they reveal much about people from these particular pictures she deduced that brubaker was smart degrees and professional course completions and savvy politically honors and keys from cities and counties and tough his company apparently had built desalination plants in mexico and colombia photos showed him surrounded by sunglassed vigilant mensecurity guards the men were the same in all of the pictures which meant they were brubakers personal minders not provided by the local government one held a machine gun were they the source of the creaks nearbywhich shed heard again closer it seemed dance asked about the desalination project and he launched into a lengthy sales pitch about the latest technology the plant would use she caught words like filtration membranes freshwater holding tanks brubaker gave them a short lecture on the reduced costs of new systems that was making desalination economically feasible she took in little information but instead feigned interest and soaked up his baseline behavior her first impression was that brubaker didnt seem troubled at their presence though high machs were rarely moved by any human connectionswhether romantic social or professional they even approached confrontation with equanimity it was one aspect that made them so efficient and potentially dangerous dance would have liked more time to gather baseline information but she felt a sense of urgency so she stopped his spiel and asked mr brubaker where were you at one pm yesterday and eleven am today the times of lyndon stricklands and mark watsons deaths well why a smile but dance had no idea what was behind it were looking into certain threats against mr chilton true though not of course the whole story oh he libels me and now im accused were not accusing you mr brubaker but could you answer my question please i dont have to i can ask you to leave right now this was true you can refuse to cooperate but were hoping you wont you can hope all you want he snapped the smile now grew triumphant i see whats going on here could it be that you got it all wrong agent dance that maybe it isnt some psychotic teenager whos been gutting people like in some bad horror film but somebody whos been using the kid setting him up to take the fall for killing james chilton that was pretty good dance thought but did it mean that he was threatening them if he was the somebody he referred to then yes he was carraneo stole a brief glance at her which means youve pretty much had the wool pulled over your eyes there were too many important rules in interviewing and interrogation for any of them to be number one but high at the top was never let the personal insults affect you dance said reasonably theres been a series of very serious crimes mr brubaker were looking into all possibilities you have a grudge against james chilton and youve assaulted him once already and really he said in a dismissive tone do you think itd be the smartest thing in the world to get into a public brawl with a man im secretly trying to kill either very stupid or very smart dance responded silently she then asked where were you at the times i mentioned you can tell us or you can refuse and well keep investigating youre as much of a prick as chilton is actually agent dance youre worse you hide behind your shield carraneo stirred but said nothing she too was silent either he was going to tell them or he was going to throw them out wrong dance realized there was a third option one that had been percolating since shed been listening to the eerie creaks in the seemingly deserted house brubaker was going for a weapon ive had enough of this he whispered and eyes wide in anger yanked open the top desk drawer his hand shot inside dance flashed on her childrens faces then her husbands and then michael oneils please she thought praying for speed rey behind us cover and when brubaker looked up he was staring into the muzzle of her glock pistol while carraneo was facing the opposite way aiming at the door to the office both agents were crouching jesus take it easy he cried clear so far carraneo said check it out she ordered the young man eased to the door and standing to the side pushed it open with his foot clear he spun around to cover brubaker lift your hands slowly dance said her glock steady enough if you have a weapon in your hand drop it immediately dont lift it or lower it just drop it if you dontnowwe will shoot understand arnold brubaker gasped i dont have a gun she didnt hear a weapon hit the expensive floor but he was lifting his hands very slowly unlike dances they werent shaking at all in the developers ruddy fingers was a business card which he flicked toward her contemptuously the agents holstered their weapons they sat dance looked at the card reflecting that a situation that couldnt get any more awkward just had on the card was the goldembossed seal of the department of justicethe eagle and the fine print she knew fbi agents cards very well she still had a large box of them at home her husbands at the time you mentioned yesterday i was meeting with amy grabe special agent in charge of the san francisco office of the bureau we were meeting here and at the site from about eleven am to three pm oh brubaker said desalination and waterbased infrastructure projects are terrorist targets ive been working with homeland security and the fbi to make sure that if the project gets under way therell be adequate security he looked at her calmly and with contempt the tip of his tongue touched a lip im hoping it will be federal officers involved im losing confidence in the local constabulary kathryn dance wasnt about to apologize shed check with sac amy grabe whom she knew and despite differences of opinion respected and even though an alibi wouldnt absolve him from hiring a thug to commit the actual crimes it was hard for dance to believe that a man working closely with the fbi and dhs would risk murder besides everything about brubakers demeanor suggested he was telling the truth all right mr brubaker well check out what youre telling us i hope you do i appreciate your time you can find your own way out he snapped carraneo cast a sheepish glance her way dance rolled her eyes when they were at the door brubaker said wait hold on the agents turned well was i right right that you think somebody killed the boy and set him up to be the fall guy in some plot to kill chilton a pause then she thought why not she answered we think its possible yes here brubaker jotted something on a slip of paper and offered it hes somebody you ought to be looking at hed love for the blogand the bloggerto disappear dance glanced at the note wondering why she hadnt thought of the suspect herself chapter parked on a dusty street near the small town of marina five miles north of monterey dance was alone in her crown vic on the phone with tj brubaker she asked no criminal record he told her and his workand the alibiwith the fbi was confirmed he still mightve hired somebody for the job but this information did ease him out of the hot seat attention was now on the man whose name brubaker had given her the name on the slip of paper was clint avery and she was presently gazing at him from about one hundred yards away through a chainlink fencetopped with razor wirethat surrounded his massive construction company the name avery had never come up as someone involved in the case for very good reason the builder had never posted on the blog and chilton had never written about him in the report not by name that is the yellow brick road thread didnt mention avery specifically but questioned the governments decision to build the highway and the bidding process by implication also criticizing the contractorwhich dance should have known was avery construction since shed been flagged down by a company team at the site of the highway work when shed been on her way to caitlin gardners summer school two days ago she hadnt put the two pieces together tj scanlon now told her seems that clint avery was connected with a company investigated for using substandard materials about five years ago investigation got dropped real fast maybe chiltons reporting might get the case reopened a good motive to kill the blogger dance agreed thanks tj thats good and chiltons got you the list of other suspects yep any others stand out not yet boss but im glad i dont have as many enemies as he does she gave a brief laugh and they disconnected from the distance dance continued to study clint avery shed seen pictures of him a dozen timeson the news and in the papers he was hard to miss though he would certainly have been a millionaire many times over he was dressed the same as any other worker a blue shirt sprouting pens in the breast pocket tan work slacks boots the sleeves were rolled up and she spotted a tattoo on his leathery forearm in his hand was a yellow hard hat a big walkietalkie sat on his hip she wouldnt have been surprised to see a sixshooter his broad mustachioed face looked like a gunslingers she started the engine and drove through the gates avery noticed her car he squinted slightly and seemed to recognize hers immediately as a government car he concluded his discussion with a leatherjacketed man who walked away quickly she parked avery construction was a nononsense company devoted to one purpose building things huge stores of construction materials bulldozers cats backhoes trucks and jeeps there was a concrete plant on the premises and what appeared to be metal and woodworking shops large diesel tanks for feeding the vehicles quonset huts and storage sheds the main office was made up of a number of large functional buildings all low no graphic designer or landscaper had been involved in the creation of avery construction dance identified herself the head of the company was cordial and shook hands his eyes crinkling lines into the tanned face as he glanced at her id mr avery were hoping you can help us youre familiar with the crimes that have been occurring around the peninsula the mask killer that boy sure i heard someone else was killed today terrible how can i help you the killers leaving roadside memorials as a warning that hes going to commit more crimes he nodded ive seen that on the news well weve noticed something curious several of the crosses have been left near sites of your construction projects they have now a frown his brow creasing significantly was it out of proportion to the news dance couldnt tell avery started to turn his head then stopped had he instinctively been looking toward his leatherjacketed associate how can i help we want to talk to some of your employees to see if theyve noticed anything out of the ordinary such as passersby behaving suspiciously unusual objects maybe footprints or bicycle tire tread marks in areas that were roped off for construction heres a list of locations shed written down several earlier in the car concern on his face he looked over the list then slipped the sheet into his shirt pocket and crossed his arms this in itself meant little kinesically since she hadnt had time to get a baseline reading but arm and leg crossing are defensive gestures and can signify discomfort you want me to give you a list of employees whove worked around there since the killings began i assume exactly it would be a big help i assume youd like this sooner rather than later as soon as possible ill do what i can she thanked him and walked back to the car then drove out of the parking lot and up the road dance pulled up beside a dark blue honda accord nearby she was pointed the opposite way so her open window was two feet from rey carraneos he sat in the drivers seat of the honda in shirtsleeves without a tie shed seen him dressed this casually only twice before at a bureau picnic and one very bizarre barbecue at charles overbys house hes got the bait dance said i have no idea if hell bite how did he react hard to call i didnt have time to take a baseline but my sense was that he was struggling to seem calm and cooperative he was more nervous than he let on im also not so sure about one of his helpers she described the man in the leather jacket either one of them leaves stay close yes maam patrizia chilton opened the door nodded and said hi to greg ashton the man her husband called an über bloggerin that cute but slightly obnoxious way of jims hi pat ashton said they shook hands the slim man in expensive tan slacks and a nice sports coat nodded toward the squad car sitting in the road that deputy he wouldnt give anything away but hes here because of those killings right theyre just taking precautions ive been following the story you must be pretty upset she gave a stoic smile thats putting it mildly its been a nightmare she liked being able to admit to how she felt she couldnt always do that with jim she believed she had to be supportive in fact she was sometimes furious at his role as a relentless investigative journalist it was important she understood but sometimes she just plain hated the blog and nowendangering the family and forcing them to move to a hotel this morning shed had to ask her brother a big man whod been a bouncer in college to escort the boys to their day camp stay there and bring them back she bolted the door behind them can i get you anything patrizia asked ashton no no im fine thanks patrizia walked him to the door of her husbands office her eyes taking in the backyard through a large window in the hallway a tap of concern in her chest had she seen something in the bushes behind the house was it a person she paused something wrong ashton asked her heart was pounding hard inothing probably just a deer i have to say this whole case has got my nerves shaken i dont see anything its gone she said but was it she couldnt tell yet she didnt want to alarm their guest besides all the windows and doors were locked they arrived at her husbands office and stepped inside honey she said its greg ah right on time the men shook hands patrizia said greg said he doesnt care for anything how bout you honey no im fine any more tea and ill be in the bathroom for the whole meeting well ill leave you two boys to do your work and get back to packing her heart sank again at the thought of moving into a hotel she hated being driven from her home at least the boys would consider it an adventure actually ashton said hold on a minute pat im going to do a video of jims operation to post on my site i want to include you too he set his briefcase on the table and opened it up me patrizia gasped oh no i havent done my hair and my makeup ashton said first of all you look fantastic but most important blogging isnt about hair and makeup its about authenticity ive shot dozens of these and ive never let anybody so much as put on lipstick well i guess patrizia was distracted thinking about the motion shed seen behind the house she should tell the deputy out front about it ashton laughed its only a webcam anyway medium resolution he held up the small video camera youre not going to ask me questions are you she was growing panicky at the thought jims blog alone had hundreds of thousands of viewers greg ashtons probably had many more i wouldnt know what to say itll be sound bites just talk about what its like to be married to a blogger her husband laughed ill bet she has plenty to say we can do as many takes as you want ashton set a tripod up in the corner of the room and mounted the camera jim straightened his desktop organizing the dozens of stacks of journals and papers ashton laughed and shook a finger we want it authentic jim another laugh okay fair enough jim replaced the papers and magazines patrizia looked at herself in a small decorative mirror up on the wall and ran her fingers through her hair no she decided defiantly she was going to get fixed up no matter what he said she turned to tell ashton this she had only a moment to blink and no time to protect herself when ashtons fist swung directly into her cheek and collided hard with bone breaking skin and knocking her to the floor eyes wide in horror and bewilderment jim leapt toward him and froze as ashton thrust a gun into his face no patrizia cried scrabbling to her feet dont hurt him ashton tossed patrizia a roll of duct tape and ordered her to bind her husbands hands behind him she hesitated do it hands shaking tears streaming confused she did as shed been told honey she whispered as she wrapped his hand behind the chair im scared do what he says her husband told her then he glared at ashton what the hell is this ashton ignored him and dragged patrizia by the hair to the corner she squealed tears falling nono it hurts no ashton taped her hands as well who are you jim whispered but patrizia chilton could answer that one herself greg ashton was the roadside cross killer ashton noticed jim looking outside he muttered the deputy hes dead theres nobody to help you ashton pointed the video camera at jims pale horrified face tears welling in his eyes you want more hits on your precious report chilton well youre going to get em ill bet itll be a record i dont think weve ever seen a blogger killed on webcam before chapter kathryn dance was back at cbi headquarters she was disappointed to learn that jonathan boling had returned to santa cruz but since hed come up with the platinum findstryker well jasonthere wasnt much else for him to do at the moment rey carraneo called in with some interesting news he explained that clint avery had left his company ten minutes ago the agent had followed him along the winding roads in the pastures of heaven the name that literary legend john steinbeck had given to the lush agriculturally fertile area there hed stopped twice on the shoulder both times hed met with someone first two somber mendressed like cowboysin a fancy pickup truck the second time a whitehaired man in a nice suit behind the wheel of a cadillac the meetings seemed suspicious avery was clearly nervous carraneo had gotten the plates and was running profiles avery was now headed toward carmel carraneo right behind him dance was discouraged shed hoped that her meeting with avery would flush the construction bossforce him to speed to a safe house where hed stashed evidenceand perhaps travis himself but apparently not still the men averyd met with mightve been hired guns who were behind the killings the dmv report would give her some clues if not answers tj stuck his head in her doorway hey boss you still interested in hamilton royce the man who was probably at that very moment considering how to bring her career down in flames give me a oneminute précis a what tj asked synopsis summary digest précis is a word learn something new every day okay royces a former lawyer

get going on it too the young agent handed her a sheet of paper ill give you the small list he said because youre my favorite boss dance looked over the names considering how best to proceed she heard in her mind jon bolings words we give away too much information about ourselves online way too much kathryn dance decided shed get to the official databases in a whilenational criminal information center violent criminal apprehension program california open warrants and consolidated dmv for now shed stick to google greg schaeffer studied james chilton who sat bloodied and frightened before him schaeffer had been using the pseudonym greg ashton to get close to chilton without arousing suspicions because the name schaeffer might raise alarms in the blogger but then again it might not have it wouldnt surprise schaeffer one bit if chilton regularly forgot about the victims who suffered because of his blog this thought infuriated schaeffer all the more and when chilton started to sputter why he slugged him once more the bloggers head snapped back against the upper part of his desk chair and he grunted which was all fine but the son of a bitch wasnt looking terrified enough to satisfy schaeffer ashton whyre you doing this schaeffer leaned forward gripped chilton by the collar he whispered youre going to read a statement if you dont sound sincere if you dont sound remorseful your wife will die your children too i know theyll be home from camp soon ive been following them i know the schedule he turned to chiltons wife and i know your brothers with them hes a big guy but hes not bulletproof oh god no patrizia gasped dissolving into tears please and now at last there was real fear in chiltons face no dont hurt my family please pleaseill do whatever you want just dont hurt them read the statement and sound like you mean it schaeffer warned then ill leave them alone ill tell you chilton ive got nothing but sympathy for them they deserve a better life than being with a piece of shit like you ill read it the blogger said but who are you why are you doing this you owe me an answer schaeffer was seized by a wave of fury owe you he growled owe you you arrogant asshole he slammed his fist into chiltons cheek once more leaving the man stunned i owe you nothing he leaned forwards and snapped who am i who am i do you know anybody whose lives you destroy no of course not because you sit in that fucking chair a million miles away from real life and you say whatever you want to say you type some shit on your keyboard send it out into the world and then youre on to something else does the concept of consequences mean anything to you accountability i try to be accurate if i got something wrong schaeffer burned you are so fucking blind you dont understand you can be factually right and still be wrong do you have to tell every secret in the world do you have to destroy lives for no reasonexcept your ratings please does the name anthony schaeffer mean anything to you chiltons eyes closed momentarily oh when he opened them again they were filled with understanding and perhaps remorse but that didnt move schaeffer one bit at least chilton remembered the man hed destroyed patrizia asked whos that who does he mean jim tell her chilton the blogger sighed he was a gay man who killed himself after i outed him a few years ago and he was my brother his voice cracked im sorry sorry schaeffer scoffed i apologized for what happened i never wanted him to die you must know that i felt terrible schaeffer turned to patrizia your husband the voice of the moral and just universe didnt like it that a deacon in a church could also be gay chilton snapped back that wasnt the reason he headed a big antigay marriage campaign in california i was attacking his hypocrisy not his sexual orientation and his immorality he was married he had childrenbut when he was on business trips hed call up gay prostitutes he was cheating on his wife sometimes with three men a night the bloggers defiance was back and schaeffer wanted to hit him once more so he did hard and fast tony was struggling to find gods path he slipped a few times and you made it sound like he was a monster you never even gave him a chance to explain god was helping him find the way well god wasnt doing a very good job not if the fist struck again jim dont argue with him please chilton lowered his head finally he looked desperate and filled with sorrow and fear schaeffer enjoyed the delicious sense of the mans despair read the statement all right ill do whatever you want ill read it but my familyplease the agony in chiltons face was like fine wine to schaeffer you have my word on it he said this sincerely though he was reflecting that patrizia would outlive her husband by no more than two secondsa humane act in the end she wouldnt want to go on without him besides she was a witness as for the children no he wouldnt kill them for one thing they werent due home for nearly an hour and hed be long gone by then also he wanted the sympathy of the world killing the blogger and his wife was one thing the children were something else beneath the camera schaeffer taped a piece of the paper containing the statement hed written that morning it was a moving pieceand had been drafted in a way to make sure that nobody would associate the crime with him chilton cleared his throat and looked down he began to read this is a statement his voice broke beautiful schaeffer kept the camera running chilton started over this is a statement to those whove been reading my blog the chilton report over the years there is nothing more precious in the world than a mans reputation and i have devoted my life to needlessly and randomly destroying the reputations of many fine upstanding citizens he was doing a good job its easy to buy a cheap computer and a website and some blog software and in five minutes youve got a venue for your personal opinionsa venue that will be seen by millions of people around the world this leads to an intoxicating sense of power but its a power that isnt earned its a power thats stolen ive written many things about people that were merely rumors those rumors spread and they became accepted as the truth even though they were total lies because of my blog the life of a young man travis brigham has been destroyed he has nothing more to live for and neither do i he has sought justice against the people who attacked him people who were my friends and now hes rendering justice against me im ultimately responsible for destroying his life glorious tears were streaking down his face schaeffer was in purest heaven i now accept responsibility for destroying traviss reputation and those of the others ive carelessly written about the sentence that travis now serves on me will stand as a warning to others the truth is sacred rumors are not the truth now goodbye he inhaled deeply and looked at his wife schaeffer was satisfied the man had done a good job he paused the webcam and checked the screen only chilton was in the image the wife wasnt he didnt want an image of her death just the bloggers he pulled back a bit so the mans entire torso was visible hed shoot him once in the heart and let him die on camera then upload the post to a number of social networking sites and to other blogs schaeffer estimated it would take two minutes for the video to appear on youtube and would be viewed by several million people before the company took it down by then though the pirate software that allowed the downloading of streaming videos would have captured it and the footage would spread throughout the world like cancer cells theyll find you chilton muttered the police but they wont be looking for me theyll be looking for travis brigham and frankly i dont think anybodys going to be looking very hard youve got a lot of enemies chilton he cocked the gun no patrizia chilton wailed desperately frantic schaeffer resisted a tempting impulse to shoot her first he kept the gun steady on his target and noted a resigned and it seemed ironic smile crossing james chiltons face schaeffer hit the record button on the camera again and began to pull the trigger when he heard freeze the voice was coming from the open office doorway drop the weapon now jolted schaeffer glanced back at a slim young latino man in a white shirt sleeves rolled up pointing a weapon his way a badge on his hip no how had they found him schaeffer kept the gun steadily on the bloggers chest and snapped to the cop you drop it lower the weapon was the officers measured reply this is your only warning schaeffer growled if you shoot me ill he saw a yellow flash sensed a tap to his head and then the universe went black chapter the dead rolled the living walked the body of greg ashtonit was really greg schaeffer dance had learnedwas wheeled down the stairs and over the lawn on the rickety gurney to the coroners bus while james and patrizia chilton walked slowly to an ambulance another casualty everyone was horrified to learn was the mcso deputy whod been guarding the chiltons miguel herrera schaeffer as ashton had stopped at herreras car the guard had called patrizia and been told that the man was expected then schaeffer had apparently shoved the gun against herreras jacket and fired twice the proximity to the body muting the sound the deputys supervisor from the mcso was present along with a dozen other deputies shaken furious at the murder as for the walking wounded the chiltons didnt seem too badly hurt dance was however keeping an eye on rey carraneowhod been the first on the scene spotted the dead deputy and raced into the house after calling for backup hed seen schaeffer about to shoot chilton carraneo gave the killer a bythebook warning but when the man had tried to negotiate the agent had simply fired two very efficient rounds into his head discussions with guntoting suspects only occur in movies and tv showsand bad ones at that police never lower or set down their weapons and they never hesitate to take out a target if one presents itself rules number one two and three are shoot and he had superficially the young agent seemed fine his body language unchanged from the professional upright posture he wore like a rented tux but his eyes told a different story revealing the words looping through his mind at the moment i just killed a man i just killed a man shed make sure he took some time off with pay a car pulled up and michael oneil climbed out he spotted dance and joined her the quiet deputy wasnt smiling im sorry michael she gripped his arm oneil had known miguel herrera for several years just shot him down thats right his eyes closed briefly jesus wife no divorced but hes got a grown son hes already been notified oneil otherwise so calm with a facade that revealed so little looked with chilling hatred at the green bag containing greg schaeffers body another voice intruded weak unsteady thank you they turned to face the man whod spoken james chilton wearing dark slacks a white tshirt and a navy blue vneck sweater the blogger seemed like a chaplain humbled by battlefront carnage his wife was at his side are you all right dance asked them im fine yes thank you just beat up a bit cuts and bruises patrizia chilton said she too wasnt seriously injured oneil nodded to them and asked chilton who was he dance answered anthony schaeffers brother chilton gave a blink of surprise you figured it out she explained to oneil about ashtons real name thats the interesting thing about the internetthose roleplaying games and sites like second life you can create whole new identities for yourself schaeffers been spending the past few months seeding the name greg ashton around online as this blogging and rss maven he did that to seduce his way into chiltons life i outed his brother anthony in a blog several years ago chilton explained he was the one i told agent dance about when i first met herone of the things i regretted about the blogthat he killed himself oneil asked dance how did you find out about him tj and i were checking out the suspects it wasnt likely that arnold brubaker was the killer i was still suspicious of clint averythe guy behind the highway projectbut we didnt have anything specific yet so i was working on the list of people whod sent james threats the small list chilton said anthony schaeffers wife was on the list sure shed threatened me a few years ago dance continued i went online to find out as many details about her as i could i found her wedding pictures the best man at their wedding was greg anthonys brother i recognized him from when i came to your house the other day i checked him out he traveled here on an open ticket about two weeks ago as soon as shed learned this shed called miguel herrera but couldnt get through so she sent rey carraneo here the agent following clint avery was not far from chiltons house oneil asked did schaeffer say anything about travis dance showed him the plastic envelope containing the handwritten note with the references to travis making it seem that the boy was the one about to shoot chilton hes dead you think oneils and dances eyes met she said im not going on that assumption ultimately sure schaefferd have to kill the boy but he might not have done it yet he might want to make it look like travis killed himself after hed finished with chilton make the case tidier that means he could still be alive the senior deputy took a phone call he stepped away eyes straying to the mcso car where herrera had been so ruthlessly killed he disconnected after a moment got to head off have to interview a witness you interviewing she chided michael oneils technique at interviewing involved gazing unsmilingly at the subject and asking him over and over again to tell oneil what he knew it could be effective but it wasnt efficient and oneil didnt really enjoy it he consulted his watch any chance you could do me a favor name it annes flight from san francisco was delayed i cant miss this interview can you pick up the kids at day care sure im going to get wes and maggie after camp anyway meet me at fishermans wharf at five sure oneil headed off with yet another dark glance at herreras car chilton gripped his wifes hand dance recognized postures that bespoke a graze with mortality she thought back to the arrogant selfrighteous crusader chilton had been when she first met him very different now she recalled that something about him seemed to have softened earlierwhen hed learned that his friend don hawken and his wife had nearly been killed now thered been another shift away from the stony visage of a missionary the man gave a bitter smile oh did he sucker me in he played right to my fucking ego jim no honey he did you know thiss all my fault schaeffer picked travis he read through the blog found somebody whod be a good candidate to be a fall guy and set up a seventeenyearold boy as my killer if i hadnt started the roadside crosses thread and mentioned the accident schaeffer wouldnt have any incentive to go after him he was right but kathryn dance tended to avoid the whatif game the playing field was far too soupy he wouldve picked somebody else she pointed out he was determined to get revenge against you but chilton didnt seem to hear i should just shut the fucking blog down altogether dance saw resolve in his eyes frustration anger fear too she believed speaking to both of them he said firmly im going to to what his wife asked shut it down the reports finished im not destroying anybody elses life jim patrizia said softly she brushed some dirt off her sleeve when our son had pneumonia you sat beside his bed for two days and didnt get a bit of sleep when dons wife died you walked right out of that meeting at microsoft headquarters to be there for himyou gave up a hundredthousanddollar contract when my dad was dying you were with him more than the hospice people you do good things jim thats what youre about and your blog does good things too i shhh let me finish donald hawken needed you and you were there our children needed you and you were there well the world needs you too honey you cant turn your back on that patty people died just promise me you wont make any decisions too fast this has been a terrible couple of days nobodys thinking clearly a lengthy pause ill see ill see then he hugged his wife but one thing i do know is that i can go on hiatus for a few days and were going to get away from here chilton said to his wife lets go up to hollister tomorrow well spend a long weekend with donald and lily you still havent met her well bring the boys cook outdo some hiking patrizias face blossomed into a smile she rested her head against his shoulders id like that hed turned his attention to dance theres something ive been thinking about she cocked an eyebrow a lot of people wouldve thrown me to the wolves and i probably deserved to be thrown but you didnt you didnt like me you didnt approve but you stood up for me thats intellectual honesty you dont see that much thank you dance gave a faint embarrassed laugh acknowledging the complimenteven as she thought of the times when she had wanted to throw him to the wolves the chiltons returned to the house to finish packing and arrange for a motel that nightpatrizia didnt want to stay in the house until the office had been scrubbed clean of every trace of schaeffers blood dance could hardly blame her the agent now joined the mcso crime scene chief an easygoing middleaged officer shed worked with for several years she explained that there was a possibility that travis might still be alive stashed in a hideout somewhere which meant hed have a dwindling supply of food and water she had to locate him and soon you find a room key on the body yep cyprus grove inn i want the room and schaeffers clothes and his car gone over with a microscope look for anything that might give us a clue where he mightve put the boy you bet kathryn she returned to her car phoning tj you got him boss i heard yep but now i want to find the boy if hes alive we may only have a day or two until he starves to death or dies of thirst allout on this one mcsos running the scenes at chiltons house and at the cyprus grovewhere schaeffer was staying call peter bennington and ride herd on the reports call michael if you need to oh and find me witnesses in nearby rooms at the cyprus grove sure boss and contact chp county and city police i want to find the last roadside crossthe one schaeffer left to announce chiltons death peter should go over it with every bit of equipment theyve got another thought occurred to her did you ever hear back about that state vehicle oh that pfister saw right yeah nobodys called i dont think were prioritized try again and make it a priority you coming in boss overbearing wants to see you tj sorry ill be in later ive got to follow up on one thing you need help she said she didnt though the truth was she sure as hell didnt want to do this one solo chapter sitting in her car parked in the driveway dance gazed at the brighams small house the sad lean of the gutters and curl of the shingles the dismembered toys and tools in the front and side yards the garage so filled with discards that you couldnt get more than half a car hood under its roof dance was sitting in the drivers seat of her crown vic the door shut listening to a cd she and martine had been sent from a group in los angeles the musicians were costa rican she found the music both cheerful and mysterious and wanted to know more about them shed hoped that when she and michael were in la on the j doe murder case shed have a chance to meet with them and do some more recordings but she couldnt think about that now she heard the rumble of rubber on gravel and looked into the rearview mirror to see sonia brighams car pause as it turned past the hedge of boxwood the woman was alone in the front seat sammy sat in the back the car didnt move for a long moment and dance could see the woman staring desperately at the police cruiser finally sonia eased her battered car forward again and drove past dance to the front of the house braked and shut the engine off with a fast look dances way the woman climbed out and strode to the back of the car and lifted out the laundry baskets and a large bottle of tide his families so poor that they cant even afford a washer and drier who goes to laundromats lusers thats who the blog post that told schaeffer where to find a sweatshirt to steal to help him frame travis dance climbed out of her own vehicle sammy looked at her with a probing expression the curiosity of their first meeting was gone now he was uneasy his eyes were eerily adult you know something about travis he asked and didnt sound as odd as he had earlier but before dance could say anything his mother shooed him off to play in the backyard he hesitated still staring at dance then wandered off uncomfortable fishing in his pockets dont go far sammy dance took the bottle of detergent from under sonias pale arm and followed her toward the house sonias jaw was firm eyes straight forward mrs i have to put this away sonia brigham said in a clipped tone dance opened the unlocked door for her she followed sonia inside the woman moved straight into the kitchen and separated the baskets if you let them sitthe wrinkles you know what its like she smoothed a tshirt woman to woman i washed it thinking i could give it to him mrs brigham there are some things you should know travis wasnt driving the car on june he took the blame what she stopped fussing with her laundry he had a crush on the girl who was driving shed been drinking he tried to get her to pull over and let him drive she crashed before that happened oh heavens sonia lifted the shirt to her face as if it could ward off the impending tears and he wasnt the killer leaving the crosses someone set it up to make it seem like hed left them and caused those deaths a man with a grudge against james chilton we stopped him and travis sonia asked desperately fingers white as they gripped the shirt we dont know where he is were looking everywhere but we havent found any leads yet dance explained briefly about greg schaeffer and his plan for revenge sonia wiped her round cheeks there was prettiness still in her face though obscured the remnants of the prettiness evident in the picture of her in the state fair stall taken years earlier sonia whispered i knew travis wouldnt hurt those people i told you that yes you did dance thought and your body language told me that you were telling the truth i didnt listen to you i listened to logic when i should have listened to intuition long ago dance had done a myersbriggs analysis of herself she got into trouble when she strayed too far from her nature she replaced the shirt smoothed the cotton again hes dead isnt he we have no evidence he is absolutely none but you think so itd be logical for schaeffer to keep him alive im doing everything we can to save him thats one of the reasons im here she displayed a picture of greg schaeffer a copy from his dmv picture have you ever seen him maybe following you talking to neighbors sonia pulled on battered glasses and looked at the face for a long time no i cant say i have so hes him the one done it took my boy yes i told you no good would come of that blog her eyes slipped toward the side yard where sammy was disappearing into the ramshackle shed she sighed if travis is gone telling sammyoh thatll destroy him ill be losing two sons at once now ive got to put the laundry away please go now dance and oneil stood next to each other on the pier leaning against the railing the fog was gone but the wind was steady around monterey bay you always had one or the other traviss mother oneil said speaking loudly that was tough ill bet hardest part of it all she said her hair flying then asked him how was the interview thinking of the indonesian investigation the other case good she was glad oneil was running the case regretted her jealousy terrorism kept all law enforcers up nights if you need anything from me let me know his eyes on the bay he said i think well wrap it in the next twentyfour hours below them were their children the four of them on the sand at waters edge maggie and wes led the expedition being grandchildren of a marine biologist they had some authority pelicans flew solemnly nearby gulls were everywhere and not far offshore a brown curl of sea otter floated easily on its back inverted elegance it happily smashed open mollusks against a rock balanced on its chest dinner oneils daughter amanda and maggie stared at it gleefully as if trying to figure out how to get it home as a pet dance touched oneils arm and pointed at tenyearold tyler who was crouching beside a long whip of kelp and poking it cautiously ready to flee if the alien creature came to life wes stood protectively near in case it did oneil smiled but she sensed from his stance and the tension in his arm that something was bothering him only a moment later he explained calling over the blast of wind i heard from los angeles the defense is trying to move the immunity hearing back again two weeks oh no dance muttered two weeks the grand jurys scheduled for then seybolds going allout to fight it he didnt sound optimistic hell dance grimaced war of attrition keep stalling and hope it all goes away probably we wont she said firmly you and me we wont go away but will seybold and the others oneil considered this if it takes much more time maybe its an important case but they have a lot of important cases dance sighed she shivered you cold her forearm was docked against his she shook her head the involuntary ripple had come from thinking of travis as shed been looking over the water shed wondered if she was also gazing at his grave a gull hovered directly in front of them the angle of attack of his wings adjusted perfectly for the velocity of the wind he was immobile twenty feet above the beach dance said all along you know even when we thought he was the killer i felt sorry for travis his home life the fact hes a misfit getting cyberbullied like that and jon was telling me the blog was just the tip of the iceberg people were attacking him in instant messages emails on other bulletin boards its just so sad its turned out this way he was innocent completely innocent oneil said nothing for a moment then he seems sharp boling i mean he is getting the names of the victims and tracking down traviss avatar oneil laughed sorry but i keep picturing you going to overby about a warrant for a character in a computer game oh hed do the paperwork in a minute if he thought there was a press conference and a good photo op involved i couldve beaned jon though for going to that arcade alone playing hero yep save us from amateurs he married have a family jon no she laughed hes a bachelor now theres a word you havent heard forabout a century they fell silent watching the children who were totally lost in their seaside exploration maggie was holding her hand out and pointing to something probably explaining to oneils children the name of a shell shed found wes dance noted was by himself standing on a damp flat the water easing up close to his feet in foamy lines and as she often did dance wondered if her children would be better off if she had a husband and they had a home with a father well of course they would depending on the man of course there was always that a womans voice behind them excuse me are those your children they turned to see a tourist to judge by the bag she held from a nearby souvenir shop thats right dance said i just wanted to say that its so nice to see a happily married couple with such lovely children how long have you been married a millisecond pause dance answered oh for some time well bless you stay happy the woman joined an elderly man leaving a gift shop she took his arm and they headed toward a large tour bus parked nearby dance and oneil laughed then she noticed a silver lexus pull up in a nearby parking lot as the door opened she was aware that oneil had eased away from her slightly so that their arms no longer touched the deputy smiled and waved to his wife as she climbed from the lexus tall blond anne oneil wearing a leather jacket peasant blouse long skirt and belt of dangly metal smiled as she approached hello honey she said to oneil and hugged him kissed his cheek her eyes lit on dance kathryn hi anne welcome home the flight was awful i got tied up at the gallery and didnt make it in time to check my bag i was right on the borderline i was in an interview oneil told her kathryn picked up tyler and ammie oh thanks mike said youve closed the case that one about the roadside crosses a few hours ago lot of paperwork but yeah its done not wanting to talk about it any longer dance said hows the photo exhibition going getting ready said anne oneil whose hair brought to mind the word lioness curatings more work than taking the pictures which gallery oh just gerry mitchells south of market the tone was dismissive but dance guessed the gallery was well known whatever else anne never flaunted ego congratulations well see what happens at the opening then there are the reviews afterward her sleek face grew solemn in a low voice im sorry about your mother kathryn its all crazy hows she holding up pretty upset its like a circus the newspaper stories it made the news up there a hundred and thirty miles away well dance shouldntve been surprised not with the prosecutor robert harper playing the media game weve got a good attorney if theres anything i can do the ends of annes metal belt tinkled like a wind chime in the breeze oneil called down to the beach hey guys your mothers here come on cant we stay dad tyler pleaded nope time to get home come on reluctantly the children trudged toward the adults maggie was dispensing shells dance was sure shed be giving the good ones to the oneil children and her brother wes and maggie piled into dances pathfinder for the short ride to the inn where her parents were staying once again theyd spend the night with edie and stuart the perp was dead so the threat to her personally was gone but dance was adamant about finding travis alive shed possibly be working late into the night they were halfway to the inn when dance noticed that wes had grown quiet hey young man whats up just wondering dance knew how to reel in details from reluctant children the trick was patience about what she was sure it had to do with his grandmother but it didnt is mr boling coming over again jon why just the matrixs on tnt tomorrow maybe he hasnt seen it ill bet he has dance was always amused by the way children assumed that theyre the first to experience something and that prior generations lived in sorrowful ignorance and deprivation mostly though she was surprised that the boy had even asked the question you like mr boling she ventured noi mean hes okay maggie contradicted you said you liked him you said he was neat as neat as michael i did not yes you did maggie you are so wrong all right dance commanded but her tone was amused in fact there was something about the sibling bickering that she found comforting a bit of normalcy in this turbulent time they arrived at the inn and dance was relieved to see that the protestors still had not found the location where her parents were hiding out she walked wes and maggie to the front door her father greeted her she hugged him hard and looked inside her mother was on the phone focusing on what was apparently a serious conversation dance wondered if she was talking to her sister betsey any word from sheedy dad nothing more no the arraignments tomorrow afternoon he brushed absently at his thick hair i heard you got the fellow that killer and the boy was innocent were looking for him right now her voice lowered so the children couldnt hear frankly the odds are hes dead but im hoping for the best she hugged the man ive got to get back to the search now good luck honey as she turned to leave she waved once more to her mother edie reciprocated with a distant smile and nod then still on the phone gestured her grandchildren to her and gave them big hugs ten minutes later dance walked into her office where a message awaited her a curt note from charles overby could you send me the report on disposition of the chilton blog case all the details sufficient for a meaningful announcement to the press will need within the hour thank you and youre welcome for a case solved a perp dead and no more victims overby was pissy she supposed because shed refused to kowtow to hamilton royce the fixer who was about as far from george clooney as one could be meaningful announcement dance composed a lengthy memo giving the details of greg schaeffers plan how theyd learned of his identity and his death she included information about the murder of miguel herrera the deputy with the mcso guarding the chilton house and the update on the allout search for travis she sent the memo off via email hitting the mouse harder than usual tj stuck his head in the door of her office you hear boss about what in particular kelley morgans regained consciousness shell live oh thats so good to hear be a week or so in therapy the deputy over there said that stuff screwed up her lungs pretty bad but shell be okay eventually looks like there wont be any brain damage and whatd she say about iding travis he got her from behind half strangled her he whispered something about whyd she posted things about him and then she passed out woke up in the basement assumed it was travis so schaeffer didnt want her to die he set it up to make her think it was travis but never let her see him makes sense boss and crime sceneat schaeffers and chiltons any leads to where the boy might be nothing yet and no witnesses around the cyprus grove she sighed keep at it the time was now after pm she realized she hadnt eaten since breakfast she rose and made for the lunchroom she needed coffee and wanted something indulgent homemade cookies or doughnuts maryellens well in the gals wing had run dry at the least she could enter a negotiation with the temperamental vending machine a rumpled dollar in exchange for a packet of toasted peanut butter crackers or oreos as she stepped into the cafeteria she blinked ah luck on a paper plate full of crumbs sat two oatmeal raisin cookies more of a miracle the coffee was relatively fresh she poured a cup added percent milk and snagged a cookie exhausted she plunked herself down at a table she stretched and fished her ipod out of her pocket mounting the ear buds and scrolling through the screen to find solace in more of badi assads arresting brazilian guitar she hit play took a bite of cookie and was reaching for the coffee when a shadow hovered hamilton royce was looking down at her his temporary id was pinned to his shirt the big mans arms hung at his sides just what i need if thoughts could sigh hers would have been clearly audible agent dance can i join you she gestured to an empty chair trying not to look too invitational but she did pull out the ear buds he sat the chair squeaking plastic and metal in tension under his frame and leaned forward elbows on the table hands clasped in front of him this position generally signifies directness she noted his suit again the blue didnt work not dark enough or alternatively she thought unkindly he should be wearing a sailors hat with a shiny brim i heard the case is over correct weve got the perp were still searching for the boy for travis royce asked surprised thats right but hes dead dont you think no oh a pause thats the one thing i regret royce said thats the worst of it all that innocent boy dance noted that this reaction at least was honest she said nothing more royce offered ill be headed back to sacramento in a day or two look i know we had some problems earlier well disagreements i wanted to apologize decent of him though she remained skeptical she said we saw things differently i didnt take any offense not personally but professionally she thought i was totally pissed you tried to flank me there was a lot of pressure from sacramento i mean a lot i got carried away in the heat of the moment he looked away partly embarrassed and partly deceptive too he didnt feel that bad dance noticed but she gave him credit for trying to make nice he continued not often that youre in a situation like this is it where you have to protect somebody as unpopular as chilton he didnt seem to expect an answer he gave a hollow laugh you know something in a funny way ive come to admire him chilton a nod i dont agree with much of what he says but hes got moral character and not a lot of people do nowadays even in the face of a murder threat he stayed the course and hell probably keep right on going dont you think i assume so she said nothing about the possible termination of the chilton report that wasnt her business or royces you know what id like to do apologize to him too would you i tried his house nobody was answering do you know where he is he and his familyre going to their vacation home in hollister tomorrow tonight theyre staying at a hotel i dont know where their house is a crime scene well i suppose i could email him at his blog she was wondering if this would ever happen then silence time for my exit dance thought she snagged the last cookie wrapped it in a napkin and headed for the lunchroom door have a safe drive mr royce again im truly sorry agent dance i look forward to working with you in the future her kinesic skills easily fired off a message that his comment had contained two lies chapter jonathan boling looking pleased was walking up to dance in the lobby of the cbi she handed him a temporary pass thanks for coming in i was beginning to miss the place i thought id been fired she smiled when shed called him in santa cruz shed interrupted a papergrading session for one of his summer school courses shed wondered if she would catch him prepping for a date and boling had been delighted to abandon the job and drive back to monterey in her office she handed him his last assignment greg schaeffers laptop im really desperate to find travis or his body can you go through it look for any references to local locations driving directions mapsanything like that sure he indicated the toshiba passworded not this time good he opened the lid and began to type ill search for everything with a file access or creation date in the past two weeks does that sound good sure dance tried not to smile once more watching him lean forward enthusiastically his fingers played over the keys like a concert pianists after a few moments he sat back well it doesnt look like he used it for much of his mission here other than to research for blogs and rss feeds and emails to friends and business associatesand none of them have anything to do with his plot to kill chilton but those are just the undeleted records hes been deleting files and websites regularly for the past week those id guess might be more what youre interested in yep can you reconstruct them ill go online and download one of irvs bots thatll roam the free space on his c drive and put back together anything hes deleted recently some of it will be only partial and some will be distorted but most of the files should be ninety percent readable thatd be great jon five minutes later irvs bot was silently roaming through schaeffers computer looking for fragments of deleted files reassembling them and storing them in a new folder that boling had created how long she asked a couple of hours id guess boling looked at his watch and suggested they get a bite of dinner they climbed into his audi and headed to a restaurant not far from cbi headquarters on a rise overlooking the airport and beyond that the city of monterey and the bay they got a table on the deck warmed with overhead propane heaters and sipped a viognier white wine the sun was now melting into the pacific spreading out and growing violently orange they watched it in silence as tourists nearby snapped pictures that would have to be photoshopped to even approximate the grandeur of the real event they talked about her children about their own childhoods where they were from originally boling commented that he believed only twenty percent of the central coast population comprised native californians silence flowed between them again dance sensed his shoulders rising and was expecting what came next can i ask you something sure she meant it no reservations when did your husband die about two years ago two years two months three weeks she could give him the days and hours too ive never lost anybody not like that though there was a wistfulness in his voice and his eyelids flickered like venetian blinds troubled by the wind what happened you mind if i ask not at all bill was an fbi agent assigned to the local resident agency but it wasnt workrelated an accident on highway one a truck the driver fell asleep a wisp of a laugh you know i never thought about it until just now but his fellow agents and friends put flowers by the roadside for about a year after it happened a cross no just flowers she shook her head god i hated that the reminder id drive miles out of my way to avoid the place mustve been terrible dance tried not to practice her skills as a kinesics expert when she was out socially sometimes shed read the kids sometimes shed read a date but she remembered when shed caught wes in some minor lie and he grumbled its like youre superman mom youve got xray word vision now she was aware that although bolings face kept its sympathetic smile his body language had subtly changed the grip on his wineglass stem tightened on his free hand fingers rubbed compulsively behaviors she knew he wasnt even aware of dance just needed to prime the pump come on jon your turn to spill whats your story youve been pretty vague on the bachelor topic oh nothing like your situation he was minimizing something that hurt she could see that she wasnt even a therapist let alone his but theyd spent some time under fire and she wanted to know what was troubling him she touched his arm briefly come on remember i interrogate people for a living ill get it out of you sooner or later i never go out with somebody who wants to waterboard me on the first date well depending jon boling dance had come to realize was a man who used clever quips as armor he continued this is the worst soap opera youll ever hear the girl i met after leaving silicon valley she ran a bookstore in santa cruz bay beach books i think ive been there we hit it off real well cassie and i did a lot of outdoor things together had some great times traveling she even survived some visits to my familywell actually its only me who has trouble surviving those he thought for a minute i think the thing is that we laughed a lot thats a clue what kind of movies do you like best we watched comedies mostly okay she was separated not divorced legal separation cassie was completely honest about it i knew it all up front she was getting the paperwork together children she had two yes boy and girl like you great kids split the time between her and her ex you mean her notquiteex dance corrected silently and of course knew the arc of the story he sipped some more of the cold crisp wine a breeze had come up and as the sun melted the temperature fell her ex was abusive not physically he never hurt her or the kids but hed insult her put her down he gave an astonished laugh this wasnt right that wasnt right she was smart kind thoughtful but he just kept dumping on her i was thinking about this last night his voice faded at that comment having just given away a bit of data he wished he hadnt he was an emotional serial killer thats a good way to put it and naturally she went back to him his face was still for a moment as he relived a specific incident she supposed our hearts rarely respond to the abstract its the tiny slivers of sharp memory that sting so then the facade returned in the form of a tightlipped smile he got transferred to china and they went with him cassie and the kids she said she was sorry shed always love me but she had to go back to him never quite got the obligatory part in relationships like you have to breathe you have to eatbut staying with a jerk i dont get the necessary but here i am going on aboutoh shall we say an epic bad call on my part and you had a real tragedy dance shrugged in my line of work whether its murder or manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide a deaths still a death just like love when it goes away for whatever reason it hurts all the same i guess but all ill say is its a real bad idea to fall in love with somebody whos married amen thought kathryn dance again and nearly laughed out loud she tipped a touch more wine into her glass how bout that he said what weve managed to bring up two extremely personal and depressing topics in a very short period of time good thing were not on a date he added with a grin dance opened the menu lets get some food they have the best calamari burgers in town here boling said she laughed shed been about to say exactly the same the computer search was a bust she and the professor returned from their squid and salads to her office both eager to see what irvs bot had found boling sat down scrolled through the file and announced with a sigh zip nothing he just deleted those emails and files and research to save space nothing secretive and nothing local at all the frustration was keen but there was nothing more to do thanks jon at least i got a nice dinner out of it sorry he looked truly disappointed that he couldnt be of more help i guess i better finish up grading those papers and pack thats right your family reunions this weekend he nodded a tight smile and he said woooohoooo with forced enthusiasm dance laughed he hovered near her ill call you when i get back i want to know how things work out and good luck with travis i hope hes okay thanks jon for everything she took his hand and gripped it firmly and i especially appreciate your not getting stabbed to death a smile he squeezed her hand and turned away as she watched him walk down the corridor a womans voice interrupted her thoughts hey k dance turned to see connie ramirez walking down the hallway toward her con the other senior agent looked around and nodded toward dances office then stepped inside closing the door found a few things i thought you might be interested in from the hospital oh thanks con howd you do it ramirez considered this i was deceptively honest i like that i flashed my shield and gave them some details of another case im running that medical fraud case the cbi investigated financial crimes too and the case ramirez was referring to was a major insurance scamthe perps used identification numbers of doctors who were deceased to file bogus claims in their names it was the sort of thing dance reflected that chilton himself might write about in his blog and it was a brilliant choice for connie staffers at the hospital were among the victims and would have an interest in helping investigators i asked them to show me the login sheets the whole months worth so henry didnt get suspicious they were more than happy to comply and heres what i found the day juan millar died there was one visiting physicianthe hospital has a continuinged lecture series and he was probably there for that there were also six job applicantstwo for maintenance spots one for the cafeteria and three nurses ive got copies of their résumés none of them look suspicious to me now whats interesting is this there were sixtyfour visitors at the hospital that day i correlated the names and the people they were there to see and every one of them checks out except one who its hard to read the name either the printed version or the signature but i think its jose lopez who was he seeing he only wrote patient that was a safe bet in a hospital dance said wryly why is it suspicious well i figured that if somebody was there to kill juan millar he or she would have to have been there beforeeither as visitors or to check out security and so on so i looked at everybody whod signed in to see him earlier brilliant and you checked their handwriting exactly im no document examiner but i found a visitor whod been to see him a number of times and id almost guarantee the handwritings the same as this jose lopezs dance was sitting forward who julio millar his brother im ninety percent sure i made copies of everything ramirez handed dance sheets of paper oh connie this is brilliant good luck if you need anything else just ask dance sat alone in her office considering this new information could julio actually have killed his brother at first it seemed impossible given the loyalty and love that julio displayed for his young sibling yet there was no doubt that the killing had been an act of mercy and dance could imagine a conversation between the two brothersjulio leaning forward as juan whispered a plea to put him out of his misery kill me besides why else would julio have faked a name on the signin sheet why had harper and the state investigators missed this connection she was furious and had a suspicion that they knew about it but were downplaying the possibility because it would be better publicity against the deathwithdignity act for robert harper to go after the mother of a state law enforcement agent thoughts of prosecutorial malfeasance buzzed around her head dance called george sheedy and left a message about what connie ramirez had found she then called her mother to tell her directly about it there was no answer damnit was she screening calls she disconnected then sat back thinking about travis if he was alive how much longer would he have a few days without water and what a terrible death it would be another shadow in her doorway tj scanlon appeared hey boss she sensed something was urgent crime scene results not yet but im riding em hard rawhide remember thiss something else heard from mcso they got a callanonymousabout the crosses case dance sat up slightly what was it the caller said hed spotted quote something near harrison road and pine grove way just south of carmel nothing more than that nope just something i checked the intersection its near that abandoned construction site and the call was from a pay phone dance debated for a moment her eyes dipped to a sheet of paper a copy of the postings on the chilton report she rose and pulled on her jacket you going to go over there to check it out tj asked uncertainly yep really want to find him if theres any way kind of a weird area boss want backup she smiled i dont think im going to be in much danger not with the perp presently residing in the monterey county morgue the ceiling of the basement was painted black it contained eighteen rafters also black the walls were a dingy white cheap paint and were made up of cinder blocks against the wall were two cabinets one gray metal one uneven white wood inside were large stocks of canned goods boxes of pasta soda and wine tools nails personal items like toothpaste and deodorant four metal poles rose to the dim ceiling supporting the first floor three were close to each other one farther away they were painted dark brown but they were also rusty and it was hard to tell where the paint ended and the oxidation began the floor was concrete and the cracks made shapes that became familiar if you stared at them long enough a sitting panda the state of texas a truck an old furnace dusty and battered sat in the corner it ran on natural gas and switched on only rarely even then though it didnt heat this area much at all the size of the basement was thirtyseven feet by twentyeight which could be calculated easily from the cinder blocks which were exactly twelve inches wide by nine high though you had to add an eighth of an inch to each one for the mortar that glued them together a number of creatures lived down here too spiders mostly you could count seven families if that was what spiders lived in and they seemed to stake out territories so as not to offendor get eaten bythe others beetles and centipedes too occasional mosquitoes and flies something larger had shown an interest in the stacks of food and beverages in the far corner of the basement a mouse or a rat but itd grown timid and left never to return or been poisoned and died one window high in the wall admitted opaque light but no view it was painted over offwhite the hour was now probably or pmsince the window was nearly dark the thick silence was suddenly shattered as footsteps pounded across the first floor above a pause then the front door opened and slammed shut at last finally now that his kidnapper had left travis brigham could relax the way the schedule of the past few days had turned out once his captor left at night he wouldnt be back till morning travis now curled up in the bed pulling the gamy blanket around him this was the high point of his day sleep at least in sleep travis had learned he could find some respite from despair chapter the fog was thick and briskly streamed overhead as dance turned off the highway and began to meander down winding harrison road this area was south of carmel properon the way to point lobos and big sur beyondand was deserted mostly hilly woods a little farmland remained coincidentally it was close to the ancient ohlone indian land near which arnold brubaker hoped to build his desalination plant smelling pine and eucalyptus dance slowly followed her headlightslow beams because of the fogalong the road occasional driveways led into darkness broken by dots of light she passed several cars also driving slowly coming from the opposite direction and she wondered if it had been a driver whod called in the anonymous report that had sent her here or one of the residents something that was certainly a possibility but harrison road was also a shortcut from highway to carmel valley road the call could have come from anybody she soon arrived at pine grove way and pulled over the construction site that the anonymous caller had mentioned was a halfcompleted hotel complexnow never to be finished since the main building had burned under suspicious circumstances insurance fraud was initially suspected but the perps turned out to be environmentalists who didnt want the land scarred by the development ironically the green terrorists miscalculated the fire spread and destroyed hundreds of acres of pristine woods most of the wilderness had grown back but for various reasons the hotel project never got under way again and the complex remained as it now was several acres of derelict buildings and foundations dug deep in the loamy ground the area was surrounded by leaning chainlink fences marked with danger and no trespassing signs but a couple of times a year or so teens would have to be rescued after falling into a pit or getting trapped in the ruins while smoking pot or drinking or in one case having sex in the least comfortable and unromantic location imaginable it was also spooky as hell dance grabbed her flashlight from the glove compartment and climbed out of her crown vic the damp breeze wafted over her and she shivered with a jolt of fear relax she gave a wry laugh clicked on the flashlight and started forward sweeping the magnalite beam over the ground tangled with brush a car swept past on the highway tires sticky on the damp asphalt it eased around a corner and the sound stopped instantly as if the vehicle had beamed into a different dimension as she looked around her dance was supposing that the something the anonymous caller had reported was the last roadside cross the one intended to announce james chiltons death there was however none to be seen in the immediate vicinity what else could the person have meant could they have seen or heard travis himself this would be a perfect place to stash him she paused and listened for any calls for help nothing but the breeze through the oaks and pines oaksdance pictured one of the improvised roadside crosses pictured the one in her backyard too should she call in and order a search not just yet keep looking she wished she had the anonymous caller here even the most reluctant witness could be the source of all the information she needed look at tammy foster whose lack of cooperation hadnt slowed down the investigation at all tammys computer its got the answer well maybe not the answer but an answer but she didnt have the caller she had her flashlight and a spooky deserted construction site looking for something dance now slipped through one of the several gates in the chain link the metal bent by years of trespassers and eased through the grounds moving slowly the main building had collapsed completely under the flames and the othersservice sheds garages and complexes of hotel roomswere boarded up there were a half dozen open foundation pits they were marked with orange warning signs but the fog was thick and reflected back much light into dances eyes she moved carefully for fear of tumbling down into one easing through the compound one step at a time pausing looking for footprints what the hell had the caller seen then dance heard a noise in the distance but not that distant a loud snap another she froze deer she guessed they were plentiful in the area but other animals lived here too last year a mountain lion had killed a tourist jogging not far from here the animal had sliced the poor woman apart then vanished dance unbuttoned her jacket and tapped the butt of her glock for reassurance another snap then a creak like a hinge of an old door opening dance shivered in fear reflecting that just because the roadside cross killer was no longer a threat that didnt mean meth cookers or gangbangers werent hanging around here but heading back never entered her mind travis could be here keep going another forty feet or so into the compound dance was looking for the structures that might house a kidnap victim looking for buildings with padlocks looking for footprints she thought she heard another soundalmost a moan dance came close to calling out the boys name but instinct told her not to and then she stopped fast a human figure was silhouetted in the fog no more than ten yards away crouching she thought she gasped clicked the light out and drew her gun another look whoeverwhateverit might have been was gone but the image wasnt imagination she was certain shed seen somebody male she believed from the kinesics now footsteps were sounding clearly branches snapping leaves rustling he was flanking her to her right moving then pausing dance fondled the cell phone in her pocket but if she made a call her voice would give away her position and she had to assume that whoever was here in the dark on a damp foggy night wasnt present for innocent purposes retrace your steps she told herself back to the car now thinking of the shotgun in her trunk a weapon shed fired once in training dance turned around and moved quickly every step making a loud crinkle through the leaves every step shouting here i am here i am she stopped the intruder didnt his steps telegraphed his transit over the leaves and underbrush as he continued on somewhere in the dark fog to her right then they stopped had he stopped too or was he on leafless ground moving in for an attack just get back to the car get under cover rack the gauge and call in backup it was fifty sixty feet back to the chainlink fence in the dim ambient lightmoon diffused by fogshe surveyed the ground some places seemed less leafstrewn than others but there was no way to proceed quietly she told herself she couldnt wait any longer but still the stalker was silent was he hiding had he left or was he coming up close under cover of the dense foliage near panicking dance whirled but saw nothing other than the ghosts of buildings trees some large tanks half buried and rusting dance crouched wincing from the pain in her jointsfrom the chase and the tumble the other day at traviss house then she moved toward the fence as quickly as she could resisting the nearly overwhelming urge to break into a run over ground strewn with constructionsite booby traps twentyfive feet to the chain link a snap nearby she stopped fast dropped to her knees and lifted her weapon searching for a target she was holding her flashlight in her left hand and nearly clicked it on but instinct once again told her not to in the fog the beam would half blind her and give the intruder a perfect target not far away a raccoon slipped from a hiding place and moved stiffly away its kinesic message irritation at the disturbance dance rose turned back toward the fence and moved quickly over the leaves looking behind her often nobody was in pursuit that she could see finally she pushed through the gate and began jogging toward her car cell phone in her left hand open as she scrolled through previously dialed listings it was then that a voice from very close behind her echoed through the night dont move the man said i have a gun heart slamming dance froze hed flanked her completely gotten through another gate or silently scaled the fence she debated if he was armed and wanted to kill her shed be dead by now and with the mist and dimness maybe he hadnt seen her weapon in her hand i want you down on the ground now dance began to turn no on the ground but she kept turning until she was facing the intruder and his outstretched arm shit he was armed the gun aimed directly at her but then she looked at the mans face and blinked he wore a monterey county sheriffs office uniform she recognized him it was the young blueeyed deputy whod helped her out several times earlier david reinhold kathryn what are you doing here reinhold shook his head a faint smile on his face he didnt answer just looked around he lowered his weapon but didnt slip it back into the holster was it you in there he finally asked glancing back to the construction site she nodded reinhold continued to look around tense his kinesics giving off signals that he was still ready for combat then a tinny voice said from her side boss that you you calling reinhold blinked at the sound dance lifted her mobile and said tj you there when shed heard the intruder come up behind her shed hit dial yeah boss whats up im at that construction site off harrison im here with deputy reinhold from the sheriffs office did you find anything the young agent asked dance felt her legs going weak her heart pounding now that the initial fright was over not yet ill call you back got it boss they disconnected reinhold finally holstered his weapon he inhaled slowly and puffed air out of his smooth cheeks that just about scared the youknowwhat out of me dance asked him what are you doing here he explained that the mcso had gotten a call an hour ago about something having to do with the case near the intersection of pine grove and harrison the call that had spurred dance to come here since reinhold had worked on the case he explained hed volunteered to check it out hed been searching the construction site when hed seen the beam of a flashlight and come closer to investigate he hadnt recognized dance in the fog and was worried that she might be a meth cooker or drug dealer did you find anything that suggests travis is here travis he asked slowly no why kathryn just seems that thisd be a pretty good place to hide a kidnap victim well i searched pretty carefully the young deputy told her didnt see a thing still she said i want to be sure and called tj back to arrange for a search party in the end they did learn what the anonymous caller had seen the discovery was made not by dance or reinhold but by rey carraneo whod come here along with a half dozen other officers from the chp the mcso and the cbi the something was a roadside cross it had been planted on pine grove not harrison road about a hundred feet from the intersection but the memorial had nothing to do with greg schaeffer or travis brigham or the blog entries dance sighed angrily this cross was fancier than the others carefully made and the flowers below it were daisies and tulips not roses another difference was that this one had a name on it two in fact juan millar rip murdered by edith dance left by somebody from life firstthe anonymous caller of course angrily she plucked it from the ground and flung it into the compound with nothing to search and no evidence to examine no witnesses to interview kathryn dance trudged back to her car and returned home wondering just how fitful her sleep would be if indeed she could sleep at all friday chapter at am dance steered the ford crown vic into the parking lot of the monterey county courthouse she was eagerly anticipating the crime scene reports on schaeffer and any other information tj and the mcso had found about where the killer was keeping travis but in fact her thoughts were largely elsewhere she was wondering about the curious call shed received early that morningfrom robert harper asking if she would stop by his office apparently at his desk by the special prosecutor had sounded uncharacteristically pleasant and dance decided it was possible that hed heard from sheedy about the julio millar situation her thoughts actually extended to a dismissal of her mothers case and lodging charges against juans brother she had a feeling that harper wanted to discuss some type of a facesaving arrangement maybe hed drop the charges against edie completely and immediately if dance agreed not to go public with any criticism of his prosecution of the case she parked in the back of the courthouse looking over the construction work around the parking lot it had been here that the woman partner of the cult leader daniel pell had engineered the mans escape by starting the fire that had caused juan millars terrible burns she nodded hello to several people she knew from the court and from the sheriffs office speaking to a guard she learned where robert harpers office was the second floor near the law library a few minutes later she arrivedand was surprised to find the quarters quite austere there was no secretarys anteroom the special prosecutors door opened directly onto the corridor across from a mens room harper was alone sitting at a large desk the room bare of decoration there were two computers rows of law books and dozens of neat stacks of papers on both a gray metal desk and a round table near the single window the blinds were down though he would have a striking view of lettuce fields and the mountains east harper was in a pressed white shirt and narrow red tie his slacks were dark and his suit jacket hung neatly on a hanger on a coatrack in the corner of the office agent dance thanks for coming in he subtly inverted the sheet of paper hed been reading and closed the lid of his attaché case inside shed caught a glimpse of an old law book or maybe a bible he rose briefly and shook her hand again keeping his distance as she sat his closely set eyes examined the table beside her to see if there was anything that she ought not to observe he seemed satisfied that all secrets were safe he took in very briefly her navy blue suittailored jacket and pleated skirtand white blouse shed worn her interrogation clothes today her glasses were the black ones predator specs shed be happy to reach an accommodation if it got her mother off but she wasnt going to be intimidated youve spoken to julio millar she asked who juans brother oh well i have a while ago why are you asking dance felt her heart begin pounding faster she noted a stress reactionher leg moved slightly harper on the other hand was motionless i think juan begged his brother to kill him julio faked a name on the hospital signin sheet and did what his brother wanted i thought thats what you wanted to talk to me about oh harper said nodding george sheedy called about that just a bit ago i guess he didnt get a chance to call you and tell you tell me what with a hand tipped in perfectly filed nails harper lifted a folder from the corner of his desk and opened it up on the night his brother died julio millar was in the hospital but i confirmed that he was meeting with two members of the mbh security staff in connection with a suit against the california bureau of investigation for negligence in sending his brother to guard a patient that you knew or should have known was too dangerous for a man of juans experience to handle he was also considering suing you personally on a discrimination charge for singling out a minority officer for a dangerous assignment and for exacerbating his brothers condition by interrogating him at the exact time of juans death julio was in the presence of those guards he put a fake name in the checkin log because he was afraid youd find out about the suit and try to intimidate him and his family dances heart clenched to hear these words delivered so evenly her breathing was rapid harper was as calm as if he were reading from a book of poetry julio millar has been cleared agent dance the smallest of frowns he was one of my first suspects do you think i wouldnt have considered him she fell silent and sat back in an instant all hope had been destroyed then to harper the matter was concluded no why i asked you here he found another document will you stipulate that this is an email you wrote the addresses match but there are no names on it i can trace it back to you but itll take some time as a courtesy could you tell me if its yours she glanced at the sheet it was a photocopy of an email shed written to her husband when he was away on a business trip at an fbi seminar in los angeles several years ago hows everything going down there you get to chinatown like you were thinking wes got a perfect on the english test he wore the gold star on his forehead until it fell off and had to buy some more mags decided to donate all her hello kitty stuff to charityyes all of it yea sad news from mom willy their cat finally had to be put down kidney failure mom wouldnt hear of the vet doing it she did it herself an injection she seemed happier afterward she hates suffering would rather lose an animal than see it suffer she told me how hard it was to see uncle joe at the end with the cancer nobody should have to go through that she said a shame there was no assisted suicide law well on a happier note got the website back online and martine and i uploaded a dozen songs from that native american group down in ynez go online if you can theyre great oh and went shopping at victorias secret think youll like what i got ill do some modeling come home soon her face burnedin shock and rage where did you get this she snapped a computer at your mothers house under a warrant dance recalled it was my old computer i gave it to her it was in her possession within the scope of the warrant you cant introduce that she waved at the email printout why not he frowned its irrelevant her mind jumped around and its a privileged communication between husband and wife of course its relevant it goes to your mothers state of mind in committing mercy killing and as for the privilege since neither you nor your husband are subjects of the prosecution any communications should be fully admissible in any case the judge will decide he seemed surprised she hadnt realized this is it yours youll have to depose me before i respond to anything you ask all right he seemed only faintly disappointed at her failure to cooperate now i should tell you that i consider it a conflict of interest for you to be involved in this investigation and using special agent consuela ramirez to do legwork for you doesnt vitiate that conflict how had he found that out this case emphatically does not fall within the jurisdiction of the cbi and if you continue to pursue it ill lodge an ethics complaint against you with the attorney generals office shes my mother im sure youre emotional about the situation but its an active investigation and soon to be an active prosecution any interference from you is unacceptable shaking with rage dance rose and started for the door harper seemed to have an afterthought one thing agent dance before i move to admit that email of yours into evidence i want you to know that ill redact the information about buying that lingerie or whatever it was at victorias secret that i do consider irrelevant then the prosecutor slid toward him the document hed been reviewing when she arrived turned it over and began reading once again in her office kathryn dance was staring at the entwined tree trunks outside her window still angry with harper she was thinking again about what would happen if she was forced to testify against her mother if she didnt shed be held in contempt a crime it could mean jail and the end of her career as a law enforcer she was drawn from this thought by tjs appearance he looked exhausted he explained hed spent much of the night working with crime scene to examine greg schaeffers room at the cyprus grove inn his car and chiltons house he had the mcso report excellent tj she regarded his bleary red eyes you get any sleep whats that again boss sleep ha he handed her the crime scene report and i finally got more fouroneone on our friend which one hamilton royce didnt matter now she supposed with the case closed and apologiessuch as they weredelivered but she was curious go on his latest assignment was for the nuclear facilities planning committee until he got here hed been billing the nukers sixty hours a week and by the way hes expensive i think i need a raise boss am i a sixfigure kind of agent dance smiled she was glad that his humor seemed to be returning youre worth seven figures in my book tj i love you too boss the implication of the information then struck her she riffled through copies of the chilton report that son of a bitch whats that royce was trying to get the blog shut downfor his clients sake look she tapped the printout power to the people posted by chilton rep brandon klevingerever heard of his name probably not and the state representative looking after some fine folks in northern california would rather keep a low profile no such luck representative klevinger is the head of the states nuclear facilities planning committee which means the bomboops excuse me the buckstops with him on the issue of those little gadgets called reactors and you want to know something interesting about them nogo away greenies go whine elsewhere i have no problem with nuclear energy we need it to achieve energy independence from certain interests overseas whom ive written about at great length but what i do object to is this nuclear power loses its advantage if the price for the plants and the energy expended in the construction outweigh the advantages ive learned that rep klevinger just happens to have been on a couple of posh golfing trips to hawaii and mexico with his newfound friend stephen ralston well guess what boys and girls ralston happens to have put in bids for a proposed nuclear facility north of mendocino mendocinolovely place and very pricey to build in not to mention that it seems the cost of delivering the power to where its needed will be huge another developer has proposed a far cheaper and more efficient location about fifty miles south of sacramento but a source has snuck me the nuclear committees preliminary report and it reveals that ralstons probably going to get the goahead to build in mendocino has klevinger done anything illegal or wrong im not saying yes or no i just ask the question he was lying all along tj said sure was still she couldnt concentrate on royces duplicity just now there was after all no need to blackmail him at this point considering he was headed home in a day or two good work just dotting my is as he left she hunched over the mcso report she was a little surprised that david reinhold the eager kidthe one shed played catandmouse with last nighthadnt

schaeffers fingerprints dance read the list twice she couldnt be upset at the job crime scene had done it was perfectly acceptable yet it offered no clues whatsoever as to where travis brigham was being held or where his body was buried her eyes slipped out the window and settled on the thick barky knot the point where two independent trees became one then continued their separate journey toward the sky oh travis kathryn dance thought unable to resist the thought that shed let him down unable finally to resist the tears chapter travis brigham woke up peed in the bucket beside the bed and washed his hands with bottled water he adjusted the chain connecting the shackle around his ankle to a heavy bolt in the wall thought once again of that stupid movie saw where two men had been chained to a wall just like this and could escape only by sawing their legs off he drank some vitamin water ate some granola bars and returned to his mental investigation trying to piece together what had happened to him why hed ended up here and who was the man whod done this terrible thing he recalled the other day those police or agents at the house his father being a dick his mother being all weepyeyed and weak travis had grabbed his uniform and his bike and headed for his sucky job hed wheeled the bike a short way into the woods behind his house and then just lost it hed dropped his bike and sat down beside the huge oak tree and started crying his head off hopeless everybody hated him then wiping his nose as he sat beneath the oak a favorite spotit reminded him of a place in aetheriahed heard footsteps behind him moving fast before he could turn toward the sound his vision went all yellow and every muscle in his body contracted at once from neck to toe his breath went away and he passed out and then he woke up here in the basement with a headache that wouldnt stop somebodyd hit him with a taser he knew hed seen how they work on youtube the big fear turned out to be a false alarm feeling carefullydown his pants behindhe realized nobodyd done anything to himnot that way though it made him all the more uneasy rape wouldve made some sense but thisjust being kidnapped held here like in some kind of stephen king story what the hell was going on travis now sat up on the cheap folding bed that shook every time he moved he looked around his prison once more the filthy basement the place stank of mold and oil he surveyed the food and drink left for him mostly chips and packaged crackers and oscar mayer snack boxesham or turkey red bull and vitamin water and coke to drink a nightmare everything about his life this month was an unbearable nightmare starting with the graduation party at that house in the hills off highway hed only gone because some of the girls said caitlin was hoping hed be there no she really really is so hed hitched all the way down the highway past garrapata state park then he walked inside and to his horror hed seen only the kewl people none of the slackers or gamers the miley cyrus crowd and worse caitlin looked at him like she didnt even recognize him the girls whod told him to come were giggling along with their jock boyfriends and everybody else was staring at him wondering what the hell a geek like travis brigham was doing there it was all a setup just to make fun of him pure fucking hell but he wouldnt turn around and run no way hed hung around looked over the million cds the family had flipped through some channels ate kickass food finally sad and embarrassed hed decided it was time to head back wondering if hed get a ride that time of night near midnight hed seen caitlin wasted on tequila pissed about mike dangelo and bri leaving together she was fumbling for her keys and muttering about following the two of them andwell she didnt know what travis had thought be a hero take the keys get her home safe she wont care youre not a jock she wont care if your face is all red and bumpy shell know who you are on the insideshell love you but caitlin had jumped into the drivers seat her friends in the back being all girlfriend girlfriend travis hadnt let it go hed climbed right into the car beside her and tried to talk her out of driving hero but caitlin had sped off plummeting down the driveway and onto highway ignoring his pleas to let him drive like please caitlin pull over but she hadnt even heard him caitlin come on please and then the car flying off the road the sound of metal on stone the screamssounds louder than anything travis had ever heard and still i had to be the goddamn hero caitlin listen to me can you hear me tell them i was driving the car i havent had anything to drink ill tell them i lost control it wont be a big deal if they think you were driving youll go to jail trish vanwhy arent they saying anything do you hear me cait get into the passenger seat now the copsll be here any minute i was driving you hear me oh shit shit shit caitlin yes yes you were driving oh travis thank you as she threw her arms around him he felt a sensation like none other hed ever experienced she loves me well be together but it didnt last afterward theyd talked some theyd gone for coffee at starbucks lunch at subway but soon the times together grew awkward caitlin would fall silent and start looking away from him eventually she stopped returning his calls caitlin became even more distant than shed been before his good deed and then look what happened everybody on the peninsulano everybody in the worldstarted hating him h to break it to you but the driver is a total frk and a luser but even then travis couldnt give up hope the night tammy foster got attacked monday hed been thinking about caitlin and couldnt sleep so he went to her house to see if she was all right though mostly thinking in his fantasy maybe shed be hanging out in the backyard or on her front porch shed see him and say oh travis im sorry ive been so distant im just getting over trish and van but i do love you but the house had been dark hed bicycled back home at am the next day the police had shown up and asked him where hed been that night hed instinctively lied and said he was at the game shed which of course theyd found out he hadnt been and now theyd definitely think he was the one behind the attack on tammy everybody hating me travis now recalled waking up here after hed been tasered the big man standing over him who was he one of the fathers of the girls killed in the accident travis had asked but the man had only pointed out the bucket to use for a toilet the food and water and had warned my associates and i are going to be checking on you travis you stay quiet at all times if you dont he showed the boy a soldering iron okay crying travis had blurted who are you what did i do the man plugged the soldering iron into the wall socket no im sorry ill be quiet i promise the man unplugged the iron and then clomped up the stairs the basement door had closed more footsteps and the front door had slammed a car started and travis was left alone he remembered the following days as a blur filled with increasing hallucinations or dreams to stave off boredomand madnesshe played dimensionquest in his mind now travis gasped hearing the front door opening upstairs thumps of footsteps his captor was back travis hugged himself and tried not to cry be quiet you know the rules thinking of the taser thinking of the soldering iron he stared at the ceilinghis ceiling his kidnappers flooras the man roamed through the house five minutes later the steps moved in a certain pattern travis tensed he knew what that sound meant he was coming down here and yeah a few seconds later the lock on the basement door snapped footsteps on the squeaky stairs descending travis now shrank back on the bed as he saw his captor come closer the man normally would have with him an empty bucket and would take the full one upstairs but today he carried only a paper bag this terrified travis what was inside the soldering iron something worse standing over him he studied travis closely how do you feel like shit you asshole what do you think but he said okay youre weak i guess but youve been eating a nod dont ask him why hes doing this you want to but dont its like the biggest mosquito bite in the world you have to scratch it but dont hes got the soldering iron you can walk i guess good because im giving you a chance to leave leave yes please i want to go home tears popped into traviss eyes but you have to earn your freedom earn it ill do anything what dont answer too quickly the man said ominously you might choose not to no ill shh you can choose not to do what im going to ask but if you dont youll stay here until you starve to death and therell be other consequences your parents and brother will die too theres somebody outside their house right now is my brother okay travis asked in a frantic whisper hes fine for now dont hurt them you cant hurt them i can hurt them and i will oh believe me travis i will what do you want me to do the man looked him over carefully i want you to kill somebody a joke but the kidnapper wasnt smiling what do you mean travis whispered kill somebody just like in that game you play dimensionquest why that doesnt matter not to you all you need to know is if you dont do what im asking youll starve to death here and my associate will kill your family simple as that nows your chance yes or no but i dont know how to kill anybody the man reached into the paper bag and took out a pistol wrapped in a baggie he dropped it on the bed wait thats my fathers where did you get it from his truck you said my familys fine they are travis i didnt hurt him i stole it a couple of days ago when they were asleep can you shoot it he nodded in fact hed never fired a real gun but hed played shooting games in arcades and he watched tv anybody who watched the wire or the sopranos knew enough about guns to use one he muttered but if i do what you want youll just kill me and then my family no i wont its better for me if youre alive you kill who i tell you to drop the gun and run go wherever you want then ill call my friend and tell him to leave your family alone there was a lot about this that didnt make sense but traviss mind was numb he was afraid to say yes he was afraid to say no travis thought of his brother then his mother an image of his father smiling even came to mind smiling when he looked at sammy never at travis but it was a smile nonetheless and seemed to make sammy happy that was the important thing travis did you bring me ms sammy travis brigham blinked tears from his eyes and whispered okay ill do it chapter even without the benefit of excessive lunchtime chardonnay donald hawken was feeling maudlin but he didnt care he rose from the couch where hed been sitting with lily and embraced james chilton who was entering the living room of his vacation house in hollister carrying several more bottles of white wine chilton gripped him back only mildly embarrassed lily chided her husband donald sorry sorry sorry hawken laughed but i cant help it the nightmares over god what youve been through what weve all been through chilton said the story of the psycho was all over the news how the mask killer wasnt the boy but was really some crazy man whod been trying to avenge a posting that chilton had put on his report several years ago and he was actually going to shoot you on camera chilton lifted an eyebrow jesus our lord said lily looking paleand surprising hawken since she was a professed agnostic but lily like her husband was a bit tipsy too im sorry about that boy hawken said he was an innocent victim maybe the saddest victim of all do you think hes still alive lily wondered i doubt it chilton said grimly schaeffer would have to kill him leave no traces im heartsick about it hawken was pleased hed rejected the requestwell from that agent dance it had almost been an orderto go back to san diego no way he thought back to those dismal days when sarah had died and james chilton had sped to his side this is what friends did breaking the pall that had descended lily said ive got an idea lets plan a picnic for tomorrow pat and i can cook love it chilton said we know this beautiful park nearby but hawken wasnt through being maudlin he lifted his glass of sonomacutrer heres to friends to friends they sipped lily her pretty face crowned with curly golden hair asked whenre they coming up pat and the kids chilton glanced at his watch she left about fifteen minutes ago shell pick the boys up from camp then head up here shouldnt be too long hawken was amused the chiltons lived close to one of the most beautiful waterfronts in the world and yet for their vacation house theyd chosen a rustic old place in the hills fortyfive minutes inland hills that were decidedly dusty and brown yet the place was quiet and peaceful y ningunos turistas a relief after summertime carmel filled to the gills with outoftowners okay hawken announced i cant wait any longer cant wait chilton asked a perplexed smile on his face what i told you i was bringing oh the painting really don you dont need to do that its not need its something i want to do hawken went into the guest bedroom where he and lily were staying and returned with a small canvas an impressionistic painting of a blue swan on a darker blue background his late wife sarah had bought it in san diego or la jolla one day while jim chilton was in southern california to help after her death hawken had found the man staring at the painting admiringly hawken had decided at that moment that someday hed give the artwork to his friend in gratitude for all hed done during those terrible times now the three of them gazed at the bird taking off from the water its beautiful chilton said he propped the painting up on the mantel thank you hawken now a half glass of wine more maudlin yet was lifting his glass to make a toast when a door squeaked in the kitchen oh he said smiling is that pat but chilton was frowning she couldnt be here that fast but i heard something didnt you the blogger nodded i did yes then looking toward the doorway lily said theres somebody there im sure she was frowning i hear footsteps maybe chilton began but his words were cut off as lily screamed hawken spun around dropping his wineglass which shattered loudly a boy in his late teens hair askew face dotted with acne stood in the doorway he seemed stoned he was blinking and looking around disoriented in his hand was a pistol shit hawken thought they hadnt locked the back door when theyd arrived this kid had wandered inside to rob them gangs had to be gangs what do you want hawken whispered money well give you money the boy continued to squint his eyes settled on jim chilton and narrowed then donald hawken gasped its the boy from the blog travis brigham skinnier and paler than in the pictures on tv but there was no doubt he wasnt dead what was this all about but one thing he understood the boy was here to shoot his friend jim chilton lily grabbed her husbands arm no dont hurt him travis hawken cried and felt an urge to step in front of chilton to protect him only his wifes grip kept him from doing so the boy took a step closer to chilton he blinked then looked awaytoward hawken and lily he asked in a weak voice theyre the ones you want me to kill what did he mean and james chilton whispered thats right travis go ahead and do what you agreed shoot squinting against the raw light that stung his eyes like salt travis brigham stared at the couplethe people his captor had told him in the basement a half hour ago he had to kill donald and lily his kidnapper had explained that theyd be arriving soon and would be upstairsin this house the very one whose basement hed spent the past three or four days in travis couldnt understand why his kidnapper wanted them dead but that didnt matter all that mattered was keeping his family alive travis did you bring me ms he lifted the gun aimed at them as the couple blurted words he hardly heard he tried to hold the weapon steady this took all his effort after days of being chained to a bed he was weak as a bird even the climb up the stairs had been a chore the gun was weaving no please no someone cried the man or the woman he couldnt tell he was confused disoriented by the glaring light it stung his eyes travis aimed at the man and woman but still he kept wondering who are they donald and lily in the basement the man had said look at them like characters in that game you play dimensionquest donald and lilyre only avatars nothing more than that but these people sobbing in front of him werent avatars they were real and they seemed to be his captors friendsat least in their minds whats going on please dont hurt us from lily james please but the manjames it seemedjust kept his eyes cool eyes on travis go ahead shoot james no what are you saying travis steadied the gun pointing it at donald he pulled back the hammer lily screamed and then something in traviss mind clicked james the boy from the blog roadside crosses travis blinked james chilton was this the blogger travis the captor said firmly stepping behind him pulling another gun from his back pocket he touched it to traviss head go ahead and do it i told you not to say anything dont ask questions just shoot travis asked donald hes james chilton yes the man whispered what travis wondered was going on here chilton shoved the gun harder into traviss skull it hurt do it do it or youll die and your family will die the boy lowered the gun he shook his head you dont have any friends at my house you were lying to me youre doing this alone if you dont do it ill kill you and then go to their house and kill them i swear i will hawken cried jim is thisfor gods sake what is this lily cried uncontrollably travis brigham understood now shoot them or not he was dead his family would be all right chilton had no interest in them but he was dead a faint laugh eased from his throat and he felt tears sting eyes already stinging from the sunlight he thought of caitlin her beautiful eyes and smile thought of his mother thought of sammy and of all the terrible things that people had said about him in the blog yet hed done nothing wrong his life was about nothing more than trying to get through school as best he could to play a game that made him happy to spend some time with his brother and look after the boy to meet a girl who wouldnt mind that he was a geek with troubled skin travis had never in his life hurt anybody intentionally never dissed anyone never posted a bad word about them and the whole world had attacked him whod care if he killed himself nobody so travis did the only thing he could he lifted the gun to his own chin look at the luser his life is epic fail traviss finger slipped around the trigger of the gun he began to squeeze the explosion was fiercely loud windows shook acrid smoke filled the room and a delicate porcelain cat tumbled from the mantelpiece and shattered on the hearth into dozens of pieces chapter kathryn dances car turned onto the long dirt driveway that led to james chiltons vacation house in hollister she was reflecting on how wrong shed been greg schaeffer wasnt the roadside cross killer everyone else had been misled too but dance took no solace from that shed been content to assume that schaeffer was the guilty party and that hed killed travis brigham with the man dead thered be no more attacks wrong her phone rang she wondered who was calling but decided it was best not to look at caller id as she wove up the serpentine drive with dropoffs on either side another fifty yards she saw the home ahead of her a rambling old farmhouse that would have looked in place in kansas if not for the substantial hills surrounding it the yard was scruffy filled with untended patches of grass gray broken branches overgrown gardens she would have thought that james chilton would have a nicer vacation home considering the inheritance from his fatherinlaw and his beautiful house in carmel even in the sun the place exuded a sense of eeriness but that was of course because dance knew what had happened inside how could i have read everything so wrong the road straightened and she continued on she fished the phone off the seat and looked at the screen jonathan boling had called but the message flag wasnt up she debated hitting last received call but instead picked michael oneils speeddial button after four rings it went to voice mail maybe he was on the other case or maybe he was talking to his wife anne dance tossed the phone onto the passenger seat as she pulled close to the house dance counted a half dozen police cars two ambulances as well the san benito county sheriff whom shed worked with regularly saw her and motioned her forward several officers stepped aside and she drove over the uneven grass to where the sheriff was standing she saw where travis brigham lay on a gurney his face covered dance slammed the gearshift into park and climbed out then walked quickly toward the boy she noted his bare feet the welts on his ankle his pale skin travis she whispered the boy jerked as if shed awakened him from a deep sleep he lifted the damp cloth and ice pack off his bruised face he blinked and focused his eyes on her oh uh officeri like cant remember your name dance sorry he sounded genuinely contrite at the social slip not a problem at all kathryn dance hugged the boy hard the boy would be fine the medic explained his worst injury from the ordealin fact the only serious onewas from hitting his forehead on the mantel in the living room of chiltons house when the san benito county swat team stormed the place they had been conducting furtive surveillanceas they awaited dances arrivalwhen the commander had seen through the window that the boy had entered the living room with a gun james chilton too had pulled a weapon for some reason it then appeared that travis was going to take his own life the commander had ordered his officers in theyd launched flashbang grenades into the room which detonated with stunning explosions knocking chilton to the floor and the boy into the mantelpiece the officers raced inside and relieved them of their weapons theyd cuffed chilton and dragged him outside then escorted donald hawken and his wife to safety and gotten travis to the paramedics wheres chilton dance asked hes over there the sheriff said nodding to one of the county deputys cars in which the blogger sat handcuffed his head down shed get to him later dance glanced at chiltons nissan quest the doors and tailgate were open and crime scene had removed the contents most notable were the last roadside cross and bouquet of red rosesnow tinged with brown chilton would have been planning to leave them nearby after hed killed the hawkens traviss bike also rested near the tailgate and in a clear evidence bag was the gray hoodie that chilton had stolen and worn to impersonate the boy and that hed picked fibers off to leave at the scenes dance asked the paramedic and the hawkens howre they shaken up as you can imagine a bit bruised hitting the deck when we moved in but theyll be fine theyre on the porch you doing okay dance asked travis i guess he answered she realized what a foolish question it was of course he wasnt okay hed been kidnapped by james chilton and been ordered to murder donald hawken and his wife apparently rather than going through with that task hed chosen to die your parents will be here soon she told him yeah the boy seemed cautious at this news they were real worried about you he nodded but she read skepticism in his face your mother was crying she was so happy when i told her that was true dance had no idea what the fathers reaction had been a deputy brought the boy a soft drink thank you he drank the coke thirstily for his days in captivity he wasnt doing too badly a medic had looked over the raw chafing on his leg it wouldnt need treatment other than a bandage and antibiotic cream the injury was from the shackles she realized and a wave of fury coursed through her she glared at chilton who was being transferred from the san benito to a monterey county car but the bloggers eyes remained downcast whats your sport the coketoting cop asked the boy trying to make conversation and put travis at ease like i game mostly thats what i mean the young crewcut officer said taking the skewed response to be a result of the boys temporary hearing loss from the flashbangs more loudly he asked whats your fave soccer football basketball the boy blinked at the young man in the blue outfit yeah i play all those some way to go the trooper didnt realize that the sports equipment involved only a wii or game controller and that the playing field was eighteen inches diagonally but start out slow bet your musclesve atrophied find a trainer okay a rattling old nissan the red finish baked matte pulled up rocking along the dirt driveway it parked and the brighams climbed out sonia tearful lumbered over the grass and hugged her son hard mom his father too approached he stopped beside them unsmiling looking the boy up and down youre thin pale you know what i mean you hurtin anywhere hell be okay the paramedic said hows sammy travis asked hes at grams sonia said hes in a state but all right you found him you saved him the father still unsmiling was speaking to dance we all did yes he kept you down there in that basement he said to his son the boy nodded not looking at either of them wasnt so bad got cold a lot his mother said caitlin told everybody what happened she did as if he were unable to control himself the father muttered you shouldnta took the blame for shhh the mother hissed sharply his brow furrowed but the man fell silent whats going to happen to her travis asked caitlin his mother said thats not our concern we dont need to worry about that now she looked at dance can we go home is it all right if we just go home well get a statement later no need right now thank you travis said to dance his father said the same and shook her hand oh travis here dance handed him a piece of paper whats that its somebody who wants you to call him who jason kepler whos thatoh stryker travis blinked you know him he went looking for you when you were missing he helped us find you he did he sure did he said youd never met him like not in person no you only live five miles from each other yeah he gave a surprised smile he wants to get together with you sometime he nodded with a curious expression on his face as if the idea of meeting a synth world friend in the real was very strange indeed come on home baby his mother said ill make a special dinner your brother cant wait to see you sonia and bob brigham and their son walked back to the car the fathers arm rose and slipped around his sons shoulders briefly then it fell away kathryn dance noted the tentative contact she believed not in divine salvation but in the proposition that we poor mortals are fully capable of saving ourselves if conditions and inclinations are right and the evidence of this potential is found in the smallest of gestures like the uncertain resting of a large hand on a bony shoulder gestures more honest than words travis she called he turned maybe ill see you sometimein aetheria he held his arm over his chest palm outward which she supposed was a salute among the inhabitants of his guild kathryn dance resisted the temptation to reciprocate chapter dance walked across the yard to donald and lily hawken her aldo shoes gathering dust and plant flecks crisp grasshoppers fled from her transit the couple sat on the front porch steps of chiltons vacation house hawkens face was harrowing to see the betrayal had clearly affected him to his core jim did this he whispered im afraid so another thought shook him my god what if the children had been here would he have he couldnt complete the sentence his wife stared at the dusty yard wiping sweat off her brow hollisters a long way from the ocean and summer air trapped by the knobby hills heated up fiercely by midday dance said actually it was his second attempt to kill you second lily whispered you mean at the house when we were unpacking the other day thats right that was chilton too wearing one of traviss hoodies butis he insane hawken asked mystified why would he want to kill us dance had learned that in her line of work nothing is gained by softpedaling i cant say for absolute certain but i think james chilton murdered your first wife a heartbreaking gasp eyes wide with disbelief what lily now lifted her head and turned to dance but she died in an accident swimming near la jolla im getting some details from san diego and the coast guard to be sure but its pretty likely that im right he couldnt have sarah and jim were very hawkens words dissolved close dance asked he was shaking his head no its not possible but then he blurted angrily are you saying they were having an affair a pause then she said i think so yes ill be getting some evidence in the next few days travel records phone calls lily put her arm around her husbands shoulders honey she whispered hawken said i remember that theyd always enjoy each others company when wed go out and with me sarah was a challenge i was always traveling maybe two three days a week not a lot but she sometimes said i was neglecting her kind of jokingi didnt take it all that seriously but maybe she meant it and jim stepped in to fill the gap sarah was always pretty demanding the tone of delivery suggested to dance that the sentence could have ended with in bed she added im guessing that sarah wanted chilton to leave patrizia and marry her a bitter laugh and he said no dance shrugged thats what occurred to me hawken considered this he added in hollow tones it wasnt a good thing to say no to sarah i thought about the timing you moved to san diego about three years ago it was around then that patrizias father died and she inherited a lot of money which meant that chilton could keep writing his bloghe started working on it fulltime then i think he was beginning to get a sense he was on a mission to save the world and patrizias money could let him do that so he broke it off with your wife hawken asked and sarah threatened to expose him if he didnt leave pat i think she was going to broadcast that james chilton the moral voice of the country had been having an affair with his best friends wife dance believed that chilton lied to sarah agreeing to get the divorce and met her in san diego she could imagine his suggestion of a romantic picnic at a deserted cove near la jolla a swim at the beautiful seashore preserve there then an accidenta blow to the head or maybe he just held her underwater but why was he going to kill us lily asked with a troubled look back at the house dance said to donald hawken youd been out of touch for a while after sarah died i was so depressed i gave up on everything stopped seeing all my old friends most of my time went to the children i was a recluseuntil i met lily then i started to resurface and you decided to move back right sell the company and come back hawken was understanding sure sure lily and i would get together with jim and patrizia some of our old friends around here at some point wed have to reminisce jim used to come to southern california a bit before sarah died he wouldve lied to pat about it itd only be a matter of time before hed get caught hawkens head swiveled to the house his eyes wide the blue swanyes dance lifted an eyebrow i told jim i wanted to give him one of my late wifes favorite paintings i remembered him staring at it when he stayed with me after sarah died a scoffing laugh ill bet it was jims he probably bought it years ago and one day when sarah was over at his place she told him she wanted it maybe he told patrizia he sold it to somebody if she saw the painting now shed wonder how sarah had gotten it this would explain chiltons desperationwhy hed take the risk of murdering the righteous blogger lecturing the world on morality about to be exposed for having an affairwith a woman whod died questions would be raised an investigation started and the most important thing in his lifehis blogwould have been destroyed he had to eliminate that threat the report is too important to jeopardize lily asked but that man at the house schaeffer the statement that james was going to readit mentioned travis im sure schaeffers plans didnt originally involve travis hed wanted to kill chilton for some timeprobably since his brothers death but when he heard about the roadside crosses attacks he rewrote the statement to include traviss nameso no one would suspect schaeffer himself hawken asked how did you figure out jim was the one not schaeffer mostly she explained because of what wasnt in the crime scene reports tj had just delivered to her what wasnt there hawken asked first she explained there wasnt any cross to announce the murder of chilton the killer had left crosses in public places before the other attacks but nobody could find the last cross second the perp had used traviss bicycle or his own to leave tread marks to implicate the boy but schaeffer didnt have a bike anywhere and then the gun he threatened chilton with it wasnt the colt stolen from traviss father it was a smith and wesson finally there were no flowers or florists wire in his car or hotel room so i considered the possibility that greg schaeffer wasnt the roadside cross killer he just lucked into the case and decided to use it but if he wasnt leaving the crosses who could it be dance had gone back through the list of suspects shed thought of the minister reverend fisk and his bodyguard possibly crimsoninchrist they were certainly fanatics and had threatened chilton directly in their postings on the blog but tj had gone to see fisk the minder and several other key members of the group they all had alibis for the times of the attacks shed also considered hamilton roycethe troubleshooter from sacramento being paid to shut down the blog because of what chilton was posting about the nuclear facilities planning committee it was a good theory but the more shed thought about it the less likely it seemed royce was too obvious a suspect since hed already tried to get the blog closed downand very publiclyby using the state police clint avery the construction boss was a possibility too but shed learned that averys mysterious meetings after dance had left his company were with a lawyer specializing in equal employment law and two men who ran a daylabor service in an area where most employers worried about hiring too many undocumented aliens avery was worried about getting sued for hiring too few minorities he was uneasy with dance it seemed because he was afraid she was really there investigating a civil rights complaint that he was discriminating against latinos dance had also fleetingly considered traviss father as the perp actually wondering if there was some psychological connection between the branches and roses and bob brighams job as a landscaper shed even considered that the perp might be sammytroubled but maybe a savant cunning and possibly filled with resentment against his older brother but even though the family had its problems those were pretty much the same problems all families had and both father and son were accounted for during some of the attacks with a shrug dance said to the hawkens finally i ran out of suspects and came to james chilton himself why he asked a to b to x i was thinking about something a consultant of ours told me about blogsabout how dangerous they were and i asked myself what if chilton wanted to kill someone what a great weapon the report was start a rumor then let the cybermob take over nobody would be surprised when the bullied victim snapped theres your perpetrator hawken pointed out but jim didnt say anything about travis in the blog and thats what was so brilliant it made chilton seem completely innocent but he didnt need to mention travis he knew how the internet works the merest hint hed done something wrong and the vengeful angels would take over if chilton was the perp i wondered then who was the intended victim there was nothing about the two girls tammy or kelley to suggest he wanted to kill them or lyndon strickland or mark watson you were the other potential victims of course i thought back to everything id learned about the case i remembered something odd you told me that chilton had hurried to your house in san diego to be with you and the children the day your wife died he was there within the hour right hed been in la at a meeting he got the next commuter flight down dance said but hed told his wife he was in seattle when he heard that sarah had died seattle hawken appeared confused in a meeting at microsoft headquarters but no he was actually in san diego hed been there all along he never left town after drowning sarah he was waiting to hear from you and to get to your house he needed to needed to why you said he stayed with you even helped you with the cleaning thats right i think he wanted to go through the house and destroy anything among sarahs possessions that suggested they were having an affair jesus hawken muttered she explained a few of the other connections between chilton and the crimes he was a triathlon competitor which meant he biked dance recalled seeing all the sports equipment in chiltons garage among them several bicycles then the soil she explained about finding the mismatched dirt near one of the roadside crosses crime scene found identical trace on greg schaeffers shoes but the ultimate source was the gardens in chiltons front yard thats where schaeffer picked it up dance reflected that shed actually gazed right at the source of the dirt when shed first been to the bloggers house as she examined the landscaping and then there was his van the nissan quest she told them about the witness ken pfister seeing the state vehicle near one of the crosses then she gave a wry smile but it was actually chilton himself who was drivingafter planting the second cross she pointed to the bloggers van parked nearby it bore the bumper sticker she remembered from the first day shed been to his house if you desalinate you devastate it was the last syllable on that sticker that ken pfister had seen as the van drove past state i went to the magistrate with what id found and got a warrant i sent officers to search chiltons house in carmel hed discarded most of the evidence but they found a few red rose petals and a bit of cardboard similar to what was used on the crosses i remembered that he said he was coming here with you so i called san benito county and told them to send a tactical team here the only thing i didnt guess was that chilton was going to force travis himself to shoot you she interrupted the mans effusive thankshe seemed about to crywith a glance at her watch i have to leave now you go home get some rest lily hugged dance hawken shook her hand in both of his i dont know what to say disengaging she walked to the monterey county sheriffs office squad car where james chilton sat his thinning hair was plastered to the side of his head he watched her approach with a hurt gaze on his face almost a pout she opened the back door leaned down he hissed i dont need shackles on my feet look at this its degrading dance noted the chains noted them with satisfaction he continued they put them on some deputies did and they were smiling because they claimed i kept the boy shackled thiss all bullshit this is all a mistake ive been framed dance nearly laughed apart from all the other evidence there were three eyewitnesseshawken his wife and travisto his crimes she recited his miranda rights somebody did that already just making sure you really understand them do you my rights yes listen back there yes i had a gun but people had been out to kill me of course im going to protect myself somebodys setting me up like you said somebody id posted about in my blog i saw travis come into the living room and i pulled out my guni started carrying one when you said i was in danger ignoring the rambling she said were going to take you to monterey county and book you james you can call your wife or your attorney then do you hear what im saying ive been framed whatever that boys claiming hes unstable i was playing along with him with his delusions i was going to shoot him if hed tried to hurt don and lily of course i was she leaned forward controlling her emotions as best she could which wasnt easy whyd you target tammy and kelley james two teenage girls who never did anything to you im innocent he muttered she continued as if he hadnt spoken why them because you didnt like adolescent attitude you didnt like them tainting your precious blog with their obscenities you didnt like bad grammar he said nothing but dance believed there was a flicker of acknowledgment in his eyes she pushed ahead and why lyndon strickland and mark watson you killed them just because they posted under their real names and they were easy to find right chilton was looking away now as if he knew he was telegraphing the truth with his eyes james those pictures you uploaded to the blog pretending to be travis you drew them yourself didnt you i remembered from your bio in the report that you were a graphic designer and art director in college he said nothing the anger flared hotter did you enjoy drawing the one of me getting stabbed again silence she stood ill be by at some point to interview you you can have your attorney present if you like then he turned to her his face imploring one thing agent dance please she lifted an eyebrow theres something i need its important whats that james a computer what i need access to a computer soon today you get phone calls from the lockup no computer but the reportive got to upload my stories now she couldnt contain the laugh he was not at all concerned about his wife or children only about the precious blog no james thats not going to happen but i have to i have to hearing those words and seeing his frantic gaze kathryn dance finally understood james chilton the readers were nothing to him hed easily murdered two of them and was fully prepared to kill more the truth was nothing to him hed lied over and over again no the answer was simple like the players in dimensionquest like so many people lost in the synth world james chilton was an addict addicted to his messianic mission addicted to the seductive power of spreading the wordhis wordto the minds and hearts of people throughout the world the more who read his musings his rants his praise the more exquisite the high she leaned down close to his face james i will do everything possible to make sure that whatever prison you go to you will never be able to get online ever again never in your life his face turned livid and he began screaming you cant do that you cant take my blog away my readers need me the country needs me you cant dance closed the door and nodded to the deputy behind the wheel chapter the flashing lightson personal businesswere against regulations but dance didnt care the emergency accessories were a wise idea given that she was speeding at twice the limit down highway back to salinas from hollister edie dance was being arraigned in twenty minutes and she was going to be there front and center she was wondering when her mothers trial would happen who would testify what exactly would the evidence show again she thought dismayed will i be called to the stand and what would happen if edie was convicted dance knew california prisons the population was largely illiterate violent their minds ruined by drugs or alcohol or simply damaged from birth her mothers heart would wither in a place like that the punishment would be the death penalty after allcapital punishment for the soul and she was furious with herself for writing that email to bill the one commenting on her mothers decision to put down one of her ailing pets years ago an offhand comment out of proportion to the devastating effect it could have on her mothers fate which put her in mind of the chilton report all of those postings about travis brigham all wrong completely wrongyet they would be in existence on servers and in the hearts of individual computers forever people might see them five or ten or twenty years from now or a hundred and never know the truth dance was shaken out of her troubling meditation by the buzz of her phone it was a text message from her father im at the hospital with your mother get here as soon as you can dance gasped what was this about the arraignment was supposed to be starting in fifteen minutes if edie dance was in the hospital it was only for one reason she was ill or injured dance immediately punched her fathers mobile number but it went right to voice mail of course hed shut it off in the hospital had she been attacked or had she tried to kill herself dance shoved the accelerator down and drove faster her mind tumbling out of control now thinking that if her mother had tried to kill herself it was because she knew robert harper had a solid case against her and that it would be futile to fight it so her mother had committed murder dance recalled the damning comment revealing edies knowledge of the icu corridors at the time juan millar died there were some nurses down on that wing but that was all his family was gone and there were no visitors she sped past salinas laguna seca and the airport twenty minutes later she was pulling into the circular drive of the hospital the car skidded to a violent stop breaching the handicapped space dance leapt out and sprinted to the main entrance door and wedged through before the automatic panels had fully opened at the admissions station an alarmed receptionist looked up and said kathryn are you wheres my mother the agent gasped shes downstairs and dance was already pushing through the doorway and downward downstairs meant only one thing the intensive care unit ironically the very place where juan millar had died if edie was there at least she was alive on the bottom floor she shoved through the door hurrying toward icu when she happened to glance into the cafeteria breathing hard dance pulled up fast a stitch in her side she looked through the open doorway and saw four people sitting at a table coffee in front of them they were the director of the hospital the security chief henry bascomb dances father andedie dance they were engaged in a discussion and were looking over documents on the table before them stuart glanced up and smiled gesturing with an index figure meaning dance guessed theyd only be a moment or two her mother glanced her way and then expression neutral returned her attention to the hospital director hi a mans voice said from behind her she turned blinking in surprise to see michael oneil michael whats going on dance asked breathlessly with furrowed brows he asked didnt you get the message just the text from dad that they were here i didnt want to bother you in the middle of an operation i spoke to overby and gave him the details he was supposed to call when you were finished oh well this was one glitch she couldnt lay at the feet of her thoughtless boss shed been in such a hurry to get to the arraignment shed never told him theyd wrapped the chilton takedown i heard hollister went okay yeah everybodys fine chiltons in custody traviss got a banged head thats it but the roadside cross case was far from her mind she stared into the cafeteria whats going on michael the charges against your motherve been dropped he said what oneil hesitated looking almost sheepish and then said i didnt tell you kathryn i couldnt tell me what the case ive been working on the other case it had nothing to do with the container situation thats still on hold i took on your mothers case as an independent investigation i told the sheriff i was going to do it pretty much insisted he agreed stopping harper now was our only chance if hed gotten a convictionwell you know the odds of getting a verdict overturned on appeal you never said anything that was the plan i could run it but i couldnt mention anything to you i had to be able to testify that you knew nothing about what i was doing conflict of interest otherwise even your parents didnt know i talked to them about the case but only informally they never suspected michael dance again felt rare tears sting she gripped his arm and their eyes met brown on green he said frowning i knew she wasnt guilty edie taking somebodys life crazy he grinned you notice ive been talking to you in text messages a lot lately emails right because i couldnt lie to you in person i knew youd spot it in a minute she laughed recalling how vague hed been about the container case but who killed juan daniel pell pell she whispered in astonishment oneil explained though that it wasnt pell himself whod killed juan millar but one of the women connected with himthe partner that dance had been thinking of yesterday as shed driven her children to see their grandparents she knew the threat you presented kathryn she wanted desperately to stop you why did you think of her process of elimination oneil explained i knew your mother couldntve done it i knew julio millar hadnthe was accounted for the whole time his parents werent there and there were no other fellow officers present so i asked whod have a motive to blame your mother for the death pell came to mind you were running the manhunt to find him and getting closer your mothers arrest would distract you if not force you off the case altogether he couldnt do it himself so he used his partner he explained that the woman had slipped into the hospital by pretending to be applying for a job as a nurse the job applications dance said nodding recalling what connies investigation had found there wasnt any connection between them and millar though so we didnt pay any attention witnesses said that she was wearing a nurses uniform as if shed just gotten off a shift at another hospital and had come over to mbh to apply for a job the deputy continued i had her computer examined and found that shed searched for drug interactions on google the evidence in the garage she planted it i had pete bennington take the garage apart a cs team found some hairsthat harpers people had missed by the way they were hers dna match im sure shell take a plea i feel so bad michael i almost believed shed dance couldnt even bring herself to say the words i mean mom looked so upset when she told me that juan asked her to kill him and then she claimed she wasnt on the icu floor when juan was killed but she let slip that she knew the place was deserted except for some nurses oh shed talked to one of the icu doctors and he commented to your mother that all the visitors had left edie was never on the wing at all a miscommunication and an assumption not much excuse for that in her line of work she thought wryly and harper hes going forward with the case nope hes packing up and going home to sacramento hes handed off to sandy what dance was shocked oneil laughed noting her expression yep not much interested in justice only interested in a highprofile conviction the mother of a government agent oh michael she squeezed his arm again and he put his hand on hers then was looking away she was struck by his countenance what was she seeing a vulnerability a hollowness oneil started to say something and then didnt maybe to apologize for lying to her and withholding the truth about his investigation he looked at his watch got a few things to take care of hey you okay just tired alarm bells sounded within dance men are never just tired what they mean is no theyre not okay at all but they dont want to talk he said oh almost forgot i heard from ernie the la case the judge refused to push off the immunity hearing its starting in about a half hour dance displayed crossed fingers lets hope she then hugged him hard oneil fished his car keys out of his pocket and headed up the stairs apparently in too much of a hurry to wait for the elevator dance glanced into the cafeteria she noted that her mother was no longer at the table her shoulders slumped damnit shes gone but then she heard a womans voice behind her katie edie dance had come out the side door and presumably waited to join her daughter until oneil left michael told me mom after the charges were dismissed i came by here to see the people who supported me to thank them the people who supported me there was silence for a moment the pa system gave an incomprehensible announcement somewhere a baby cried the sounds faded and from edies expression and words kathryn dance knew the complete weave of what had happened between mother and daughter in the past few days the difficulty had nothing to do with her leaving the courthouse early the other day the issue was more fundamental she blurted i didnt think youd done it mom really edie dance smiled ah and coming from you from a kinesics expert katie tell me what to look for to see if youre telling a fib mom katie you thought it was possible id killed that young man dance sighed wondered how big the vacuum in her soul was at the moment the denial died in her mouth and she said in a shaky voice maybe mom okay maybe i didnt think less of you i still loved you but okay i thought you might have your face in the courtroom at the bail hearing just looking at your face i knew you were considering it i knew you were im so sorry dance whispered then edie dance did something completely uncharacteristic she took her daughter by the shoulders firmly more firmly than dance believed shed ever been held by the woman even as a child dont you dare say that her words were harsh dance blinked and began to speak shhhhh katie listen i was up all night after the bail hearing thinking about what id seen in your eyes what you suspected about me let me finish i was up all night hurt furious but then finally i understood something and i felt so proud a warm smile softened the round contours of the womans face so proud dance was confused her mother continued you know katie a parent never knows if they get it right im sure youve wrestled with that oh only about ten times a day you always hope you pray that you give your children the resources they need the attitude the courage thats what its all about after all not fighting their battles but getting them prepared to fight on their own teaching them to make judgments to think for themselves the tears were streaming down dances cheeks and when i saw you questioning what i mightve done looking at what had happened i knew that id got it one hundred percent right i raised you not to be blind you know prejudice blinds people hate blinds people but loyalty and love blind people too you looked past everything for the truth her mother laughed of course you got it wrong but i cant fault you for that the women embraced and edie dance said now youre still on duty go on back to the office im still mad at you but ill get over it in a day or two well go shopping and then have dinner at casanova oh and katie youre picking up the check chapter kathryn dance returned to her office at cbi and wrote up the final disposition on the case she sipped the coffee that maryellen kresbach had brought her and looked over the pink phone message slips that the assistant had stacked beside a plate containing a very thick cookie she considered the messages at length and returned none of the calls but ate percent of the cookie her phone beeped a text from michael oneil kjudge has ruled in la will release decision in next few hours keep your fingers crossed lot going on today but will talk to you soonm please please please a final sip of coffee and dance printed out the report for overby and took it down to his office heres the disposition charles ah good the man added that was a surprise the direction the case took he read the report fast she noticed a gym bag tennis racket and small suitcase behind his desk it was late afternoon on a summer friday and he was probably leaving directly from the office for his weekend place she detected a certain chilliness in his posture attributable undoubtedly to her flying off the handle with hamilton royce and so she was looking forward to what was coming next sitting opposite her boss she said theres one final thing charles its about royce whats that he looked up began smoothing her memo as if wiping off dust she explained what tj had uncovered about royces missionto stop the blog not to save victims but to derail chiltons exposé about the state representatives being wined and dined by the nuclear plant developer he used us charles ah overby continued to fiddle with some papers he bills his time to the nuclear facilities planning committeewhich is headed by the representative chilton was writing about in the power to the people thread of the blog i see royce hmm i want to send a memo to the ag its probably not a crime what royce did but its definitely unethicalusing me using us itll cost him his job more fiddling overby was considering this are you okay with my doing that she asked this because it was clear he wasnt im not sure she laughed why not he went through my desk maryellen saw him he used state police for his own agenda overbys eyes dipped to the papers on his desk they were as ordered as could be well itll take up our time and resources and it could beawkward for us awkward bring us into that interagency crap i hate that this was hardly an argument life in state government is all about interagency crap at the end of a chewy silence overby seemed to come up with a thought his eyebrow lifted a bit besides i think you might not have time to pursue it ill fit it in charles well the thing is theres this he found a file on his credenza and extracted a stapled document several pages long whats that matter of factthe second eyebrow joined inits from the ags office he pushed the papers forward across the desk it seems there was a complaint made against you me apparently you made racist remarks to a county employee charles thats crazy ah well it went all the way to sacramento who complained sharanda evans county social services ive never met her its a mistake she was at monterey bay hospital when your mother was arrested she was looking after your children oh the woman whod collected wes and maggie from the hospital play area charles she wasnt looking after them she was taking them into custody she didnt even try to call me she claims you uttered racist comments jesus christ charles i said she was incompetent thats all she didnt interpret it that way now since you generally have a good reputation and no history of problems in the past the ags not inclined to open a formal complaint still its got to be looked into he seemed torn about this dilemma but not that torn he wanted some input from people on the ground about how to proceed from overby himself he meant and she understood too exactly what was going on here dance had embarrassed overby in front of royce maybe the ombudsman had gotten the impression that the man couldnt control his employees a cbiinstigated complaint against royce would call overbys leadership into question of course youre not racist but the womans pretty hot under the collar about it this ms evans he stared at the inverted letter in front of dance the way one would gaze at autopsy photos how longve you had this jobeither not long enough or way too long kathryn dance realized that her boss was negotiating if she didnt go any further with the complaint about royces impropriety overby would tell the ag that the social workers claim had been fully investigated and that there was no merit to it if dance did pursue the royce matter she might lose her job this sat between them for a moment dance was surprised that overby was showing no kinesic evidence that he was feeling stress she on the other hand observed her foot bobbing like a piston i think i have the big picture dance thought cynically she came close to saying it but didnt well she had a decision to make debating he tapped the complaint report with his fingers a shame when things like this happen we have our core work then other stuff intrudes after the roadside cross case after the rollercoaster with the j doe case in los angeles after the harrowing days worrying about her mother dance decided she didnt have the heart for a fight not over this if you think a complaint against royce would be too distracting charles ill respect that of course its best probably lets get back to workthats what we need to do and this well just put away too he took the complaint and slipped it into the file how blatant can we be charles he smiled no more distractions back to work dance echoed okay i see its late have a good weekend and thanks for wrapping the case kathryn good night charles dance rose and left the office she wondered if he felt as unclean as she did she doubted it very very much dance returned to the gals wing and was just at her office door when a voice behind her called kathryn she turned to see somebody she didnt recognize at first then it struck herit was david reinhold the young deputy from the sheriffs office he wasnt in uniform but was wearing jeans a polo shirt and jacket he smiled and glanced down off duty he approached her and stopped a few feet away hey i heard about the roadside cross case kind of a surprise she said his hands were jammed in his pockets he seemed nervous ill say that boyll be okay though hell be fine and chilton did he confess i bet he doesnt need to weve got him on witnesses and pe cold she nodded toward her office lifting an eyebrow inviting him inside i have some things to take care of i stopped by earlier and you were out a curious thing to say and she noted that he seemed even more nervous now his body language was giving off high amperage of stress i just wanted to say ive really enjoyed working with you appreciate your help youre a very special person reinhold stammered uhoh where was this going reinhold was avoiding her eyes he cleared his throat i know you dont really know me very well hes at least a decade younger than i am she thought hes a kid dance was struggling to keep from smiling or looking too maternal she wondered where he was going to invite her on a date anyway what im trying to say is but he said nothing just pulled an envelope from his pocket and handed it to her what im trying to say is that i hope youll consider my application to join the cbi reinhold added most older people in police work arent very good mentors i know youd be different id appreciate the chance to learn from you struggling not to laugh dance said well david thanks i dont think were hiring right at the moment but i promise you when we do ill make sure to get this to the top of the list really he beamed you bet you have a good night now david and thanks again for your help thanks kathryn youre the best for an older person smiling she walked into her office and dropped heavily into her chair she sat staring at the entwined tree trunks outside her window her cell phone chimed not much in the mood to talk to anybody she looked down at the caller id window after three rings of debate she hit answer chapter a butterfly eased along the fence and vanished into the neighbors yard it wasnt the time of year for monarchs the migratory lepidoptera that gave pacific grove its subtitle of butterfly town usa and kathryn dance wondered what kind it was she was sitting on the deck which was slick from the lateafternoon fog it was quiet now she was alone the children and the dogs were at her parents she wore faded jeans a green sweatshirt stylish wish shoes from the brown companys fergie linea treat shed allowed herself after the conclusion of the case she sipped white wine her laptop was open in front of her dance had logged on as a temporary administrator to the chilton report after shed found the access pass codes in one of james chiltons files she consulted the book shed been reading from finished typing the text and uploaded it httpwwwthechiltonreportcomhtmlfinalhtml dance read the results gave a faint smile then logged off she heard heavy footsteps on the stairs leading up from the side of the house and turned to see michael oneil hey he smiled she had been expecting a phone call about the magistrates ruling in los angeles as to whether the j doe case would proceed hed seemed so preoccupied at the hospital she hadnt expected him to show up here in person no matter michael oneil was always welcome she tried to read his expression she was usually good at thisshe knew him so wellbut he still had on a poker face wine sure she retrieved a second glass from the kitchen and poured him his favorite red i cant stay long okay dance could barely control herself well the smile escaped we won got the word twenty minutes ago the judge blew the defense out of the water for real dance asked slipping into adolescentspeak yep she rose and hugged him hard his arms slid around her back and pressed her to his solid chest they stepped apart and clinked glasses ernie presents to the grand jury in two weeks theres no doubt theyll return a bill they want us down there on tuesday nine am to plan out the testimony you up for a trip oh you bet i am oneil moved to the railing he was gazing out into the backyard staring at a wind chime that dance had been meaning to pick up from the spot where shed dumped it on a windyand sleeplessnight some time ago he fell silent something was coming dance could tell she grew alarmed what was the story illness was he moving he continued i was wondering she waited her breath was fast the wine in her glass rocked like the turbulent pacific the meetings on tuesday and i was wondering if you wanted to stay down in la a few extra days we could see the sights get those eggs benedict we were hoping for or maybe we could go out for sushi in west hollywood and watch people trying to be cool i could even buy a black shirt he was rambling which michael oneil never did ever dance blinked her heart thudded as fast as the wings of the hummingbird hovering over the crimson feeder nearby i he laughed and his shoulders slumped she couldnt imagine what her expression looked like okay theres something else i guess i ought to say sure annes leaving what she gasped michael oneils face was an amalgam of emotion hope uncertainty pain perhaps the most obvious was bewilderment shes moving to san francisco a hundred questions filled her mind she asked the first the children theyll be with me this news wasnt surprising there was no better father than michael oneil and dance had always had her doubts about annes skills at mothering and about her desire to handle the job of course she realized the splitup was the source of oneils troubled look at the hospital she remembered his eyes how hollow they seemed he continued speaking with the clipped tone of somebody whod been doing a lot of rapidfireand not wholly realisticplanning men were guilty of this more often than women he was telling her about the childrens visiting their mother about the reactions of his family and annes about lawyers about what anne would be doing in san francisco dance nodded concentrating on his words encouraging mostly just letting him talk she picked up immediately on the references to this gallery owner and a friend of annes in san francisco and he the deduction she made didnt truly surprise her though she was furious with the woman for hurting oneil and hurt he was devastated though he didnt know it yet and me dance thought how do i feel about this then she promptly tucked that consideration away refusing to examine it right now oneil stood like a schoolboy whod asked a girl to the eighthgrade dance she wouldnt have been surprised if hed jammed his hands into his pockets and stared down at his shoe tips so i was just wondering about next week a few extra days where do we go from here dance thought if she could hover over herself looking down as a kinesic analyst what was her body language saying she was on the one hand deeply moved by the news on the other she was as cautious as a warzone soldier approaching a roadside package the appeal of a trip with michael oneil was almost overwhelming yet the answer of course could not be yes for one thing oneil needed to be there for his children completely there one hundred percent there they might notshould nothave been told about their parents problems at this point yet they would know something childrens intuition is a primary force of nature but there was another reason for dance and oneil not to share personal time in los angeles and coincidentally it appeared just now hello called a mans voice from the side yard dance held michael oneils eye gave a tight smile and called up here in the back more footsteps on the stairs and jonathan boling joined them he gave a smile to oneil and the two men shook hands like dance he was in jeans his knit shirt was black under a lands end windbreaker he wore hiking boots im a little early not a problem oneil was smart and more he was savvy dance could see that he understood instantly his first reaction was dismay that hed put her in a difficult position his eyes offered a sincere apology and hers insisted that none was necessary oneil was amused too and gave dance a smile not unlike the one theyd shared when last year theyd heard on the car radio the sondheim song send in the clowns about potential lovers who just cant seem to get together timing they both knew was everything dance said evenly jonathan and i are going to napa for the weekend just a little gettogether at my parents place i always like to bring along somebody to run interference boling was downplaying the getaway the professor was smart toohed seen dance and oneil togetherand understood that hed walked into the middle of something now its beautiful up there oneil said dance remembered that he and anne had spent their honeymoon at an inn near the cakebread vineyard up in wine country could we just shoot these ironies dead please dance thought and she realized that her face was burning with a girlish blush oneil asked wes is at your mom and dads yep ill call him i want to cast off at eight tomorrow she loved him for keeping the fishing date with the boy even though dance would be out of town and oneil had plenty to cope with thanks hes really looking forward to it im getting a copy of the decision from la ill email it to you she said i want to talk michael call me sure oneil would understand that she meant talking about him and anne and the impending separation not the j doe case and dance understood that he wouldnt call not while she was away with boling he was that kind of person dance felt a fast urgea hungry urgeto hug the deputy again put her arms around him and she was about to but for a man who remained unskilled at kinesic analysis oneil instantly picked up on her intention he turned and walked to the stairs got to collect the kids pizza night bye jon and hey thanks for all your help we couldntve done it without you you owe me a tin badge boling said with a grin and asked dance if he could carry anything out to the car she pointed out the shopping bag full of soda water snacks and cds for the drive north dance found herself clutching her wineglass to her chest as she watched oneil start down the deck stairs she wondered if hed turn back he did briefly they shared yet another smile and then
