changes the collegium chronicles book mercedes lackey dedicated to the memories of martin marty greenberg and mark shepherd well miss you chapter mags shaded his eyes and peered across the uneven ground of the kirball field at the opposing team huddled up in front of their goal and forced himself to relax there was no point in getting tense this was only a game after all he had to keep reminding himself of that even as nervous sweat trickled down the back of his neck and inside his gloves his palms were moist only a game being played in front of hundreds of people to most of whom you are just a red shape on a white horse even with colin calling the gameplay they still wouldnt know who you were the voice in his head was as familiar as his own now warm and slightly amused thanks fer makin a lad feel special dallen he muttered under his breath knowing the great white horseshaped smartaleck beneath him had very keen ears dont mention it came the cheerfully cheeky reply mags was wearing red rather than herald trainee grays because his kirball teams color was redalthough to be strictly accurate only his padding and helmet were red but since the kirball field was deliberately awash with dangerous obstacles the players wore fullbody protection so very little of his grays were showing the same went for the rest of his teammatesunrecognizable in padded helmet in red metal faceguard in red neck collar shoulder pads upper and lower arm braces elbow and knee cups thigh protection chest and backplate and armored boots they looked more prepared for combat than a game not that most people would ever have recognized this as a game field either gullies corrugated the field which also contained a major ravine little hills with abrupt dropoffs stone fences as well as rail fences culverts bridges and even a stream that led into the river there were no big hills but there were bits of very steep slope enough to make even the most surefooted companion pause it most closely resembled the obstacle course or perhaps a steeplechase racecourse but unlike the obstacle course there was no pattern no obvious path you were supposed to take around the field it was in fact far more random than nature would have created a calculated randomness that ensured that there were no easy places anywhere except in front of the goals at either end were two identical little stone buildings with ramps up to the tops of them the ramps had been stone too when the game had first been played now they were stone and rammed earth and the squat towers were buried to their ramparts in the rammed earth after the first four games the stone ramps had been deemed a bit too narrow and dangerous and earthen slopes made sure there were no abrupt dropoffs flagpoles thrust up from the tops of the towers flying pennants in the team colors red for south and green for west flapping bravely from the towertips in a brisk breeze they needed that breeze today it was wicked hot it wasnt only nerves making mags sweat the bathing room was going to suffer a stampede beneath him his companion dallen was as steady as a statue which made him feel steadier it wasnt nerves that bothered him so much as the everrecurring dread that he would somehow let the team down he wasnt the only one who felt that way though so he was in good company he knew this because he could sense it he wasnt just a mindspeaker who could make himself heard by anyone whether they had the gift or not he had just a touch of empathy too enough to be useful most of the timeenough to tell him that his teammates were fighting similar knots in their guts the emotional stakes were much much higher today than they had ever been before the kirball game they were playing was part of this concluding day of a week of presentations tours and demonstrations put on by all three collegia for the benefit of the parents and relatives of trainees and the townsfolk of haven valdemar was bigger than ever with trainees coming from farther afield the collegia were changing some people liked the changes while others were fighting any change at all the king wanted to show what the results here were and he didnt want even a hint of elitism or a shadow of secrecy to color peoples perceptions of the collegia he reckoned the best way to nip rumors in the bud would be to throw open the doors for a general look around give us a slosh of that water then would you dallen craned his neck around and opened his mouth mags obligingly poured most of the water from the halfgallon sized bucket the team runner had just brought them down dallens throat a lot of it sloshed out of dallens mouth but enough of it went down to quench his thirst mags tossed the empty bucket to the boy who ran it back to the sidelines to be refilled having a team runner was a good ideaespecially as the team runners were mostly from the healers collegium they generally knew when you needed something without needing to be asked since the ones with healing gift also had empathy huddle up ordered the south team captain herald trainee gennie swathed in her armor and helmet only her voice betrayed who she was the whole team converged on her including the foot who moved into the center standing at the heads of the horses and companions this game wasnt just for herald traineeswhich was in part the point each team had been made up of four herald trainees four riderswho could be anyone with a horse or horses who had tried out for the team and won a placeand four foot who could also be anyone but in practice tended to be young guardsmen in a real fight heralds would fight alongside everyone else in kirball herald trainees learned how to use their gifts and skills in partnership with people who had no such advantages weve had the first quarter and we took it slow by agreement between me and the west captain gennie told them we wanted the townies and the parents to get a good grounding in kirball before we went all out that was why i told you all to play easy and slow so now its time to show the game proper gloves are off bout time pip grumbled trainee pip was certainly the most keen kirball player on the south team and may have been in the entire collegium he and his companion were never happier than when they were scrumming now heres where we need to talk show versus strategy she grinned at pip a flash of teeth showing behind the metal faceguard remember that the point of this whole match is to give the crowd a show its a demonstration and we need to think about how it will all look from out there she waved her hand at the crowds pressed in along the fences around the kirball field a steady murmur of voices came from beyond the bounds so dont scrum too long or theyll get bored theyll like a bit of football but theyll like running better west team never lets us scrum much anyway halleck pointed out its those evil little ponies of theirs said one of the guard foot jeffers son of a wealthy tradesman gave him a hurt look he was mounted on his favorite kirball horse a scrappy little pony that looked ridiculously small under him present company excepted of course corwin amended your ponies arent evil jeffers not evil to you anyway jeffers corrected there were three ways to score the first was to lob a kirball through the windows or the door of the opposing teams tower that was one point the second was to occupy the tower and hold it for a quarter candlemark that was ten points and so far no one had ever had the temerity to try it sure you could get in there but neither horse nor companion would fit inside and the enemy foot were only too eager to mob you and drag you out ending your occupation meanwhile your own team didnt dare abandon their goal to come to your rescue lest the opposition make goals while they did lobbing balls was a lot faster and easier than an occupation and your ten points could easily be negated by what they did at your goal while your team held them off while you occupied the third was to steal the opponents flag and get it back to your tower that was fifty points and pretty much gameending because you had to get the flag back to your home base in order to make the score and it was pretty harrowing to have an entire team bearing down on you while you tried to do that foot generally guarded the goal and the flag although gamewinning ploys had in the games past been engineered by one of the foot sneaking close enough to the opposing teams flag to snatch it the foot obviously didnt use mounts and the companions were as much a part of the team as the herald trainees who rode them but the rider units nowthat was where much of the uncertainty in kirball came from mags didnt know horses didnt understand horses but obviously they werent companions they could be pressed and harassed in ways the companions would just shrug off many of them didnt like being crowded into the fence around the field nor the close quarters in a scrum none of them liked being rammed although by this point they had become somewhat inured to it not west teams ponies though like north the west teams riders were all rich enough to have a mount for each quarter unlike north these were all tough hardy little mountain ponies smart and fast and if mags was any judge as insanely happy to play the game as their owners they were almost as good as the companions in his opinion sometimes it seemed to him that all they lacked was mindspeech and he wasnt altogether sure some of those ponies didnt have that as well the scrum didnt bother them the least bit they played football with zest theyd nip in along a fence and scuttle like weasels and they had no problem with forcing a collision what they lacked was sheer size bigger horses and companions could ride them down or bowl them overthere were no fouls in kirball since it was at bottom training for war the size disadvantage might be the main reason why the other teams hadnt immediately swapped out their mounts for similar ponies you couldnt use trained warhorses for this though warhorses would be downright dangerous on a kirball field they were trained to use hooves and teeth in defense of their riders and while kirball was designed to be rough it wasnt supposed to be lethal mags looked up and down the field which was entirely surrounded on all four sides by spectators there were the trainees from all three collegia of course shoved up tight against the fences in clots of gray light green and rusty red in among them were the whites of full heraldsmostly the teachers here since summer meant that the heralds were out in the field in forcethe sober forestgreen of healers the scarlet of bards and the dark blue of the guard but far outnumbering those colors were the colors that were not uniforms there were parents and siblings of those trainees of all sorts who could make the journey here guards out of uniform and up on some elevated viewing stands nobles of all ranks and ages in all their finery as well as those who were not nobles but merely wealthy scuttling about and hoping not to be noticed were the pages and squires attached to the court who probably should have been at some duty or other and carefully avoiding anyones eyes were servants in palace livery other than that of the guards who were doing the same then there were the townsfolk invited up for this day so that they could see for themselves what the trainees of the collegia were aboutall craning their necks from behind the rows of trainees and teachers and nobles and family behind them were the companions of every size and shape and age bonded or not they were here to see the game and mounted up and trotting or striding in and out of the crowd were the players of the other two teams telling all and sundry how the game was playedand how it should be played glancing at them mags felt the nervous sweat start up all over again the south grays were himself pip gennie the captain and halleck the south riders were a mix of young nobles and townsfolk who were also taking classes at the collegia jeffers and meled were two of the latter reese and young lord wess the former their four foot were all young guardsmen though when the teams had been started two of them had been thought too young to join the guard proper corwin danvers holly and beales all four were young for the guard young enough to be kept here at haven for a year or two to get in some serious training while living at home before being sent out to a guard garrison somewhere else sixteen was generally the youngest that the guard would take and the youngster had to be a very mature sixteen at that eighteen was preferred they were all only sixteen and the captain of the guard here very much approved of kirball as fine training for them they had relief players now too two foot and one rider the herald trainees however had now concluded that while it might be a fine thing to be a kirball hero it was also a lot of work and you had better be at the top of the athletes to play so the sixteen grays who were on the four kirball teams had no relief players on the other hand kirball had aroused enough interest among the nobles that now all the riders had four mounts one for each quarter presented to them by noble patrons jeffers father had presented him with carte blanche to pick a fourth mount for his birthday somewhat to his shock jeffers had passed by all the big handsome highbreds that had been offered him and had chosen a second little cob as like to his scrappy favorite as a twin the others hadnt had a choice three nobles had presented them with mounts they deemed suitable still none of those literally gift horses had been utterly wrong for the game and if they were not outstanding they were certainly good enough for an easy quarter the first quarter had started off quickly no matter what gennie said there had been nothing slow about it west had nipped in as soon as the game was on one of their riders had snatched the ball and made a dash for the goal and got it in the rest of the quarter had been running up and down the field over the obstacles with no one getting a clear advantage until right at the end when gennie and pip had taken clear control of the ball and had traded it back and forth until halleck got into good position and he had bunged it in to tie the score strategy strategy said gennie we cant tire out those ponies but we can make them their riders and maybe even their trainees lose their tempers and get grumpy and we can wear out their foot so lets leave off trying to goal for this quarter and do that pip and i will harass the foot make them guard their flag mags and halleck you and the riders play some hard football with their companions and riders dont be afraid to get bruised but dont knock anyone over either not yet anyway pip raised an eyebrow isnt that going bit hard for an exhibition we might upset some parents halleck snorted not as long as therere no broken bones or broken necks people like to see some danger as long as everyone walks away from it corwin nodded maybe you didnt hear it over the noise but me old man was shouting at me from sidelines telling me to break some heads he dont mean it literally but hed have been the first one on his feet shouting hurrah if id pulled someone down no broken heads but no easy quarter of it either gennie told them if were given the gift of a goal opportunity take it but otherwise we concentrate on giving them a hard time and not letting them score on us pip laughed now wouldnt it be the height of irony if wests captain is telling his team the exact same thing right now the companions all snorted gennie grinned thats why were against west for this exhibition instead of north or east harkon couldnt be more unlike me and still be in grays dean wants a good exhibition game not a mirrormove chess match it was their ball and mags had it and when the whistle blew signaling the start he feinted to pip then dropped it straight down among the legs of the riders he and dallen stayed to contest it while pip and gennie headed straight for the west goal momentarily confusing the entire west side half of whom thought pip had the ball and half seeing mags drop it knew it was down among the feet of their mounts it took west a moment to sort themselves out then they were all back into the scrum leaving their foot to be harassed by pip and gennie now one of the wests grays had fetching gift they knew that of course and west knew that they knew and in all the games that had been played before he had never actually used it until now they had always assumed that anyone using fetching gift would be standing off to one side and concentrating hard to manipulate the ball into the goal or more likely grab the flag from afar since it was a tricky gift and required absolute concentration so they had assumed they hadnt counted on the wielder using it for something very small kicking the ball into the open for instance that didnt require any more concentration than hitting it with one of the kirball sticks but that was exactly what he did and the moment he did one of the other west grays pounced on it like a cat on a catnip toy this was not how they had planned things they have the ball he shouted into the minds of his teammates together with the projected image of the gray with the ball who was even now pelting toward the south goal mags and dallen skittered across the ground to intercept him the rest a few paces behind how gennie blurted incredulously then got the image from dallen exactly as it had happened her reply was rude and laden with exasperation at herself for not foreseeing this very thing but their foot were on it as fiercely determined to prevent a goal as mags had ever seen them no matter where the ball went they were there first and instead of hitting it back hard they hit it into the most awkward places they could the third time they blocked it one of them managed to shoot it into a tangle of bushes and at that point it became a scrum again it stayed a scrum right in front of the south goal until the whistle blew and everyone had to back off because it was time to start the third quarter and get a change of horses where did that play come from corwin asked wiping his head and neck down with a towel and accepting water from a runner fetching gift gennie said her voice thick with disgust oh too bloody smart altogether hes using it to bunt the ball just a little he doesnt have to stand off and concentrate on it to do that he just needs to see it she took off her helmet dumped a pail of water over her head and jammed her helmet back on theyve been keeping that little play a secret thats for sure then wed better not put the thing in the air corwin warned hell bunt it there too well then we have to keep him from seeing the ball jeffers said slowly which means one of us has to mind him thatll be me wess volunteered immediately this rack of bones is no good in the scrum and hes tall enough im practically sitting on a cliff ill mind him for the entire quarter now it was scarcely fair for wess to call his horse a rack of bones but it was one of those gift horsesvery well bred rather too well bred for kirball and very tall the gelding was like lightning on straight even ground but he couldnt turn the way jeffers ponies could and he got very nervous when his footing was uneven oddly enough hed take getting rammed and was astonishingly eventempered about herding or being herded in fact his temper was the best thing about him all right that will leave us a rider short so well just have to make up for it by the way foot damn fine job on that save this in mags opinion was one reason why gennie was such a terrific captain now remember that if the ball gets in clear sight it just might start to act unnaturally so be alert expect it to change direction at any point so heads up stay sharp well have to play this quarter by best guess and go all out in the last hup the third quarter was a frantic mess wess did manage to keep the fetching gray occupied during most of it but the time or two he broke free and got an eye on the ball it clearly had a mind behind it there was no telling where it would go for certain and all they could do was follow it and one of those times the other team scored a goal the timing could not have been worse for south theyd made a series of spectacular saves but the ball was still in front of their goal one of wests players managed to scoop the ball into the air but instead of hitting it toward the goal he smacked it in the opposite direction mags thought he was mad until he realized that the fetching trainee had gotten free of wess he realized that too late the ball suddenly acted as if someone else had hit it with a paddle in midairsending it straight for the goal the trainees and riders who had been in hot pursuit couldnt reverse fast enough and just when it looked as if holly was going to make the save the ball did a bizarre drop bounced once then an invisible hand smacked it into the goal the crowd went insane mags swore and he was pretty sure that the rest of his team was turning the air blue with curses as well dallen danced under him with frustration they were so determined now that it was mere moments from the point where the ball came into play again that they had it in front of wests goal but try as they might they could not manage to shake it out of the scrum and the quarter ended with west still ahead by one this is the point where i should be a good sport and remind you all that this is only a game gennie said crossly as they huddled as your captain i am supposed to keep the greater good in mind right yeve reminded us mags managed from between clenched teeth now ow dye really feel ballocks to that cant said gennie fiercely her eyes gleaming behind the faceguard i know they werent cheating but did they have to pick the day were playing in front of half of haven to pull that trick out ive got a trick of mown corwin said grimly are there any rules bout gettin help from the side so longs its not touchin the ball there had been some extremely stringent regulations laid down regarding extra players on the field or a spectator using any gift to interfere with players ball or flag gennie and the others looked at each other noooo gennie said slowly you know all the rules as well as the rest of us corwin so i assume whatever you have in mind doesnt break anything existing what are you going to do keep em busy but keep half an eye on their goal corwin said when you see me pop up in front of it get the ball tme anyhow now they all looked at gennie who shrugged weve got nothing to lose and we have to make two goals to win she pointed out try it corwin hup so it was football again with jeffers and halleck keeping the fetching trainee so busy he was never able to put an eye on the ball for as much as a heartbeat mags couldnt figure out what corwin was up to he seemed to be holding his place in front of their goal steady as a rock when suddenly he blinked out just vanished and when mags threw a startled glance at the wests goalthere he was corwin he shouted into everyones heads and fast as a snake pip had the ball up out of the scrum and in the air and gennie hit it as hard as she could in a fast drive to corwin while jeffers and halleck boxed in the fetching trainee and shoved him down a slope corwin leaped into the air and snatched the ball out of it then tucked it under his arm put his head down and charged like a bull for the goal there were no rules about that either although no one in all of the games that had been played so far had ever tried to run the ball to the goal physically no one could believe that corwin was doing it the wests foot stunned for an instant charged for him they all met in a cloud of dust and a tangle of limbs right at the door of the goal the entire south team ran for the west goal by the time they got there the pile had sorted itself out and the referee had gotten there he really didnt need to make a ruling though the ball was clearly just over the threshold corwin had made the goal but corwin was still on the ground groaning and holding his arm against his body and three healers had peeled out of the crowd at a run with four healer trainees and a stretcher behind them goal for south colin shouted over the fieldtrumpet foot corwin down substitute for south corwins sub a blue by the name of jamson ran out to join the south foot as everyone watched nervously the healers huddled over corwin who couldnt be seen for all the greenclad bodies mags watched his heart in his throat how badly was corwin hurt had he cracked his skull there was an awful lot of stone around those goals finally one of the healers popped his head up just a broken arm he called the crowd exploded with cheers they cheered again when two of the healer trainees hoisted up the stretcher with corwin on it and he waved feebly with his good arm gennie rode up to him as he was carried off the field talked with him for a moment or two then signaled to the referee for a time out as she rode back to join the rest as corwins porters made their way through a sea of wellwishers the team gathered around gennie how in the name of kernos did he do that jeffers demanded herald tamlin gennie grinned and as about half of the team including mags looked puzzled she added his gift is to make you see things that arent there waitwhat jeffers said then his eyes widened so the corwin at our goal wasnt really there gennie nodded hes an old friend of corwins family they probably worked this out between them last night she shrugged he was right theres no rule against it it wasnt as if he were cloaking corwin sneaking up on the goal corwins just that good at sneaking and i cant believe he charged in there like that me either pip said with admiration he looked down at the substitute think you can play up to that standard laddy jamson gulped but he straightened his back ill give it all ive got trainee gennie nodded with approval well said all right theres not much time left in the quarter so do whatever it is you need to do to win this game just dont break any skulls however the game ends it wont be said that we didnt give them a fight if west expected them to be shaken by corwins loss they were quickly disabused of the notion play started with a fullon charge headed by souths riders who were all over the fetching trainee pip got the ball and he and gennie dribbled it up and down the sides of the field which effectively prevented about half of the west riders and companions from closing in on them mags and dallen concentrated on harassing the edges of the action giving special attention to wests riders acting as if they were about to ram then just brushing by that rattled the riders who kept bracing for collisions that never happened getting their ponies irritated and in a lather and then in desperation the fetching trainee broke free the ball popped straight up into the air but pip was already on it standing up in his stirrups as his companion managed to simultaneously scramble toward the midair ball and keep pip steady pip hit it with a mighty backhanded swing while the riders mobbed the fetcher the ball arrowed toward mags mags saw two things simultaneously as time seemed to slow to a crawl he could make the same swing and had even odds of getting it to the goal but halleck was in the clear with a better shot the odds were in favor of halleck halleck he shouted ball and he stood in his stirrups and gave the ball a second whack sending it screaming toward halleck as three of the four west trainees barreled toward him grimly intent on stopping him they were too late but they had too much momentum pull up or change direction he and dallen were hit by three companions with only a moment to prepare instead of bracing dallen was scrambling backward when they were hit with mags clinging to his back like a burr dallen scrabbled and nearly went over sideways he saved them both with a catlike twist of his body scrabbled a bit more as dust rose about them in a cloud and fetched up against one of the dropoffs which was all that saved them from going over meanwhile the roar of the crowd signaled that halleck had made the goal and the shrill whistles of the referees signaled the end of the game ow dallen said sitting down abruptly mags leaped from the saddle i think i pulled my offside hock the companion stood up gingerly put a little weight on the hoof and winced definitely ow but a healer trainee was already jumping down off the top of the dropoff he must have jumped onto the field as soon as dallen felt the first twinge of pain easy on there old man the fellow said cheerfully give me a moment the healer wrapped both his hands around the injured leg as mags fidgeted anxiously dallens sigh of relief was echoed by his chosen put a little weight on it old man the youngster told him see if it will bear being walked on dallen did as he was told tell him it hurts but ill be able to get up to companions stable under my own power and thank him mags did so adding his own thanks the healer waved it off just stay off it as much as you can for the next two days ill come by for another treatment or two barring any emergencies coming up mags never got a chance to thank him a second time he vanished into the mob that poured over the field to hoist halleck onto their shoulders i saw what you did gennie told him with a grin walking up to him with her own companion trudging beside her you could have taken the shot and been the hero of the game but you didnt he shrugged got nough just bein in the game dallen snorted impolitely ill just get up to the stable then he said with great irony and turned slightly to limp his way past them mags laughed ye think well get i trouble fer corwins lark gennie shook her head the action mimicked by her companion there were no rules against putting an illusion of a player on the field only against sending in an extra remember these are war games well get faintly praised for thinking of something new faintly damned for scraping so close to cheating and theyll make a rule against getting help from off the field that isnt a healer or a runner now we had better go see to our companions and get cleaned up and changed and out there she waved her hand vaguely at the rest of the collegia we need to go be halleck and corwins eversomodest teammates mags nearly choked on his laughter coughing so that gennie had to pound on his back and when he had recovered they followed in dallens limping wake chapter mags was scarcely likely to let dallen limp his way up to the companions stable alone nor leave him in the hands of the hostlers no matter how competent they were he saw to dallens comfort himself of course making sure he got a good rubdown before he went off himself to a coldwater wash under the pumpanything but a hardship in this blistering heatand a change into clean trainee grays he stripped as close to bare as he could get and did the job thoroughly every bit of him was itchy with drying sweat the grounds of the palace had been cordoned off quite properly and only those who actually lived within the palace walls were being allowed to get past the watchful eyes of guardsmen who knew them all by name but the rest of the grounds had the atmosphere of a fair this was aided and abetted by the food and drink tents and the various demonstrations by trainees of all three collegia there was a big official bardic concert scheduled for the last event of the day but there were bardic trainees scattered all across the grounds alone or in groups happily showing off their prowess the game had been the big event for the herald trainees but quite a few of them were ambling about the lawns with their companions making themselves available for questions and as for the healershealers collegium had an open clinic where anyone could come for treatment simple cases were treated by the trainees more complicated ones by the healer teachers and many of the healer trainees had little booths set up to teach people about the signs of various illnesses in humans or animals and how to prevent as much disease as possible mags best friend bear had one of these booths demonstrating the use of his standard herb kit it had been very popular all this week it made sense to people that there were things they could do for themselves and some parents and relatives of trainees had come from places where there simply wasnt a healer nearby these were the very people who needed bears instruction the most he had spent all week demonstrating things it didnt take a gift to dohow to set a bone treat cuts and other injuries how to handle common nonlifethreatening ailments and most importantly when to recognize early enough to do something about it that what you were facing needed an expert one of the full healers was with him of course but in the background most people probably wouldnt notice he was there and if they did they would probably just be relieved that bear obviously had collegium approval the packs had proven themselves over the winter in guard stations and in the hands of heralds on circuit now it was time to distribute them more widely so that every farrier and midwife and priest who cared to could make use of them not that he had the approval of every healer out there there were those who thought the packsand this instruction had they known about itwere an unmitigated disaster in the making these highly conservative healers were not unlike the highly conservative heralds who did not approve of going from the old system of traineeplusmentor to a collegium education over a five year period with a just a year with a mentor after being put into whites never mind that there were not nearly enough healers to fill the need and never mind that healers mostly stayed at their house requiring the patients to come to them rather that riding circuit as heralds did whichs pretty hard on th feller whats far off mags reflected aint like he kin wait like a judgment can things had to be rather dire before a healer would leave a house of healing or his own home village to attend a remotely situated patientthis was on the logical grounds that if he went riding about no one would know where to find him in an emergency the unspoken rule was that the patient came to the healer not the other way around as with so many things in valdemar that had been all right before valdemar got so big that the healers were stretched as thin or thinner than the heralds were and now well it did make sense to keep a scarce resource in one place at all times it made sense but in mags view and bears and evidently that of the collegium itself if you were going to put people without a local healer in the position of stay put and die or be moved and suffer you had better be prepared to offer them an alternative for things that they could handle themselves so long as you showed them how unfortunately some of those highly conservative healers were bears own family hed fought them once over the packsthey had been using the scandalous and foolish invention as the reason to haul him home so he could marry some neighbor girl unlike the rest of the male members of his family bear did not have a healing gift he was a pure genius with herbs and had the skill of a prizewinning seamstress with knife and needle but that seemed to matter not at all to bears family mags suspected that the only reason they had allowed him to attend the collegium in the first place was with the vague notion that the collegium might trigger something dormant in him to make him like the rest of them like a gifts contagious or somethin or like soot an it cn rub off on ye when it didntand when the collegium began to foster with considerable delight bears very real abilities with herbs surgery and bonesetting their solution to the problem was to bring him back to breed to a willing girl in the hopes that one of his children would have the gift that he did not whichs stupid an meanspirited an treats him an thet poor gel like a couplea prize cows mags approached bears booth quietly it was on this last day of the festival even more popular if that were possible like the other booths it was a halftent providing welcome shade for those who came to be instructed and issued a voucher for the kits that would be going out soon with the guard supplies today people were not only listening attentively they were asking questions from where he stood mags couldnt hear most of them but the healer kept nodding slightly with approval and had a slight smile of satisfaction on his face no it was far more than just satisfaction this was the look of someone who was not just satisfied but proud of his pupil mags stiffened suddenly as he sensed someone who was not who was in fact in a towering rage he turned slightly to see a man in healers greens to his right and behind him whose face was utterly rigid and every muscle tight he did not have to lower shields to know why although he had never actually met one of bears family there was no mistaking the features the shape of the bones beneath the skin was the same especially about the cheekbones and chin the hair was the same chestnut brown and the man had the same sturdy build with added muscles that bear would no doubt acquire with age and work mags did not hesitate this man was so angry with his young relative that he wasnt even thinking of the damage giving free rein to his temper could cause the confrontation he was about to start was going to turn into an incident one that would cause a great deal of harm not only to bear not only to the healers but to all three collegia he halfclosed his eyes and concentrated on the healer overseeing bear he didnt know the man but after all his gift was to mindspeak into anyones head whether or not they had the gift themselves meanwhile dallen would be doing something on his ownpossibly alerting the kings owns companion rolan he didnt even have to tell dallen what was going on they lived in each others heads so much that unless either of them blocked out the other what one knew the other did maybe not everyone would care for that sort of closeness and lack of privacy but mags liked it and it certain made things easier at times like this sir he said urgently and saw the healer start tis trainee mags onef bears familys here an hes about tmake a mighty todo the healer looked about and quickly spotted both mags and bears relative mags kept his mind open and heard the mans halting reply can you summon discreet help yessir he replied immediately already on th way done chosen he heard dallen say as soon as he had replied but it will take them a few moments if bears brother makes a move toward the tent before the reception party gets there soit was bears older brother not good got it mags said just as he saw the mans face harden with decision and the little movement that suggested he was about to stride toward the booth he ran up to the man before he had a chance to take that first step and stood directly in his path scuze me healer he said with a combination of deference and authority i don blieve yeve got yer badge on the man stared at him taken completely by surprise badge whatwho are you ye gotta hev a badge sir mags said insistently without identifying himself just in case bear had ever talked about him at home as being a friend besides he was in grays that should be identification enough to give him the authority to accost anyone he needed to ye gotta hev a badge badge sez who ye are an ifn yer fambly ifn yer teacher they be clearin townies out soon ony famblies an teachers kin be ere then ye gotta hev a badge sir the mans face darkened i dont need some stinking he began and at that point the help arrived he found himself engulfed by a crowd of healers and guards four of each the healers greeted him heartily the guards interposed themselves in such a way that there was no way he could get past them to bear without forcing his way through something they were not prepared to allow his face reddened but the healers were all talking loudly one of them the largest flinging an arm around his shoulders before he quite realized what they were doing they had hustled him off toward healers collegium quite the opposite direction from bears booth mags sensed that the confrontation had not been prevented however merely postponed he winced inwardly this was going to be a bad day for poor bear no matter what the outcome bear always emerged from a clash with his family feeling miserable most likely cause he kin never win well at least he would have had his week of approval before getting hit with the hammer of family scorn mags could never figure this sort of thing out why couldnt they see it made no sense to him and even if they couldnt see why didnt they just leave him alone bear had the approval of the collegium why wasnt that enough for them possibly because they feel that they know best and cannot imagine that there is no one true way actually applies to them dallen said remember bear is the first of his family to be trained here at the collegium rather than at home by the elders of his extended clan they might give lipservice to the collegia and healers circle but in their hearts i imagine they think that they have the only answers worth knowing im beginin tthink aint so bad bein a orphant he replied wryly and on that note you had better go console lena shes feeling downcast mags shook his head and went looking for his other best friend he found her as he had half expected sitting on the grass of one of the lesser gardens beside the bush that hid the grave of her pet rabbit she had a lute with her and was playing it softlytoo softly to attract any listeners who had dozens of bardic trainees standing or sitting all over the grounds all vying for their attention the dead rabbit was what had brought them together in the first place she had brought her pet with her to keep her company but it had been elderly and had died during her first winter here mags who himself had not been at the collegium for more than a few days had found her sobbing out here alone with the poor thing in her lap trying to scratch out a grave for it in the hard frozen ground heyla he said plopping down on the grass why th long face lena sighed and brushed her dark hair out of her brown eyes melting brown eyes bear called them with a sigh of admiration bear had taken to talking a lot about lena when he and mags were together and she wasnt with them he said a lot of nonsensical things about her looks always with sighs or a foolish grin most of it didnt seem to make much sense fine call her eyes pretty or soulful or entrancingthose all made sense but melting mags didnt see how you could call her eyes melting if her eyes were doing that it would be hideously painful for her and rather nasty to watch he grabbed his concentration back from where it was wandering among words in time to catch what was making lena so sad funny thing about heat it made your mind want to ramble off somewhere its the concert she said mournfully aye that had him confused they gi ye a solo ye don like they being he actually lenas father bard marchand had been put in charge of the concert possibly because if he was put in charge everyone knew that he wouldnt load the thing up with his own solos as some other bard might be tempted to do that was not because bard marchand was modest nor because he was fair nor even because he was generous it was because there would be no one of importance at this concertonly the common folk of haven and the parents and other relatives of the collegium trainees the highborn who had the trainees of the collegia about them all the time really had not given a fig for the activities of this week with the exception of the kirball game they could hear the trainees any time they liked and many of the teachers made extra money by playing at their parties so for the notables and wealthy of haven only the kirball game had provided a variation in their usual schedules and they would much rather enjoy music in the cool and luxury of their own dwellings than out in the sultry night in the park and marchand would really rather be there too if the audience didnt contain anyone important bard marchand was not particularly interested in putting in more than a token appearance hed have to do something of course he was the famous bard marchand there was no way hed get out of some sort of performance but it would be short and there would be no encores they havent given me any solo at all lena said tearfully i just found out today all i have is my part in the chorus the schedule still hadnt been set this morning there were a lot of bardic trainees all of them wanted solos and it had been decreed that the only fair thing to do was wait until the last minute to decide who would be performing what to allow for people suddenly improving mags blinked what why they said its because i froze at the contest she said in despair and they said its because i chose such a simple song for the contest they said im not ready for such a big audience now mags knew very well that the only trainees at lenas level who were not getting a solo were the ones who were performing in some sort of small ensemble or who had specifically asked to be let off he tried to put a good face on it although inwardly he was angry if lena had known she wasnt going to be given a solo she could at least have gotten into one of the smaller groups she was well liked among the bardic trainees and when she sang in a group she never tried to overwhelm anyone else people appreciated that but he throttled down his temper and tried to put a good face on things well ye are summut shy he told her could be they thought they was doin ye a favor could be they reckoned yed be able t enjoy the festival wout getting yerself all over pothered worritin over yer piece she shook her head and wiped her eyes im probably just not good enough she said shakily not like farris he drew a complete blank at the name farris who be farris she left off pretending to play and fished out a handkerchief farris grevner hes new hes fathers protege they gave him three solos mags felt his temper flaring and threatening to escape the leash he had put on it if mags had had bard marchand in front of him at that moment hed have flown at him and broken his nose for him it was bad enough that half the time lenas father seemed to have forgotten that she even existed and the other half used her to get to people he deemed importantlike mags himself back when hed saved bear from that assassin and when hed been the first star of a kirball team but to take on a protege when his own daughter was right here and would have cut off her own hand to get some approval from him then to give the boy three solos in the concert and lena none it was beyond belief father cant show me any favoritism she said her voice sounding wretched i understand that everyone knows im his daughter and he cant treat me differently than anyone else its not right s also not right tgive his trainee three solos mags replied voice thick with indignation thas th same sorta favoritism oh it doesnt matter she exclaimed tearfully one three the only thing that matters to me is that i didnt get any mags patted her hand helplessly there wasnt much he could say or do at this point it was too late to ask to be included in a small group even her best friends wouldnt do that without at least a little time to rehearse all he could do was to let her cry on his shoulder and remind her that even if it had been meant as a slight she was still going to get to enjoy the last day of the festival without getting all of a knot over her piece and to rein in his own temper tight he had to think of something to distract her he wouldnt leave her to sink in misery another of those welcome breezes sprang up cooling his head and helping him to cool his temper jest go give yerself a wash he suggested then as he wished that bear was here something else occurred to him one sure way to distract her would be to give her something else to think about onea bears relations turned up dallen says tis his older brother he got ambushed by somea th other healers fore he could make a pother but you gotta know hes gonna chew on bear afore he goes home thats true lena replied looking faintly alarmed and drying her tears on her sleeve well reckon bears gonna need some coolin an a friendly face an i misdoubt th one ell wanta see is mine he put a little force into his words and she nodded he was thinking furiously now trying to figure out if marchand had done this to his daughter out of anything other than sheer lack of caring about what she thought or what happened to her and what if it wasnt marchand at all what if this new pet of his was behind it all an look ye if someun did mean ye tget hurt by this well if they see ye cryin ye jest gi em what they want eh so dont he made her look at him mebbe tis farris mebbe e wants ye tfeel like es

and looked at him in a way that suggested she was shocked certainly that had never occurred to her well acourse it didnt she never had tfight fer nothin till she got here while this sort of thing was very different from the daily frantic scrabble for food and shelter and even the tiniest bit of comfort that mags had endured for most of his childhood as a mineslave the motives were much the same and he recognized them for what they were now best fer ye tdo is sit down an have yerself a hard think he told her firmly lookit how good this is fer ye ye got no pressure ye want t play fer folks well ye kin sit down jest bout anywhere an do it like ye bin an enjoy it wiout havin t match up wi anyun else so there git a wash make yersel pretty go take a nice corner an git a liddle audience make

slowly i do see youre right mags she laughed a little and that is why you are a herald trainee and im not he snorted but secretly he felt a little pleased it felt as if this was the first time he had actually put it all togetherwhat he was supposed to do and how he was supposed to do it the being a herald that is and for the first time he didnt need dallen to tell him he was right because it all felt right shoo he said with a chuckle i spect t see ye out there wi a smile an a audience bears prolly safe nough till after dinner so ye stick wi im e gits called ye foller sos ye kin be there after aye aye she replied and got up she brushed off her skirt and walked resolutely back to bardic collegium mags watched her go and nodded with satisfaction pocket pie dallen asked hopefully he laughed aye ye greedy git ill find ye a pocket pie good make it two chapter by the time dinner came dallen had been stuffed with pocket pies mags had found a herd of younglings hanging around the door to the companions stable watching the door yearningly he made it known that many of the companions from the kirball game were inside recuperating that they were all partial to pocket pies and that as long as he was there they were welcome to come in and offer treats the kiddies shot off like so many barn swallows chasing insects and came back with their hands full of pies you know youve been nominated for the status of a minor god dont you dallen told him as he cleaned himself up a second time even without doing anything other than stand about answering kirball questions or questions about being a heraldic trainee he had been sweating and he wasnt going to change into something nice without a second wash a second wash until hed come here hed never had any kind of a wash except by accident when he got rained on on a hot day like today he not only didnt mind a cold bath in the pump he preferred it ill take it mags chuckled wouldn mind bein a god ye kin hev m four an twenny handmaids lay out me good uniform take it back ye kin send twa out here t wash mback he heard dallens snorting laugh even outside if i sent even one youd be blushing so hard theyd think youd fallen into a vat of scarlet dye oh thets right i keep fergettin yere th ladykiller not me he toweled off his hair vigorously there reckon i wont offend no uns nose now cause now i don smell like you i take back all the nice things i said about you thets cause now yer stuffed too fulla pie tmove he let himself into his room in the stable and got out his good uniform not his bestthat was for fancy occasions like the special parties that master soren held or for use on the remote chance he would be required to attend some court function or other but that was about as likely to happen as for dallen to sprout wings and fly this outfit was something new something the dean had decided he needed and had again found among the stored trainee uniforms outgrown by highborn trainees best was far more suitable for winter being of warm materials good was for summer the tunic and trews were light moleskin rather than canvas they felt like soft leather but were thinner and cooler the shirt was a very light linen of the same sort that highborn and wealthy ladies used for chemises the boots were light leather gloveweight the tunic and collar and cuffs had very subtle embroidery at the hemlydia had told him it was called a featherstitch everyone would be wearing some form of good clothing tonight at dinner most of them except for the bardic trainees would not be wearing uniforms this was not a collegium dinner this was a family affair and now that the trainees had spent a full week with their families seeing them only in uniform it was time for them to dress and act as part of their families for a few hours everyone with family visiting would be seated with them rather than among their fellows dinner would also not be in the dining hall it would be outside in the gardens it was the only way to accommodate all the visitors though anyone who was not a relative was being gently ushered out the gates right now since the big concert would be held down in haven itself mags wasnt sure he was going to attend that he would have gone if lena was playing a solo but now well hed see how he felt after dinner he ambled up to the palace noting that the noise had died down considerably and that a small army of people was busy cleaning up the grounds not that they needed much cleaning people had been very respectful but there were places where flowers had been trampled things had been spilled or upset bits of ornamentation or halfeaten treats discarded given how fast the folks were working though it wouldnt be a candlemark before everything was set to rights finally now that the sun was westering the worst of the heat was over and those fitful breezes had turned into a nice soft zephyr of a wind the picnic was actually going to be a pleasure he heard footsteps on the path behind him and recognized them immediately only one person he knew walked with that particular care choosing each step with an eye to making as little noise as possible without actually sneaking wed better hurry or everything decent will have been snatched up said the kings own herald nikolas with a chuckle as he came up even with mags i swear you would think these people had never had a decent meal in their lives theyve been devouring everything in sight all week if you had to pick nikolas out of a crowd you would never be able to his hair and eyes were indeterminate brownish colors his face was so unmemorable it practically fled from your memory the moment you looked away part of this was just nikolas himself but most of it was skill a skill he was training mags in with particular intensity and only with a handful of people would he have let his guard down enough to have made a remark that was something other than innocuous since mags now knew very well that when a trainee came from a family that was living in poverty the crown compensated them quite generously for the loss of a working pair of hands he laughed no trainee from any of the three collegia had to endure guilt knowing how good his life had become while his family struggled sono no one who had turned up here was actually starving most of the time might be bein as its here at the palace makes em think food mun somehow be better he offered might jest be cause celebratin means food tworkin folk but most likely cause tis stuff they never seed afore an figger never tsee again he scratched his head i mind when i got ere i didn even know what tcall alf uv what they gie me very likely care to eat with me and amily mags his mentor offered bear and lena too of course isuggested to the healers that they should keep bears brother away from him for now theres no way to keep a confrontation from happeningfamily has rights of coursebut there is no reason to ruin the lads day or a triumphant week for that matter tomorrow will be soon enough at the moment i dont believe bear even knows his brother is here mags heaved a sigh of relief good he said sincerely thet yer doin sir in part in part id like you and bear to come with us to the concert as well nikolas sighed a little we have a lot of work ahead of us you and i and this will probably be the last chance youll have for a lot of social time with your friends you and i have a project we will have to undertake that is going to occupy every bit of your free time and probably some of your class time as well mags felt as alert as if someone had doused him with a pail of ice cold water he waited for nikolas to elaborate but it seemed he was going to have to wait i am not going to discuss it with you right now nikolas continued you might as well enjoy this last truly free day without having to think about much of anything just remember the relaxation exercises you have learned put this aside and enjoy the evening mags nodded he had learned a very great deal from one of the healers lately on nikolass advice and one of those things was a series of mental exercises that allowed him to put something out of his mind and not merely appear relaxed but actually be relaxed it had made him that much more valuable to nikolas as someone with the ability to fit in and appear casual in virtually any situation because he actually was relaxed and casual the only time he really couldnt use the exercises was on the kirball field should we go git amily sir he asked it was a good question since amily was so lame as to be virtually crippled the accident that had taken her mothers life had broken her leg in several places no one where they were had known what to do and by the time shed seen a healer the bones had already started to mend all wrong wonder if that aint parta why bears so hot on his healin kits anyone with the basic knowledge that bear was providing would have known at least how to immobilize amilys leg in such a way that though she might have been lamed she would not have been crippled no she has a place set up for us nikolas replied we just need to collect some food and round up bear and lena speaking of which there is bear just packing up they had by this time reached the row of healers teaching booths bear was putting the last of his demonstration kit back together and talking animatedly with a middleaged woman when he finished just as they neared he handed the kit to the woman to her surprise and voluble thanks he turned in time to see them approaching and waved the woman took this as her signal to tender her thanks once more and make an exit taking the kit clutched to her chest with her midwife bear said without being asked been here every day askin good sensible questions reckoned i could trust her with it heyla herald nikolas you kidnappin mags and you and lena if you knowah there she is lena appeared as if conjured though mags had the notion shed been somewhere nearby just out of sight waiting for bear to be finished so that she could just happen to come by as the dinner bell rang which it did at that moment your timing is impeccable lena nikolas told her with a little bow that made her giggle i have orders from amily to round up the lot of you so that you can make sure to get some of all her favorites from the repast on offer we are not accepting your refusal he did not mention lenas father nor the concert nikolas had been a heraldic trainee at the same time that marchand had been at bardic he had been the one who uncovered one of marchands misdeeds that had earned him a terrible but fully justified rebuke he knew very well that marchand would have left lena to wait for him in vain even if he hadnt been involved with setting up the concert im thinkin might be nikolas oughta get that godhat dallen was offerin aha bear said pushing up his lenses which were always sliding down his nose now the truth comes out you have caught me out nikolas made a mournful face i am too old and decrepit to dash from table to table for my daughters pleasure mags laughed all right grandad he said impudently well do yer dashin fer ye nikolas shook an imaginary cane at him someonevery possibly other heralds for amily was much belovedhad set nikolass daughter up very nicely on the lawn nearest the entrance to the kings owns quarters she had sole possession of the one substantial tree there which provided plenty of shade and was seated on a comfortable pile of cushions against the trunk there was a huge blanket easily big enough for a dozen people to picnic on spread out in front of her more cushions stacked to one side and a big basket which presumably contained plates and cups hail oh queen of summer bear intoned as they reached her making a comical bow we your loyal subjects await your command amily was in mags opinion prettier than lena though her beauty was so quiet and contained that hardly any of it was obvious like her father she had brown hair and eyes that were of no particular shademore like all of them mixed she shared his knack for blending in with the background when she chose tothough right now she wasnt choosing to and her lively expression when she saw them all made mags smile she blushed a little and laughed well my wish is for you all to get us food youre the biggest bear so you and papa get our main course mags you get the other dishes and lena you get the desserts she said but in such a way that you clearly understood she was grateful mags dashed off knowing exactly what it was he was going to be looking for he had been snooping at the preparations so he knew which of her favorites were going to be served up the cooks were more than prepared for people who were getting food for more than just themselves and had provided baskets hastily sewn together out of coils of grass not intended to last past the picnic and most of the food was intended to be eaten with the fingers mags returned in triumph laden with baskets heaped with vegetables in puffpastry a nice selection of cheeses little individual loaves of bread a clever cup of butter made of a cabbage leaf and raw vegetables cut up bitesized with a hollowedout cabbage holding something to dip them in he was the first to return and amily was laying out plates from the basket as he put down his bounty one of the collegium servants left a pair of pitchers with water beading up on the glazed surface beside amily nikolas and bear returned next with cold ham a baconandegg pie and a whole cold roast chicken lena was very partial to ham but amily preferred chicken mag was amused to see that bear had the chicken and nikolas the ham last of all came lena with a basket full of pocket pies honeyballs and strawberry or custardfilled tarts quickly the food was distributed and there ensued contented silence broken only by such quiet sentences as don spose there be morea them mushrooms and anyone want ham mags for one hadnt eaten since breakfast as he didnt like to have more than a bit of soup just before a game and he was fairly certain bear hadnt taken a break to eat all day between the two of them they managed to inhale anything that no one else wanted and when the last crumb was gone and no one wanted to send them off for another round they reclined on cushions with identical expressions of satisfaction nikolas looked at them with incredulity where do you put all of that he demanded as the girls giggled i am quite certain the human stomach cannot possibly contain everything you put into yours theyre growing lads niko said the dean of the heralds collegium herald caelen strolling up and sitting down on a corner of the blanket dont you remember when we could eat like that he rubbed his middle with a mournful expression no more alas too many honeyballs and i will look like one the breeze stirred the leaves of the tree above them a page came by to collect the baskets with another to pick up the dishes and carry them away nikolas sighed what do you want caelen he asked with resignation echoing mags sudden suspicion that caelen was not here by accident you would never drop yourself down on my picnic without a by your leave unless you wanted something caelen pretended to look offended it isnt what i want its what you want your little project with mags will count toward his year in the field the circle approved nikolas smiled with satisfaction herald caelen was another around whom he actually showed something other than a smooth mask and how much brandywine did that take am i going to have to restock your cellar enough and yes nothing like being able to choose your moment to make a request caelen chuckled it does help that they all feel guilty about assuming mags was some kind of bizarre assassin planted among us at least we wont have to worry about that again nikolas grumbled i swear to you if i hear the words black and companion together in the same sentence any time soon i am going to use the speaker for mucking out rolans stall from now until the death of the universe and ill help caelen promised then stole a cushion from nikolas and stretched out on their blanket curse whites i would love to lie down on the grass right now liar nikolas said throwing a second cushion at him which he confiscated and added to the first truthspell me caelen said lazily then tell me about the old sticks are they coming around who do i need to cosset and coddle and coax amily and lena ignored all this in favor of whispered conversation that involved a bit of giggling but bear and especially mags listened with fascination mags filed every word away for laternikolas would probably ask him about it this was how things were done he had learned at least among the heraldsnot in stiffly formal meetings conducted like religious ceremonies but between two old friends who happened to be very powerful men nothing they discussed was earthshaking yet it was all important what nikolas knew was vital to the future running of this new heraldic collegium armed with this caelen would know where to put forth extra effort in bringing other heralds who did not approve of this new way of training the newly chosen around he didnt know all of the old sticks all that well but nikolas knew everything about everyone if he didnt know exactly what it would take to convince someone he at least knew all the strings to pull to make the reluctant herald dance caelen could do the rest when mags had first gotten here he had thought that caelen was very intelligent very kind and rather unworldly he had gradually come to realize that caelen hid a very shrewd nature and sharp political savvy behind that unworldly exterior while nikolas knew how to make himself invisible caelen knew how to make himself look utterly harmless what caelen knew about those in his care was vital to how nikolas would continue to make use of the collegium and the trainees in it though he lived at court nikolas rarely interacted with the collegium he didnt even know who all the trainees were caelen was able to tell himand tell him who their parents were and what if any important ties they had that was where mags came in part of his job was to be nikolas eyes and ears among the trainees so occasionallyto bears eyebulging surprisenikolas would ask him a question about one of the trainees and he would answer it in as much detail as he could which was often quite a lot eventually the conversation went from quite serious to light and personal and it was obvious nikolas was not going to ask mags any more questions that was when bear nudged him what was all that about bear whispered mags shrugged you might as well tell me now ill pester you until you do bear pledged aint nothink really ye saw how herald nikolas likes tknow bout all the heralds ony theys too many trainees now fer him t put eye on personal so youre his eye huh bear regarded him thoughtfully and with a touch of admiration i spect this little project of his means youll be taking time off classes again sowhat hes training you to be a spy mags blinked at his friend he never in a hundred years would have suspected bear of being that astute nowaitdont tell me just let me know if you need me to cover for you like get you class notes or something so you dont fall behind or find out about the sorts of things i know about bear chuckled at mags expression what you saved my life and if youve forgotten that i havent i owe you twas more barrett an is crew than me mags said weakly twasnt barrett standing off a madman with a poisoned blade bear retorted you know nikolas remarked conversationally you two havent actually been whispering for quite some time they both froze oh mags said weakly nikolas looked at caelen caelen shrugged as well as a man lying flat on his back with his hands under his head could you know i advised this some time ago caelen said you have your little gang which includes me its time for mags to build his own nikolas nodded by this point lena and amily had given over even pretending to gossip and were staring listening avidly mags glanced around they were in an excellent position not to be overheard virtually everyone nearby had packed up and gone off elsewhere those who remained were not anywhere near close enough to hear them yes we are surrounded but at a distance and theyre all part of my gang as caellen puts it nikolas said as he followed where mags was looking he pointed with his chin thats healer sofrens who came from my village rolan told me to bring him along when i was chosen little did i know his father was beating him half to death whenever he was drunk which was becoming distressingly often over there are three of my yearmates who helped me when i was being trained as i am training you mags and bard lita jakyr was part of my group too but hell not show his face where lita is if he can help it now he sighed jakyr like lita still is a part of my network in fact i suspect my errands are part of the reason why he and lita had a falling out mags thought about that and decided to say somethingbecause at this point he knew quite a bit about herald jakyr the man who had rescued him from the mines when mags masters would not allow dallen anywhere on their property jakyr was a good man he had to be in order to be a herald but if nikolas thought that he was to blame for what had fallen out between jakyr and his former lover well he needed to be told otherwise mebbe part not all he said firmly i owes herald jakyr mun rescued me eh but e rabbits soons e thinks a females thinkin temples and pledges dunno why but thats is prollem an you got naught tdo wiit sir now it was nikolas turn to stare how on earth did you work that out mags snorted fust candlemark i was ere fust pusson we met was bard lita don need tbe mindspeaker twork thet out when tis in fronta yer face caelen coughed get to the point niko nikolas shook his head right look you twothis is something amily already knows im the kings primary information gatherer he means spy caelen said helpfully nikolas glared at him ive been doing this as long as ive been kings own i was doing it before i was kings own in fact this isnt usually what the kings own does by the way i just happen to be quite good at it where anyone else might have looked a little uncomfortable right now mags was struck by howrelaxed and ordinary nikolas looked he was so used to playing the role that now he probably couldnt remove the mask anymore so to speak now of all the trainees i have examined over the years mags is proving to be the best at doing the same things i do so i have every intention of making him into my partner if all goes well hell replace me eventually but i sincerely hope this will be a partnership for a good long time good amily said firmly i wont worry as much if there are two of you mucking around doing secret things and i think mags has more sense than you do papa caelen smothered a laugh nikolas sighed and rolled his eyes never have children he advised bear they either cause you to wish that you had smothered them at birth or they turn into your mother grandmama has more sense in her little finger than you do in your whole body papa amily said nikolas looked aggrieved to return to the subject nikolas said severely no one can do this sort of thing without support so you three are to form part of that support pick who else you tell carefully ask caelen first ill tell my group so they know to help you and to take you seriously if and when you come to them for help all four of them nodded some uv th kirball team mags said meditatively gennie an pip an mebbe halleck lydia and master soren thetll do fer now good choices all caelen nodded as he spoke lena on no account are you to tell your father she gulped and looked a little guilty but she nodded i promise sir she pledged not a word to father caelen sat up good because tobias marchand couldnt keep a secret if someone sewed his lips shut on it im off see you at the concert he got to his feet and dusted himself off tell the boys to put the double saddle on rolan would you nikolas asked then glanced at mags unless tell him yes dallen said instantly uh dallen says to tell you yes mags relayed obediently oh he means to put the double saddle on him so ill he blushed so no one will ever think twice about you being in my company nikolas smiled slightly well cement everyones speculation that you and amily are close by having you take her to the concert everyone knows how protective i am of amily theyll assume when they see us together that i am keeping a stern eye on her suitor which you are papa amily giggled you cant fool me quiet wench nikolas growled i still have parental rights you know a little respect if you please mags didnt know quite where to look so he settled for staring fixedly at a vague point in the distance now lena was giggling bear elbowed him they exchanged a look then mags dared to look at nikolas who sighed and shook his head ill get dallen and meet you here mags said hastily using that as his excuse to escape but as he was getting the peculiar double saddlenot so much a double saddle as a saddle with a seat a bit more secure than a pillion padarranged to dallens satisfaction something occurred to him why dont all heralds know nikolass the kings spy because whenever they think about it we companions point out how ridiculous an idea that is dallen replied immediately mags was stunned i thunk ye couldn lie in mindspeech you cant said dallen its not a lie it is ridiculous no other monarchs own in the history of valdemar has been a spy its insane its impossible so you cant lie in mindspeech but you dont have to tell the truth either that was a revelation it was one that could be useful all we do is tell the exact truth we just dont exactly answer the question mags thought about that some more would ye ever do thet tme not xactly answer th question no the response was so immediate and so forceful that he was taken aback why not he had to ask but the answer was yet another he hadnt expected because you could tell what dallen nudged him in the shoulder with his nose now hurry up and mount everyone is waiting chapter the concert was fine lena acted like a trouper singing in the chorus without a sign that she had been slighted mags wanted to dislike marchands protege but he couldnt or at least he couldnt dislike his musicianship he didnt perform anything original and if he had bardic gift he didnt display it but he certainly was a good musician and his three solos were warranted mags supposed he did play three wildly different instrumentsflute fiddle and trumpet nor were any of his solo pieces overly long more like interludes while larger groups got on stage so maybe marchand wasnt trying to show off his protege just doing something sensible to keep people from being bored maybe but if mags was any judge probably not marchand never did anything unless it had some possibility of making him look good finding a young bard with that much raw talent and ability was going to make him look good that was what mags figured anyway amily loved the whole concert and afterward herald nikolas whisked them all off to a very enjoyable evening at an inn where a troupe of actors was performing short comic plays with performances by acrobats and tumblers in between mags suspected that nikolas was trying to distract lena if so it worked she was still laughing and chattering with amily about the funny lines in the plays as they all parted to go to bed but as he climbed into bed himself after throwing all the windows open to the breeze he was not thinking about the comic plays nor was he really thinking about the inevitable confrontation bear was going to have in the morning nor how lena was going to deal with this newest slight on the part of her father oh those things were in the back of his mind but he had something more personal to occupy his thoughts right now nikolas project he said hesitantly to dallen i know ye all gossip worsen bored kitchen help ani know rolan tells ye things sometimes whatcha know bout it some as you have already guessed its about the assassins well that was scarcely a surprise although they aint exactly assassins he pointed out fust time they was just spyin nears we kin tell second time they was after thet book fer their code kay they kidnapped bear when they was pretendin tbe envoys an stuff but we figger twas ttake carea the un thet went crazy there wouldnta been no killin at all if theyd been able tget off palace grounds wi im twas ony bein cornered an caught made em dangerous they mighta been bullies but they didn really hurt anyone till then and they might have remained merely kidnappers until they had no more use for bear dallen responded a little tartly as mags tucked his hands behind his head and stared at the vague shadow of a bat flitting about the ceiling catching bugs we don know thet he protested then sighed but aye prolly second time though he shuddered at the memory of the ruthless cold killer whose mind had brushed against his so many times aye that un he was somethin ida called an assassin and hed planned to destroy the stable full of companions as a distraction while he stole back the book he needed to decipher the coded messages of his superiors well nikolas intends to set the two of you up in haven as a father and son in some shady business or other im not sure what it is it will be shady enough that youll have a lot of contact with criminals but also so no one will be surprised to see guardsmen or constables coming in from time to time dallen seemed a little perplexed this is not my forte i cannot imagine what that could be but i am sure he has something worked out what he wants to do is find out if there are any more of these people either that there are some who havent left or new ones to do that he has to discover who set them up here in haven they knew next to nothing about valdemar someone had to give them local help he wants to find that personor persons once he does with luck we might have a better path to discovering what they wanted and where they came from and why one of them thought he recognized me a trace of that uneasy thought must have crept across to dallen you do know that this could all have a very very simple explanation dont you he blinked an whatd thet be mistaken identity they do say that everyone in the world has a twin somewhere perhaps he knew your twin mags sensed dallens mental shrug the simplest explanation is generally the correct one mebbe but mags didnt really believe it no there was something more going on there but worrying at it was not going to solve it right now either more interesting was that nikolas was going to set the two of them up together and that he had openly called him a partner in front of the others this this was amazing yet at the same time it woke old aches he knew one reason why nikolas had chosen him for this lifeit was because he had no family if he vanished there would be no repercussions as there would be if say he were highborn or had other connections that could cause complications the few people who knew him on sight would not let it slip if they saw him in an unexpected place or out of uniformnot like someone with a hundred cousins who might bump into him and accost him loudly and publicly there was no one that he could let things inadvertently slip to who didnt already know what he was doing he had no ties no loyaltiesexcept to the heralds who had saved him from what would have been a very short life of starvation privation and pain in the gem mines he was related to no one in valdemar owed no one else anything and no one owed him he was the orphan child of two young people who didnt even speak the language and who had been murdered by bandits the few things that had been left offered no clues as to their land of origin he could not have been more perfect to be trained as a spy if nikolas had gone out and arranged it all himself and that was the ache although he made jokes about how he preferred being an orphan the truth was when he saw people who were happy in their familiesmaster soren and his niece lydia nikolas and amilyhe was raw with envy family brought along baggage but it also gave support of a sort hed never had except for dallen stop whingin bout what ye caint change he scolded himself jest think yer folks coulda been like bears or they coulda hated heralds oh his head knew that but his gut now his gut knew what it wanted like salthunger meathunger this was familyhunger in his rare moments of quiet thought it always came back to him what had his parents been like would they be proud of him now or horrified by him had they been running from something what what kind of blood ran in his veins what would he have been like if hed had a real family a mother and a father surely he had actual blood relations somewhere if only he could figure out where they were shet it he told his gut sternly mind whut they say be careful what ye ast fer yer like tget it an in the wust possible way there was no point in looking for trouble trouble was all too inclined to come looking for him wake up layabout mags came awake all at once the legacy of the years when you woke just before the kick came so you could roll out of the way and pop up on your feet whahey he replied sitting straight up in bed and swinging his legs over to the floor before he was able to form a coherent thought whuts th mergency no emergency rolan just told me what you and nikolas will be doing he and nikolas want you to be thinking about what you believe youll need based on when you were playing the blind beggar down in haven hes already got an identity as a fellow who deals openly in secondhand goods who is secretly something they call a fence thats someone who takes in stolen goods and gets rid of them where no one knows theyre stolen or sells them in turn to someone wholl take them so far away the theft wont be known youll be his son tell im i reckin i should be deef he answered promptly i be good at holdin mtongue an i kin make whatever signs an mindspeak whut im sposed thev said straight to im an peoplell talk free round me thinkin i caint hear em ill tell them if you can think of anything else tell me nikolas wants to start tonight these fence people usually dont work until after the sun goes down huh takin in stolen stuff guess thetll be whut brings guards an constables an i reckon well be passin em whut we learn mebbe theyll be passin whut they do it sounded as if he was going to be doing without sleep for a while well worse things had happened than a little lost sleep he washed up and pulled on his uniform nikolas hadnt said anything about skipping classes heyla dallen mind nikolas thet i knows sparklies thetd be th reason for why e keeps me bout oh good idea he began mentally calculating what it was going to take to pull this off fortunately that exhibition game of kirball was the last the teams would play this season it was just too hot to play in that open field in all the armor and padding practice and games would resume in the fall when it was cooler and herald caelen wants to see you about your class schedule now he asked in surprise after breakfast well that was interesting perhaps he had better postpone making plans until after he heard what caelen had in store for him back at the mines hed loved and hated summer in equal measure hated it because the longer days meant longer work loved it because at least he wasnt freezing all the time when he could snatch a free moment there were things you could eat to be grubbed up out of the woods fields and stream and because even he miserable creature that he had been was able to see the breathtaking beauty in a summer morning now he was well fed healthy andyeshappy and a walk up from companions stable to the dining hall on a perfect summer morning was enough to make him want to sing not that he would he would never shatter the quiet full of birdsong and the scent of fresh grass and the flowers up in the gardens with something that sounded like a mule in pain there were many things that mags knew he did well singing was definitely not one of them the waking bell rang as he reached the dining hall but breakfast began there before the bell sounded plenty of people other than the trainees ate here and many of them started their day at dawn he was as usual one of the first in the hall he sat down at an empty table and ate neatly and quickly whatever it was that caelen wanted to tell him it had to be important or he would never have had dallen relay the order to him at a moment when most of the trainees werent even up yet he never ate so quickly that he wolfed down his food without tasting it however he had gone for so long eating what most of the folk in this building would consider not even fit for pigs that he never missed an opportunity to actually savor what he ate and give a little silent thanks that he was getting it in the first place just as the first of the trainees began to trickle in looking a bit rumpled and still sleepy he was finished he took his dishes to the hatch and ran down the hall and up the stairs to caelans office the door was already standing open and the dean was putting away a stack of books like mags the dean of heraldic collegium began his day early i sometimes wonder if people who lie abed late have any idea what they are missing herald caelen said conversationally with a nod to the open window behind his desk the office was in much better shape than it had been when mags had first met the dean there were only half as many books and papers as had been crammed in here back then and most of them were properly stowed in cubbys and on the bookshelves that lined the walls dunno sir mags responded and closed the door behind him reckon theyd jest say tis same as sunset ony i th east so they might well sit down this shouldnt take long nikolas has told me all about his plan and asked me to do what i could to make things easier on you so i have i have good news and bad news caelen waited while mags took a seat then seated himself the bad news is that i simply cannot wave my hand and make the classes you really need to take go away its possible it might take you more years before you are reckoned to be ready for whites than the rest of your yearmates mags heart sank the good news isit might not its going to depend on how well you can keep up and what things the circle ultimately decides that you need not take in order to qualify and i can do things for the short term at least nikolas is fairly certain this little adventure is not going to be needed come the fall and traditionally in summer we give students a lighter load anyway so this is what ive done ive postponed some of your classes and moved the rest into a single block of time so my question is would you rather sleep from noon until sunset then join nikolas in the city then return here at dawn and take classes in the morning or would you rather sleep from early dawn until noon take your classes then join nikolas oh now that was a good question if he had only himself to consider he would take his lessons in the morning and sleep until nightfall but he didnt have just himself to consider he had friends and if he did that he would never see them it struck him then leaving him a little stunned for a moment i hev friends real friends people i wanter see an talk to an be with afternoon please ye sir he replied and laughed reckon i kin get easier used ter eatin nuncheon fer breakfast than breakfast fer supper thats probably a wise choice caelen replied making notes if nothing happens all night and you end up drowsing youll have a morning to catch up with the others in your lessons and if you end up working all night you will be very tired when you get back here so tiresome of thieves and criminals not to keep regular hours mags managed a little laugh all right nothing for you today youll start the new schedule tomorrow im glad nikolas waited until the start of the quarter before embarking on this its much easier than trying to rejuggle everything after youd already started that last was muttered as herald caelen began leafing through papers and making out schedulesnot just mags but several others from the look of things since theyd all gotten their schedules before the weeklong event these must be for newly chosen trainees who had just arrived or were about to four of them if mags was counting right good thing new collegiums done he knew the dean well enough by now to merely murmur thankee herald caelen and take himself out and once out in the hall he realized that he had something he almost never had a whole morning to himself only a morning because he knew very well that his new schedule would be presented to him by nuncheon if not before if the dean said he was going to start afternoon classes the dean would have him starting afternoon classes this afternoon well there was one thing looming that he probably ought to check on bear bears brother was not going to stand for being put off much longer erm dallen said if you were to stick your head outside you would hear the rumbles of that very thing that didnt sound good he hurried to the stairs and clattered down them a lot more noisily than he usually did he had yet to figure out how to be fast and quiet whats goin on what youd expect bears brother and his father are ranting at him at the tops of their lungs hes not alone with them there is a great deal of erm presumed status flaunting going on oh mags could very well imagine how that waswait what status flaunting bear has the four most senior healers at healers collegium and their dean backing him dallen was extremely amused against that the head of a house of healing no matter how old and wellestablished that house is just doesnt measure up huh mags had been under the impression that bears father and brother outranked his teachers certainly his father and brother are under that impression themselves dallen paused oh my they are going to bring out the very large hammer now very large hammer ye aint makin sense dallen he shoved open the door to the outside and paused for a moment casting a glance at the outwardly serene facade of healers collegium well you might say that back when you and bear had that little misunderstanding i took one of the things he had said to heart the part about us not getting him support against the arguments of his family from some of the more important people here there was a long pause mags didnt move and he said finally and i had a few words about him with rolan another pause and and rolan spoke to nikolas the third pause was too much if ye don come t the point ima gonna come straight t the stable and shave yer mane an tail bald he put a good deal of force behind his mindspeech i was getting to it dallen replied sounding aggrieved yed make a portant message inter a joke yed draw out anythin with suspense so thet the telling uv it lasted all night an hev th point the healers will be presenting bears father and brother with the kings edict that bear is a vital resource and that he will remain at the collegium to attain his greens then to train the ungifted healers for the foreseeable future in fact they will be handing the edict over about now the explosion of anger was so powerful it jolted against mags shields a moment later two greenclad figures stormed out of the collegium heading for the stable another powerful surge of mingled anger and impatience made mags pick up his feet and sprint for the stables but before he was halfway there two sturdy cobs with those same greenclad figures on their backs galloped out of the stableyard and down the road heading for one of the gates to the outside world mags slowed a little but not too much he wanted to make sure no one had actually done anything egregious he only dropped to a walk when he reached the stableyard the yard actually served three stables with one open side the companions stable was to the left with all of companions field behind it in the middle was the stable for draft and hauling animals riding beasts were served in the stable to the right the yard was hardpacked dirt but as clean as if a fanatic housewife kept it swept and smelled of nothing worse than fresh straw and hay the stablemaster for the entire palace was standing there at the riding stable door shaking his head and patting one of his hostlers on the shoulder is evone all right mags asked and flushed im mortal sorrythem healers they was here tget trainee bear which he don wanta go an collegium aint gonna let him go so they kinda got put in their place the stablemaster said with a lift of his eyebrow he and mags were very well acquainted at this point since mags was living in the companions stable and had been since his arrival here my thanks mags we were warned they were likely to be temperamental when they left they were certainly temperamental when they arrived but thank you for making sure they hadnt caused anyone inadvertent harm with their he groped for words temper tantrum supplied the hostler pressing the heels of his hands into his temples blessed cernos my head is splitting if theyd been my littles theyda both gotten such a hiding theyda been eatin dinner standin up for a week grown men an healers actin like that the stablemaster patted him on the shoulder again you go up to the collegium and get your head seen to theyll be able to put you right aye i will by real healers not poncy little brats the man grumbled and began to make his way a little unsteadily toward the collegium mags was torn between trying to offer up some sort of apology since they surely wouldnt and running after the man to make sure he got where he was going safely he decided in favor of the latter good thing too the man was losing his balance a little just as he caught up with him mags caught his elbow to steady him you be a good lad trainee the man said thickly through clenched teeth i got a very little touch of a gift enough to make me good with beasts not enough to be of any special use so they tell me anyway so oh aye mags replied as he kept the hostler steady aye i kin see what happd then tis like getting sunstruck aye exactly like or the time a beam fell on me and knocked me senseless now mags was very glad that he had come with the man i got ye don worry mags assured him he half held the hostler up the rest of the way and maneuvered him in through the door when he saw a healer he knew making his way toward them he hailed the man with a feeling of intense relief the hostler would be in good hands now healer juran he called this lad was down at stable when when two of my fellows who should have gotten a lot more spankings and a lot less being told how important they were when they were small came storming down there and blasted anyone with a touch of gift and an unshielded mind with a display of their pique the perpetually wearylooking healer said tartly yes we all felt it and i was heading out to see if anyone had been hurt by their carelessness come along my good man he took the mans arm and mags let go well get your splitting skull set to rights and you he added over his shoulder you might want to go see your friend young bear standing up to a parent is a rather difficult thing to do at his tender age even when they are in the wrong mags nodded and he half closed his eyes waiting for the sense of bear to tell him where his friend was it didnt take long since bear was very distressed that sort of thing tended to make it easy for mags to find him there were two other people with him both full healers in their most formal greens but by the time mags found the room he was inan empty classroom from the look of itthey were on the way out ah good said the first spotting mags just outside the doorway your friend mags is here bear skip your classes todayor the morning ones at least this situation was very stressful for all of us but it was a lot worse for you he eased by mags and walked briskly in the direction of the infirmary take him out for a long walk muttered the other to mags as he passed bear continued to sit where he already was in one of the classroom chairs looking drained mags decided the healer was right he walked straight up to his friend grabbed his elbow and tugged cm on he said gruffly outside where th air dont stink uv bad temper an errergence thats arrogance bear corrected automatically then smiled just a little little did i know that father planted a spy among the healers here who has been reporting every time i breathed in a way that father wouldnt like which explains a lot that was he shook his head that was like being beaten with words if theyd wanted to punish me they couldnt have gone about it more thoroughly you know id rather be tied to that chair with a madman about to kill me than go through that again mags snorted oh i reckon they wanted tpunish yer an moren ever now yer right they be wrong an they got told so an i reckon folk like yer pa and brother dont get told theys wrong real often never as far as i know bear said wryly then they aint gonna fergive thems told em real soon mags told him bluntly well reckon now thet th kings put is oar in ye wont hevta see em ifn ye don wanta les git a walk afore it gits stinkin hot got stuff ttell he hoped that telling bear what he was going to be up to would take bears mind off his own problems and it seemed that he was right as they walked slowly down the road away from the collegia bear listened attentively nodding from time to time but didnt interrupt until mags was finished it was still pleasant sultry rather than stinking hot birds and insects making a cheerful racket and the occasional breath of flower scent from the palace gardens would you like to come talk to a deaf person so you can see exactly what you need to do to counterfeit it bear asked a little diffidently when mags was done and would you be pretending to be someone who was born deaf or someone who lost his hearing because of a sickness or injury theys a difference mags asked surprised in how they act i mean very much so by this time the meandering course they had been taking wound them up at the kirball field and they both leaned against the fence and watched a companion foal scrambling over some of the obstacles under the watchful eye of his mother the little fellow was very intent mags wondered if he had dreams of playing the game whichd be easier mags asked i mean obvious i wanta do whats easier someone who had once been able to hear definitely bear told him juran has a fellow like that helping him he does all the distilling for the healers collegium even i use him when i need more than a single dose of something hes very good and very dedicated and he has an amazing nose mags nodded that made sense when people lost one sense the rest tended to get sharper he remembered how his own senses had sharpened when he was only pretending to be blind he followed bear to healers taking the side entrance where the house of healing was but bypassing the rooms where the patients were still you couldnt avoid the sharp smell of the things they used to keep infection away or the feeling that if you cracked your shields youd be bombarded with pain it wasnt just heralds and folks from the collegia and palace that were brought here anything anyone down in haven thought too serious for the healers there was treated here bear ushered him around to the stillroom where amid a bewildering array of odors both sweet and bitter a relatively young fellow who had lost his hearing in a fever walked him through what it was like for him now something mags had not anticipated was that the fellow could still speak he sounded odd and a little mushmouthed and his tone was flat but he was perfectly understandable should i try that no best not might make people think i kin still hear some the young assistant had learned to read what other people were saying by watching their lips as they spoke now mags could see what bear was talking about there were a lot of little behavior quirks that mags was going to have to think about adding to his character the young man stared intensely at his lips when mags spoke he always had his back so close to a wall that no one could get in behind him and startle him mags realized at once that in someone operating in the criminal world such a habit would be even more pronounced in a world where he would supposedly not be able to hear anything looking nervous all the time would not be out of character mags noted how the young man was acutely sensitive to any vibration looking about immediately when the floor trembled the slightest bit as someone nearby dropped something heavy he understood then that while he must never react to something that was purely a sound he could and should react to anything that he could feel as for the young mans sense of smell well it was clear by how he monitored the progress of the three different distillations he was running by scent alone that this was one of the strongest and most reliable of his senses this very brief exchange told him far more than he would have thought of on his own this would make life much easier for both him and nikolas nights are bad for him bear said as they left the young man a friend stays in the same room with him because hes terrified that something will happen in the night a fire or something and of course he wont hear an alarm and in their haste to get out no one will remember him i would expect anyone who couldnt hear would feel the same then i best never nap less nikolas is about mags mused heh not thet i would be crazy tlet down yer guard down there this was a damn fine notion bear learnt moren i coulda thought they walked out of healerswhich somehow was always cool in summer no matter how hot it wasinto the full strength of the sun there was heatshimmer above the grass and the scent of heated rock instead of flowers least we aint goin down there by day thet parta haven i th sund stink like a midden they ducked back inside electing to face the infirmary and sickroom spells rather than the heat well good nice when i can be useful bear said with what was almost a smile clearly the fact that he had helped mags had made him feel better so mags ventured as they left the infirmary wing where the stillroom was and faced the heat and full sun again he squinted against it ye wanta talk bout it bear sighed and his shoulders sagged nothin much to say you know thiss been brewing for a good long time fathers spyhis name is cubern by the wayis one of the guard healers so i had no idea he was around hewas able to find out everything he wanted to know about what i was doing just by socializing with the teachers at the collegium he knew i wasnt planning to go home at midsummer even though most people do if they dont live too far from here ive been trying to figure out a way to avoid going home at midwinter i know now that even though i never told them about the event because i knew what would happen they found out about it anyway thanks to cubern i suppose they got it in their head i was doing the healing kits in secret without the byyourleave of the collegium and the healers circle he shook his head deluded thats all i can figure they are so damn sure that they are right and everyone else is wrong that i suppose they thought once they exposed me and showed the collegium how dangerous my stupid notions are everyone would be horrified and wouldnt be able to get rid of me fast enough came riding up here figuring to drag me home for certain this time found out bout what i was doing at the event when they showed up erm i saw thet mags confessed yer brother i reckon thought e was gonna fall down inna fit there an then dallen scared up some folks ter innercep im afore e made a pother did he bear looked interestedand grateful well i guess i owe dallen a pocket pie yesterday was a real good day and nothing they said to me today is going to change that mags patted him on the shoulder awkwardly reckon healers woulda kep em away from ye iffen they coulda reckon they tried ttalk some sense into em too since they had em all yestiday an last night so healers on yer side aye i know bear swallowed parents still have rights its not as if they beat me or anything they just think im he waved his hands helplessly they cant see that anything i do is worth a fraction of what they call a real healers work before i walked into that the dean had a long chat with me everyone tried to talk em around but they just were not gonna listen not to anyone not even to the dean i guess mfather tried to he shook his head mfather has an exaggerated idea of his own importance all right our house of healing is one of the oldest in the whole kingdom but that doesnt make him any more important than any other senior healer he just doesnt see it that way the kings edict though there was nothing he could say or do after that and nothing he can do to alter it i dont think even he is stupid enough to try to claim that i somehow hoodwinked the king he winced a little ive never seen him so mad i thought he was gonna explode well now yer safe mags said into the silence as they both stood in the doorway of heralds collegium he sighed a little with relief to be out of the sun i mean safe they caint drag ye outa here fer no reason i don mean i think theyd beat ye or nothin not with fists or sticks mebbe but words but he didnt say that out loud bear scratched the back of his head reckon so he finally said sounding a little relieved but a lot bitter probably be told im disowned as soon as he can find someone to bring the message here but aye safe mags looked at him askance werent yer doin th king reckoned ye was needed ere you will never convince him of that bear replied sourly hell find a way to blame me for it ever since he figured out that i wasnt going to spontaneously bloom a healing gift hes been sure it was somehow all my fault thats daft mags said flatly course its daft and he should know better he does know better bears tone had gone from bitter to exasperated hes a really really good healer i dont think ive ever seen him fail but to him im a failure but all my life everything he has wanted to happen has happened until me bear shrugged and now he has to go home and tell alise or avise or whatever her name is that i am not going to marry her or more likely tell her parents hes gonna have to come up with some sort of excuse or reason another failure this time because he couldnt control me and make me do what he wanted and thatll make him look bad in front of everyone he told that i was gonna come home and get married hes gonna hate that mebbe alisell be happy though if she don know ye thet well it was all mags could think of to say could be yer gonna make a lady real happy fer all ye know she got someun shes sweet on already an thisll leave er a way twangle thins he understood very well what poor bear was dealing with the pieters boys had gotten the same sort of treatment from their father he expected them to be copies of himself obedient little copies that would do everything he told them to do without a murmur maybe bear finally stood up and straightened his back lets get some nuncheon as mags had expected there was a new class schedule waiting for him in his room when he returned from eating it wasnt at all bad actually weaponry practice every day at the end of the day although it would be a much shortened version of the class and would include no riding three days a week classes specific to being a heraldon this schedule property law criminal law and surveying three days a week classes common to all three collegiahistory math geography sevenday off except that mags knew very well that sevenday was likely to be spent trying to catch up with things hed miss because nikolas needed him and hed skipped a class or two still he grabbed what he would need for his afternoon classes and made his way over to bardic which was where the history class was going to be taught it came as a pleasant surprise to discover that the class was going to cover the reign of king bedwyn which just happened to be a period he knew something about hed come across a book about that time that was written so well hed borrowed it and read it for pleasurethe dogeared state of the book had given mute evidence that he was not the only person to have felt that way math he had never had much difficulty with and although geography was a new subject for him it was just memorization he could do that while he was down in haven at night he went to weaponry practice feeling that he just might manage to survive this summer in a relatively sane condition that feeling of confidence vanished the moment he stepped into his room and found nikolas waiting the sounds of the crickets outside coming through the open windows seemed suddenly as loud as shouts the kings own tossed him a small saddlebag as he stood up and mags caught it since nikolas was still in uniform and he was not suggesting that mags change now presumably the saddlebag held a change of clothing and they would assume their disguises elsewhere mags felt his stomach tense up a little he reminded himself that this was not the first time hed gone into haven in disguise for nikolas but it was the first time he was doing so as nikolas partner he shivered a little despite the still sultry heat rolan and dallen are saddled and ready ive already established myself as a pawnbroker and clandestine receiver of stolen goods the herald said holding open the door into the stable time to add you to the mix now its been my experience in these situations that the simpler the story is the better and the more you can get people to assume things the stronger your disguise will be your notion of playing deaf fits into that perfectly no one can question you and you can listen to whatever is going on and no one will ever suspect you of eavesdropping id prefer if you were mute as well he paused waiting for an answer to the unspoken question id already recked tdo thet mags nodded bein mute means i aint got nothin i need tkeep straight evbody spects lad whats deaf tbe mute anyroad we jest wiggle our finners at each other an mindspeak what were sayin an nobuddy th wiser he followed nikolas out into the stableyard where roland and dallen were waiting mags noticed something he hadnt before this groom was very familiarin fact every time that he recalled nikolas going out clandestinely it had been this groom whod prepared rolan and now that he knew nikolas had a special circle of assistants hed be daft not thev a special groom they mounted up and rode out into the dusk fireflies danced over the lawnsit looked as if the king had planned for the court to remain indoors tonight only lovers would be in the gardens at this hour the companions hooves chimed softly on the road but there were always companions going up and down at most hours no one would notice two more the evening breeze was just beginning to cool things off in a way mags regretted this it would have been a fine night to just laze about once they were on their way nikolas resumed the conversation i am going to tell anyone that asks a different story about who you are and why i have you he continued as they passed a gatehouse with two guards keeping a watchful eye on both sides of the wall the one thing i will never say is that you are my son this will mean of course that virtually everyone will be sure that you are if anyone calls you my son i will deny it furiously which will only cement their certainty willy weasel is not the sort of man who would take in a deafmute for the sake of charity only being my son could possibly prompt me to do such a thing mags had to chuckle at that name willy weasel whered ye git thet name allegedly i look like a weasel nikolas replied with an amused glance at him i am also very good at what they call weaseling a bargain people dont win unless i let them they were among the homes of the highborn and wealthy now there were little garden parties going on in several mags was glad he had eaten as savory scents wafted over the wall from one garden all lit up with tiny lanterns one whiff and his mouth was watering a little even though hed had dinner if hed been hungry it would have driven him insane aight i be yer son ony ye aint gonna say so what else am i nikolas pondered that for a moment the weasel wouldnt have a woman about because he doesnt trust them so your mother must either have abandoned you or is dead mags shrugged tell it both ways he suggested let em guess hev ye ever talked bout me afore i actually have spoken of you now and again nikolas said and he turned slightly so mags could see his grin ive been planning on getting you on this from the beginning im usually grumbling that you are not there when i have taken in a piece of jewelry or that you are asleep in the loft of the shop when i want something taken down off a high shelf so you have been established as a young relative with an uncanny power for judging gemstones no one will be particularly surprised to see you with me tonight although now nicolas chuckled at least one person will be very disappointed he has been passing me what i suspect to be inferior gemstones you will put a stop to the practice should be able to sir mags affirmed here he knew he was on firm ground no one was going to be able to get a flawed sparkly past him and as long as he had one thing he was sure of for now that was enough all right then nikolas and rolan both nodded weve got enough of your persona roughed in that we can do a credible job of inserting you into my operation time for the next step in your education chapter mags was not quite sure what to expect at this point where would they don their disguises how would they get to where they were goingthey certainly couldnt take rolan and dallen with them and where were rolan and dallen supposed to stay but going off to an inn especially a very popular inn instead of delving into the seedier side of town did not fit in with anything he would have anticipated it was the very large very noisy inn that had featured the actors and players that they had been to last night he assumed that nikolas had a good reason to take them there so he held his peace and asked no questions nikolas glanced curiously at him once when they had left rolan and dallen in a special area of the inn stables reserved for companions but seemed satisfied with his silence nikolas took a table in the common room a small one right in the corner and out of the way but well lit he ordered drinks for both of them looked very much like a man who was enjoying a rare night out and spent about a candlemark talking to people he knew who came by the table and this is trainee mags he would say as soon as the conversation allowed you will probably come to hear about him as a famous kirball player if you havent already but he and i are getting acquainted away from the overly curious ears of my darling daughter then he would get an arch look on his face as mags flushed then the newcomer would look at mags look at nikolas and get the ohaha look on his or sometimes her face and say something like so thats the way the wind is blowing eh well shes of age for it and mags would blush even redder that it was all trueexcept for the getting acquainted partonly made him more embarrassed which was he supposed the point at least for nikolas not that nikolas specifically wanted him embarrassed but that nikolas wanted a consistently genuine reaction since some of the people they were greeting were heralds and just when mags was starting to wonder when they would actually get around to doing what they allegedly came down into haven to do one of the actors from the previous evening hailed them from across the room the man came to the table at nikolas gesture niko arianna wants your opinion on her farce he said we want it to be funny but we dont want a repetition of the bochter incident eh nikolas made a face no one wants to repeat that it took the constables most of the night to clear the inn i can certainly help make sure no tender sensibilities are trodden on nor tempers raised nor insults taken he stood up come on lad we get to be theater critics today this will take a while but you dont need to worry about andels locking you in you might as well leave by our entrance its closer to the stables and theres someone on the door at all hours the actor said as they followed him through a side door he wasnt pitching his voice in a way that made it obvious he wanted to be heardbut if mags was any judge he was making sure that anyone who wanted to hear him could puzzled now mags still held his peace the actor went one way at a tjunction in the hallway but nikolas went in the opposite direction and mags followed nikolas opened a little door that looked as if it led to a storeroom with a key he had on his person he opened the room and somewhat to his surprise mags saw that a lamp was already burning in it it probably had been a storeroom at one time but now it held just two things a rack with clothing on it and the lamp safely mounted on the wall without a word nikolas handed mags a set of clothing not unlike what he had worn as the blind beggar and took down a similar set for himself very shabby and threadbare but carefully mended shirt jerkin and some sort of loose trews all in faded dust colors with the faint remnants of stains on them but clean mended clothing and cleanthat put two more things in mags mind he and willie weasel were supposed to care about how they looked but willie didnt spend a pin more on anything than he absolutely had to things were beginning to make sense for mags now this was where they would transform into their other identitiesperhaps not every night but given that nikolas was a familiar creature around here they would be using this room often enough it was probable that someone had come to ready the room and light the lamp as soon as he and nikolas had settled at their table then it had just been a matter of someone coming up with an excuse for nikolas to go talk to the actors their comings and goings in an inn that was already frequented by heralds in general probably because of the plays and patronized by nikolas in particular would not be noted the actor who had accosted them was clearly one of nikolas confederates now that he had the general shape of things in his mind mags was confident that when weasel and his boy left this inn they would leave by a side entrance that no one would note huh guess i been learnin a lot i niver thought bout all right then nikolas said very quietly in tones barely above a whisper as mags hung up his uniform tell me whats going on here mags did and nikolas nodded with satisfaction ive built up confederates and places like this on a network that i inherited from my predecessor he said this particular resource was his he actually was an actor before being chosen and this inn belongs to his family remember the soapmaker you utilized mags nodded ive recruited her nikolas said with satisfaction shes a fantastic resource as you noticed no one pays any attention to the person who comes to clean the ashpits mags felt a sudden pang of guilt this was all very well butwhat if they were ever trailed back to these boltholes by someone dangerous buti wouldn wanta bring danger on er he said hesitantly thats another reason i am relieved to have you partnering me mags nikolas told him as he cracked the door for light then blew out the lamp you should be able to sense if we are being followed and in that case we take another way back one that will take us through a few cellars that should effectively lose them and if for some reason that doesnt work well lead them straight into constables or the guard mags felt much better about that as he closed the door to the little room and made sure that it locked behind them he wondered if they would leave through a cellar this time in fact they left by a side entrance so lost in darkness and shadows that they had to grope their way along the alley it let out on to find a street not a nice street either not a dangerous street but there were a fair number of disreputable looking characters and establishments on it mags fell into his character immediately sticking close to nikolas and not reacting to sounds at all unlike the street of their inn this one smelled it wasnt rank but there were faint suggestions that someone had been sick overlaid with beer cheap wine and burning grease smells the neighborhood gradually became dirtier and darker not that mags could see the dirt but he could smell it places where cats and dogs and probably people had relieved themselves a stink of unwashed bodies and unwashed clothing slops poured into the gutter only added to the reek which would persist until a rain came and washed it all down to the collection basins people living here werent supposed to do this but unless you actually caught someone at it it was hard to tell who the culprit was finally nikolas paused at a shuttered storefront halfway down the street from one of the few streetlamps took a key out of his belt pouch and opened the door the universal symbol of the pawnbroker three coins was painted beside and above the door the paint was fading the symbol was the visual representation that the pawnbroker would lend you two coins but would get back three whether he got it when you redeemed your pledge or when he sold it it was as dark as the inside of a hat in there and the place smelled musty mags held absolutely still while nikolas groped around at the edge of the door he came up with a tallowdip which he took to the dim little streetlamp and held it up until it took he brought it back sheltering it from the breeze with one hand and mags followed him and the light inside the shop seemed to hold a mishmash of just about anything and everything there were tables heaped with old clothes and shoes battered tools and kitchen utensils hung on the walls and above them were shelves with boxes on them everything on the wall had a paper tag on it only half the shop was open to the public the other half was behind a wall with a barred window in it and a counter behind the window it had another locked door which nikolas unlocked after lighting a lamp in the front they both went inside and nikolas locked the door behind them this clearly was where the valuable things were kept tools in much better condition silver plate some jewelry in trays there was more in labeled boxes on shelves along the walls mags didnt have a chance to do more than glance around when a bell over the door rang and a man entered i hope that boy of yours came with you this time weasel said the man sounding irritated as he pulled a small box out of a pouch and shoved it under the bars of the window he aint my boy and aye i got im nikolas half snarled since mags had been standing away from the window looking at the things hung up on the wall when the man came in he gave no indication that he had heard anything until nikolas reached over and shook his shoulder roughly he turned hunching over in the same servile posture he used to take at the mine when one of the owners sons accosted him nikolas pushed him toward the counter and opened the box spilling out the roughcut gemstones inside onto a tray there was already a magnifying lens on the tray waiting mags nodded and nikolas brought over a cobblers lamp and lit it so that the clear light fell on the tray mags picked up the lens and the first of the stones doing his best to ignore the mans beerladen foul breath as he leaned forward to watch mags sort there were about twenty of them none of them were the rare sort rubies emeralds or sapphires there were some citrines garnets some quartz dyed to look like aquamarine and amethyst and a couple of sunstones mags examined each stone carefully with the magnifying lens all had flaws and inclusions all had been cut to try to hide the flaws he sorted them all into the cups at the edge of the tray nothing went into the one on the farthest rightwhich meant worthless but none of them went into any cup higher than inferior and the dyed ones he sorted out onto the counter the man was incensed what th hell weasel he demanded it was clear to mags that he knew what the sorting cups meant thems good sparklies an whats he sorted th purples an blues out fer mags made meaningless hand motions when nikolas shook his shoulder keeping his head ducked down as if he expected a blow hes trying to pass off dyed quartz as aquamarine and amethyst all of the stones have been cut to try to hide flaws nothing is even up to good grade but the ones in the farthest cup left have flaws that are interesting at least and could be recut and polished to take advantage of them he mindspoke to nikolas as his fingers flew my sense is that he knew very well these were fakes they are worth just about as much as cut glass or paste nikolas nodded then his face darkened with rage as his hand shot out to grab the man by the collar and haul him up to the bars mags ducked and scuttled into a corner yer tryin t pass off fakes nikolas snarled and shook the man onehanded until his teeth rattled ye rat bastard yer tryin tpass fakes off on me the man yelped and beat at nikolas hand no i didni never nikolas let go and spat at him liar i should take thesen get a constable i didn know the man sputtered looking genuinely terrified how was i tknow ed be carryin aroun fakes i lifted em fair an square e guessed e dont know stones but e guessed that these wasnt wuth much mags was positive of that the man was terrified of the rage in nicolas eyes because he hadnt expected it so he was lying his head off hoping to somehow wiggle out of this without nikolas making good his threat he jest admitted t stealin em mags added i noticed that which would make me a receiver of stolen property if i call the constables now ill be in as much trouble as he is ye damn fool didn ye figger ed be holdin a droppouch idjit that boy has more sensen ye do nikolas spat again he made no reference to the fact that the stones had been stolen but he also was not talking about constables now either well they aint all fakes is they the man asked desperately i mean the boy didn sort em all out nah but they aint wuth what ye was tryin tgit outa me neither nikolas snarled not even close gold not a chance not even siller copper ill giye two apiece an nothin fer th fakes two ten the man yelped and they settled down for some serious bargaining mags had no idea that nikolas was such a ruthless bargainer two copper was about what a glass or paste gem was worth even the fakes were worth twice that but then again these were stolen while it was not likely that the constables would be searching very hard for the thief who had taken something so small in value there was still a risk for nikolas in taking them eventually the man worn down to nothing by nikolas sharp tongue and threats to expose him to the constables as a thief after all settled for five silver and twenty coppers for a pile of small gemstones worth in mags estimation about twenty silver mags wondered what he was going to do with them nikolas counted out the money reluctantly and shoved it under the bars the man trudged away nikolas pointed to a stool in one corner and handed mags some horsehair then made some meaningless signs you have to look busy he mindspoke reading would be out of character so i supposed you could braid some trinkets to sell here in the shop mags nodded scuttled over to the stool and began to make a pretty round braid for a bracelet people came and went some legitimate some not mags soon learned that nikolas was a moneylender as well taking peoples possessions as surety against a loan those who came in and repaid their loans a bit at a time got their property back those who defaulted lost it and presumably nikolas sold their goods one fellow came in and joyfully redeemed his carpentry tools nikolas grumbled the entire time he was handing them over this fellows a good honest man nikolas was saying in mindspeech as he berated the carpenter he just fell on hard times i found someone who could take him on so he could get his tools back hell be fine now reckon ye didn overcharge im neither mags replied keeping his face still well it would have been out of character for me to be easy on him weasel is known as a sharp man but fair when it comes to a plain loan but as the night wore on people came in who were not honest there was no reason why a fellow with dirt caked black under his fingernails and who clearly had not washed himself nor changed his clothing in a year would own six silver spoons nor why a woman with paint caked on her face so thick it was cracking and a threadbare velvet gown so lowcut mags was afraid her breasts were going to pop out of it should have a double handful of silk handkerchiefs both plain and embroidered nikolas bargained with both of them as sharply as he had the gem thief and with as little evidence that he cared where the loot had come from or how the possessor had acquired it finally as the trickle of customers slowed and dried up and mags judged it was getting near dawn the first man came in again here he said thrusting something under the bars now thetll be worth somethin nikolas gestured to mags who left off his braiding and joined the herald at the counter on the worn wood between them was a brooch set with carnelians and silkstone cabochons not worth much in and of themselves but the workmanship of the brooch itself was incredible made all of twisted wires of a metal that was so red it looked a little like copperbut which proved on application of the touchstone to be gold and not plated either who would mount common stones in a setting of gold wires huh nikolas said and stroked his chin huh i dont rightly know how tvalue that tis gold carnelian and silkstone aint worth a lot but settingtis gold i could gi ye th goldweight value i don spose thiss somethin nobodyd miss the last was said with so much sarcasm the words practically sank beneath the weight hactually they wont the man said smugly i got yon off a corpus e wont be lookin for it and i misdoubt theres any sad relations about to shout thief grave robbin now are ye nikolas cackled but if yon relations should come cross it in me shop they wont or if they do they wont say nothin the man grinned smugly furriners what werent spossed tbe here fool got hisself kilt by dray wagon this mornin an his friends lit out babblin in some furrin tongue i mightve been follerin em seein as furriners dont know city an might need a guide big of ye nikolas said with a snort right then i can gi ye a bit now an a bit more once i make sure this aint gonna bring no trouble to mshop heres goldweight value he shoved a few silver pennies under the bars come back termorrow an yell mebbe get that agin the man reached for the money but nikolas seized his wrist not so fast i gi ye twice as much ifn ye kin find out where these furriners be bidin the man stilled who wants tknow nikolas laughed ye think im so daft as ttell ye sos ye kin run to em an collect my fee he let go of the mans wrist he really does look like a weasel dallen marveled watching through mags eyes mags kept his shoulders hunched over and his head down he was actually beginning to enjoy this now he himself wasnt at all sure that the brooch was from their murderous guests it wasnt of a style like anything he had ever seen before but as he had come to know there was a great deal of valdemar out there and beyond the borders of valdemar there were a lot of strange places and people still if the weasel was known for taking in things like this some other trinket might lead them to their targets is there any way you could tell for certain where this is from nikolas asked as the thief rubbed his wrist not really not like stones got liddle maps on em sayin where they come from might could be a gift thet could tell ye where its been but i aint got it mebbe i could look at them books the buggers left behind an see ifn the designs look alike but he wanted to shrug but didnt no giving the game away by something out of character ida thunk an artfeller would be more like ttell ye yea or nay on thet score i take all the risk an you get all the profit the thief whined now i ask you is that fair nikolas laughed nastily oh aye a lot of risk ye took takin it off a dead man afraid hes gonna haunt ye the thief looked around uneasily nikolas laughed again ye got to do next thing tnothing to get twice what ye got fer this trinket keep it in mind he shoved the money all the way to the other side of the bars i buy lotsa stuff that aint trinkets people pay me tfind out things i pay people tfind em out for me understand aye weasel but it still aint fair nikolas snorted ye want fair go get yer friends tgether an make yerself a guild so ye can make yerself rules bout whats what fair he laughed through his nose a thieves guild ha that there might be funniest notion i heard all year the thief looked at him sourly but did not dispute any further with him he scooped up his money and left looking entirely disgruntled nikolas slipped the brooch into a secure pocket inside his tunic mags went back to braiding horsehair eventually nikolas went to a cupboard with a lot of little drawers and rummaged around in it coming out with a handful of curious beads he handed these to mags who studied them no two were alike they looked like something out of a magpies hoard if the magpie had excellent taste there were carved stone glass enameled metal and carved wood with a faint exotic sweet scent to it the one thing they all had in common was large holes fully large enough for him to slip the round braided horsehair through so he did just that with one of the enameled ones secured it in the middle with a knot on either side and finished the braid off with a loop and another intricate knot he held it up to nikolas as if for approval very clever yes that will give you an excuse to be here said nikolas the weasel however just grunted snatched the bracelet and hung it on a nail at eye level mags started a necklace by the time they left for the night hed made three pieces of jewelry and sold onesold being relative since another slattern younger than the first and with only a smear of red lip paint traded some of her offerings for a necklace with a porcelain bead covered in a garden of miniature flowers it made him almost sad to see her put it around her neck for a moment he could see what she might have beenand at the same time what she was going to become he wondered how nikolas could stand it being in this shop night after night seeing these people come in some of whom were merely victims of appalling luck or very bad choices i stand it because there are some i can help nikolas said as if he had read mags thought or perhaps he had read the expression on mags face that onemaybe that bead is worth five times what i traded her for it but i dont think shes going to let go of it easily and it might be that little bit of beauty in her life will remind her that she can make other choices than she has mags was dubious but well why not why not hope for her so long as there was no expectation with that hope expectations now that was what bit you every time hope for the best expect nothing not that long ago you hoped for nothing as well dallen chuckled aye well this big white mule seemsta hev corrupted me he sensed dallens snort of derision at the same time that nikolas straightened his back and stretched then turned and cuffed him in the ear well made it look as if he had been cuffed the fist merely grazed his ear and whiffed through his hair but mags had the sense to act as if he had been hit he cringed and made a little animal moan nikolas grabbed his shoulder and hauled him to his feet come along ye gurt fool he growled time tbe getting home nikolas blew out lanterns and locked up making sure the foreignlooking brooch was in his pocket then he trudged up the street mags following with his back hunched it was still as black as night but mags knew the feel of things and dawn wasnt far off by his reckoning he was beginning to feel the effects of the long night he was glad that he was moving because he knew the moment he closed his eyes he would start to nod off he and nikolas could scrounge something out of the kitchen he was sure though it was far too early for even the kitchen staff to be awake then he could actually get a good seven maybe eight candlemarks of sleep much better than he had reckoned he would get he had expected he would not see his bed until after dawn the inn was without lights at the back where they slipped in and as silent as if it were populated only by the dead they changed back into their uniforms and went out to the stable where a sleepy hostler awakened by the companions had just finished saddling them they kept ye might late herald the hostler said though with no hint of complaint in his voice actors nikolas said in a tone of weary amusement while mags yawned ostentatiously they think because they can sleep all day and carouse all night the rest of the world does the same aye well ye know what ye be getting into herald any time they ask ye to stay the hostler said with a yawn of his own and a chuckle it aint as if ye havent been here afore then he leaned over and whispered new lad not sure hes asleep good man nikolas whispered back and slipped him a couple of coins for his trouble well then till the next time my feelings of friendship overcome my good sense the hostler merely waved to them as they rode out of the stable doors mags whole thought at this point was for his bed it appeared that nikolas was likeminded for the two of them practically flew up the hill to the collegium with both companions moving at a very brisk trot and there still wasnt any light showing in the sky by the time they parted at the stable door i left word with one of the servants i trust to leave some breakfast waiting for you in your room mags nikolas told him as they hastily stripped the companions of tack and stowed it fortunately so short a ride meant neither needed to be groomed and although both of them had probably dozed some it could not have been the sort of restful sleep they really needed thenkee sir mags began but nikolas waved him off part of what i do for you at the moment when you make your own contacts among the servants youll handle these things for yourself now go and eat and get some sleep you did will tonight and oh he handed mags the brooch study that while you are still awake and give me your thoughts later he took it i will sir but nikolas just waved off his unvoiced objections then headed for his own rooms and bed nikolas had been as good as his word there were pocket pies of the savory and sweet sort both exactly the sort of thing that kept well and tasted fine cold someone had left a sweating crock set up for him as wellthis was a sort of halfglazed vessel with a wooden spigot on the bottom that kept whatever was in it remarkably cool by evaporation through the unglazed portion the cool water in it tasted as sweet as anyone could wish following nikolas orders mags studied the brooch as he ate his pies neatly and methodically the cabochoncut stones were nothing remarkable though the finishing was very fine the rosegold told him nothing the designs he caught his eyes unfocusing and his head nodding not gonna get anything more done tnight he thought blearily and left the brooch on the table to stumble over to his bed and fall into it chapter the noon bell woke mags although the morning bell had not it was already quite warm despite having the windows open a little longer and it definitely would be too warm to sleep in here now he was glad he had made the choice that he had to sleep through the morning and get up at noon he threw on yesterdays uniform since it would have to go down the clothing chute anyway carried a clean set of grays up to the collegium and had a good bath before going down to what remained of the noon meal things were pretty picked over but he was quite able to put together a solid selectionand just as he was settling in at a newly cleared table to enjoy it bear came rushing in bear looked even more untidy than usual though the effect was mostly due to his hair standing practically straight up as it did when hed been nervously running his hands through it and he looked distractedso very distracted that he didnt even notice mags was sitting there until mags gave an unceremonious whistle bears head swiveled as if it had been pulled by a string and his face lit up uncharacteristically he bounced over to where mags was sitting with his round face so full of repressed emotion mags worried that he was about to burst easy on there mlad mags said soothingly siddown ye look like a runaway cart whats got ye so riled up eh amily bear said succinctly dropping down onto the seat next to mags and helping himself to some of the veggies ohho mags exclaimed with complete understanding now it had been determined that amilys crippled leg if rebroken could probably be healed againnot perfectly but she would end up with a leg she could actually use instead of one that was a twisted burden to her bear was the first one that had suggested this based on the fact that he had rebroken and set farm animals legs so that farmers didnt have to put them down it probably could not have been done anywhere but herebut here at the collegia healers collegium in particular were some of the best and brightest in the kingdom and amily was the daughter of the kings own so theyre gonna do it an they gi ye a seat at front mags hazarded bear practically exploded they told me im the one to oversee it all cause its my idea well not exactly oversee but the one to figure out whats needed get everyone together and agreed and then be the one to keep everything running smoothly until shes all fixed and walking mags blinked on the one hand uh thas good he said feeling decidedly mixed about this but yer jest a trainee bear didnt seem at all upset that mags was dubious instead he nodded vigorously exactly and ill have the dean checking over everything and lots of people making sure that i dont make some stupid mistake but i have done this before and no one else has and they tell me that when amily is all healed not even my father will be able to say im not a real healer now that he looked closer mags could tell something else under the excitement bear was scared as well he should be in mags opinion this was going to be dangerous workdangerous for amily that is ah but mags already knew just how badly amily wanted this and who was he to stand in her way he wanted to help amily more than anything in the whole world he wasnt a healer and he knew nothing about healing so the only way he could help amily in this was to help the healers to help bear aight he said slowly so thiss kinda like plannin a kirball game aye so fust thing i th games gonna be getting th leg broke agin but thas like sayin fust thing i a real games gonna be meetin th other team on field an we know thet aint howt goes aye so fust thing fust thing i kirball games knowin th lay of the ground he quirked an eyebrow at bear who was listening to him intently bears eyes flashed yes thats it exactly so the first thing is going to be to get some kind of of map of where all the old breaks are and how strong the mends are yes and then get everyone familiar with it even the ones that dont have the gift to see it sounds tme like yell be needin someun who kin draw mags hazarded yes no bear began running his hands through his hair again no whoever draws this has to be able to see what things look like and no e don mags said patiently when we gets someun in what got robbed an e knows th face uv th feller what robbed im we jest git herald rashi she kin draw an she got mindspeech th kind what sees pichers she looks at picher i feller what was robbeds head an draws it so ye gets rashi an she makes yer picher or better yet she makes a model bear exclaimed face alight again we can get cattle bones the right size and shape we can break them and cement them together saw em mags advised break ont be th same as amily less ye saws em exact right but we can put them together exactly the same as amilys leg andand we can make muscles out of stuffed cloth or somethingand he was running his hands frantically through his hair now but in a frenzy of ideas rather than frantic worry stop mags laughed holding up a hand thatll do fer now ye go tell yer dean an build yer field tstudy like dallen tol me when i fust got here one step at a time aye jest take it all liddle bits at a time right thanks mags youre a star bear bounced off again without even stopping to eat well mebbe he et early on an ifn i don eat now i aint getting nothin till dinner classes were a little confusingand confused as one of the teachers was not aware hed been juggled into the history class in question and there was even an enquiry send to herald caelen before it got resolvedbut things went a lot more smoothly than mags had expected except in one class the weaponsmaster was concerned that he not fall out of practice mags was frankly just as concerned after all hed nearly been killed far too many times and he really did not want to find himself facing down an armed opponent with skills gone rusty can you tell me why the dean shortened your class the weaponsmaster asked you should be spending a good three candlemarks up here a day youll only be spending one you cant possibly keep in practice at everything with your practice time shortened to a third mags shook his head can you at least tell me what you are doing in place of it the poor fellow asked desperately nossir mags said and watched as the herald tilted his head to one side and got that listening look many of them did when their companions were talking to them from the look of him the weaponsmaster was actually arguing with his companion finally he sighed and rubbed his temple i dont know why i try he said a little crossly you can never win an argument with one of them and they always have the last word mags did his best not to smile true sir was all he replied supposedly this wont last past the summer the weaponsmaster continued but i want you to pledge me faithfully that you will do everything you can to keep your coordination sharp and your muscles conditioned that was an easy promise to make mags had no doubt that nikolas would have him climbing up and down ladders all over the shop moving heavy objects rearranging things cleaning things to keep him awake if nothing else he would stay fit of that much he was sure yessir he promised all right then but any time you have a moment free and the inclination for a lesson i want you to come to me whatever class i am teaching ill fit you in the weaponsmaster put one fatherly hand on mags shoulder looking very worried indeed you have had far too many close calls mags i would feel directly responsible if something happened to you that a little training and practice could have prevented at that point it was almost time to join nikolas and mags escaped from the weaponsmaster with another set of apologies and promises he had just enough time to grab something to eat shove the brooch in his belt pouch and get dallen saddled when nikolas summoned him out to a different gate in the wall from the one theyd used the night before as they rode down to haven mags related to his mentor the weaponsmasters doubts and concerns nikolas was very silent for a while as they passed through some quiet residential streets in a modest neighborhood finally he answered as he led mags down an alley to what seemed to be a dead end he has some legitimate concerns hes right you have needed to defend yourself far more often than our average trainee ill see what i can do about this hmm this actually might prove to be more of an opportunity an opportunity for what however nikolas did not say instead he touched some part of the wall and the entire end of the alley pivoted in the center mags would have liked to get a closer look at thatit was literally a brick wall somehow pierced through the middle and rotating with hardly more than a touch when the locks were released but he didnt get a chance and nikolas led him into a tiny enclosed yard with a bit of roof over it hanging in an alcove at the back were outfits similar to the ones they had worn last night there were also a pair of buckets full of clear clean water nikolas took a bag off rolans saddle and filled two empty dishes with grain he and mags took off the saddles and set them aside changed their clothing and went back out through the pivoting door did you consider that brooch nikolas asked since the wretched thing had been drifting in and out of his dreams all night mags nodded i dunno why he said finally but it made me think uv horses nikolas didnt change his posture or his expression but mags felt his reaction as if mentally he had smacked himself in the head of course its shinain or rather its a shinain trade piece they themselves rarely make anything that requires metalwork but theyre like magpies they love jewelry members of a prosperous clan will hang themselves all over with itand their favorite horses too thats a bridle brooch mags had to keep himself from frowning does thet mean th dead feller was shinain somehow he didnt like to think that he didnt know a lot about the plainspeople but what he did he liked he rather thought he wanted to meet one someday this far north in the spring not likely you mightmightfind one turning up at the ashkevron manor in the fall when they cull the horse herds but thats as close as they ever come to haven no this is more than likely someone come up from the south who got the brooch in a trade or the like nikolas sighed i think thats a dead end i cannot imagine shinain having anything to do with someone like our guests mags stared at the back of nikolas heels and did frown thet don follow he said instantly feller coulda killed a shinain an took it if he didwell thats why hes dead now nikolas replied soberly but its not likely shinain on the plains are almost impossible to find shinain off the plains are extremely suspicious of strangers rightly so their horses are prized especially the ones that they dont sell ive heard that the couple of genuine shinain studs that the ashkevrons own are valued at their own weight in silver mags felt his jaw dropping a horses weight in silver he could scarcely imagine that much money by this point they were at the shop and nikolas repeated last nights routine when they were ensconced in the little room behind the barred window and nikolas had lit the lamp indicating they were open for business someone came in almost immediately it was a constable a tall burly blackhaired fellow with narrowed eyes and a clenched jaw who said nothing to nikolas merely peered suspiciously around the store as if he was looking for something evening weasel he said finally been shown anything i should know about whosir mesir nikolas said innocently thiss a leejitamit shop sir nothin amiss here no the constable snorted and im a master bard are you sir nikolas expression was of utter guilelessness well ye should take down one of them instruments on the wall an give us a tune then itd be a rare pleasure to hear ye sir leave off the constable snapped you know what the law is about taking in stolen goods none better sir as ye remind me of it every time ye walk in me shop nikolas tone did not edge so much as a hair into sarcasm but the constable glared at him anyway now if i could be interestin ye in some of me goods im more interested in that boy who is he the constable thrust his face at the barred window mags considered many different responses all in the flash of a moment f i looks askeered hes gonna think im askeered of nikolas then hell figger nikolas up to no good mebbe hell try an take me away same if i act shylike mags decided that a bold approach was in order glared at the constable and stuck his tongue out at him that cheeky little bastard the constable exclaimed affronted why i nikolas cuffed mags then grabbed his chin and thrust his head up so he was looking directly at nikolas face you show some respect fer the law ye little demonlimb he said enunciating carefully mags sneered then shrugged and turned his back on the constable he sat down on his stool still with his back to the man and resumed his horsehair braiding im mortal sorry sir nikolas said putting an edge of a whine into his tone right little bastards msisters son hes been here afore only i guess you was never here when he was deaf as a post from a fever promised her id take care of him well see to it that you beat some manners into him the constable retorted then mags noted his footsteps retreating toward the door and the jangle of the bell over it signaling his departure good thinking didn want im reckonin i was some kinda slavey yed bought or th like mags replied uh meant task ye somethin ye do know bout th healers collegium an bear an and that they plan to try and fix amilys leg yes of course i do nikolas sounded amused rather than alarmed you surely didnt think theyd keep that a secret from me did you nikolas took out the stolen gems from last night and unlocked a panel at the back of the room there was a box inside and inside the box were several small linen pouches he poured each cup of sorted gems into a separate pouch and shook them there good luck finding one set of stolen gems in a cup of stolen gems just like them he turned back to mags was there something else bears in charge mags blurted his mentor nodded slowly amily told me last night you think i wont approve mags shrugged i didn rightly know i was gonna ast ye tgi im a chance not like es doin this wiout supervision exactly so nikolas clapped him on the shoulder i trust the dean i trust the healers circle and i trust bear ill let him know that myself if youd like mags considered that might steady im sir then i will now knowing how you bear and lena are as thick as birds hatched in the same nest i assume youve already had a hand in this project nikolas handed mags his horsehair and box of beads and mags sat down to work aye es makin a model uv amilys leg as tis then him an some senior healersll study it over figger out what needs t be done slow steady and methodical i approve nikolas didnt ask if mags approved he already knew mags did as terrified as mags was for amilywhat if this didnt work and she was left worse off than beforehe knew she wanted it more than anything how could he stand in the way of that the only hold he had over her would be to say i cant stand it if you try this if you care for me at all you wont do it and that would be just wrong she was brave enough to try this to get the proper use of her leg back she hated being a burden on people hated that they would have to alter their plans to suit what she could and could not do he also knew she worried for her father she was the daughter of the kings own herald which made her a potential target to be used to control her father as long as she was fundamentally unable to escape a kidnapper she represented a serious vulnerability and it wasnt safe for her to go many places away from the palace this was important to her he would never stand in her way so like her father he knew he would worry and fret on the inside and never let his concern show reckon his famblyll try an stop it he hazarded if they find out about it yes nikolas said soberly mags what do you think bear needs to do not about amily about his own situation i ask you this as a point of strategy not as his friend purt obvious aint it needs tstand up to em mags finished the bracelet he was working on and started another more than that because that will only alienate them and in the end he doesnt want that what he wants is to be treated as someone with intelligence and valuable skills to get that sort of treatment he will have to discover why his father and older brother are treating him in this way ill give you a hint it is not solely because he is the youngest son after all he has demonstrated that he can handle great responsibility mags shook his head dunno i dont either but i do know this when a person acts this outrageously about something it is because there is more going on than is showing on the surface i think you and bear need to find out what that something is and address it in the many leisurely hours of your spare time that is mags nearly laughed aloud at that now there is something that only you and lena can do nikolas continued bear needs to learn how manage being under pressure he tends to allow it to eat him alive i think you can show him a better way im tryin ill put lena to it she does th same mebbe theyll learn from each other he thought a moment better ill put him twatchin her on it reckon they concentrate on each other they aint gonna be thinkin so hard bout thesselves the bell over the door rang and nikolas was all the weasel again bears problems lenas even amilys set aside for the moment it was the thief from last night i want mmoney he said abruptly found out what ye wanted and i want mmoney nikolas showed no signs of producing anything got thear it first dont i he said with a sneer i dunno if its worthy anything but if i tell you afore ye pay me ye can say it aint worth nothin when it is the thief protested nikolas shrugged there was a long long silence as the man fidgeted on the other side of the barrier finally he couldnt bear it any more and blurted feller that had the shiny was poisoned that got both their attention how dye reckon that nikolas asked cautiously i don reckon it the thief said healer said so fellers a guide he was down in some city south took some horse traders down there from here thats where he got the shiny passed through there picked up some other fellers tguide back up here healer says he dunno what poison twas ony that feller was poisoned fellers he brung here they was all kinda furrin bet they poisoned im mags could smell the booze on his breath all the way from where he was sitting he couldnt imagine how nikolas could stand it nor could he imagine how nikolas was remaining sober an where didja here all this nikolas drawled skeptically feller had a reglar oman at pegs got it from her the man kept looking furtively over his shoulder as if he thought he had been followed into the shop this woman gotta name now nikolas reached into the cash till which was out of sight and reach from anyone standing at the barred window and pulled out a few silver coins he pushed them idly back and forth on the counterstill just out of reach senla the thief said all of his attention centered on the coins he stared at them avidly senla at pegs nikolas played with the coins well i spose she got nothin tgain from this she ever see these furriners nah he just tol her bout em mags watched the thiefs eyes follow the coins like a cat watching a fly the coins made a soft scraping sound across the counter it was the only sound in the shop aside from their voices well thats somethin aint much but nikolas shoved the coins under the bars and the thief grabbed them greedily they made a chinking sound as he shoved then into a pouch that he thrust into his shirt you get me somethin better youll get paid better the thief didnt reply to this he skittered out the door as if someone had set him on fire that was odd mags wondered why he was in such a hurry to get out of there nikolas drummed his fingers on the countertop for a moment im torn mags knew exactly what he meant this was the middle of weasels business day there was no way that weasel would close the shop now unless he was dying or the shop itself was on fire and maybe not even then but he wanted to get to this woman now ill go mags said instantly sure he was just a youngling but there had to be plenty of reasons for a youngling down here in this part of haven to be seeing a woman of that sort right now he couldnt think of any but surely nikolas could ye thin of some reason fer me twanter see th oman whilst i git there ye know where pegs is i do nikolas showed him the location not in terms of a map but the streets he would follow to get there going by rooftop mags grinned at him of course he was going by rooftop on the unlikely chance that someone had followed that thief here the only person he would have to follow would be the same thief nikolas nodded at a ladder in the corner hatch at the top mags trotted over to the ladder and skittered up it feeling quietly gleeful that nikolas trusted him to go after this woman there was indeed a hatch at the top bolted from this side he pulled it up and dropped it down poking his head up into the darkness above it was an attic he hauled himself up into it and in the light coming up from below he saw the outlines of a roofdoor find the door nikolas asked aye lemme git er open then ye kin close up from below the door to the roof opened outward he checked and saw that it would lock again when he closed it aight im good he heard the ladder creaking then the hatch closed and the bolt shot home he was on his own he levered himself out onto the sloping roof and shut the door quietly no use alerting anyone to the fact that there was someone crawling about on the roof he took his bearings and started out moving as quickly as he could he just hoped that when he got there hed have figured out an excuse to talk to her or nikolas would have hmm when hed been snooping around as the blind beggar hed noticed that not all house girls stayed in the house to practice their trade trusted ones were allowed to visit clients maybe pegll send er girls out fer a price he suggested to nikolas if the price is right i am certain she would send her girls out to entertain performing bears came the cynical reply mags snorted from what he knew nikolas was probably right i cld be errand boy settin somethin up then that would make sense a man with the means to hire a girl for the evening would also have the means to hire a boy to go out and make the arrangements for him this was an excellent part of town for roofrunning the buildings were crammed too close together for anything bigger than a rat to pass between them mags could basically scuttle along without anyone seeing him as long as he didnt make more noise than a large cat this was all very familiar the feel of slates and tiles and the occasional thatched roof under his hands and feet balancing on the slope basically going on all fours with three points of contact on the roof at all times since these roofs were inspected yearly for chimney issuesa fire in this part of town would be a complete disaster because it would spread for blocks in no time at allthey were in good repair even if the interiors left a lot to be desired there werent a lot of thatched roofs here they were more prone to fires mags vaguely remembered that house and shop owners were being pressured to get rid of them a pity since they were easier to scramble across then again that was probably a reason that could be used to get them replaced if he could do it a thief would find it ridiculously easy nikolas sent him another thought theres money sewn in the hem of your jerkin its enough to get pegs attention see if shell send senla to the owl and firkin its close and i can be there soon enough the weasel has gone out to a tavern for food now and again on a slow night mags gave his wordless assent these roofs were absolutely ideal for what he was doing even the ones that werent thatched although they were steep they were also broken up by chimney pots and dormers to make the most use of the attic space there was more than enough light for him to see his way up here with a full moon and no clouds he didnt even have to fight chimney smoke any cooking was over and done with at this time of night he was mortal glad to get out of that stuffy shop and out in the fresh air and he took his time it wasnt more than a few blocks to this house and there was no real hurry to get there so he could test each foot and handhold making very sure of them before he trusted his weight to roof or handhold down below there were still a few people out and about this part of haven actually came to life after dark those who lived here worked from dawn to dusk and only had time to get their own business done when the sun went down he was literally on the roof of the house next door to pegs when he heard a commotion below him there was an altercation going on at the front doorbut that wasnt what was interesting what was interesting was that a few moments after the todo started he saw a back door open from the inside a big burly man held it open while a woman carrying a pack slipped out it looked to him as if the altercation was being stagedthere was a lot of shouting and some wild swinging of fists going on but he wasnt sensing anger and none of the swings were connecting a distraction to keep anyone from going to see what was happening at the back door if it was then the woman was leaving with the cooperation of at least some of the other inmates of the house acting on a hunch he followed her she kept to the alleys and from the way she was moving she was trying very hard to keep from attracting any attention if that aint senla ill eat dallens hay you stay out of my hay he sensed dallen peering down through his eyes i would say you are correct now why dye think shed be runnin he asked more to the point why would one of the house enforcers be helping her the proprietors of such places tend to make sure that the loyalty of their men is firmly with the owner and not the women after all if there are going to be any disputes the owner wants the ones with the muscles enforcing her will not siding with the hirlings he sensed dallen thinking some things over id have to say the owner knew about what just happened there is no way it could be kept quiet not with all the shouting at the front and the mockfight then this peg person had t hev ordered im thelp er git an ordered up yon fight sos tdistract anyun what was watchin that seemed the only possible conclusion exactly so dallen went silent for another moment probably thinking mind it was probably not altruistic if the woman was bringing trouble to the house or even had the potential to bring trouble it makes sense to be rid of her and thet might could be why th thief was afeared the guide had definitely been murdered the thief might think the same people would come after him perhaps because he had enquired about the woman reckon th gel thinks shes in danger anyroad mags made a splitsecond decision kin you git outa there dallen clearly found the question amusing easily rolan tells me our waiting places are deliberately made so we companions can get out and come assist if we are needed i see through your eyes where you are ill meet you somewhere just keep following her and ill intercept you at some point mags oozed over to the next roof and crept along the edge keeping her in sight she was moving so slowly and so furtively that it wasnt hard even though the alley was in deep shadow she was wearing lightcolored clothing not thinkin real hard i reckon he was very glad he had decided to try to get her himself she obviously had no idea of how to get away from potential dangerother than sneak out a back door and that might not even have been her idea she wasnt even looking up from everything that he had experienced with the foreignersif indeed they were from the same place as the killers who had tried to murder the companionsthey were skilled killers they could just as easily have been up here on the roofs as he was with that alarming thought he took stock of his surroundings thinning his shields just the slightest bit the quickest way to find out if there was someone lurking was to see if there were any thoughtpresences near him that were giving out bits of roofimage a moment later he was able to relax that part of his vigilance no no there was no one there all the human presences that he could sense nearby were definitely inside and most of those were asleep the only creatures on the roofs were cats and rats dallen interrupted his thoughts im almost there im going to stop her at the end of the alley she is in now drop down behind her well get her between us so that she cant easily run gotcha he worked his way down the side of the building which was in such a shabby state that there were plenty of finger and toeholds it was probably just as well that the inhabitants had so little worth stealing because a thief who could climb would have no trouble breaking in he clung to the side of the building and waited for dallans signal he never had been able to figure out how they did it but when they wanted to companions could move like ghosts on the wind one minute the end of the alley was clear the next it was full of a large white beast the woman stopped dead in her tracks her posture showing shock and uncertainty she started to turn and mags dropped down behind her trapping her between himself and dallen things moved very swiftly then her eyes went huge and round he heard her intake of breath without waiting for her to let it out in a scream he rushed her ramming her up against dallens chest and slapping a hand over her mouth she wasnt accustomed to fighting she went limp eyes terrified her hands were trapped by the bundle she refused to drop if he actually had been there to kill her it would have been ridiculously easy she wouldnt even have put up a token fight whoaup he said softly i aint gonna hurt ye ye knows whatta companion is aye her head moved under his hand nodding this heres a companion my companion names dallen dallen curved his neck around and nudged her with his nose he did that thing that companions could do and made himself glow slightly so she could see him clearly in the dark her eyes went bigger im trainee mags he continued we come here thelp ye im agonna take mhand away don scream aye theres ony th two on us an iffen ye got trouble on yer tail i aint sure jest the two on us kin keep ye safe he took his hand away from her mouth she didnt scream though she was shaking in every limb he looked her over as best he could in the shadows of the alley she wasnt as slatternly as the women who had sold their stolen finery at the shop but it was fairly clear what her profession was under the huge shawls she had wrapped about herself her tawdryand scantyoutfit was a clear advertisement for her services yer senla aye he asked her eyes widened again and she nodded aight i know bout that guide whut was yer reglar an whut happen thim here nowdon cry he added with alarm as her eyes brimmed with tears we aint got time fer cryin im agonna git ye somewhere safe so no cryin till i does he knew that dallen would have been keeping rolan apprised of the situation and rolan would have been keeping nikolas up to date so he simply mindspoke nikolas without a second thought got er what di do take her to the actors inn keep her in the stable until i get there well that was clear enough and it was a good thing that he and nikolas had left the companions under saddle and bridle he hauled himself up into the saddle then held out a hand to senla pulling her up behind him she weighed next to nothing he revised his estimation of her age downward all right you ghost us outa here make damn sure caint nobuddy see us he felt dallens smirk as if i couldnt hold on so when they murdered giels i knew they were gonna come after me senla sobbed both hands wrapped around a mug of wine she held onto as if she were afraid she was going to drop it i told peg she told me shed help me but i had to leave i couldnt bring trouble on the house cleaned up she was an entirely different person prettier in mags estimation he guessed she was about three or four years older than he wasbut although in some ways she acted and thought as if she were much more experienced than her age in others she was rather childlike annoyingly childlike he had never quite realized how much he liked being around girls who thought for themselves instead of passively sitting there and waiting to be told what to do did you ever see these men nikolas asked her she shook her head giels told me that they spoke no language he recognized and hes guided people all over the south right down to that city the horsepeople go to when they want to sell horses katashinain thats what its called i think nikolas and mags exchanged a look he told me they had a lot of things he thought were poisons she continued theyd put out baits when they thought he wasnt watching and theyd check to see if the animals that took em had died that was why when he just dropped dead in the street i knew they had done it she shivered i knew they knew about me and i figured theyd guess giels had told me about them she started crying again mistress peg she always likes her girls to make a nest egg an get married and giels he always said that was what wed do you make a nest egg an ill make a nest egg hed say an when we got enough that we can have that little tavern youll quit an ill quit guidin an well sell beer an youll wait on the custom an well have a grand old time of it thats what he said and now she burst into tears mags patted her hand awkwardly he wished that giels had told his girl a little more than he had right now given that there was a dead body in a healers hands and the healer couldnt identify the poison used to kill the man it was reasonable to figure this was the same lot as the ones that had tried to murder mags and the king earlier this year that was really not good poison was definitely an assassins weapon everyone around the king would have to be even more careful and alert about what he ate and drank now giels had been commendably closemouthed if he was trying to protect her the only things she knew was that they were foreign and that there were no fewer than three of them all right nikolas sighed haven is not safe for you well have to send you away she mopped at her eyes with the handkerchief he gave her where she asked timidly i don know yet nikolas admitted youll be safe enough here for a few days ill be back later today with someone wholl help you figure out where you can go and what you can do until then dont let anyone in all right open the door only to me that was why i had food and drink brought up for you you wont starve in the time im gone the girl nodded bleakly mags felt horribly sorry for her but what could they do really they couldnt bring the guide giels back he hoped that there was something she could do besides sell herself but in her rambling story shed said more than once that shed joined mistress pegs establishment when shed come up from the country because shed hated being a servant so what else was there for her he and nikolas went down to the stables and retrieved dallen and rolan after changing into uniforms in the secret room whatre we gonna do wi er he asked nikolas on the way back i have no idea and fortunately that is not my problem nikolas replied with just a hint of irritation personally i cannot think of anything shes suited for ill be bringing old lord kennely down with me after i get some sleep its his job to work out problems like this when we have someone whose life is in danger and who is assisting the crown hell figure out what her skills are find a place for her to go outside of haven and see to it she gets there safely at least she doesnt have a huge family that has to be resettled along with her he rubbed the back of his neck as he rode i tell you mags its times like this that i am mortally glad that i am not the one that has to make these decisions he sighed i dont regret rescuing her i just wish shed told us more that is useful well least we know one thing sure mags pointed out we know we got moren the first lot ere now yes and we know that this second lot is definitely not handicapped by being unable to read their orders nikolas tone was grim you and i are going to have our work cut out for us now chapter wheres lena mags asked bear as the latter sat down next to him with a tired thud mags passed him the bowl of butter and the loaf of bread without being asked across the table pip passed over a bowl of pickles and gennie stood up to snag a plate of cheese before it vanished down to the other end bear made himself a little ploughmans lunch and tucked in driving herself to silliness in this heat he said in between bites seriously when she isnt in class shes either playing or writing and when i manage to drag her out all she can talk about is marchands pet and sit there and fret because she wants to hate him and cant turns out the feller is all right dead serious dead grateful to marchand for finding him his family dont have two pins theyre from some stony spot on the border and hed been learnin on any sort of instrument that anyone would let him borrow now coming up to bardic that means his family gets that familystipend which i guess is more money than theyve ever seen and he gets well bardic bear finished what was on his plate and reached for the bowl of baby carrotsa rare treat since you only got them when the young carrots were thinned out to allow the biggest to grow off stage hes shy shy unbelievable bear shook his head so of course she cant hate him so all she can do is try and figure out how to make marchand take notice of her instead of the pet i keep trying to tell her that shes wearing herself out for nothing but she doesnt listen well that put an interesting complexion on things mags felt his thoughts disengage from the problem of find the foreigners to concentrate on lena and he snagged a few baby carrots to munch on himself while he thought no use in my tellin er nothin he thought she blieves me when im with er an then fergets evthin i tol er when im agone exactly so dallen replied ermnot exactly she would listen to you as you said but doubts always set it as soon as she is alone but remember what you are trying to do about her and bear right so what he should do is put in bears mind the direction things should take and let bear do the telling and comforting and so on ye haven been all that around yersel he told bear with just the tiniest bit of reproach in his voice ye ken so whas she gonna do wi me runnin about after nikolas an you off doin too she gots nobody she talks to but us yes but bear faltered damn it why do you have to be right all the time and the only time i can get her out of class is when im agone aye he nodded nay look bear ye kin afford ttake a liddle time off amily ye gots th herald what draws stuff she sees i other peoples heads aye bear nodded and crunched a carrot she said shed do it when i asked her this morning just have to get her an amily an the right healer together deans finding me the healer an deans gonna set it up she says the best way is for her to make a bunch of drawings then we use those to roughsaw the cow bones in the right places then we all get back together again with her and the healer and amily and we make adjustments on the cow bones and pin em together exactly the right way theni dunno were gonna have to figure out how t do something more permanent than cement pinswere gonna have a bunch of healers handling the bones and turning them and studying them i just cant figure out how to make em stand up to that much abuse so whod know how tdo stuff like stickin bones tgether mags asked patiently it was beginning to dawn on him what his job was in all of this it wasnt necessarily to find answers his job was to ask the right questions then even if neither he nor bear nor lena knew the answers at least knowing the question would mean that they had a direction to go to find someone who did know the answers who sticks things together twouldnt be a healer the bones would have to be living i dunno bear ran his hand through his hair making it stand on end gennie noticed and smacked his hand lightly quit that you look like a hammerbird stick what together now bonesbone pieces i mean bear said and explained now anything that gennie was interested in was bound to get the interest of the rest of the team and they all leaned over to hear what bear was up to they were all gratifyingly encouraging in their enthusiasm and not one of them expressed any thought that bear wasnt up to the job bear began to brighten visibly and all of them began tossing ideas back and forth about how the bonemodel could be made until people at other tables started to notice ideas were tossed out and discarded glue obviously wasnt going to hold past rough examination you couldnt nail the pieces together the bone would split and screws had the same problem pins by themselves were too unstable finally one of the oldest people listening spoke upnot a teacher but one of the servers why doest have to be one thing he asked they all stopped talking and looked at him he flushed obviously unused to that much attention ohdont mind me he stammered no no go on bear said encouragingly please what did you mean by that well look my ma is a seamstress for real special stuff for the guard say shes got something that has got to hold up life or death uhlike the seams on the carrybags they use to get sick or hurt people down off mountains where you cant even get a stretcher well she dont use just one thing to put that seam together first she sews it loose so she can adjust curves and all then she sews three seams close together then she sews something to protect the seam on the outside then she glues the seam then glues a layer of leather down then she gets a saddler to stitch the leather down so its not just one thing the loose stitches would pull out if that were all there was one line of stitches might break three might get cut the glue might give the leather might get torn off if it was only glued the saddle stitches might pop but with all of that there even if part of it goes the rest is gonna hold it together the man flushed again sorry ii shouldnt have yes you should have bear exclaimed all right then so hes right the pins only have to hold so we can do what at this point there were three tablesworth of trainees and other students involved in this well someone who wasnt in any of the three collegia who was up here taking classes so he could learn how to plan things like bridges and buildings tentatively put his oar in what you need after you position the bones is something to hold them in place temporary aye well look is there any reason why your model has to be made of bone at all cant you just make a model directly bear frowned a little sort of i mean i dunno of anyone who can mold the way the bone is out of clay if thats what youre asking the herald thats making the drawings doesnt make sculptures she told me so when i asked her to help right that clarifies things im myca by the way he stuck out a hand and bear shook it he tapped the server on the arm the server jumped introduce yourself man its only polite pawel the server said diffidently they all nodded a friendly greeting look sit down bear said but pawel shook his head im on duty and if i dont work the cook will have my hide and i might get my wages cut thank you but i really need to get back to work he picked up some empty bowls and headed for the hatch to return them to the kitchen huh bear stared after him a moment well all right so myca i guess we could use something other than bone once we have the sketches but theres no way that i know of to make a model thatll be accurate other than by pinning bits of bone together fair enough then pawel was right first pin but then go ahead and use carpentry glue but glue the pins in first then glue the two surfaces then start working on something more permanent i guess this is going to get a lot of handling so it is going to have to be sturdy id say to make a carpentry join a dovetail or something like that but that would be difficult to get right and youre only going to waste time if you spoil it and have to start over soid use metal staples out of soft wire so you can set them in rather than hammering them in staples bear wasnt the only one that looked puzzled but this time it was a firstyear bardic student who suddenly popped his head up like a jeweler the boy exclaimed he scrabbled in his belt pouch for a writing stick and began to sketch on the tabletop my cousins a jeweler sometimes you have to join stone or metal together and you dont dare put heat to it so this is what you do you drill a hole you cement in one end of your wire you bend that like so and so make it flat to the surface you drill another hole and you cement the other end of the wire in make sure its flat to the surface and you can even burnish it into place like inlay nods all around the table oh and you know what else i would do once you have your staples in place all around the bone said pip id get pliversuede and fishskin glue and sinew or maybe horsehair or gut or harpstring wire put in one of the bardic students aye any of those and id glue the pliver down all the way around the break then id glue the string and wrap the break just like fitting an arrowhead to the shaft thatll hold the staples in place the staples will hold the bone from shifting and the pins and the glue will keep the pieces from falling apart i think thatll work bear said slowly then grinned i think thatll work might want to make two and call on one of those fellows that makes the fancy coloredglass windows it was lord wess who had popped over from the palace to have the noon meal with the team as he often did he might be able to do something with that copper foil and lead they use try that on the second model instead of the glue and leather and sinew no reason why not bear agreed then if we can get one thatll hold through being used to make a mold from we can make as many plaster copies as we like he looked around at the small mob that had gathered youre terrific he burst out beaming like the sun youre all terrific mags smiled quietly to himself tis all askin th right questions then makin sure when ye ask em theres plenty of people about these are people used to thinking mags you need people who are used to thinking otherwise you might as well go down to the kennel and ask the dogs youll get about as much help eh i spose thets true only partly true though he reckoned you could get about anybody to think if you just coaxed at them long enough he finished his lunch quietly as the chattering died down someone brought some paper so the one lad could copy his rough drawings of stapling onto something more portable than the top of the table and bear could put everything else into coherent notes and things generally got back to normal so he said once bear had tucked his precious notes into one of his books now bout lena bear sighed and shook his head what about her mags ii dont know what to tell her really and she cries and i feel like breaking something because i dont have anything good to say or anything at all really and bollocks evbody knows how they feels bout each other but them whoaup mags stopped him goin at this all wrong like ye oughter ask yerselwhat the hell is goin on here thiss marchand were lookin at if th attention aint on im e finds th center of attention an sits ont if theres a more selfcentered feller i th whole damn kingdom i never heerd of im so now e goes and picks up this raggedy tadbit whats got a lot of what makes a bard an brings im ere an why goodness uv is heart bear stared at him put that way theres somethin int fer marchand mags said firmly i know it i jest don know what tis all i know is gotta be somethin e cant git from lena so he made a dustoff motion with his hands e knows ow she feels aint like es gonna lose er no matter ow e treats er so e gits whut e wants from this pet an then lena gets a crumb or so when e reckons e wants somethin from er bear looked at him in mingled admiration and despair youre right that feels right it matches the man perfectly but i cant tell lena that mags tilted his head to the side so i thin i know what yer thinkin sure tell er she likely wont blieve it so whatll make er believe i dont know bear said slowly but i can think about it good mags smiled an i thmeantime stead uv tryin t think uv some daft thing tsay which you aint good at ye know jest tell erno show er thet shes as good a bard as anybody else up ere an then get all stern wi er and tell er that it aint er pa she needs tplease its er teachers er pa aint gonna grade erthey wouldn let im even if ed teach which es too bonelazy tdo amen to that bear sighed then managed one of his old grins all right then ill take all this to the dean hes made it clear that once i find solutions to things hell see to it that theyre implemented he told me he wasnt going to give me an excuse to skip class and go larking about palace collegia and haven as if ye would mags laughed bear reddened a little well he admitted maybe a little mags smacked him in the shoulder and left him to finish his meal he headed for the kitchen if lena hadnt eaten and he was pretty sure she hadnt bringing her a basket was a good excuse to work his wiles on her mags did not go to lenas room himself for a start that would have been improper and for another he wanted a little bit of backing before he tackled his friend so counting on the fact that she encouraged people to come to her he presented himself with not one but two baskets of nuncheon at the door of the office of master bard lita darvalis dean of bardic collegium and head of the bardic circle the door as he had been told was usual was open the dean liked her students and teachers to know that she would ever shut them out or refuse to see anyone regardless of rank and status lita was oblivious to the quiet cacophony of her collegiumpeople practicing anything and everything in their rooms in the practice rooms with their teachers alone or in groupsvoices lecturing in classes people just talking a lot bards seemed to do that the very air of bardic hummed he had the slightly confused impression that if all the people were suddenly snatched away bardic collegium would still murmur quietly to itself like a bell that hums on and on after it has been struck he tapped politely on the doorpost and the dean looked up her brows creased mags she said what brings you here shouldnt you be got a candlemark he assured her i brung ye nuncheon dean lita he held up a basket with a sprig of rosemary tucked under the lid cook put in whut was on offer e knowed was yer favorites knew she corrected automatically and brought thank you mags now whats your real reason for being here lita did not look all that imposing sitting behind her cluttered desk with an open window framing tree branches behind her she just looked like an ordinary middleaged woman handsome rather than beautiful darkeyed with dark graying hair her bardic scarlet outfit was no uniformunlike the heralds and healers the only thing uniform about what bards wore was the colorand it was not particularly fancy she generally favored a split skirt a belted tunic and shirt tailored like those that the heralds wore and at the moment both were made of very lightweight breezy material so she looked just a bit gypsylike there were ink stains on her writing hand and the only sign that she was the head of the bardic circle was the seal of her office in the form of a ring on that hand but mags had seen her perform and he knew that the moment she put her hand to the strings of one of her favored instruments you would forget everything about her and be caught up completely in whatever story she was telling you afterward if someone were to ask you what she looked like you would probably use words like goddess and regal and queenly mags chuckled not taking offense in the least and put the deans basket on the least cluttered corner of her desk lena he said simply the dean rolled her eyes that girl how marchand threw such a child i will never know he lives to please himself she lives to please everyone but on the other hand i could wish all my students gave me the sorts of problems she does i tell you it is far from comfortable presiding over a collegium where by rights we should count double enrollment mags had been about to say something about lena but the comment caught him off guard ah what maam double enrollment my trainees and their egos she said making a face all right what can i do to help you twa thins he said fust one git someun tdrag er outa er room sos i kin feed er and talk to er lena nodded and second one i dunno whut tis but ye gotta hev some way uv showin er ye figger shes as good nor bettern marchands new pet he pointed out ye know lena ye know thet boy is gonna make er feel like er pas wrote er off as a failure tellin er aint gonna talk to er gut ye gotta show er oh bother the dean said torn between exasperation and amusement you would say something like that im a bard young man were all about words not deeds he dared to raise an eyebrow at her she raised one right back at him trading him look for look i can keep this up all day you know she said conversationally i am the past mistress of the admonishing brow you cannot hope to beat me besides i agree with you but i am not going to coax and cosset her that was all very well when she first came here and was terrified lonely and shy shes older now and i am not going to allow her to fall into the trap of being weak and bleating like a little lost lamb because she wants attention its not attractive its not appropriate and its not bardic yesm he said obediently resuming his normal expression unnatural child she complained you have the looks of someone barely old enough to be admitted and the mind of an old man a conniving calculating scheming plotting old man yesm he admitted schemin kept me breathin i the mine she made a wry face i imagine it did all right ill tuck your second demand in the back of my poor overworked enfeebled brain and let it simmer perchance the goddess or the angel of music will take pity on me and stick an answer in there for me before my mind melts of the heat and ill summon a lenaextractor nowno wait ill get her myself i havent been out of this chair in candlemarks you wait here suiting actions to words the dean got up and left him standing there basket handle in his hands the deans office was on the same floor and corridor as the rooms for the female bardic traineesfor reasons that would have been obvious to anyone with the least knowledge of restless young men and women all of them very far away from the parental eye in no time at all she was back with lena in tow he was relieved to see that lena didnt look too bad shed been getting some sleep since her eyes werent red or darkcircled she did have that slightly distracted air she usually had when shed been working too hard though there now you see even the wretched cook is worried enough about you missing meals he sent one of your friends over with a basket you should be ashamed of yourself lena the dean scolded gesturing at mags as they came in what is the very first thing we tell you youngsters when you get here hmm your body is your instrument she said without thinking and what would i do if you neglected your instrument let it get shamefully out of tune didnt keep the wood oiled and polished allowed the strings to break the dean asked sharply with a fearsome frown on her face mags stilled his feelings of alarm the dean was acting as she had said she would and he couldnt fault her she had been teaching bardic students for a very long time indeed he had to believe she knew how to handle someone like lena he waited for dallen to say something but dallen remained silent so he hazarded that this meant dallen agreed with the bard take it away from me until i deserved it again lena whispered her head hanging well i cant exactly take your body can i the dean sniffed but i can take you out of that room and tell you that if you dont stop driving yourself into the ground i am going to suspend you from all classes and assign you to the stables for a moon no music plain ordinary labor nothing that would harm your hands of course but other than that subject to the orders of the stablemaster lena looked up sharply her mouth agape with shock youdwhat a faint flush of outrage passed over her pretty face mags felt encouraged to see it the bard might be right it might be that what lena needed to make her stronger was a bit of opposition not support the dean crossed her arms over her chest i am responsible for you for your health for your wellbeing if you refuse to take care of yourself i will give you no choice in the matter a month of good healthy work carrying water and feed and shoveling manure should undo all the nasty things youve been doing to yourself when you see your meals youll devour them because work made you hungry and youll be so tired at the end of the day that youll fall asleep whether you want to or not its not as if you have anything to fear in your studies youre so far ahead now that youll probably get your scarlets a year early if not sooner than that the dean shifted her weight to one foot and raised an eyebrow so eloquently that mags was ashamed of his own effort earlier so what is it going to be start acting like a perfectly normal girl study and create yes but also eat and play and sleep or am i going to have to put you to stable duty lena stared at her eyes wide and shocked and finally remembered to close her mouth but what had startled her was not the parts about stable duty getget my scarletsa year early she stammered the dean threw up her hands what am i speaking karsite now didnt i just say that havent your teachers been implying as much yes or sooner than that you dont have to worry about falling behind youre making the rest feel rather badly actually which is scarcely fair that poor little brat marchand brought in is terrified of living up to your standard hes sure that if he dares say a word to you youll somehow magically and instantly see him for a fraud and have him thrown out iwhat lenas jaw dropped again i must be speaking karsite the dean muttered loudly enough that both of them could hear her quite clearly no one understands a word i say today lena there is only one thing in which you are not so very far ahead of your yearmates that they would resent you if you were not a pleasant and friendly person you need to work on performing in front of large audiences alone and to be absolutely honest ive put people into scarlets that never mastered that there are plenty of bards out there who wont play for more than a dozen people at a time there are lena said dazed there arehowever do not take that as permission to slack i want to see you trying and trying hard to overcome your stage fright and since you are so far ahead believe me much more will be required of you than your yearmates but for now i want to see you learning how to be a person you cant create if you dont have experience she nonetoogently turned both mags and lena around and shoved them at the door you two she said enunciating with exquisite precision out eat play do not come back before your next class or i shall visit great wrath upon you lena still seemed stunned so mags grabbed her elbow and towed her out of the office from there it was a short trip down the stairs and out the door the coolest place he could think of to have their impromptu picnic was a kind of cavegrotto down by the river most of the time it was entirely too damp to be pleasant but he was pretty certain it would be nice today and he didnt particularly care if someone else was there either which was just as well because there was a couple of young highborn fellows from the palace one in brown linen with all the edges piped in red and one in a dull green of much better quality than the first they were engaged in a spirited game of haresandhounds laid out on one of the little stone tables this place held they looked up when the two trainees came in waved in a lazy fashion pointed at the other side of the grotto and went back to their game the cool in here was a fabulous relief from the heat outside there was just a bit of a damp smell but with an overtone of green that made mags think it came up from the river moss thickly carpeted the floor the artifical cave wall of the grotto was cold to the touch as were the stone benches on either side of the three little stone tables mags set the basket down and took a seat as lena did the same by this point lena was mostly over her shock she wont blieve it acourse not een when twas th dean hersel what tol er she was thet good not once she starts tthinkin bout it which would be where bear would come in once bear started showing her what the dean had just told her lena just might slowly start to accept that it was nothing about her that made her father treat her like something hed scraped off his boot no it was all about bard marchand and what bard marchand wanted i gotta figger out whut es getting from thet boy mags unpacked the basket there was a lot of food more than two people could eat and only one of them was going to actually be eating there was so much that it caught the attention of the two fellows at the portable game board they looked and looked away looked and looked away and finally one of them caught lenas eye i suppose youre going to eat all that that one finally said wistfully erm we got up too late for luncheon and the palace cook told us to take your lazy carcasses out of my kitchen dammit mags was amused at that they could of course go down into haven and have whatever they wanted at any inn in the city or they could go visit the stately manor of some friend who would have father mother or housekeeper order them up something clearly however they were disinclined to move very far in this heat prolly figgered on waitin till cook fergot bout em then gettin a page tfetch summat fer em that startled lena into speech oh no she laughed breathlessly please come help yourselves with glee they did coming over and when mags assured them that it was all right that he had already eaten taking everything that the two trainees pressed on them they were very polite about it and thanked them both profusely before returning to their game with their booty lissen mags said when the young men were immersed in the game again munching on the food in one hand while they moved counters with the other i didn come over t git ye in trouble wi yon dean i come over tgit yer help wi bear immediately her brows knitted with concern her own woes set aside for the moment is it the whole business of fixing amilys leg she asked and then answered herself before he could say anything of course it is he has to be worried sick about it hes in charge which is an awfully big trust and an awfully big responsibility its bad enough that its a fearfully dangerous thing to do but amily is our friend that just makes it all worse mags nodded now look reckon them whats in charge got a pretty good holduv this i think akchully thet th reason they put bear i charge ere is on account f a coupla thins they wanta gi im th chance t show is pa es got th stuff they wanta put im inna place where e akchully sees fer isself thet es got th stuff aye gi im whatchacallselfconfidence i don think they knowed ow much es like tfret hisself tpieces on accounta e caint thinkv answers eh then e caint thinkv answers on accounta es frettin hisself tpieces jest goes roun an roun i kin ep im some an hev but the frettin part i caint do nothin bout thet so thets where ye come in she nodded slowly i can see that i need to make sure he eats because her eyes flickered to the strangers for a blink hell take it better from me than from you good girl lena aye ell say im bein a nanny an e don need one he grinned at her es said as much already and i need to make sure he sees some sun and thinks about something other than amily she smiled and of course when he starts complaining about his family i listen and let him run on and then tell him that they are idiots and dont deserve him which they are and they dont so it wont even be a little lie teach him hareandhounds said one of the young men at the game board unexpectedly turning and looking at lena or if he already knows it play it with him i know they teach you bards the game straight offive lost plenty of pocket money to you trainees its a good excuse to come down here in the cool if were here we can even trade off partners if you dont mind that that is he looked up and flushed a little as if realizing he had been just a bit rude for eavesdropping and even more for butting in on the conversation but lena beamed at him that would be a lovely idealord charliss said the speaker with a foolish grin he was a very affable looking fellow with blond hair that flopped a bit into his deepset blue eyes and a generous mouth that looked as if he smiled a lot moron said his friend who was a thinner slightly harder version of the first young man aiming a cuff at him lord pig with no manners now he turned toward the two of them and after you were so nice as to feed us too im grig no lordishness attached im the poorandpitied cleverer cousin assigned to make sure char keeps from putting his foot in his mouth too often he sighed and shook his head as you can see it is a neverending and utterly thankless task and yet i endure grig lord charliss lena somehow managed to give an impression of a curtsy while still sitting im trainee lena this is trainee mags the two young men started their eyes popping taking mags completely aback the trainee mags gasped charliss the kirball player for south team the one with the companion that runs like a cat with twelve paws a cat with twelve paws thats an ungainly image dallen snorted ermaye he said the two young men exchanged a gleeful glance benter is never going to believe us said grig grinning as if he was never going to stop oh hell believe us hell just never forgive us replied charliss with the air of someone who had just taken all his opposing players hounds in one go so trainee mags just what strategy would you recommend to get on a kirball team so thets where th wind blows weell he said with a glance at lena to make sure it was all right with her to start this particular conversationbecause after all he had come here with her not them tstart with ye gotter git th right horses chapter when i proposed this business i thought you would be sitting here in the shop with me not climbing about rooftops all night nikolas said ruefully mostly i thought you would be watching me work these people and watching out for my back and you have done that but i never imagined id be putting you out there on your own he was not happy with this but and this had given mags such a thrill that he almost forgot how dangerous this was going to be he had not argued at all somebody gots tbe i shop buyin whatall mags replied briefly with a glance down at nikolas worried face as he pushed open the hatch in the ceiling somebody gots ter foller th lads as sells ye th words nobodyd blieve yed leave me i chargev shop even ifn i werent sposed tbe deaf so reckon i gotter foller nikolas was going to start secondguessing himself in a moment if mags didnt say something to lighten the mood he climbed up into the attic space and dropped the hatch back in place asides yer too big tclimb bout like yon roofrat the word he used was big but the mental shading that came with it was unmistakably fat oy nikolas replied with mock outrage im not that big an yer jest not limber nough either reckon yer bones git creaky caint hev ye breakin yon tiles an fallin through someuns ceiling mags continued mockingly thatd land ye in gaol fer certainsure theyd figger ye fer a thief an then whut and would you dare take me and rolan in a challenge race you unwashed brat came the growled reply nossir he said promptly wouldn dare sir because you know wed beat you like a handdrum nikolas told him nossir cannot lie sir tis cause yer not ony big yer me elder wouldn be fittin t challenge a granther sir not only fat but old he suppressed his giggles at nikolas reaction of outrage he wasnt just goading nikolas for the sake of it the kings own was seriously worried about him and if he had to do his part of this evenings work with an undivided mind he had to shake off his concern for mags it was true he did have a dangerous job he was going to lie in wait above the door until a couple of men who said they had information to sell about the foreign spies arrived sold their information and left then mags was going to follow them it wasnt the full moon now it was the dark of the moon and he wasnt merely making his way across the rooftops to get from one place to another he was going to have to follow someone which meant keep up with people walking on the flat open street and it wasnt going to be people as oblivious as selna wunner whut happened t selna further talking with her had uncovered the rather disconcerting information that shed gone into the profession with mistress peg because shed come up from the country to be a serving maid and hadnt liked all the hard work now mags knew that not all households were like that of master soren where the servants were treated fairly and if shed been treated as a slavey well he could sympathize but shed come up from the country in the first place because shed been under the delusion that being a maid in the city meant huge wages compared to the country and a life of ease after all there could be dozens of servants in a household and with that many hands she had told herself that no single one would have to work very hard guesst musta come pretty shockin when she was put i scullery he thought ruefully arranging himself in the shadows above the door and watching for movement up and down the street he himself had firsthand experience of what working as a scullery drudge was like and just because there were dozens of servants in a household it didnt follow that this was going to make for leisure not when the master and mistress would entertain thirty or forty guests at a time when they constantly had houseguests and when the houses themselves were so big only when the highborn and wealthy were away from their town manors off in the country on their estates did things slow down and the skeleton staff left behind could expect some of that leisure well he just hoped that the poor old fellow in charge of such things managed to find her someplace where she would be content he rather dreaded to think that it might be another establishment like mistress pegs but he didnt have any time to think about it now not when the two men he had been told to watch for had just come around the corner one of them was holding something he went very still theyre ere he warned nikolas he did not like the way they moved they were aware of everything around them and prepared to attack at the first sign of trouble but at the same time they held themselves with an unconscious arrogance as if the assumption that they would prevail in any fight was something so ingrained in them that it was unconscious their walk said all of that it was it was the walk of a predator it was the way the man who had nearly slaughtered a stableful of companions had walked that alarmed him if they even suspected that nikolas was not what he seemedthe previous lot had proved they would kill without thinking twice about it quickly he passed that information on to nikolas amilyd never frgive me if and she would equally never forgive me if anything happened to you nikolas replied somberly i have a knife on me and ive bolted the door theres a shutter i can slam down over the paywindow if i need to and that will give me time to come up the hatch and join you the men had reached the shop mags froze not even breathing unlike selna they were making a quick scan of everywhere including up before either of them even touched the door mags knew he was in full shadow he knew that at most only the top of his head showed from where he was crouched but he felt a cold chill spread over him as their gaze raked the roof and he didnt relax at all when they finally opened the door and entered the shop assuming all went well in there he was going to have to be very very careful when they came out carefully he opened his awareness some not like dropping shields at all but enough to see if he could just read something on their surface he couldnt not like he could with ordinary folk there was something in the way and he pulled back this was not the point at which to make them wary because men like these two reacted swiftly and decisively when something made them wary at least he had not felt that bewildering kinship with either of these men the way he had with the ragefilled assassin nor did there seem to be any inexplicable link with them he still had no idea what could have caused such a link it had almost been as if no that was utterly ridiculous and he had better not let his thoughts wander not now not at this juncture he didnt move not a muscle as he concentrated on sensing what he could passively without letting his shields down too far and without impinging on nikolas the last thing the kings own needed right now was to get his metaphorical elbow jiggled well they were talking small things leaked past those shieldsthatwerenotshields there was no sense of animosity a bit of contempt for the lowly creature who was purchasing their information information they wanted to be known they were planting this information he couldnt shake that impression whatever it was these men were here for they wanted what they were selling to be generally known generally no no they wanted it to be known to the people who were interested in it now since it was the whereabouts of the foreign assassins it followed that they wanted the people who were trying to track them downthe heralds the guardsto know this deceptive information of course they were trying to throw the heralds and guards off the trail that at least made sense now they were amused as nikolas reacted to a bit of intimidation with fear he tried to cover with bluster the bargaining concluded quickly after that they pushed something through under the bars nikolas pushed a great deal of silver back and he added the shinain brooch that had told them nothing on top they didnt react to the brooch they gathered it up and left the emerged into the street examined the entire area for anyone who might be following and turned and walked away going in the opposite direction from which they had come mags watched them he was going to keep as far back from them as he could whatd they say he asked nikolas as the two strode off positioning themselves in such a way as to cover each others blind spots that the spies left haven came the reluctant reply they say they arranged passage with a traders caravan going into the east into hardorn they said that the foreigners had paid them with almost everything they had and they sold me another one of those poetry books and a few odds and ends nikolas hesitated its a very plausible story why dont i believe them cause yer smart or i have good instincts wut i think i got from em is thet thiss tryin tthrow us offen th trail they got that funny shield tother one had so i caint be sure i got little bits cause whatever thet shield is i dun want it pickin up on me so i caint be certainsure now mags left his perch and followed the men he had the flavor of their thoughts even if he had not probed deeply enough to read anything with that unless they worked their way into a crowd he would be able to find them oh i think youre right these men were better prepared than the first lotthey speak valdemaran extremely well and theyre dressed like locals in old clothesbut they cant hide what they are and they are too welltrained to be local thugs mags continued to gather what he could from them passively whatever else these men were they were not insaneor at least they were not as full of rage as the other assassins had been cold definitely calculating purposeful and literally nothing meant anything to them not even each other except the job the first two assassins had been the flawed copies of which these two were the perfect originals mags didnt want to get too close to their minds though because he sensed that they were very much like the second assassin in another aspect they were not mindspeakersbut they could be they were not shieldedbut that something was protecting them so long as he hovered passively that thing wouldnt notice him and he could pick up bits of what they were thinking images feelings mostly unlike the first and second assassins they did not hate valdemar nor did they like it they were entirely indifferent to the place for them it was just another place that held a job and it was always the job not the surroundings that mattered he followed on the roofs he wished he could have gone down to the ground but he didnt dare these men were too good they just might spot him there was a definite purpose in them not just whatever the longterm job they had come for they had an immediate task one that had to be performed very very soon he balanced on a rooftree and scuttled down the slates while his mind oozed around them like a weasel circling something very dangerous but asleep the task was to take care of something unfinished there was contempt contempt for the task no he crossed between two roofs as he followed that faint wisp of contempt not contempt for the task contempt for for there was a flash of an image but because he had seen this man with his own eyes and more than once he knew it immediately the supposed head of the phony trading envoys the contempt came strongly with the image contempt for himcontempt presumably for the rest of the men who had been with him disgust mags negotiated a drop to a lower roofline then scrambled up it to reach a higher one disgust they had they had well he already guessed at that these men were disgusted with their predecessors because of their performanceor more correctly lack of performance theyd failed at the task the greater task that these two had taken over and failed at it twice oh but there was anger as well why anger it was cold and distant it wasnt for the failed agents it wasnt for anyone in valdemar someone else someone hadno he couldnt make it out it was too abstract but now they had stopped he couldnt hear their footsteps on the street ahead and he felt himself getting nearer to their presence he slowed his own pace and slipped up on them at a crawl careful to remain below the roofline on the opposite side of where they were when he was as close as he dared get he hugged the slates his chin pressed into the roof and closed his eyes he let go of everything except the need to listen with his ears with his mind like a sponge he soaked up everything around him he could hear them talking but not clearly he didnt think they were speaking valdemaran now the cadence the accents were wrong what were they doing besides talking why had they stopped did they realize they were being followed no it was this place this building that he was on it wasnt much one of those narrow twostory houses that was a scant two rooms up two rooms down and an attic there was no one in it but this was where they had to take care of that unfinished business that was smaller than the greater task the other assassins had left undone an image of a broken trail a little cruel pleasure the sense that punishment had been meted out one went to the front door and unlocked it the other stood guard in the street the strange notshield tightened over both of them letting nothing out now whatever it was that he went in to do he was done quickly he came out conferred with the other and then the two burst into a run from a standing start with absolutely no warning they ran like deerhounds mags could scarcely believe how fast they were they ran so quietly that he actually hadnt realized they were moving at all until their presence shot away they were already at the end of the block before he had gotten to the edge of the roof he gazed after them in disbelief and crushing disappointment he couldnt hope to catch them or even keep upalready the mindtraces were fading with distance and in a moment while he tried desperately to keep hold the faint traces slipped from him and were gone nikolas he said with despair i was following came the reply dallen let me ride his link with you it cant be helped see what they were doing in that house if you can well one thing for sure he was absolutely not going in the front door if hed been in the shoes of these men he would have left a trap on the door but they might not be aware that most of the buildings in this part of town had rooftop hatches that was what he would look for first it was easier to find than he had thought the owner must have had reason to be up here more frequently than most for he had installed a real hatch with a solid door the kind that was in nikolas shop rather than a makeshift thing you had to move tiles to find it was locked but only by a sliding bolt working by feel mags got it open and felt around the edges for any sort of triggering mechanism for a possible trap it was risky brushing his fingers around the edges like that but he kept his body out of direct range of anything that might shoot him as best he could there was nothing he gave the frame of the hatch a more thorough examination and still saw nothing all right he was safe so far holding onto the edge as long as he could he lowered himself down as far as his arms would reach then dropped the remaining distance onto the attic floor there he crouched listening nothing the house was absolutely silent he couldnt even hear any vermin light would have been nice then again he was used to working in the dark on hands and knees he felt his way along the attic floor searching for the hatch that would lead down into the house itself using the dim patch of sky and stars where the roof hatch was open as his guide in the search crawling in an everwidening circle until his hands encountered something raised off the surface of the floor a hatch identical to the first also locked he listened with mind and ears then pressed his ear to the hatch still nothing odd no rats no mice wunner why it could be that they were extraordinarily vigilant about vermin it could be that theyd actually had a ratcatcher in recently once a ratcatcher had gone over a place with his ferrets it usually took the surviving rats and mice a fortnight or two to work up the courage to come back he worked the second latch open as he had the first this hatch opened downward and he peered into the darknessand this time he saw a glimmer a faint shimmer of light at the farther end of the house he thought it would be coming the ground floor at the back of the house he dropped down onto the floor and made his way toward that faint glow confident now that the house was empty he thought these might be bedrooms there were large bulky objects on the floor and a musty bitter smell it was nothing he could identify not exactly a perfume but not exactly a stink either the closest he could come was some sort of bitter herb the light was coming up a staircase at the back of the house damn i hate this there was no good way to get up or down a staircase when you didnt know what was waiting for you on the next floor all he could do was lie down flat on his belly and scoot himself awkwardly down the stairs a little at a time hoping that if there was someone there after all and his gift had gone completely unreliable he would see them before they saw him but he saw the source of the light first it was a candle left burning atop what looked like a heap of clothing and bedding this was where the smell was coming from it looked as if the cloth had been drenched in some sort of oil it was stained and dark and there was a sort of dull sheen on it once the candle burned downwhich would not even take a candlemarkthe clothing would catch fire with all that oil the place would be ablaze in no time was this what the assassin had come into the house to set up probably nikolas confirmed its a good way to ensure that you are long gone when the fire starts and that candle was awfully slim and short mags didnt bother with getting to his feet tumbling down the stairs was faster at the bottom he bounced up and ran over to the pile of clothing and snatched the candle out of it this looked like the kitchen fireplace with some pots the table on which all the clothing had been heaped some chairs implements on the counters he wrinkled his nose the smell of the oil had covered up the stink of spoiled food but it was old he went to look at the pots and they were half full of mold and spoiled food all of it dried and cracking no one had been here in a while why bother to burn it down then he recognized another smell he knew that smell absolute dread rolled over him and he shuddered he remembered that smell from the mines when col pieters and his boys had hidden things they didnt want anyone to ever find knocked out the supports of the tunnels their secrets had been left in and buried them in the waste rock that held no gems but the rock never stopped the rot and the smell would permeate through the mine and get into everything and all you could do was tie rags around your mouth and nose and try to breathe through them until time and vermin took care of the problem and try not to think too hard about what was making the smell because if you did he didnt want to go into the next room he didnt want to see what was there he didnt have a choice waitmags nikolas mindvoice interrupted him this room had a door between it and the next mags propped the candle in a little wax pulled off his shirt and jerkin took the shirt and wrapped it around his face making sure to cover his mouth and nose before putting the jerkin back on then he tried the door am i yer partner or not he asked fiercely telling himself not to be sick you are but you dont have to do this ill haveta dot sometime ye knows thet fust time mights well be now he sensed nikolas resignation ill send the guard when they take over from you get out the same way you got in the door wasnt locked but it had been jammed shut not caring now about noise he rammed it repeatedly with his shoulder hearing something crack every time he did as if he was breaking some sort of seal each time he did it more of the stench puffed out around the frame finally the door gave and he stumbled into the room the candlelight flickered over a scene of grotesque even macabre horror even through his shirt the stench was appalling the stench of four bloated bodies sprawled across the furniture in bizarre poses of ease as if they were all relaxing their clothing wasnt disarranged there was no sign of a fight no sign even that they had been carried in here they looked exactly as if they had come here together to pass some time before bed but they werent relaxing they were dead dead without a mark on them to show how they had died chapter the guardsmen had sent some of their most experienced and hardened men but even they had been overcome with nausea and had had to leave the building several had been violently ill and the curious thing wasat least in mags mindthere was not a man among them himself included who would not happily have seen these men hang at the very least these victims had conspired to wipe out a stableful of companions they were spies they had colluded in kidnapping a healer trainee and probably would have killed him when he was of no further use to them but your head could tell you all that a thousand times but your gut was going to react to the visceral stench in the timehonored fashion and that was all there was to it someone dispensed mintsoaked scarves to wrap around their faces and that helped but after the initial group arrived and set up a line that no one would be allowed to cross there was a wait for a special squad a wait during which the guard captain insisted that no one could touch or move anything finally the special squad arrived laden with bags and implements and lanterns and the others dispersed to hold the curious outside an established perimeter their faces reflecting their relief mags remained partly out of curiosity and partly in case any of this new group wanted to ask him anything they had stronger stomachs than he did that was certain for all that he could tell the stench didnt bother them at all they examined the bodies in place minutely they confiscated every used dish and pot then after finally having the bodies closed up into waterproof bags and transported on a cart somewhere they allowed all the windows to be opened so that the place could air out mags was intensely grateful for the brisk breeze and felt very sorry for anyone nearby who was downwind of the house two of the special squad combed over the room of death like misers searching for a lost gem while the rest accompanied the bodies and the confiscated objects back to wherever they were being taken one of them actually was picking up small things and carefully bagging them and when mags finally gave in to his curiosity and came to see what he was doing he saw to his surprise that the young guardsman was picking up dead bugs the fellow looked up and saw mags staring at him in disbelief didnt you notice there werent any flies he pointed out and held up a dead one mags blinked ye mean them flies is all dead as dead as last years leaves the fellow replied and i will bet that is why there are no mice or rats here either it might have been poison in the food but given all the dead insects i suspect poison fumes or smoke of some sort ye kin do thet mags gulped that was altogether nasty how could you guard against something like that ye kin poison summun with stuff they breathe in its not easy and its rather difficult to get people to sit there and breathe the stuff but yes it can be done of course if you drug them first its trivial and judging by their relative positions they were either drunk or drugged when they died the guardsman went back to picking up bugs whatever it was it would have to work quickly it might have been a poison in the food or drink but that wouldnt account for the dead bugs we can test for most poisons but not the sort that are inhaled and the men who did this might have been trying to prevent anyone from finding out that these men were murdered rather than died by accident i do think however that the room was sealed after they were dead rather than before probably to keep the stink from leaking out and betraying whoever did this until they were ready to burn the house down ow longve they bin dead he asked a little repulsed but a little fascinated by someone who would talk so matteroffactly about grisly corpses more than a day not more than two the reply was prompt its been warm the room was sealednormally bodies dont bloat until the third day but the room probably got rather hot during the day and that would speed things up mags relayed all this to nikolas hmm so it appears that they died before or about the same time as the guide came the reply reckon so and that begged the questionhow long had these new killers been in haven before they rid themselves of the first lot and why yeve been askin bout strangers fer long that was a good place to start the weasel is an established persona of mine and hes always bought and sold information nikolas said thoughtfully but i have only been asking specifically about foreigners for a week it would have taken a few days for that particular piece of information to get around the same thought must have occurred to nikolas damn by looking for them i killed them i wanted to catch them not kill them that puzzled magsnot that nikolas was unhappy about these men being killed but that he blamed himself im purt sure ye didn toss poison i their fire sir i might just as well have nikolas replied bleakly if im purt sure they was gonna get kilt anyway sir mags interrupted as he watched these odd guardsmen finish combing the room then spread out to the rest of the house thet was how them others thet i was follerin was thinkin anyroad ye fail ye die leastwise if this new lot gits sent tclean up yer mess he paused coulda jest been coincidence too or they coulda bin killt an then these others heard bout you lookin an figgered t pass on that th fust onesd got away an collect them some money at same time maybe nikolas replied then went silent well mags had done his best and if nikolas was going to brood about this there wasnt much he could do about it all things considered through if he were a ruthless killer who could not only send searchers on the proverbial wild hare hunt and make some money at the same time hed do just that that might have been why they decided to burn down the building with the bodies in it rather than just leaving them for someone to find having someone find the bodies of four people who were supposedly leaving the country at a brisk pace would certainly alert the authorities that there was someone else in town who not only had provided the misinformation but had probably done the murders in the first place these guardsmen fascinated him despite their grisly avocation obviously they expected to learn something from the things they were collecting but what he followed the bug collector up to the second story the air was much better up here he didnt even need his mintsoaked scarf there were plenty of lanterns up here as well which gave him a very good look at the two guardsmen who were left they looked remarkably alikenot as if they were from the same family exactly but as if they had been picked precisely to be unmemorable they both had hair and eyes of the same neutral brownish faces that were neither round nor square short nor long both were of middling height and weight neither had any distinguishing features rather like nikolas in a way although with nikolas a good deal of his ability to be invisible rested with his training it seemed that the fellow mags had been talking to wasnt just a bug collector when mags got there he was helping another man go through the dead folks belongings and not just sort through them but take them apart hems were opened on clothing linings torn out mattresses were cut open any object was picked up examined minutely for what why were they poking and prodding closing their eyes and running their fingertips over things the bugfellow opened his eyes to see mags staring at him perplexed he cracked a very slight smile secret compartments he said without waiting for mags to ask him the question and if you have mindspeech would you kindly tell nikolas that if he eats himself up over this i am going to drag him out of his bed later today and beat him senseless that seems to be the only thing that gets through his thick skull the other man uttered a smothered chuckle buthow mags asked howre ye lookin fer stuff thats sposed tbe hid well if we had found one i could show you but in general we look for something that seems to be solid or solidish but is a little too light thats why we are weighing these things in our hands we look for drawers or compartments that are too short we close our eyes and use our fingers hunting for concealed seams and test to see if what seem to be solid panels will actually move thus far i am sorry to say we have found nothing this place has been cleaned the second man said with an air of one pronouncing a judgment i dont think well find anything unless these lads thought they might be betrayed and hid something or the killers made a mistake i dont think either is likely that fire was cleverly and carefully set the room was sealed to keep the stink from getting out too much theres pitch all around the doors and windows and it would have set up around the front door once they closed and locked it they didnt need to break the seal to set the fire you said they came in the back way there would have been remains but nothing that could have been identified and anyone investigating would have seen four drunks in the front of the house and what was left of the table in the kitchen and figured a perfectly ordinary bunch of fools left a candle stuck to a table soaked in grease and were too drunk to notice when it set a fire i dont think anyone that thorough is likely to have been careless with his victims belongings me neither mags said glumly he explained moreorless what he had picked up from the killers and the second man nodded as if not surprised i dont know what we have here exactly he said closing his eyes and running his fingers over the back of a hairbrush spies ive seen before caught one or two killers for country or for hire ive seen though we usually dont intercept those the kings bodyguards do but i have not encountered anything like this the first lot that came inthe ones that i believe you and your friends uncovered magswere well trained to a point but most of them were gentlemen trained as spies not professional spies and they were just not prepared for valdemar it was bad enough when one of their number went mad but it got worse when that second madman popped up got no ideer where e come from mags said ruefully tis like mebbe when e was sposed tbe hangin bout th others but whatever made th fust mad sent im mad too an they didn know e was conkers till they got im tketch bear sos bear cd take carea th madun an then twas too late the second man shrugged thats as good an explanation as any well whoever sent them in the first place didnt make the same mistake twice they found out about valdemar they got people who could pass as natives and gave orders that the mess be cleaned up as thoroughly as possible he paused as he put the unlit lamp he had been examining aside after he had emptied it of oil so he could be sure there was nothing hidden in the bowl they planned they took their time they were absolutely methodical they might not have arrived with exact orders but with the discretion to do whatever had to be done i thinkno i am surethey knew they were going to kill these four within moments of talking to them and realizing what a hash theyd made of things they probably had been given contingency plans and a free rein when they leftwherever they came from but these four never saw it coming they thought they were passing the job on to a new team and that they could go home ask him how he knows that nikolas said instantly nikolas wants ter know how you knowed thet mags waited head tilted to one side watching the two guardsmen but i reckon tis thet he nodded at the empty pack that lay crumpled at the head of the bed you see said the first to the second thats what nikos been waiting for not just mindspeech not just someone clever and agile there are trainees by the dozen who have those qualifications hes been waiting for someone who can observe and think and not just assume things the second nodded youre right he told mags it was the empty pack and do you know why cause it dont blong there mags said pack shoulda been stowed prolly wi th others outa th way who needs packs iffen yer settled in iffen feller had it with im fer some reason like e were keepin somethin needful int itd be at foot of bed not th head or off t side mebbe i corner he thought of all the times hed been briefly in the rooms of other trainees all the packs hed seen always empty ones were stowed on a shelf that was awkward to get to anywhere out of the way always if they held something the owner wanted to keep in them they were at the foot of the bed where they wouldnt get kicked or tripped over never where that one was unless reckon e were packin up mags said thoughtfully mebbe him an tothers cooked up a big meal tgit rida stuff thatd spoil thets when th others done em after thet meal then they come up here an went through evthing jest tmake sure prolly where they got thet book an stuff they sold nikolas good said the second with satisfaction and that is why i am fairly certain they heard the weasel was making inquiries after they did this not before probably shortly after they would have made several passes through this place making sure that nothing was left behind if they hadnt heard that someone was asking about their victims they would simply have left this as a mysteryfour men dying after a big meal in this neighborhoodthe guard would have written it off as accidental maybe some of the food had gone bad maybe they picked the wrong mushrooms if we tested for poison we wouldnt have found anything no one would have been called on to investigate the men would have been buried in the poor grounds and that would have been that but then they heard that someone was snooping about and they realized they were going to have to clean up a bit more thoroughly than they had first thought because someone would be smart enough to put four dead bodies together with the fact that the weasel was looking for information so they planted the story that these men had left town and set the fire figuring it would take some time before the weasel found his buyer by that time the fire here would have destroyed all signs that there was anything other than four common laborers living here and no one would associate what the weasel wanted to know about with this place mags turned all that over in his head and nodded slowly that made plenty of good sound sense hope yer feelin unguilted he told nikolas i would if that were even a word nikolas retorted but he sounded more like himself and that pleased mags no end gods i am never getting the stench out of this uniform the first muttered toss it advised the second i cant think of any good way to get it clean its not as if they wont give us more it wont be the first time ive tossed a uniform that reeked of death swiftly mags put two and tow together youre not guard he said flatly well we wear the uniform we get paid by the quartermaster like everyone else the first man grinned at him dye work fer nikolas or tother way round mags was very interested to hear that answer lets just say we work for the same person and since you do too we probably ought to be polite and introduce ourselves im tal merrick this is kan betler the other three members of our team are jun lysle ref graden and serj karmas tal put his hand on his chest and made a little bow jest mags mags said bowing awkwardly got no other name we know said kan and waved a little hello dallen well how thoughtful dallen sounded surprised and pleased tender my greetings please dallen says lo mags smiled a little aight anythin i kin do not really kan told him takes a bit of training to do what we do to know what to look for we investigate any death in haven that doesnt seem straightforward sometimes we investigate when we are asked to do so by relatives rarely we go outside haven we work with nikolas a great deal because he has things we dont mindspeech mags said instantly an truth spell tal touched one finger to his nose and pointed the same finger at mags sharp one and he works with us because deaths that arent straightforward sometimes involve threats to the kingdom and the king if you arent going to die of boredom you might as well stay and watch kan continued going back to his methodical sifting of the foreigners belongings it will save us having to have the weasel arrested so we can talk to him and nikolas will appreciate that we are educating you thats only so they can get out of sharing some of the special brandy they keep down at their headquarters nikolas retorted i aint bored mags repliedand it was the truth he was anything but bored he watched carefully making note of what they did and did not do this was a skill worth having and now that the bodies were gone and the house was airing out it was becoming more tolerable to be here as expected they found nothing and finally at a point well after midnight the special guards packed up the things they wanted to take away and departed leaving mags alone in the house he climbed back up on the roof per nikolas instructionbut then something told him not to leave not just yet there was something tickling around the edges of his awareness a presenceno several for a moment he was afraid it might be the other assassins come back to make sure the house had burned as they had planned but as whoever it was neared cautious as a feral cat he knew immediately it wasnt them there were three they were young very young he sensed their hungervery physical hunger they might be young in age but in the way of poor children they were old in grief and experience they were creeping up on the house full of anticipation but as soon as they saw the doors and windows standing wide open they stopped in their tracks hidden in the alley their anticipation turned to despair mags crept across the roof to the point nearest where they were and strained his ears what have you got mags nikolas asked him urgently dunno yet mebbe somethin worth chasin kids but they was comin here fer a reason hoi came a whispered voice they done a runner there was a whimper we aint agonna git paid naow im hungry merrow shut it said a third voice mags identified it as belonging to the oldest of the three mebbe they done a runner but they left house open lessee what we kin find mebbe theys still stuff i there with infinite caution the three slipped up to the back door one skittered up to the door and peered inside aint nobody ere came the whisper pew stinks the youngest whimpered again this time sounding terrified and the whimper rose to a thin wail noooooo the child cried backing up from the door don go in there its death its death and despite the hunger that mags sensed gnawing at her belly the little girl fled the other two paused shes there was an audible gulp shes right ma smelt like this arfter a day the older one was indifferent so if theys dead they aint agonna need their stuff doors and winders open must mean guards been an gone an aint nobody else aroun well git first pickins gotta be somethin we kin use er sell the younger hung back what if theysghostes then them ghostes kin pay us the elder said defiantly we done what we was sposed to we kin take what they owes us outa their stuff the two figures slipped inside the house one boldly one reluctantly oho so them bastiches got thesselves some errandrunners eh an th new ones don know bout em or theyda tidied up the kids afore they bolted mags weighed the notion of confronting the childrenbut they might manage to elude him and run and even if he caught them theyd probably lie what to do he wanted to find out just what sort of errands these youngsters had been running it made perfect sense for the assassins to use children for almost anything that didnt require strength a hungry orphan would do just about anything no questions asked if you approached him right didnt frighten him made sure he thought he was getting the better of you i surely wouldve back at th mine and if you needed to be rid of them a couple of stray children would never be missed all right then the best thing to do would be to eavesdrop on them now follow them back to whatever place they called home and figure out exactly where that was if he tried to intercept them now theyd run after all they could tell by the stink that someone had died here anyone they encountered would likely be involved in a killing or be a rival looter better to approach them later when he could figure out how best to get at them without spooking them he slipped back inside the house and stayed well out of sight but not out of hearing one of the two found a candle and the means of lighting it and they carried it with them as they went from room to room once inside when they thought they were alone they were not exactly stealthy unfortunately he didnt learn very much from listening to them since most of their comments were restricted to evaluating how much they could carry away and what was likely to bring the most money if they sold it when they moved their search upstairs he pulled himself back up into the attic and listened from there adults might have been disappointed even angered by the lack of things of real valuewhat the guards hadnt taken he suspected that the pair of killers had carried awayor by the fact that garments had been ripped up and things taken apart but these little fellows were not dismayedand he certainly felt kinship with them when they discovered a pile of warm stockings and exclaimed in glee to find that not one had a hole in it he remembered a time when finding a stocking of any sort was cause for rejoicing eventually they staggered out laboring under the burden of two full packs apiece one carried on the back and one in the front with whatever else they thought salable tied on the outside it made them ungainly and ridiculously easy to follow and they were so concerned with their burdens that they were not paying any attention to their surroundings at all he was even able to follow them down on the ground ghosting along behind them near enough that he could still overhear their occasional mutterings but such disregard for their surroundings was not only to his advantage it also made them targets he spotted the thief about the same time that the thief spotted them a ragged youth in his teens he was lounging in a doorway near what mags figured was an ale shop when he saw the two children mags sensed his greed and glee as soon as he spotted the easy targets and knew then what the fellow was he was probably a little younger than mags but he was several years older and much taller and heavier than his potential victims in fact he was not at all unlike the flash of memory overcame mags for a moment mags sensed the cutpurse who was hiding in the alley ahead then sensed that the thief had spotted the assassin that mags called temper the surface thoughts of the thief desperation crossed with greed alarmed mags and he stopped bending over to fumble with a shoe while he tried to figure out what was going to happen and if he could do anything about it the wouldbe thief was a boy not a man a boy no older than he was a boy with a master to answer to and who so far today had nothing to bring back to him coming back meant a beating or worse and no supper the boy looked at temper with the eyes of a hunter and saw good clothing a man well fed with no obvious weapons that was enough the thief made his decision before mags could even think of something to try to stop him the boy was moving his was the cutandrun style rushing at the victim from under cover cutting the bands of the belt pouch and dashing off with it effective only when conditions favored a swift escape it was well suited to a night thief and to thefts where crowds thickened and thinned again hampering pursuit the boy thought he had such conditionsnight the alley and a half a dozen escape routes on the other side of the street he was wrong the man heard the running footsteps his instincts all came alive and an unholy glee came over him the rest was a blur to mags caught as he was between the thoughts of the cutpurse and the thoughts of temper temper threw off such violence that it rocked mags back on his heels but it was precise and calculated violence and an acute pleasure in what he was about to do that was very nearly pain in and of itself the man moved at the last minute the boys outstretched hands missed the tempting purse there was a moment of anger and bewilderment on the part of the thief as his hands closed on air then a flash of terrible pain and incredulity then nothing and in the street ahead all that anyone would have seen was the thief make a rush the man step aside and the thief falling to the ground as if he had stumbled except the thief didnt get up again temper passed on leaving the cooling body of the boy in the street it happened that quickly one moment the thief was alive the next dead mags shook off the unwelcome memory and this new thief faded back into the shadows and waited for the two laden boys to pass figuring to take them from behind burdened as they were they wouldnt be able to run or fight effectively mags swarmed up a drainpipe and got onto the roof he waited for the older boy to come out of the shadows and paced him while he followed the children making sure that they didnt have an adult protector anywhere about when the thief was positive they were alone he made his move that was when mags dropped down on him from above all that training at the hands of the weaponsmaster culminated in a move so perfectly executed that he thought his mentor would probably be beside himself with pleasure if he could have seen it mags managed to knock the boy cold without damaging him too much and do it so silently that the children up ahead of him were not even aware that anything had happened mags dragged the young thief into the shelter of an alley pulled him behind a pile of garbage and left him there bad luck tosser he thought as he resumed tailing the children mebbe thatll teach ye not trob kiddies the children staggered into what looked like an enormous abandoned building it was hard to tell in this light but part of it looked fallen in burned out perhaps i believe so dallen told him there was a building around about there a big building that held several apartments there was a fire there four or five years ago no one could sort out who it belonged to afterwardprobably the actual owner didnt want to come forward thinking hed be up on charges for letting it get into that state so its been abandoned and no one can do anything about it until an owner is found or the city confiscates it i suppose there are all manner of squatters in it now they plunged into the warren he followed only far enough to determine that their home was an intact part of a cellarand that the little girl who had fled was already there he left them then as the oldest of the boys sorted out some of the things that were likeliest to sell and hurried off with them to get some money and buy them all the food they had been promised as the reward forwhatever it was they had done for the assassins what are you thinking dallen asked curiously tryin tthink how tget at em he said briefly as he headed back to the weasels shop at a trot reckon ill sleep ont i dun think theyre gonna go anywhere soon it had been a very long night full of exertion and once he got back to the shop and nikolas congratulations he was yawning and starving he didnt say anything about the latter to nikolas after all he would be getting food soon enough if he could stay awake for it he managed to have a coherent conversation about the special guards with nikolas anyway once they got the companions and headed back up the hill it was quite enlightening evidently there were more suspicious deaths in haven over the course of a year than he had dreamed so the rule of thumb is figure out the motive and you generally find the killer if there is one nikolas was saying as they rode in through the back gate near the kirball field wisht we could figger out the motive of them twa new bastiches mags fretted an if theres moren two i caint blieve all they been sent fer was tclean up tothers mess i reckon theyre sposed t finish what tothers started an we still don know whut thet was i dun like it sir i dun like it one bit that makes two of us mags nikolas replied and sighed all right i need to report towhoever is awake at the moment it wont be the king probably the lord marshal then i need to write a report that the king will get as soon as he is awake theres nothing much that you can do lad so get yourself fed and get some sleep well be on this tomorrow dallen paused in response to mags unspoken command sir reckon thiss th time fer me t take a bit uv leave from classes nikolas pondered that for a moment it might just be he said slowly your gift isnt going to find these men from up here on the hill not without opening yourself far too much and endangering yourself you did that once already and we were lucky you didnt go mad the odds are not good that we will be lucky twice we might have to repeat what you did last timemoving through the city until you can sense them then narrowing down our search until we find where they are he gnawed his lip ill know better after i report to the kingbut yes be prepared we might be settling in for a long job an there goes any chancea seein amily fer a while he sighed yessir he said obediently thiss too important even wi her healin thing acomin up nikolas knowed it an es er pa an shell know it too shes er pas daughter after all chapter mags woke from a dream of the mine knowing exactly what he needed to do to get to those three children down in haven it pained himbut it was absolutely the surest fastest way they would never respond quickly enough to kindnessthat was what the dream had been about in the dream hed outgrown being allowed in the kitchen hed been just old enough to have been tossed in with the rest of the kiddies to learn the business of chipping out sparklies and one of the older boys had immediately latched onto him he had become the lads personal little slavey which was generally the norm with the very youngest of the children hed been bullied and hit and at the end of the day half his sparklies went to his master only later when the older boy had died of a fever had he figured out that he had been better off with him than without him maybe hed had his sparklies taken but he never went without foodthe older boy had always seen to it he had his bowl of soup and his slice of bread and never let anyone take it from him he might have been bullied but he had never had to fightthe older boy had protected him that was how he would approach these kiddies they likely thought they were safe from discovery in their little cellar he would ambush them there give them a good fright and tell them that they were working for him from now on a cuff or two would get them in line fast enough if hed had time he would have tried wooing them with kindness he didnt have the time maybe later he could make it up to them right now he had to get them cowed under his thumb and compliant enough that he could worm their recent activities out of them and in the process he would be able to protect them and see that they were adequately fed the combination of care and bullying should do the trick he explained it all to dallen as he washed and dressed the companion listened without interruption until he was done i dont like it dallen said slowly oh not the plan the plan is sound enough i just dont like that it puts you in the position of hurting those children even a little i can see why you think you have toi just dont like it no more do i he confessed but kin ye see another way no dallen admitted not an expedient one aight ill arsk their frgiveness later make it up to em mebbe thet lord somethin what took care a selna kin find em someplace good t go now i gotter find out what they was doin maybe it werent nothin but runnin tfetch stuff an they don even know what twas they was fetchin but mebbe it were somethin important fer us tknow either case i gotter find out instead of going straight to lunch he went to nikolas roomsand walked straight into a storm of tears nikolas nearly opened the door to his rooms in mags face they were both shocked nikolas that he was there and mags because nikolas hadnt sensed him before he opened the door but amily was wailing and amily never wailed her voice thick with tears and pitched high with frustration but why she sobbed why i cant tell you sweetness nikolas said in a tone of voice that suggested to mags he had used this very phrase several times now im sorry but i cant you can but you wont she wept thats not good enough i got myself all ready for this i cant bear dragging myself around any more i want to get it over with and i want to get it over with now what if something happens what if bears parents drag him off what if the other healers get tired of waiting about and get assigned somewhere else what if it never happens mags quickly deduced what was going on for some reason the complicated procedure to straighten amilys leg had been canceled and she was justifiably upset the more so because her father wasnt telling her why somehow something had changed and changed drastically between last night and this morning the king has already issued the order that bear is to stay here nikolas reminded her an edge of exasperation in his voice and the cancelation has nothing to do with bear they dont trust him she cried i trust him that ought to be good enough nikolas pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger amily he said sharply i have been over this with you a dozen times now we will fix your leg i dont know when but this is just a temporary delay you have to stop this youre going to make yourself sick as if you care she cried burying her face in her arms nikolas gave mags a look of frustration see if you can calm her down he said in the tone of someone who was quite at the end of his rope ill be back oh great how was he supposed to do that he closed the door behind himself quietly and crossed the room to where amily wept draped over the arm of a settle he sat down beside her he didnt know what to say so he opted to say nothing he just patted her shoulder now and again awkwardly finally she stopped crying and sat up and looked at him with eyes red and swollen i dont understand she said blotting her face with a handkerchief they just came and told me that they were putting off fixing my leg they wont give me a reason and they wont tell me when they will allow it they wont talk to me about it at all dont they understand how scared i am to do this dont they understand how hard it was to decide to go ahead why wont they just i dunno either mags said feeling utterly helpless thiss the fust i heard of t theres gotta be a reason i dunno mebbe they wanta give bear more time tget everbody all coordinated like mebbe foreseers figger theres gonna be a summer plague or somethin an theyre gonna need alla th healers mebbe well he could think of dozens of good reasons but not any that meant they wouldnt tell amily the reason why and there was a reason hed seen that in nikolass face in a brief flash of guilt when amily demanded the reason of him and hed said he couldnt tell her couldnt which meant he was under orders if he hadnt known the reason he would have said something to that effect what on earth could cause him to be under orders like that amily knew all of this as well as he did and if the answer had been it cant be done now because the foreseers think it will kill you yes she would be told that too the only thing he could think of was that it had something to do with the new spiesor assassinsthat he and nikolas had uncovered and that made absolutely no sense at all as mags was very well aware although the king would do so with tremendous regret and a guilt that stayed with him the rest of his life he would not hesitate to sacrifice anyone not even the daughter of the kings own for the greater good of valdemar and what difference could this procedure make to the safety of the kingdom anyway that was like saying the safety of valdemar depended on whether or not a particular orchard had fruit this year you can come up with maybes until you turn purple mags she cried passionately so can i im not a child dont i deserve to know what the real reason is reckon yer pa jest wants tpertect ye he said for truly what else could he say but i dont want to be protected now she flushed with a little anger which was goodat least she wasnt crying anymore all right i am going to be as afraid as anyone else if there is a good reason to be afraid but i can face whatever it is i can i dont need to be protected mags thought about how nikolas looked whenever he thought amily was going to be hurt even a little and the lengths he went to in order to keep that from happening and clamped his mouth shut look im certainsure it aint cause they don think they kin trust ye he said finally an i don think its cause they reckon yed ever do summat thetd cause a morta trouble but mebbe they aint telling ye cause if ye knowed yed do summat thatd bollix things all up wiout realizin ye was doin it he shook his head i jest dunnobut ill try an find out she dried her eyes some more i hate not knowing things she said fiercely father used to keep all sorts of secrets from me because he thought id be afraid or id fret too much about the danger to him and i fretted more because i didnt know what was going on he knows that he knows it better than anybody mags could see that ill jest see what i kin find out he pledged which was after all all that he could really do and they wont tell me bear fumed his anger underlaid with anxiety of course it was poor bearthe first thing he would think was that this delay was because everyone had realized that his father was right and it was the height of madness to have put him in charge of this project only no one would tell him that because they were all going to be polite about it then he would be certain that the truth was that they all knew and they were talking about him in pitying tones behind his back pitying or scornful bear had an active imagination his next leap would be that shortly his father would be sent for and he would go home and and he would never see lena again nor any of his friends hed become an animal healer dispensing herbs for sick sheep maybe his father would allow him to take a human as a patient so long as it was nothing seriousor was purely mechanical such as setting a bone or stitching someone up prior to the real healers doing their work look mags said desperate to hold off the inevitable cascade of andthentheylldothis has anybody said anythin bout this cept tis bein delayed nobut how dye know it aint some foreseer seein a summer plague i haven mags rubbed his temples getting amily calmed down had been hard enough getting bear calmed down was giving him a headache hellfire iffen there was onea those theyd be needin alla beds an evry hand bear gave him a look there hasnt been a plague in haven for over two hundred years then yer overdue mags retorted it dont haveta be a plague could be a fire he thought about what a disaster that fire the assassins had set could have been if there had been a wind hot dry big ol windstorm someuns lantern goes over whut happens then bad time thev someun laid up i middle uv a complisticated healin thats not even a word bear said crossly but he was listening at least so why not just tell me that cause foreseers got caught lookin stupid bout me mags replied mebbe causelook yer parta my crew so i kin tell ye theys a couple new lads from thet merry banda killers an they are whoa bettern the first lot quickly he told bear about the situation he and nikolas had unearthed as he had hoped it at least got bears attention and got his mind off his own troubles so whatf they seen this new lot doin somethin that hurt a buncha people so aye they tell head of heralds and head of healers and they find out nikolas knows bout em already but they aint agonna bandy this bout iffen it gits out peoplell panic start seein assassins evwhere next thing yknow theres people beatin up people on accounta they got a funny waya talking or they look furrin orwell you know people bear nodded slowly reluctantly but wouldnt nikolas tell you not iffen e was ordered not to es kept plentyuv things from me hellfire id wanta go tell master soren an my other friends down i haven an theyd wanta warn their friends and sooner or later someund slip by this time he was half convinced himself it made perfect logical sense i mean he continued les go ahead an get real crazy cause these fellers don know what kinda weather well get mebbe they caint count on the right sorta stuff to make a big fire an they know we got the foreseers what might see somethin an heralds thatd get roused up right quick iffen they ran round settin a lot of fires but mebbe they got a new kinda plague where they come from new tus mebbe an mebbe they know what spreads it so mebbe they come ere wi thet i baggage an are getting ready tturn it loose bear shuddered the anger in his expression fading being replaced y alarm i aint sayin tis thet mags hastened to add im jest sayin could be aight all right bear agreed but where does that leave me whered it leave ye afore ye got tapped fer amilys fixin mags countered well bear rubbed the back of his head ruefully keeping lena from feeling bad as much as i could and classes and doing my work with the healing kits i feel bad for putting some of that aside but i have the basic kit now and that part is out of my hands aight so figger steada runnin round tryin tbe three people ye got leave tjest be one fer a change mags punched his shoulder lightly wisht i cd say thsame mags dallen interrupted time to go nikolas has arranged that leave i gots t git he said feeling both a bit of thrill and a lot of apprehension and not to go to class bear said after a moment studying his face youre going to be down in haven all the time now mebbe mags shrugged dunno yet mebbe well move inter thet shop fer a while i dunno might could be een nikolas dunno jest know i gotta go now cause we gotta be down there long afore sunset tday i gotta start huntin fer this new lot bear gave him a long and measuring look these people almost killed you he said somberly three times they almost killed you and the ones that almost killed you you say werent as skilled as these new ones aye i figgered thet part out mags said dryly mightve been no bad notion thave some other gift aye too bad we don get tpick ida picked one thet made it so i had tbe treated like king hisself and what gift would that be bear asked dunno kingdoms luck thet a gift whatever im th one thet kin hear these lads so im the one gotta go he honestly wished it could be anyone but him right now or better yet that there were two of him bear made a face just don say be careful aye i aint goin inter this plannin on doing stupid shite mags gave him an evil stare it had the desired effect bear laughed a little point taken and i suppose you had best get on your way before nikolas gets annoyed with you go on illtry not to let my imagination get the better of me ill definitely keep lena sane and try to do the same for amily mags thought about advising him to door not doany number of things but in the endwould any of it do any good probably not ill let ye know when i kin whats what he said instead iffen ye see me tmorrow least yell know i aint fightin fer bedspace wi bugs down i haven and he had to leave it at that he met nikolas at the stable and knew immediately by the size of the packs that dallen and rolan were carrying that he would not be seeing his friends over lunchnot tomorrow and maybe not for a while a moment later nikolas confirmed his guess i cant say that i will be terribly unhappy at not having to deal with my daughter for a while the herald murmured as he tightened the girth on rolans saddle and made sure that everything was comfortable for the companion maybe by the time i am back up here shell have decided that i am not the worst father in the kingdom i mags tried to think of something to say and couldnt he finally just shrugged aint nothin i kin say sir iffen yer unner orders well an i reckon ye caint even tell me thet much an iffen ye caint tell me aye ye caint tell amily i don like it an she don like it an it aint fair though aint like wed tell anyun an anyun thet thinks we woulds daft nikolas just gave him an opaque look lets just say that events in the past have proved that foreseers sometimes interpret what they see incorrectly no one wants to chance that happening this time and leave it at that amily will get her leg mended as soon as can be managed and bear will be the one overseeing it i just cant tell you or her or him when that will be now let it go thats more than i should have told even you yessir mags replied and got into the saddle so any notion ow long well be livin oer yer shop attics like tbe mortal warm tsleep in i dunno might could wanta think bout sleepin elsewhere well actually be living in a squalid little basementor rather what was a squalid little basement before i smoked out all the vermin and made some improvements nikolas told him though he didnt look at all happy about this i couldnt do too much without exciting attention however so it will be rough i don think e as the least little idea of rough mags thought to himself but with more amusement than bitterness maybe it was a good thing that even nikolas forgot now and again just who he was talking too tis a basement be cooler than attic might could be cooler nor up ere dunno whut yer rooms like but mines been agetting warm there is that nicolas admitted and hoisted himself into the saddle as well so off we go to our grand adventure of sleeping in a cellar bathing in a bucket and eating dubious sausage and hoping it isnt so dubious that we need a healer afterward he shook his head and rolan echoed the gesture oh the grand and glamorous life of the kings own ive more than half a mind to kidnap marchand and show him what our work is like on an intimate basis maybe then he wouldnt be so cursed jealous of me he led the way out of the stableyard and onto the road jealous huh thet might splain a few things oh i wouldn do thet sir mags said aloud as they passed through the gate and moved down among the great houses fust time e felt a mouse run oer im i th night ed bloody scream so loud arf havend think we was stranglin a cat then there goes us bein all quietlike it would be worth it nikolas said fervently can you imagine his face oh aye mags chuckled huh mice caint say i like hevin m face run over i th night meself reckon we better git us a cat nikolas sighed yes im afraid so its been a while since i smoked the vermin out the bugs havent returned not even the black beetles in the cellar but there isnt much there to attract them mice are another matter and theyre probably back already ill help you find a good mouser dallen said aight mags said ill sort it nikolas cast a ghost of a smile his way i rather hoped you would heres the problem this cellar was really only meant as another escape route or a place to hide while someone searched the shop nikolas said aloud as he shoved the crate that mags usually sat on aside revealing a hatch es talkin out loud steada mindspeakin which prolly means he dont want me tchance getting a liddle bit of whatever tis e aint sposed t tell us cause e knows i kin git stuff that kinda spills over well if that was what nikolas wanted to do it wasnt as if mags had any grounds for objecting he thought about it carefully and decided that he didnt mind because nikolas knew that mags knew that nikolasmags caught himself before he started snickering hellfires aint like hes insultin me jest doing whut he was tol tdo furthermore mags had the oddest feeling that if nikolas thought for one moment that mags actually needed to know what was going on he would violate those orders and tell him so ill maket easy on im an not fuss i spect most shops round ere hev thet mags observed dispassionately or at least with a good imitation a cheerful indifference nikolas pulled up the hatch instead of the ladder mags expected there was a good solidnewlookingset of stairs nikolas handed him a lit lantern he went down first as a home it was pretty primitive there were a couple of straw mattresses stacked up against the wall with some bedding rolled tightly atop them and that was about it mags sniffed no mouse stink nothing but damp but he was glad he and dallen had acquired the new shop cat anyway if they started bringing food here in any quantity mice would follow the walls were extremely crude slatwall wood the floor was either hardpacked dirt or soft rock the tunnel leading out of one side was cut through the dirt but had been expertly shored up it was cool itll do mags pronounced nikolas looked vaguely relieved guess e fergits what i come from the only problem was the floor space was minimal not bad for one not so comfortable for two wheres tunnel go he asked shining the lantern in but not venturing down it too far the basement of the shop next door the empty one we bought it when we bought this one to keep it empty huh mags considered that a moment might could sleep oer there iffen ye don like sleepin down ere thet place got heavy shutters an bars over twinders aint nobuddy gonna see in tknow nikolas looked thunderstruck as if the idea simply hadnt occurred to him mags allowed himself a ghost of a smirk see i aint entirely useless if its cool enough nikolas replied i have no idea if that place is going to be a stifling hellhole or a reasonable space to use but i feel like an idiot for not thinking of that myself outa sight outa mind mags said philosophically so ye know them liddle uns i was follerin last night he continued instead of gloating i reckon ttake em over an find out what they was doin fer the dead fellers the kings own turned to look at him wearing a slight frown by take them overyou dont mean nikolas began hesitantly nay aint messin wi they heads but i aint got time tlure em neither i gotter git em under mthumb right quick iffen them others know bout em ye kin bet they aint gonna be breathin too long that too had occurred to him this morning i reckon ttake over thet ganguv theirs he quickly explained what he had in mind nikolas listened carefully reckon i kin hev mosta what they know in a couple nights then we figger what tdo wi em youre probably chasing nothing mags nikolas cautioned i very much doubt that those men were so stupid as to entrust a couple of children with anything important that might be true on the other hand mags knew firsthand that adults men especially tended to forget that children had minds and ears of their own they might have overheard something useful they might have deliberately eavesdropped and they might not even be aware that what they had heard was important but there was no point in bringing that up just now it would just sound as if he were trying to dig up specious reasons to go track those children down mags just shrugged dunno till i find out which i reckon tstart on tnight reckon i kin cast bout fer them new fellers while im bullyin the liddle uns nikolas wincedrather as dallen had done mags reflected that it was rather odd that they both felt so squeamish about frightening and intimidating a group of street urchins who were probably already criminals and yet were utterly matter of fact about other far nastier things maybe it was because nikolas was a father and saw his own child reflected in the eyes of every child if so e needs t get over thet not every child was innocent not every child was good mags knew that one firsthand always seeing a child as the innocent left you open to not seeing when the child was scheming to take you down it remained to be seen what these three wereinnocent halfinnocent or nasty little monsters although the fact that they had banded together and were loyal to each other was a mark in their favor i wont need you that i know of nikolas said you might as well go see what you can do about these children once we have a look at the other shop he looked sheepish i havent been there except to make sure all the exits were in order mags ran over what he knew of the shop next door in his mind if this shop was small the one next door was scarcely more than a hole in the wall it looked to him as if it had literally been built between two existing buildings and how the builders had gotten away with that he could not imagine nikolas led the way into the tunnel which was short and ended in a ladder while mags held the lantern nikolas climbed it and opened the hatch at the top mags passed up the lantern and followed the space he climbed up into was dusty narrow and absolutely emptyfrom inside it was clear that what he had taken for a shuttered window was actually a shuttered hatch in fact it looked exactly like a servinghatch there was no front door only the rear and another ladder to a hatch directly in the roof above there was nothing in this long narrow room but a single barrel the good thing was it was not nearly as warm in here as he had feared though it was stuffy it would make a decent place to sleep and there was a privy in the tiny patch of walled yard that this place and nikolass shop shared what was this place he asked alehouse nikolas said briefly or really more like an ale stall you brought your own tankard or pail bought the ale at the hatch either took it home or drank it standing at the front when the owner was prospering he probably also sold bits of things to eat meat pies sausage that sort of thing there are not a lot of these places anymore it was one thing when this was a busy street during the day and people would snatch a bite and a drink on the way to a job or on the way home from one but this part of the city stopped prospering and when you are poor you drink water or what you can brew out of what you can scavenge and you dont pay someone else to cook your food and in the rare good times you want to go somewhere that you can sit down to drink your ale there was just enough room for them to put their mattresses here without blocking the exit and this was probably better than the cellar where it was likely that theyd kick or step on each other a couple of times a night they spent a little time hauling their bedding over and setting up by then it was dark so nikolas opened the shop and mags went out over the roofs he didnt immediately seek out the children however they were secondary to the reason why he and nikolas were here after all he settled in the coolest spot he could find one with a bit of breeze and nothing digging into his backside he rested his back against a cold chimney and carefully opened his mind not a lot and slowly nearby thoughts brushed against his ordinary folks settling in for the night after a hard day of work for the most part nikolas shop notwithstanding most of the people in this neighborhood were pretty lawabiding theyd steal a little if they got the chance just as he and the minekiddies had stolen and for the same reasonnot out of greed or avarice but to eat to live but most of them wouldnt steal from a neighbor and most of them wouldnt do anything to harm another person who wasnt trying to harm them he didnt probe probing was wrong unless he had a compelling reason to do so he simply let surface thoughts brush past him there was a lot of anxiety about money some hunger pangs that drinking water wouldnt still restless children who had not worn out their energy at their jobs for everyone worked here exhausted parents who had come home exhausted and only wanted to stuff a crust into their children and themselves and sleep some bright spots of happinesssomeone had done well there had been a good meal a promise of prosperity a bit of luxury someone was in love someone was heartbroken both were not much older than he was many were a little drunk several were very drunk some were in pain physical or emotional a few were ill several someones werehe shied away from that particular activity a little embarrassed nothing was so terrible that it required his intervention or that he call for help via dallen it was noisier here than up at the collegium dallen had explained that as the existence of many old and new shields and the buffering efforts of the companions but nowhere was there that peculiar halfemptiness that marked the presence of the foreigners which didnt mean that they werent in haven it only meant that they were not within a block or so of where he was that was the problem the farther he reached the more mental voices started to press against him and the harder it became to lock them out now if he was talking to a single person or a few he could reach quite far indeed without danger but if he had to do something like this open his mind to every stray thought that passed by well that was a great deal more difficult partly since they werent mindspeakers it was more difficult to make sense of what they thought and their thoughts didnt have the force behind them that caused them to reach farther which was just as well since this was rather like being in a room full of people all talking at once he had to concentrate to sort out what anyone was saying the farther away he reached the noisier it became because it wasnt possible to block out the nearer folk while reaching for the farther such things had driven people mad in the past and they probably would again he was just fortunate that he had dallen the more he came to understand heralds and companions the more it became obvious that dallen helped him far more than most companions aided and taught their heralds he put up his shields again resting for a moment in the peace and silence that followed the incessant chatter you arent exactly the normal sort of person we choose dallen commented dryly as you already knew quit joggling melbow he chided with amusement i think i jest figgered out you got in an dumped a whole lotta learnin in mhead back when i was lettin ye keep me from havin fits when he had first been chosen he had understood nothing quite literally nothing he had been one short step up from a feral thing and if he had not accepted dallens offer to buffer him from the rest of the world and to simply supply him with exactly the information he most needed about his new lifewell he certainly wouldnt have done very well it was things you would have learned anyway if you had been chosen when most are instead of when you were ready dallen replied and anyway most of it was about the managing of your gift you had a great deal of information and a great many skills you needed to acquire in a very short time the consensus among the companions was why add the burden of learning how to handle your gift too when i am an expert in mindspeech and empathy you and i have a uniquely strong and open bond and i could just give you the benefit of what i knew directly so thets how come i never needed too much trainin in mgift he replied exactly so you didnt need attention from an outside teacher because you had the knowledge already dallen paused it was for your protection too what if youd had temper impinge on your mind when you first arrived here as it was we all had to work hard before we understood that there was a powerful outsider disrupting your thoughts and your sleep huh kinda seems like cheatin he waited for dallens answer it would be i suppose if we could do that with every chosen but we cant you a few of the monarchs owns of the past some of the heraldmages not vanyel interestingly enough it requires a peculiarly receptive and open mind and a point in time where everything comes together so that they are not only receptive but their minds are prepared to accept everything we give them without question dallen paused and now you think about this and his thoughts were already racing through the implications ye coulda just dumped in whateer ye wanted to he sensed dallen smiling yes like makin me think bout things a certain way makin up mmind for me pushin me tthink one things good nothers bad dallen seemed delighted yes ye didn actually he was delighted too there it was proof that he was still his own person tempting especially when you were wallowing in a swamp of delusions of inadequacy but no you hadhaveto remain you mags all i ever did was give you very very rapid training so that you didnt go insane as your gift blossomed and at any rate the time when i could do that so freely is passed i can still teach you things if i have to but never with that freedom and ease he sensed mixed feelings now both pride and a little regret he decided to blunt the regret with a joke huh well hellfire i was hopin ye could git me through them courty graces horsecrap wiout hevin t strain mskull perhaps we can work on your speech came the sarcastic reply mags smiled even broader my dear old companion he said his mental voice reflecting letterperfect diction and grammar i fear i must disagree with you what you are taking for ignorance is part of the persona of the thickasabrick gamesplayer that nikolas wishes me to cultivate the less cultured i sound the more people underestimate me he paused eyes still closed grinning at the mental silence tis also hardern hell he admitted an it dont seem like me if ye take mmeanin what about those words you make up dallen finally asked its on accounta im a bonehead an dont allus member what th right word is so i comes close as i kin that comment nettled him a little he really did try after all people figger it out i suppose they do dallen sighed all right i dont think that our quarry is anywhere around you and at the moment we have no real direction to go in other than that you sensed they still had a job to do here and were not going to leave until it was done i am going to try to put my thoughts together and think in what part of the city they might be you pursue those little thieves not thieves so much mags corrected him opening his eyes and starting to stretch to get all the kinks out the bastiches owed em an not like they was gonna get paid point taken mags stood up careful to remain in the shadow of the chimney how you plan to try and figger out where them new bastiches is he paused we need a name fer em think ont wouldja all right dallen sighed this is the part of the job i never really enjoyed im going to do something thateventuallyyou are going to be able to do as well as i can its just not very pleasant in this case and you dont have the experience that i do to do it yet there was a pause i am going to attempt to put myself inside their skins and think as they do mags froze he was getting better at thinking because the implications of what dallen had just said were all racing through his mind thas ugly yes thas kinda how i figgered out how tget tthem kiddies its exactly how an how i handle bear an lena an amily i could not yet you have the raw talent the reasoning ability you just dont have the experience you will and when that day comes he waited finally dallen finished the thought when that day comes i will be both proud and terribly terribly sad he let that roll over in his mind a moment sad cause when i know how the baddest of bad people think when i kin think like they do i aint ever gonna be completely happy or comfortable or secure said dallen sadly that not ever again yes said the creature closest to him in the whole world and you can decide you dont want that why would i he said somberly someuns gotta hellfires mights well be me i got you tkeep me from goin crazy eh he blinked as a moment of epiphany came upon him hell fires thet is the kinda herald im agonna be not th runnin about country not th tellina laws notall the rest oft this this is gonna be mjob and that o my chosen is why i chose you chapter mags lurked outside the abandoned building and waited for his quarry to return he had already scouted his way in and had already trapped all their clever little exits well they were clever if you were a little child not so clever if you were an adult and a predator he wished he had more time he didnt want to do things this way but in the long run hed have done them a favor tal and the other men in that special unit of the guard agreed the first adult that wanted to put any effort into taking them would have them just as he would have them the bunnies would not be escaping this warren he even knew where they were at a ragandbone seller someone who would accept the clothing that had been unceremoniously ripped apart by the guard he knew what they planned to dosell enough to buy a meal and eat it on the spot because it wasnt safe to have food here now that it was summer more gleaning of their surface thoughts proved that they had learned summer could be as perilous a time as winter theyd learned that they couldnt hoard food in warm weather the hard way twice once by getting sick on food that had spoiled and once by being swarmed in the night by mice and rats it was safe to store what theyd gleaned from the agents houseand although they had gleaned what they had thought was the best the boys had gone back to the house again and again until they and the rest of the neighborhood looters had picked it clean in one way they were right to feel relatively safe the part of the cellar theyd claimed as their own was very difficult to get into if you were adultsized and it was hard to work your way through the halfcollapsed walls to get there you had to know exactly where you were going or you ran into dead ends an adult determined to trap them would probably do one of two things either catch them as they went in or came out or set fire to the whole cellar clearing the way they werent thinking of that of course to their minds it would be impossible for anyone to know they were in there in the first place of course they had not come up against someone like mags small agile trained he would have been able to pull this off even without mindspeech with it this was not so much a challenge as a chore to be gotten over with he was not looking forward to what he was about to do to them these children werent goodbut they werent bad either they would steal anything they thought they could take but they were also living on the edge of survival and what they stole meant the difference between living and dying they had no love and no loyalty to anyone or anything outside their own little family but they had no hatred for anyone else either except the brief bright hatred that burned when someone cheated them or robbed thembecause being cheated or robbed meant an empty belly he certainly understood them they differed from the mags of the mine in only one way up until last winter theyd had a mother she might not have been a good mother but she fed them before she fed herself and she gave as many kisses as cuffs that counted for a great deal down here as he had learned when he was here as a blind beggar haven wasnt perfect even as valdemar wasnt perfect there were places these children could have gone for help but they either didnt know about them or didnt trust them that was true of a lot of the sad stories down here and if everyone who needed help came for it would the help run out the places that distributed food as charity often did shelters frequently had to shut their doors in bad weather because there literally was no longer room inside to move how wouldhow hadthree small children who could not even hold their places in line fare when your options were steal or starve you couldnt exactly call those options but right now mags needed to focus there were plenty of hiding places around the remains of the basement that gave him a clear view of where the children would come in it was dark but not completely and the children would probably have a rushlight with them even they couldnt thread their maze at night without some kind of light so mags crouched in a space where two tottering wall fragments had met a space where it was unlikely hed be seen in the dim illumination of a rushlight mags waited hunched down and resting patient every so often allowing his shields to drop a little so he could look for those agents that was what dallen had decided to call them and it was just as good as any other name to mags he got no brushes of that nowfamiliar feeling of the shieldsurrogate they wore but as the moments became candlemarks he finally did sense the children approaching he froze in place they didnt seem particularly sensitive but there was no point in taking chances if they guessed he was going to ambush them theyd bolt and it would take days for him to track them down again they werent talking today but he sensed the sleepy content in all three of them that came from a full belly good that was exactly what he wanted he needed them to be off guard and unready if there had been a real predator hunting them now theyd be tied up in sacks before they even reached the entrance to their maze they wormed their way into their shelter thinking of nothing but the comfortable pallets theyd made out of the bedding that the guards had taken apart he followed behind them silent as a snake they started whispering to each other now feeling completely secure and in their minds why shouldnt they so far no one had found them in hereexcept the mice the rats and the bugs and even if someone did there were three ways of escape besides the way in mags felt them letting their guards down further there was even a better source of light than a single rushlight in their shelter as he had discovered to his amazement you couldnt see it until you were in their hidden corner but theyd managed to create a little fireplace and there was still plenty of wood in this building to scavenge it was how they had survived the winter that was going to work in his favor even though he felt a sickening guilt for what he was about to do to them they had reached their home and were settling down on the beds he heard them talking not bothering to whisper they were making plans on where to take some of the ruined boots and shoes tomorrow not the same ragandbone man that they had just sold things to they were smart enough not to make anyone think that they might have more loot cached he listened with his ears and his mind pausing just inside the last twist of the path while they bickered the eldest wanted to go quite some distance away the girl whined that it was too far he waited until they were fully engaged in their little argument then slipped into the room shet it he shouted before they even realized there was someone else with them three pairs of startled eyes met his yell be takin it where i tell ye he growled contorting his face into a snarl they froze but only for a moment the girl moved first with a highpitched shriek of terror that nearly split his head in two she dashed for one of their exits and she screamed again when she found it blocked well actually it was more than merely blocked mags knew tunnels and tunneling and it had not taken him long to find the way to collapse the rubble so that the exits had literally vanished the little girl didnt know what to do she only stood there and screamed in terror the two boys rushed him he backhanded the younger into the pile of bedding taking care to throw him rather than hit him and grabbed the elder by the throat pulling him close so the boy could see his face therell be nonea thet he growled and used his free hand to pinch the boys mouth shut when he squirmed and tried to bite nor thet ye demonspawn yer mine sooner ye decide thets th way its gonna be th less ill heveta beatcha now the girl and the other boy swarmed him it was brave but pathetic he felt sick inside as he deliberately terrorized them this was a horrible thing to do to anyone this was what had been done to him cept the blows an the beatins were real and meant thurt he tried to remind himself but the rationalization felt hollow he did the best he could to turn what looked like blows into deflections always sending them tumbling to keep from hurting them too much but it was almost a candlemark later when the three of them finally stopped fighting or trying to escape and huddled together on the pile of bedding cowed and terrified he looked them over the two boys moved to protect their sister good that was the control he needed he reached for the sobbing girlchild slapping the other two out of the way and before she knew what was happening hed snapped a collar and leash on her now he said squatting down on his heels to glare at the three of them thiss how its agonna be ye do what i say ye do evthin i say yer my gang now an iffen ye don do what i say he pulled abruptly on the leash when the child was offbalance and the little girl sprawled onto the floor then this bit has somepun appen to er he let his lips curve in a lazy smile while inside he cringed and felt so sick it was all he could do not to throw up now i dunno what that somepunll be itll dpend on where we is an what ye was sposed t be doin fer me mebbe she don get no supper mebbe she gotta sleep idirt mebbe i fin someun then likes liddle wenches they were old enough to know exactly what he meant and all three of them froze in terror so he said blandly yer gonna do what yer tol an right now thets tcome alonga me with the little girl crawling on hands and knees ahead of him and the boys now thoroughly cowed trailing behind they emerged from the ruin wherere we goin the eldest quavered when the younger boy crawled out and stood up shet it he snarled yell see soon nough there were a number of places he could have taken them including the shop but he knew that nikolas would never tolerate how he was going to handle these children if it had been an adultgiven what they needed to know nikolas would have terrorized them himself but not a child so for now he had a different goal in mind the same house where the agents had killed their predecessors the little girl began to fight and utter a thin high wail when she saw the place he grabbed her by the back of the neck and shook her a little i said shet it bububu she blubbered theystheys ghghgh aint no ghosts he scoffed i been squattin ere an they aint no ghostes so shet it before he had gone stalking the children he had prepared his squat thanks to tal and his squad tal had been far more pragmatic about the plan than he had been look youre going to scare them well theyre scared that much most of the time and if theyre not they should be when it comes right down to it unless you do this theyve got three futures they die of privation they die by someones hand ormaybethey survive like you survived in the mines reckon up the odds for yourself there was a good sound cellar here one with only one door in and no windows it was perfect for his purposes he had already gotten the keys to the place from the guardanyone coming around now was going to have a rude awakening to find the place locked as tight as it had been open before the turning of the key in the lock caused a thunder of deep barks to erupt on the other side the little girl would have screamed if he hadnt had a precautionary hand at her throat instead she shook where she stood down dammit he growled reinforcing the command with a mental one the doga huge fawncolored mastiff whose name really was dammit dropped to the ground he shoved all three of the children inside and locked the door you he barked pointing at the younger boy kitchen git th food onna table now the boy scuttled off and returned with the old splintery basket full of broken meat pies and burned sausages and greasesoaked loaf ends mags had bought from a vendor mags pulled open the hatch to the cellar and gestured roughly there was a lamp burning down there the two boys went down the stairs followed by mags followed by the girl on the end of her leash when they got to the bottom of the stairs mags whistled and the dog came down in a rush there were three pallets down here a couple of empty buckets and one full of clean water there were also iron rings in the wall over the pallets mags hauled the girl over to the pallets and shoved her down on one then tied her leash to the iron ring above her guard he told dammitwho had been borrowed from tal an exceptionally welltrained animal he would no more harm these children than fly but they didnt know that and he would guard them nothing would get past him dammit whined his thick tail thwacking the dirt floor mags turned to the children ye got food an water an bed he snarled use em tmorrow yer gonna work then he thumped his way up the stairs slamming the cellar door closed shooting the bolt home now he had them it was just a matter ofnot breaking them but bending them and he felt so sickened by all he was going to have to do that he could not wait for it to be over the next three days were exhausting for the children without letting them know what exactly they were doing he had the boys running all over the city carrying meaningless messages until they could barely stagger while the girl was put to such simple household tasks as her strength would manage he had a plan and he figured it was a good one on the night of the third day the guard stormed the house his guard of course mags escaped tal was in the lead and took charge of the children immediately and the little ones who would have run like rabbits at the sight of a blue uniform three days ago literally flung themselves at him they were so grateful for rescue that once the questions started they couldnt stop babblingeven though most of the time neither they nor tal had any idea of what they were actually talking about but mags who was in the next room listening to the thoughts that spilled out like gravel from an overturned bucket found himself practically struck dumb he didnt believe it at first the overheard words as the three waited for their rewards night after night our men on the hill he was certain they could not have heard it correctlyor the assassins had meant something else entirely but no there was another memory sparked into life by one of tals gentle questions and another and anothernone of them saying directly that the plants were in the palace the collegia or bothbut the code words couldnt possibly mean anything else that was insane not possible everyone was vouched for how could he sat there thunderstruck even dallen was speechless time and time again these three children had been sent to pick up messages that came from our men on the hill or take messages to them never directly of course they came via message drops places where a message could be hidden until someone who knew it was there came to collect it thanks to the memories mags had the locations of these drops of course but there was no use going to them nowwith the original agents dead they wouldnt be in use the new agents would have established a new set of dropsand they wouldnt be so lazy as to send halfferal children to fetch the messages for them either this is insane dallen said finally tell me bout it mags retorted feeling as if the floor had dropped away beneath him at least he could count on dallen to relay all this because right now it felt as if he were so rattled he couldnt move and thenhe was metaphorically knocked halfway across the room the door to the little room next to the one in which tal was questioning the children opened but it wasnt one of the guard that was standing there it was nikolas time to go mags the kings own said tense but quietly were leaving ye heard mags blurted ye heard right dallen relayed aye ye i heard so did the king andwell most of the circle we all heard and we all agree its impossible mags stared at him surely nikolas had not just said were going mags this is a dead end well find another way to track down these agents but this isnt working nikolass face was a mask unreadable maybe you somehow infected those children with somefantasy of what you thought was happening maybe this is coming from some other source than the children maybe they are hallucinating i dont know i only know that what they are showing you is impossible and weve been told to pack up and come back its over but its over he clamped his mouth shut on any further words he listened silently while nikolas gave directions about the disposition of the childrenbeing sent off to a home for orphans somewhere outside haven he gathered he hoped theyd be happy he was laden with sorrow and guilt for what he had done to themhed terrified them completely and they might never get over itbut at least they were still alive if the agents had gotten hold of them they wouldnt be he could scarcely believe that nikolas of all people was dismissing what he had heard from these children nikolas knew very well he hadnt somehow infected them it didnt work that way dammit i know it dont work thet way he had not projected so much as a stray foodthought at those children there was no way that he could have influenced them he turned his mind to nikolas but was met with an absolute rock hard barrier finally he let out his breath in a sigh as nikolas stood there with his arms crossed over his chest waiting aight he said feeling bitterness so profound he could taste it its over les get back he lay on his back in his bed staring at the ceiling he hadnt had anything like an appetite when they got back hed had a hot bath and gone straight to bed nikolas he could scarcely describe what nikolas was being like it wasnt as if nikolas were angry at him not even for putting those kids through a pretty bad experience and it wasnt as if nikolas were blaming him for anything no it was as if nikolas wasnt even there as if something had pulled every bit of his mentors attention away so completely that there was nothing to spare for mags as if there was nothing that mags could possibly say or do that would contribute in any meaningful way when nikolas was being so totally uncommunicative dismissed that was the word mags had been dismissed did i fail he wondered bleakly hev i so messed up thet there aint no possible way i kin get back t th way everthin was but he hadnt influenced those children he knew he hadnt why would he ever even think even in his most fearful fantasy that the agents had people planted here but but if not what could the explanation possibly be ist me i mean it was me listn t their thinkin mebbe it werent them thinkin it but me thinkin it was them thinkin it now his head was splitting trying to second and thirdguess himself im not any happier about this dallen said fretfully startling him i trained you i gave you my training and it is the best ill stand by it i cannot imagine any way that you could either have misinterpreted the children or influenced them then what he replied in anguish how how kin it be true an nottrue he pressed the heels of his hands into his temples and tried to think it was temptingso temptingto just give in on this one he wasnt in disgrace no one blamed him for anything and certainly no one suspected him of trying to make trouble and no one was accusing him now of being some foreign agent himself when he opened himself to the stray thoughts up here there was none of that suspicion and accusation there had been before although there was a lot of heavy shielding going on that was new it was harder to shield emotions though and he wasnt getting any animosity under all the shields think it aint th end uv th world it was like hed told bear what did he have before all this started he was still a herald trainee he had his classes he had lena and bear and amily he had the kirball team he had kirball itself and he had plenty of things he was good at he could just let things be things after all he was only a trainee he wasnt supposed to be able to do the same things as a herald he didnt have the experience he didnt have the knowledge wouldnt it just be smarter to let it all go and let other people deal with it of course it would he sighed problem is i aint very smart and i aint gonna let it go after a long and restless night he still found himself with no appetite at all and since the dean had not given him his new class scheduleonly the third one this quarterhe found himself feeling a little sick very headachey still wracked with guilt over what he had put those children through and with nothing to do he stared at the ceiling as the light in his room grew he felt the breeze die and the air become heavier with heat well he might have nothing to do but that just meant he could go see someone who could at least do something about the headache he got up washed under the pumpthe water was lukewarmand got dressed in a fresh set of grays the headache wasnt any better in fact it was a little bit worse he did not expect to see bear on the path approaching him as he left the stable however bear looked as if he had spent a similarly unhappy night mags looked him up and down for a moment taking note of the darkcircled eyes the pinched look to his face iffen i look like you you do bear said abruptly lenas coming here in a bit shes not doing real good either he sighed he had hoped that at least one of them was managing to get along without problems faint hope evidently whats wrong wi lena he asked bear rolled his eyes theres a rumor something someone says someone they know heard someone they know say marchand said he looked as if he had bitten something sour i hate gossips i really really hate loathe and despise gossips what this time mags irritation with bard marchand rose sometimes it seemed as if every problem lena had could just be solved if bard marchand would get hit by a runaway cart bear looked away and flushed a little marchand thinks he may not be lenas father mags felt his mouth dropping open e akchully said thet wi is own mouth bear waved a hand in irritation i dont know all i know is the rumor started and lena is taking it predictably one moment shes crying because shes a bastard the next shes sure everyone is looking down on her and the next shes thinking about leaving the collegium because shes here under false pretenses mags shook his head violently now thet is plain stupid itd be false pretenses iffen she was pretendin she ad th gift an didntit aint yer name that gets ye in its what ye got i know i know and we all managed to make her see sense on that one but shes still all in knot over this bears jaw tensed and i havent heard anything back on the field trials of the first lot of the healing kits i mean nothing its summer people get hurt in summer people get sick from bad food people eat the wrong mushrooms people fall out of trees chop off their own handsyoud think by now id be getting reports back but nothing he sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger i keep thinking i was wrong mfather was right people are too stupid to be trusted with something like that what if the reason i havent heard anything is because people are killing themselves with it what if theyre killing other people with it what if what if you share some of that headache medicine you promised to give me if i got out of bed lena asked coming around the side of the stable and looking every bit as miserable as the two of them you are the cruelest person in the entire world bear maybe bear retorted but you arent crying and youre out in the sun which is stinkin hot an we all have wuss headaches an prolly none of us et mags interrupted how bout we take thet medicine an all go someplace cool an play my life is miserabler than yours i could do that lena said snatching one of the potion bottles from bear and downing it on the spot i know jest th place said mags doing the same les go bear swallowed the last bottleful and left the empties on the side of a stall as he and lena followed mags miserabler mags heard bear say to lena is that even a word chapter there was no one in the grotto and it was blessedly blessedly cool in there they all flung themselves down on the mosslena with a sigh bear with a grunt and mags utterly silent it felt good to lie on the cool soft moss the three of them forming a sort of triskele with their heads in the middle not quite touching for a while they all just lay there waiting for the headache potion to take effect when his headache finally began to ebb mags was able to feel all the muscles that had been tensed up making it worse one by one he coaxed them to relax keeping his mind blank and thinking of nothing else just staring at the artificially irregular rock of the ceiling he wondered how this grotto had been made and who had made it whoever hadwell mags was grateful and he was equally grateful that no one from the palace was down here when they had arrived well bear said into the silence you first mags what happened nothin good mags sighed but slowly picking his words carefully he related everything that had happened from the time that he and nikolas had taken up residence to the moment when nikolas told him that they were leaving he hid nothing not what he had done to those poor children nor what nikolas had said huh bear said well you probably should have gone for the long way with those younglings at least then you wouldnt be feeling all guilty now and youd know that no wait thats not true either whats not true lena asked even ifin fact especially if mags had spent days getting those littleuns to trust him then bringing them to the guard for protection everyone could still say hed somehow influenced them and they would have and mags youd have even less reason to trust your training bear made a rude noise which is stupid given what dallen told you companions are better mindspeakers than any human or almost any youre sure you didnt somehow taint those younglings dallen is sure his voice trailed off but mags knew better than to interrupt bear when he did that something had just occurred to bear and he had to think it through before he said it out loud i have to wonder if nikolas isnt just as sure that you didnt influence the littleuns as you are andand everyone else agrees with him but they dont dare tell you thats why they pulled you out so fastsomething is going on that this just fitted into and they cant tell you outright and they hope you never find out and thats why all the people in the know are shielded so tightly they believe you they dont want anything to get out while they try to figure out who it is mags sat up and stared at bear who was still on his back with his hands behind his head looking up at the rock arch of the grotto but thas impossible he objected nothings impossible bear retorted improbable maybe but the second you assume something is impossible you pretty much open a door for it to come in and happen because you wont be guarding against it theres a lot of people up here mags lena pointed out a lot i know everyone is supposed to be vouched for but what does that mean really just take the courtiers and the guard for instance somebodys uncle who knows their family told the people up here he was reliable and thats all there is to it same for the servants certainly most of them are from families that have served the crown or the highborn for decades if not centuries but families die out and someone has to replace them thats just the palace servants some of the highborn who have palace apartments instead of their own manors bring their own servants the hill operates on trust if you shake that you upset a lot of people do you want to put everyone up here through a truth spell to prove they are loyal no mags retorted revolted at the idea lena was right the hill did operate on trust heralds get a pass because of the companions but there are two more collegia remember if you want an example of someone whos up here all the time and would probably fall right into someones hands and babble everything he heard to them if he thought it would get him more adulation you dont have to look any farther than bard marchand bear continued with more than an edge of bitterness to his voice im not saying that hed work hand in hand with these agents of yours not if he knewbut if he thinks theyre just incredibly wealthy and could make him more popular or something and he thought they were just trying to get a little more influence in the court hed tell them anything he heard and probably help them get on the grounds of the palace as a bonus or take that new protege of his wheres he from we dont know how old is he really we dont know that either he could be like you mags undersized and be a lot older than he looks any trainee could except the heralds lena replied and besides the two collegia and the servants therere all the courtiers who are always bringing in poor relations trying to get them advantageous marriages or crown appointments for that matter lets be really afraid and consider that someone might have murdered a new guard on his way to take a post at the palace and taken his place its not as impossible as it seems mags scratched his head and lay back down reckon not he said slowly an thet business bout a guard not so crazy neither iffen i was ttry an git in reckon thas a pretty good way guard uniform lets ye inter anyplace on th hill you know what else i think lena said i think the reason nikolas went all rockfaced on you and you both came back is that what you told him ties right into why they canceled the healing on amilys leg i dont think he would have reacted so strongly otherwise mags opened his mouthand shut it without saying anything it was an unlikely theorybut so was the notion that there were enemy agents or spies somewhere in the palace or the collegia and it certainly would explain nikolas stiff attitude huh was all he said i am not gonna tell you to leave it alone mags bear said while he thought about that little tidbit but i dont think youre gonna get anything out of nikolas or another other herald rolan certainly hasnt been forthcoming dallen put in which when you think about it is interesting its very difficult even for us to lie mind to mindwhich argues that he is refusing to talk about it because i will certainly know there is something not quite right about a denial ive been thinking about other things too lena said after another long silence i think were getting nowhere trying to sort out our own problems you know proving that bear is as good or better than any other healer proving that my father is wrong about me and finding your enemy agents i think maybe we should trade problems just hows that sposed t work mags asked dubiously well look i have a lot of chances to go just about anywhere up here on the hill that i want to lena pointed out even trainees are welcome anywhere they want to go i know youve been training in how to be sneaky but ive been training in how to be welcome i can literally look everywhere up here for those agents whats more her voice hardened whats more i can make people trust me wait what bear asked startled you know my fbard marchand uses projective empathy they say i have it too i just didnt want to to be so manipulative so i havent gotten much past the most basic use of it in case i have to use it some day to control a crowd in an emergency she lost some of the hard edge to her voice so if i really start training in it and use it to make people trust me the way he does i can find out a lot an ye prove ye gots th exact same giftss marchand too aye i see where thiss goin but he didnt object on the contrary this was one of the better ideas hed heard and using projective empathy for a purpose like this not only was it ethical it was probably something that everyone in the know was wishing marchand would get off his behind and do himself ye know what mags said after a moment might could be i kin find out whats goin with yer healin kits and mebbe find out why amilys healin got canceled too you arent bear began not a bit mags replied theyre expectin me t snoop an listen wi mgift well im still gonna when i git a chance tgo down inter haven but i bet they find reasons tkeep me up ere an i aint gonna use mgift fer that up ere im gonna go lookin at comins and goins and records gonna chat wi guards dependin on what i find out might could tell me ifn someun makes a lotta liddle trips down inter haven thesselves that nobody else does gonna watch whos watchin important thinswho gits thesselves duty sos they kin be at particlar place an i reckon whoever this is they aint all doin th same thing so whos meetin up on the sly wi sommun odd bear was very quiet well i had a notion theres a city healer who belongs to one of those charitable orders that came up to talk to me about the kits and hes asked me a couple times if ill come down a few days a fortnight and work with him down there theres a lot more people whod trust a potion than a healer down there now i could do that and people talk when theyre getting helped heck they babble sometimes i could have you come along as my helper mags and you could aye could do mags said seeing immediately where he was going yer right people they sorta rain bitsa thinkin when theyre hurtin he perked up at the thought now thet theres a fine notion bear anye know what ye do thet yer gonna show evbody i th whole damn healers circle thet yer gonna shove right up an do th dirty work not jest the stuff where yer fiddlin wi yer plants an all an niver touch a real human patient he heard the life come back into bears voice aye ill show i not only can accept responsibility im willing to take it on my own and ill prove im my fathers daughter but without being so selfcentered lena said firmly an an ill show i kin figger stuff out wi jest usin mhead an dallen mags said thank you for that yer welcome yer half mbrains anyway only half dallen teased ah hush slowly mags felt his stomach unknotting and the tension behind his eyes easing it felt good to have a plan again and better to have one that didnt involve torturing children he felt his eyes starting to drift closed and became aware of something else bear and lena they were probably unaware of it themselves but now that they had something they could actually do about their situations they would be a great deal happier if he was elsewhere at the moment mags was always careful to screen out stray thoughts around these two but nevertheless a great deal of feeling swirled around them and im agonna find amily an tell er whats goin on he said trying to keep it from sounding abrupt as he sat up reckon she needs ter know right off aight oh damn i cant believe i forgot about amily bear exclaimed definitely she can use some good news shes kind of gotten over being mad at her pa but shes not happy he got to his feet mebbe i kin change thet he said with a smile he started to leave the grotto but then turned back a moment he caught bear just reaching for lenas hand and suppressed a grin at bears flush lenaye mind what yer dean said aight she looked confused what my dean said bout playin reckon tday ye kin skip class fer once or at least fer a liddle without waiting for their answer he strode off he regretted the brisk stride within a few steps as the heat hit him like a hammer and the headache threatened a return im agonna cheat dallen wheres amily it had occurred to him that dallen seemed to be able to locate amily just fine even though she was not a herald and dallen did not challenge this observation well thats interesting the companion said after a moment what is ill have to show you following dallens mental instructions mags found himself going into the palace which was not a surprise since nikolas and amily had their rooms in the heralds wing therebut then following further instructions he went down a halfhidden set of stairs he never even knew were there into what must have been a basement and from those stairs down a long dimand blessedly coolcorridor there were several doors leading from it the place had a definite feeling of age and was plain without being shabby he stopped where dallen indicated and tapped lightly on the solid oak door there its mags he called softly kin i come in mags the door muffled amilys voice but the surprise in it was clear yes of course i wasnt expecting anyone down here he opened the door to a room scarcely larger than a closet round and with a round table in the center it was lit by one lantern heavily shaded suspended from the ceiling above the exact center of the table beneath it resting on a padded base was a sphere of crystal the table itself was surrounded by padded benches with backs to them as the door closed behind him the dead feeling to the room showed that it was so wellinsulated against outside noise that a small riot could probably take place outside the door without the occupants of the room being aware of it amily was sitting on one of the benches and it seemed she must have been staring into the sphere what what is this place amily asked its a workroom for doing things at a great distance its one of the most shielded rooms on the hill and the shields are tremendously old its said vanyel made this place though no one remembers how or why were right underneath the royal suite in fact i was gonna ask whatre ye doin down ere all alone he said with a half smile just thinking i suppose she replied as he sat down beside her it seems easier to stay calm down here and it doesnt hurt that its cooler than upstairs aye tthet her hand lay quietly on the table he considered it then put his over it this seemed as good a time as any to ask her about something that had been on his mind for a good long time yknow yer pa started up this thin tween us tgi me a reason fer hangin about we were friends an all an thet was fine but now evbody seems tfigger were courtin even yer pa nobody seems thev asked you how ye feel bout thet an nobody seems thev asked ye if ye fancied the courtin be fer real amily looked right at him no blushing or faltering he liked that about her so muchshe was so straightforward i was hoping that you holding my hand right now meant you were happy with the idea she said with a faint smile because i dont think i would care to be courted by anyone else he grinned hard enough to make his face split and squeezed her hand reckon we feel bout th same then he said warmly he was about to say more when amily held up her free hand stopping him but mags that was one reason why i wanted to have my leg fixeddont you see she said anxiety now coloring her voice ive been such a burden on father all these years i dont think i can bear to be a burden on someone else he blinked taken by surprise his first reaction was to tell her she was no kind of a burden but that wasnt true and they both knew it his second was to say nobody minded and that was partly true people were only people patience ran out well just look at the prime fit that she herself had pulled when her healing had been canceled and she was one of the most patient people he knew the silence lengthened and he knew if he didnt say something she was going to think the worst he scratched his head ye know there aint no good answer tthet cept thet i unnerstand an it aint like yer never gonna git yer leg fixed right her eyebrows furrowed but she nodded an it aint like nobuddy wants ter help ye ye know thet right again she nodded so ye aint hateful an this aint gonna be ferever its jest fer a liddle while longer i think th worlda yer pa but i think hes a damn fool fer not tellin ye whats goin on thoughan not jest cause it aint right he smiled crookedly es a damn fool fer thinkin wed all jest sit there wi our hands folded nice an not try an find out whats what fer oursels she managed a little smile or maye he does know youre all going to try and he figures to let whoever ordered him not to tell find out that keeping you lot from chasing after a secret is like trying to keep kittens in a basket yere in thet too he reminded her aint jest me an bear an lena bet yeve been snoopin a bit on yer own aye she blushed well she temporized people do tend to forget that im around when im quiet can i help it if they say things id rather not hear something about the way she said that gave him a sudden notion he knew part of what made nikolas so good at what he did was that he did have a subtle giftmaybe a variant on empathy mags didnt know enough about gifts to guessthat made people forget he was there and it sounded as though amily had the same gift i thought companions always chose people with gifts well maybe not maybe it was only that the people they chose had to have a gift and you could have one but not be chosen ill tell ye this he continued abandoning that particular line of thought een iffen yer leg never gits fixed itll be wuth dealin wi it tbe wi ye an thets th plain truth i aint gonna say it aint gonna be a pain but itll be wuth it he grinned crookedly iffen you kin put up with me getting beat up playin kirball and moanin and whinin bout it after reckon well be even aight whatever she had been expecting him to say it hadnt been that judging by her reaction but judging by that same reaction she was just as happy with it if not more she looked puzzled for a moment then suddenly just beamed at him as if he had given her the best present of her life she looked as if she too was searching for something to say but he had the sudden intuition that words were probably not the best reply at this moment so instead he reached for and captured her other hand leaned over and kissed her yes that was the best reply the best possible reply chapter bear was right people did babble to healers mags had learned an amazing amount just by being the one who handed things to bear while he patched folks up he was becoming an expert on other peoples children how they should be raised other peoples love lives other peoples grievances other peoples pain other peoples neighbors unfortunately none of this information was leading to where the agents were mags had solved the possible problem of being forbidden to help bear with his charity healing by simply not asking for permission bear went down into haven one out of every two or three afternoons and if anyone asked mags where he was on those occasions he would reply with absolute truth that he was with amily which he was she was helping bear as well women were sometimes shy around a male healer even at the best of times if theyd been abused oras bear delicately put itinterfered with having to go to a male was problematic at best so it was amily who asked them questions while bear stayed a nonthreatening distance away amily who soothed them and amily who dispensed advice and herbs in equal measure and if there was anything that was a testament to how successful bears idea of allowing folk with training but no gift to do healing work could be it was amilys work with these poor victims of abuse and assault here her leg was a help rather than a hinderance these women saw it saw her as someone even weaker and at a greater disadvantage than they were and did not react to her as they would probably have reacted to another woman who was obviously better off in the world than they were as for amily herself although she would often come back up the hill bowing under a mingled burden of compassionate grief and anger mags could see that being there doing something that he and bear could not and accomplishing something good was making a slow but profound change in her she wasnt just a cripple anymore in her own eyes she wasnt just the heralds daughter who had not been chosen herself she was amily whom bear and brother killian relied on to handle the heartbreaking cases that would not respond to them she was amily who had managed to get three women in the past fortnight to leave their abusers and allow the brothers of the well to get them away to the sanctuary of their corresponding order of women off to the north in amberdeenwhich was more than brother killian had been able to do in six months mags only wished hed had as much good fortune he hadnt gotten so much as a hint that the agents were anywhere in the city at allneither rumors nor brushes of their presence up the hill absolutely no one had been acting out of character if he had had absolutely nothing to do but listen to and watch folks perhaps he might have gotten somewhere but as it was he wasnt even running up dead ends because he wasnt finding any beginnings nikolas and the other heralds were similarly baffled if the stonewalling on amilys healing and the stoney faces were anything to go on he reflected on this with a feeling of dull urgency as he and bear with amily on dallen made their way back up the hill after another of brother killians charity afternoons bloody hell bear said with feeling flapping the loose neck of his sleeveless tunic to cool himself i never thought id miss winter i swear the hardest part of doing this stuff for killian is the climb back up afterward im sorry amily immediately said contritely from her perch on dallens back i nah never mind im whingin mags interrupted the walks good fer im hed neer get any exercise otherwise wi is nose i book all th time he kept his tone light to cover his disappointmentand his growing unease he couldnt help but get the feeling that time was running out to find the agents and their plants they had to be planning something soon he just felt it like a storm about to break bear snorted as if he began as they passed through the gates with a wave to the guards standing sentry who looked only slightly cooler than bear that was when whatever he had been about to retort was lost in the stampede of heraldic trainees bearing down on mags dallen backed up quickly to avoid having amily jostled the trainees were all talking at once asking him if hed heard if he knewsince none of them bothered to say what it was they were so roused to a fever over all he could do was shake his head that was when gennie and pip came fording through the throng goodnaturedly pushing the rest out of the way until they got to mags where have you been she demanded weve been looking all over for you ever since the announcement off wi friens mags said gesturing vaguely toward haven wha nouncement well it seems that half of valdemar has gone mad for kirball gennie told him so excited she was bouncing a little on her toes but they dont just want to see it they want to play it too wait it was bear who spoke up before mags could frowning and combing his fingers through his hair in agitation thats insane the only reason hardly anyone gets hurt now is because youre playing it with companions that field is a nightmare you go using ordinary horses and you are just begging for broken bones and maybe someone killed everyone knows that pip replied thats why the guards been working with some of us to come up with a simplified versionone that uses a flat field and doesnt need heralds weve been training two guard teams for a moon or so now we even have two versions one with riders and one using all foot bear stopped making his hair stand on end ah he said calming down oh well the point is gennie interrupted the king himself authorized a kirball festival hes going to have us demonstrate our style and then have guard teams demonstrate the new styles hes checked with the healers and the guard and everyone agrees that we can start training again even though theres a lot of summer heatwith precautions bear so dont start making your hair look like a hedgeand have the festival in time for the start of fall quarter isnt it fantastic mags didnt quite know what to say aye he managed fantastic fantastic t think theres three enemies up ere we dunno who they be theres at least two more down i haven we caint find an were gonna do games that was my reaction dallen said until rolan pointed out that the agents will certainly think we are unaware of their presence will certainly try to take advantage of this opportunity and mags waited dallens mindvoice was smug really smug and he prodded sharply when dallen had let the silence go on for too long and he as much as admitted that yes you were correct there are three operatives up on the hill somewhere no they still dont know who they are and they are hoping to use this festival as the means of smoking them out on the one hand that was absolutely insane no one in his right mind would do something like this on the other hand the threespies operatives whatever they weredid not know that the heralds knew they were there the hill was going to be thrown into a gamesmad frenzy for the next moon or so schedules would fly right out the window people would become unpredictable in actions and habits and that would put the agents under a tremendous amount of pressure they might snap under it they might make mistakes they might reveal themselves its fantastic mags said with more enthusiasm which teamsll be aplayin all of them east against south us and north gennie said with great satisfaction rubbing her hands together with glee this is going to be amazing itll be amazin iffen i kin get through this next moon wiout droppin over wi exhaustion an neer mind them agents tryin tkill me iffen they ever figger out im lookin fer em helping bear was completely out of the question now there was no way he would be able to do that and keep up with the training schedule that gennie had imposed on them training was in the morning before the full heat of the day was on them and with all four teams needing field space they were beginning at dawn the dean had thrown up his hands in defeat as soon as this festival had been announced those trainees who were on the teams had been put into their own classes which were more like big tutoring sessions lasted all afternoon and dealt with all subjects together instead of attending formal classes with lectures each of the players was given daily assignments by his or her regular instructors and was expected to turn them in completed by dinner teachers came and went during the afternoon and the trainees were expected to help each other strangely enough it worked well at least as far as mags could seethough he could also see the potential for slacking off so he doubted this novel approach was going to last past the festival but this approach pretty much decreed an end to his snooping up on the hill he simply did not have time by the time dinner was over the collegia kitchen staff and the few servants were gonebecause their working days began before dawn and ended as soon after dinner as possible he had no reason to be poking his nose over into the palace staff and absolutely no reason to be found among the courtiers the guard had been tolerating his presence by day but by night those who were not on duty were not in the least interested in socializing with a boyand at any rate most of that socializing was going on down in two or three specific taverns in haven where again he would stand out rather than blending in if hed had time he might have been able to slip in posing as a potboy but by the end of the day he was far too weary to spend his evening delivering drinks and clearing tables the closer the time came for the festival the more agitated he felt he was getting nowhere alone he had no idea if nikolas and the others had had any more success than he hadbut he rather doubted it finally the week before the festival he made up his mind so far as he knew he was the only person herald or trainee who had exactly the right combination of gifts to find the agents if they could be found at all hed had one brush with their minds in theory at least he should be able to find them at a middling distance if he thought about this all through the afternoon tutoring session and instead of going to supper and sitting down with the rest he went out to companions field to consult with dallen whatcher think he asked without preamble when dallen ambled up to the fence and put his nose over it while occasionally it was a bit irritating to have dallen looking over his shoulder so to speak virtually all the time if he didnt specifically work to keep the companion out this was one time out of many when it was a distinct advantage that dallen knew what he had been considering i think it will work dallen replied with a few changes nothing drastic but it will make a great deal of difference do you remember that room with the crystal sphere in it he blushed a little as if he could forget he and amily had gotten rather beyond just kissing before prudence and dallens reminder that the room was not a private one had brought them both to their senses what bout it i mean tis shielded so thatll help i spose its more than that dallen said raising his head and flagging his tail much much more if you were being gifttrained like the rest you wouldnt even know the thing exists much less what it can do for years maybe not ever but i am your instructor and it is my determination that what thing mags interrupted him ye mean thet glass ball dallen snorted and shook his head so his ears flapped that glass ball is not glass at all andwell never mind the point is that one of its functions is to allow anyone to focus a gift with great precision providing that the gift us under conscious control for instance it helps mindspeakers to focus right down on a single person at a great distance mags saw where he was going immediately so since i already know what these bastiches feel like an look like what wi thet whatever tis thets watchin over em i kin find em wiout havin tdrop shields an kinda roam around open exactly dallen replied and fixed mags with an intense gaze his blue eyes practically boring a hole into mags brain youll have to be carefuli honestly dont know what is shielding these people and we already know that it reacts poorly to any perceived meddling for all we know if it thought there was something about it might lash out and the danger isnt only to you its to anyone about that might somehow be open to it aight im headin fer thet room now he patted dallens shoulder turned and well he would have trotted toward the palace if it hadnt been so hot that it felt as if he were being weighed down by bags of baked salt he concentrated on the fact that it was going to be a lot cooler in the shade and grimly forged his way toward the buildings getting inside the palace was a relief the side door was in shade and the stone walls of the palace held out a lot of the heat the cooler he got the more energetic he felt and he began to feel less like a baked brick as he made his way down the dim stairs and into the lower level by the time he reached the door to that mysterious little room he was feeling as if he could take on almost anything he opened the door to find that the room was empty and there was no sign that anyone had been in it recently that shaded lamp was still burning over the center of the table was it ever allowed to go out maybe not if dallen was to be believed and the crystal sphere could make your gift work better then you wouldnt want to have to wait around for someone to come light the lamp for you when you needed it how many people knew about this place hed bet not many it works best with specific gifts dallen said mindspeakers dont bother with it much for sending a message quickly to a herald at a distance its easier just to ask the companions to do it he entered and closed the door behind him then sat down carefully on one of the padded seats now what i want you to understand that because you are going to be using your gift in a very intense way it is going to take a great deal out of you dallen cautioned your gift is like any other thing you do it takes energy to use it this will be exactly like playing the most energetic game of kirball you ever have in your life followed by two more and thats if youre lucky nothin comes fer free i got it he replied leaning over the table what else you will not need to keep your shields up the room will shield you in partto be brief it will shield you from everyone up on the hill for the rest as you hunt i will shield you as i did before you learned to shield yourself save your strength for the hunt aight he relaxed and let the shields down a little at a time and huh dallen was right the shields on this room were incredible he wondered how that had been done since most shields evaporated when the person who held them in place died now just let your eyes rest on the crystal remember what those agents looked like when you saw them either with your own eyes or nikolas they were probably not bothering to disguise themselves at the time then remember how their minds looked to you and when you are sure of what you are looking for start hunting it will be like sifting gravel to find a gemstone he braced his elbows on the tabletop cupped his chin in his hands and stared at the crystal after a moment he realized that he couldnt look away something was holding his gaze the crystal was holding his gaze he made no attempt to fight it instead he did as dallen had told him to do and concentrated on the two enemy agents he had seen height roughly the same as nikolas one shorter than the other build powerful but lean their faces though there was something like a distant family resemblance there both had lightly tanned skin dark hair dark eyesby candlelight he couldnt vouch for the exact color thin lips strong cheekbones deepset eyes expressions that were so neutral they were masklike eyes like shiny dark pebbles and just about as cold and lifeless things started coming up in his memory things he had not consciously noticed at the time a scar at the corner of the shorter ones left eye that their hands were gloved but the gloves had no fingers that the fingertips looked oddly flat the fingers had a crosshatching of faint scars on the backs when he had them firmly in his minds eyes he added the memory of how they had felt in his head how dispassionate and cold those stray thoughts had been as if everything were a factor in some calculation that only they knew the answer to and how utterly indifferent they were to whether something or someone lived or died they were nothing like the man who had somehow driven his dreams and feelings into mags without realizing it and yet they were clearly cast from the same mold fired in the same furnace the one that mags had called temper had been flawed though the flaws had never been on the surface and those who had sent him had had no idea that what they had sent out would crack so easily under pressure these two were the perfect specimens of of of whatever it was they were supposed to become weapons they were supposed to become weapons mags felt something fall into place as he recognized what they were and he had names for them nowicethat was the older slightly taller one he was colder than the other and experiences and emotions simply slipped off him stone was the othernot as cold but harder nothing got past his surface the first froze his own feelings the second never allowed them to escape and that shield that shadow that enveloped them no not exactly a shadow a fog no that wasnt it either it was just as cold and dispassionate as they were which probably made it easier to obscure their thoughts despite being a separate thing from them and despite the fact that it definitely reacted to an intrusive presence mags didnt think it was exactly alive not as he knew things were alive and despite the appearance of intelligence he didnt believe it could actually think could it be it was like a clockwork toy that gave the illusion of life by doing several things in a lifelike manner never mind he knew what it felt like too he could hunt for it as well as for them ready to hunt dallen asked he answered with a wordless yes he felt his eyes closing and yet he could still see the sphere odd but he didnt have time for musing becausebecause at that moment he wasnt sitting at the table anymore he was floating somewhere if he concentrated quite hard he saw parts of haven beneath him but the buildings were like sketches of buildings while the people in them varied from dim ghosts to perfectly normal looking people to creatures that burned like stars and without thinking about anything but the need to hunt he began to move it was something like flying dreams hed had and the dreamlandscape below him took on a hint of familiarity well the only analogy he could make was that he became a hunting falcon circling up over the palace searching searching herald jakyr the herald who had rescued him from his life at cole pieters mine was an avid falconer and had taken him along on a few hunts on the rare occasions he was in haven and this was exactly like being one of those hawks circling soaring keen eyes looking looking everywhere walls were no barrier to those eyes as he circled farther and farther outward he saw the people beneath him and somehow saw them outwardly and inwardly too he could have read their thoughts but that wasnt right and besides it was not why he was out here he only needed to recognize what they weresee that they were not what he was hunting forand move on it was anything but effortless he felt exactly as if he were playing a hard game of kirball and he was hunting the ball energy drained out of him dallen had spoken nothing less than the truth at least it wasnt stinking hot this was like the search hed done for bear only so much more precise and there was none of that mental clamor he had to shut out all the time under ordinary circumstances the clamor that had come so close to driving him insane the single time hed been forced to rid himself of all shields if hed had to hold his own shields against that this task would have been out of the question he could never have done it mags sensed his quarry in the distance before he saw them sensed the chill of the thoughts that wisped away from them that was what made them stand out in this vague and everchanging landscape there was nothing and no one as cold and emotionless as they were they were on the move and the thing that shielded them made it impossible to say exactly where in the real haven they were damn he heard dallen say as he sped toward them he wasnt sure if that damn was because that sheltering thing obscured their location or because of what they were doing for as he neared them the real landscape of haven solidified around them as if by their very presence they were dragging it into this world of ghosts and shadows a moving irregularly shaped spheroid of reality surrounded them he could see it all quite clearly and he watched in amazement and grudging admiration hed thought he was good going over rooftops now he was glad hed never encountered these two up there they moved like nothing human that he had ever seen fast agile making insane leaps that not even a cat would try the only way they could have gone faster over these rooftops would have been if they had grown wings well at least he knew they were in the city he didnt need dallen to tell him to stay with them for as long as he could those shieldthings werent perfect thoughtsthe most intense thoughts at a guessleaked out he had to stay with them and concentrate on listening so he could catch those thoughts his focus narrowed again he stopped being aware of anything except the two shields and the whispers that slipped out and evaporated away he was getting hints but not in words these two were concentrating on what they were doing to the exclusion even of coherent thoughts but he was getting something they had just left their allies on the hill but who were these allies he strained for a hint since their escaping thoughts bore hints scents glimpses traces of sound he was too far the thoughts were too tenuous to catch from this far away and he tried to get closer suddenly something bright and dark together exploded in his face he was flung halfway across the sky he felt dallen enclose him for just a moment protecting him he was stunned it felt as if hed been hit in the head hard enough to crack his skull when he could look again they were gone dammit i got too close the shieldthings had sensed him andwell now he knew what they could and would do he hovered in an empty space an empty sky with the world beneath him blank for the moment thanks to dallen he knew what had happened even through dallens protection they had shocked his system and he had lost his mental image of the world should he try to find them again could he what if those shieldthings recognized him and went straight into an attack could dallen protect him a second time before he could make up his mind another unshielded thoughtnot from ice and stone but someone else entirely echoed across the ghostly spaces where he floated an image amily amily bound and gagged terrified and alone mags it wasnt an image in the presenthe knew immediately that amily was safe in her own bed this was something someone had seen no foreseen mags he ignored dallen and focused on that thought on that mind fear and anger turning his will into a rapier with a tip of diamond searching until he found the mind that held that vision he didnt have to follow anything this timehe was there right there in a room here in the palace catapulted into the midst of a small group of people nikolas the king a herald he didnt recognize three people in the robes of three different temples the lord marshal a couple of healers i thought perhaps wed averted it when we canceled the procedure on amilys leg the strange herald was saying but all four of us got the same vision within an hour of each other these people are going to try again to take herald nikolas daughter and hold her to force him to do what they tell him to last time we got a vision they were going to take her either just before or just after her leg was reset we couldnt tell which probably because they didnt know which it was going to be a matter of opportunity the king said face impassive but now as you must have expected your highness they are going to use the kirball festival and the crowds and the confusion nikolas groaned theres no hope for it i cant allow her to be used as a tool to manipulate me well have to find somewhere to send her niko where would that be exactly the king interrupted sharply the first lot were bad enough and one of them nearly murdered a stableful of companions but thesethere doesnt seem to be anything that will stop them and it isnt amily that theyre afternot reallythey have some broader agenda that begins with breaking you and we dont know what that agenda is we dont even know who they are or where theyre from mags was furious a swirling seething anger that washed over everything for the moment since its real target was out of reach it erupted into a torrent of pure emotion that left no room for the tiniest of thought turning him into a fireball of rage and hate a fireball that burned out as quickly as it had erupted as his chin hit the hard surface of the table and he came abruptly back to himself he was shaking shaking with reaction and with weakness and a little with cold his head felt fit to burst pain throbbed behind his eyes his mouth was as dry as a handful of sand and he truly deeply wanted to kill someone mags dallen whispered aye tis all right well now the mystery was solved he knew why the healing had been canceled and he thought maybe one of the images hed gotten from the agents was of a keystone pulled from an arch and he thought he knew now what it was they were here to do amily was just the keystone they had correctly identified the weakestand yet the strongestspot in the grand construction that was the kingdom of valdemar the kings own take the daughter of the kings own and the kings own crumbles the king is without his prime support and confidence in the heralds is eroded kingdomwideafter all if the heralds couldnt protect amily who could they protect opportunistic outsiders take advantage of that uncertainty and with the right strikes at the right time the entire kingdom falls apart he sensed dallens shock well thats how itd look toutsider ye ken he said grimly but they don know heralds with shaking hands he pushed himself up and away from the table im gonna go hev me a liddle talk wi kings own chapter mags was still shaking with fatigue when nikolas entered his own rooms to find him amily and bear there waiting it had taken some strong potions from bear and what seemed like a bucket of salted honeywater but at least his head wasnt splitting and he could think clearly bear had asked to come along when he talked to amily he welcomed the support nikolas already looked shaken as he entered his rooms when he saw the three of them together his face went white we know amily said calmly we know everything mags told us about your meeting nikolass gaze flashed to mags and there was a moment of recognition on his face so interesting nikolas had sensed that mags was in the room a few candlemarks agohad the king probably nikolas cleared his throat carefully then you know that i am not moving one inch from the hill she interrupted im just the lever to overset you they know if they kill you someone else will be chosen as kings own within a week so what they want to do is weaken youor better still break you of course nikolas said harshly thats obvious and when the news got out that my own daughter had been he shook his head people would say if the heralds cant keep one girl safe on the hill why should we trust their judgement their ability anywhere else pressure from within pressure from without the heralds start to fall apart from there its only a matter of time before the kingdom falls apart divides into little warring factions thats why i have to get you away from here you have to go into hiding right out of the kingdom if no amily and mags said together he took her hand in his thet aint gonna do it he said i went huntin fer these critters tnight ye send er away theyll hev er afore shes halfway tnext city theyre moren good sir there bettern anythin yeve ever seen at what they do they jest don stop till they git what they want an they don let nothin stand i their way he tried not to sound as if he were accusing nikolas but he wasnt sure if he managed it admit it ye knew th moment i tol ye bout the spies up here thet i was right nikolas flushed a little you were right the foreseers had already gotten that much the first time im sorry all of you sorry i was not allowed to tell you mags nodded a brief acknowledgement of the apology so ye wanta send amily awaywell theres people spyin fer em planted right up ere so theyll know yer sendin er away mebbe they wont know when she leaves mebbe they won even know thas what yer gonna do but theyll know soons shes gone an theyll find er it aint gonna work theyll track er down aint no way ye kin keep em from findin er you should have told us what was going on in the first place father amily continued as nikolas looked as if he wanted to dig a hole right there and stuff his daughter into it to keep her safe it wasnt right and if youd told us we could have been thinking of ways to catch these men all this time idin er ere i th palace an startin a rumor she bin sent off aint gonna work neither mags pointed out divining the next turn nikolass thoughts would take ows thet gonna help amily by makin er a prisoner sides spose ye kin keep er safe i dungeon say wi a morta guards these bastiches aint stupid theyll swap t some other target an ye wont know who tis i want some say in this amily said her voice shaking this is my life were talking about i dont want to spend it locked up like a prisoner or watching over my shoulder in some strange place ive never heard of in fact i dont want other people making decisions for me anymore not even you father not even you mags squeezed her hand she squeezed back mind you he hated this but he couldnt deny her this either guarding her back was one thing protecting her like a child did no one any good you said yourself that you know what all this is about well the way to stop it is to stop them cold right at the beginning of their plan thanks to the foreseers we know what theyre going to do so we let them or we let them try anyway she raised her chin and looked her father square in the eye you are not the only one in this family that is willing to risk everything for valdemar noamily i cant let you do this nikolas protested you mean you cant stop me from doing this she corrected weve spoken to the king and the lord marshal and they both agree this is the smartest plan she smiled a little shakily or as the lord marshal put it there is nothing that ruins a bad persons day quite as thoroughly as an ambushed ambush amily she shook her head we may have discussed this only briefly but it wasnt difficult to come to that conclusion father they are not aware we know of their plans that makes this our best chance to catch them off guard youve put both yourself and mags at far greater risk in the past yes you are very highly trained but mags is only a trainee and i have been thinking about this while we waited for you the logical time for me to serve as bait for this trap is going to be during the kirball games thats when there will be the most noise and confusion the best time for them to take advantage of the crowds they will believe they have the upper hand when in fact we are the ones in control now all three of them bear mags and her father stared at her aghast and in disbelief then they all began talking at once mags was frantic how could he protect her if she was among the spectators and he was on the field when shed told him her intention of going ahead and acting as bait hed agreed because he planned to be right there to guard her it wasnt something he would trust to anyone else besides he knew how ice and stone felt and he would know if they got close he tried to make himself heard but after a moment of babbling he finally shut up and let bear and the kings own rattle on while he thoughthard finally nikolas and bear both ran out of objections and left him a chance to put in his own oar look amily he said trying to sound reasoned and logical kirballs dangerous aye i mean th game yeve seen it ye saw corwin took off wi smashed arm taken by surprise by the apparent change in subject she nodded sir he said wincing a little at the ache in his head that using mindspeech was giving him at the moment dallen was right using that crystal took an awful lot out of whoever was crazy enough to try it no wonder there wasnt a line to use it in front of that room shes made up er mind an ye aint gonna talk er outa doin this but lemme try an show er why hers aint the best plan nikolas bit his lip but he didnt interrupt kirballs dangerous evbody knows thet nobuddyd think nothing if somethin happened an i ate serious dirt like i go down an i don git up but thered be a big todo an yed not be thinkin bout bein carried off right then yed be askeert an tryin tgit tme an th crowdd be millin an shoutin an tryin tsee an evbodys attentiond be on me an not on you ye kin bet theyd figger thet out prolly plan t do somethin t make me eat dirt sos theyd git thet chance t grab ye as he saw her eyes grow wide he drove home the last nail an iffen they wanted ye all quiet an not fightin an not thinkin while they was seein bout makin me eat dirt they might think about how tmake it permanent cause ye aint gonna be in no shape tdo nothin if ye done passed out or somethin an i aint gonna be comin fer ye if im dead if it was me id set it up so i had some way to make her faint bear put in i can think of a couple just off the top of my head no one would be surprised and if you had people in healers green come carry her off no one would stop them either amily was white now to match her father and slowly nodded now playin bait durin tother kirball games thas not a bad thought mags continued jest not durin mine i kin stick wi yehellfires ye know how tride dallen an e knows you ye kin be on im aint noplace safer an i don think these fellers really unnerstand what a companion is i thin they thin companionsre jest extree smart horses even iffen they got some ideer companionsre moren thet i don thin they got ary notion jest ow special they be you say the sweetest things dallen said dryly but i like the idea of her being on me she will be safest there evbodyll say so sweet lookee there them two mun be tgether aye he nodded a little none on em are gonna thin ye know howta really ride im he blew out his breath now look ye i know th way them fellers minds feel ill know iffen they even get close an i kin give a mindshout when they be an where they be like when i mindshout th ball i the game ony they be th ball for a plan hed come up with on the fly it wasnt bad it let amily do what she wanted to do when she wanted to do it and it let him be there to stick by her because no one was going to get her without eliminating him first nikolas took a deep breath and some of the color came back into his face all right then amily you are right i have no business telling you that you cannot do something only you can do for this kingdomeven though i hate the bare thought of it im sure the king and his advisers are still trying to work some way out of this predicament i will go and tell them what weve decided and they can put together a coherent plan should we tell im we already did mags asked dallen well except for th part bout doin it durin th kirball game no let him keep some shreds of his dignity nikolas got up still shaking a little and looked down at the three of them i think you are both very brave and very insane he said to mags and amily says the man in the here i am shoot me uniform muttered bear mags shrugged reckon best way tkeep amily safes tlet em think they got high ground when its uss got it i hope youre right mags the kings own said and left itll be all right pip said as mags fidgeted with his gloves for the twentieth time no one and i mean no one is going to try to get her where she is right now i wouldnt try it gennie agreed shes out in the open and theres a stiff wind so that means these people cant use some sort of smoke or powder to incapacitate everyone if they had incredibly powerful mindmagic theyd have used it already therere heralds all around the ring theres absolutely no way you could eliminate all those dogs you might be able to do something to oh maybe half of them and the ones you didnt she shook her head theyre boarhounds and deerhounds sure but herald sorald told them to protect her while shes there when sorald tells an animal to do something it generally gets the job done right now amily was judging a dog contest she was indeed surrounded by wolfhounds boarhounds deerhounds and bearhoundsnot to mention a nice selection of the enormous mastiffs trained from puppyhood to guard children she was in the middle of a riding ring set up for horse and hound judging a herald with the gift of animal mindspeech hadso mags understoodmade it quite clear that besides behaving themselves and ignoring anything that might be a distraction the dogs were all required to protect amily from any threat this or so those whose expertise in this sort of thing said was likely to drive the agents and any help they had hired on insane there she was out in the open and untouchable they all felt that this would make the agents snatch at the first opportunity that presented itself to make their play mags wasnt so sure about that if the agents really had recruited local criminals for thiscertainly but to his mind they were much much too cool to be irritated into acting before they were ready no he was pretty certain that despite all their plans something would happen where for a moment everyone would be caught off guard and only then would the kidnappers move in as he saw it at this point his job was not so much to keep them from taking amily himself but to buy time for the rest of her protectors and the ambushers to get to them it was one thing to tell himself that there was no way they would get to amily except through himbut the reality was the very best he and dallen could do if ice and stone were as good as he thought they were was to delay them until the odds were just too great for them to succeed are you sensing anything dallen asked im thinkin mebbe i put mfoot int when i bumped them shields he admitted ruefully im thinkin now them things knows me an they closed up even tighter nor afore if you did theres nothing we can do that will change that so you have to watch for the shields themselves dallen admonished and if you didnt then theyll be leaking away and you need to watch for the telltale signs of them hate it when yer right mags muttered what pip whipped his head around jestdallen right none of them really had their heads in the game today mags wished hed been able to divulge what was going on but even if the only ones hed told were his fellow grays that still meant there was a chance that ice and stone would get wind of the plan only the specific heralds guarding amily knew what had been predicted id still feel a hella lot better iffen tothers knew even as he was thinking this he noticed something odd the trainees on his team stiffened so did those on the opposing team was some sort of message being passed then why hadnt he heard it and why was every gray on both teams turning furtively to look at him a mindvoice that was completely new to him spoke inside his head mags its riker riker but he was the captain of we all just got told by our companions whats going on mags looked up startled to meet rikers solemn gaze gennies blocking everything at the moment i think shes a bit stunned at the mere idea that amily could be in serious danger ask her to come over and talk to me quick please mags gave an abrupt nod and turned to see that gennie was looking at him with a horrified gaze before she got herself under control gennie riker wants ye t go talk to im he told her not sure why cept e says you an im need t talk bout whats goin she nodded brusquely and moved out of the pack heading for the other side of the kirball field whats going on asked jeffers puzzled gennie huddle up pip said sharply im going to tell you when they had huddled pip and mags together explained the situation as best they could a shocked silence filled the space where the team huddled together when they were done no one objected though everyone remembered what had happened a mere few moons ago and when mags said that ice and stone were more dangerous and more skillful than the man whod nearly burned down companions stable with companions locked into it the team was inclined to believe him i halleck rubbed his helmet absently this is insane how can we play a game whenhow can you think to play mags gennie came trotting back over to the huddle thats what we were just talking about we arent going to play a game were going to give a show riker and i will call the moves mags will tell the rest of you well end in a tie stay sharp mags keep most of your attention on the crowd keep watching for those men all we need out of you is the occasional brilliant move that ill plan for you and relaying orders to the nongifted so long as you do a few plays that look like our star kirball player no one is going to notice that youre nothing more than dallens passenger the rest of the time that suit there were no dissenters right then first play out of the box scrum a bit and whoever gets the ball kick it to the twisted elm and let rikers bunch run it up and down the sidelines for a while when the crowd gets tired of that well break for a new play hup she pulled the faceguard down over her helmet they did the same both teams headed for the middle of the field and the start of a gamethatwasnt you just stick tight and ill make it look as if youre actually playing dallen told him as the pack scrummed over the ball concentrate on watching for those devils mags hunched down over his saddle horn obediently while dallen was seemingly everywhere it probably looked very exciting to their audience and dallen was working up quite a sweat but it was all running and leaping and fancy footwork that didnt actually accomplish anything though it wasnt likely anyone would notice meanwhile mags cast his mental net wide searching for either a hint of those cold cold thoughts or the shields that guarded the two mags a cautious call from gennie got his attention ball coming right right back give me a brilliant hit down the center toward the goal now he swiveled in his saddle saw the ball coming at him at exactly the right angle for him to give it a boost onwardof couse the other team also had a fetcher which was probably why it was flying so truestood up in his stirrups and hit the ball with all the pentup fury over this situation he had dared not otherwise express he hit the ball so hard he came close to bursting it probably the only reason that it didnt was that it was already moving and he just boosted the speed it screamed toward the opposing teams goal with a force that surprised everyone including him pip just got out of its way instead of giving it a helping whack the goaltender stiffened then dove to the side not even pretending to try to intercept it the ball hit the back of the goal in the deep black shadows of the little stone building hit it so hard that the tiny building echoed with a hollow boom did the ball just explode halleck asked in the sudden silence the goaltender peered inside and signaled for a new ball one of the judges rode up to the goal brought out the flattened remains of the kirball and held it over his head the crowd went insane as one of the sideline helpers brought in the new ball his entire team was staring at him well mags managed ye wanted a brilliant move bastard said riker with no rancor whatsoever how the hell are we supposed to top that mags didnt manage to top that move himself although he did execute three more showy plays one in each quarter that was enough to make it look as if he was playing the game brilliantly when in fact he wasnt playing the game at all it was just as well because early in the second quarter he knew that the foreseers had been absolutely right he sensed the odd blankness of those shields somewhere beyond the watching crowd he caught faint hints of ice thought none of stone during the last quarter he relayed all of that to the heralds guarding amily they were all glad to exit the field at the end of the last quarter mags had a throbbing headache and they were all drenched with sweat riker walked over to the horse trough and fell into it armor and all then got out pumped his helmet full of colder water from the pump and dumped it over his companions head i hope we never have to fight a battle in heat like this he said aloud weaponsmaster says heat kills more fighters in a summer war than anything else but disease gennie observed they both cast a brief but penetrating glance at mags he shook his head slightly wheres amily he asked dallen still judging dogs theyre restless herald sorald says they sense something out there but they havent managed to locate it dallen sounded worried then theyre better nor me im jest gettin liddle flashes so shes still judgin hev i got time t yes just as we planned ill go to the judging ring nikolas will put her up on me and well meet you there dallen tossed his head impatiently go mags stared at him askance he was filthy covered in sweat and sweatcaked dirt but ye look dallen gave a quick glance around as if to make sure no one was watching no one was he shook himself vigorously and for a moment the sun winked off him as if he were made of something reflective and in the next moment he stood there looking as if he were fresh from the hands of the groomers mags gaped what dallen said with irritation ye yes i did why dont ye because youd get lazy now move if you please the dogs are not happy and my skin is crawling something is about to happen theres something important about this whole situation we dont understand andsomethings about to happen i can feel it mags moved pulling off his armor as he ran to the stable hed left a clean set of grays at the pump he stripped off washed and changed in record time then ran toward the dogjudging ring he crossed the end of the new kirball field where the remaining members of the trainees teams were chatting with the guard teams before their game and he spotted amily on dallen coming toward him and that was when he sensed stone nearby very nearby practically but waitthere was ice ice on one side of him stone on the other but why were they here instead of focusing on amily werent theywasnt it amily they wanted but he felt it now felt their concentration on him felt a chill of real fear lance through him lady amily lady amily a middleaged man ran up to amily waving his arms wildly he looked vaguely familiar mags tried to place him guard no he didnt have a fighters build he wasnt in the uniform of any of the collegia pawel amily said in surprise course pawel onea th servers at collegium of course amily would recognize him and remember his name like her father she made a point of being able to recognize almost everyone she had ever been introduced to whatpawel what is it she asked loudly loudly enough to make heads turn toward both of them not nearly as much attention as pawells shouting attracted lady amily dontdont go to the kirball field he shouted desperately its a trap lady amily its a mags had wormed his way through the pack at the end of the field and felt a surge of icy anger that stabbed right through his head and made him double over with the unexpected pain which was why the man who had been following him stumbled right into him fear joined the pain it was stone how had he gotten so close instinctively mags ducked under him so that the man rolled over his back and landed on the ground mags got a startled glimpse of something in his hand that glittered reflexively kicked it away spun and ran toward amily theyre ere he mindshouted theyre ere and theyre after both of us evidently the group going after amily had not discussed things in advance with the group going after mags or perhaps vice versa mags sensed stone behind him dropped and rolled out from under his grasp coming right back up on his feet again as rescuers came running from all directions someone in a guard uniform had knocked pawel to the ground and was reaching for dalens bridle he was saying lady amily this man is demented allow me to escort you away from here he was saying that but mags read his thoughts and they were not that of a guard thas not a guard he shouted to the rescuers as dallen half reared lashing out at the man with wicked hooves trus dallen as amily clung to his saddle like a burr dallen put his head down and charged an entire small group of guardsmen barreling right through them and heading for the real guard and more of the heralds mags sensed ice coming at him from the side this time instead of dropping and rolling he abruptly changed direction heading for the piled supplies for the stables he vaulted over a stack of hay bales and switched direction again ice followed himout of the corner of his eye he saw that ice was wearing a guard uniform stone probably was too another three men in guard uniforms had converged on amily two were hanging onto dallens bridle forcing his head down by their weight one was shouting something about getting that horse under control obviously they hadnt yet figured out what dallen was mags did another tuck and roll this time starting with a leap ice and stone nearly collided saved themselves and pelted angrily after him he looked for a weapon spotted a hayfork that would do he glanced at amilyalready herald caelen was charging up to dallens side his companion ramming one of the men trying to coax her out of the saddle and sending him tumbling mags grabbed the hayfork as he ran past it ran on a couple of paces felt ice and stone breathing down his neck he turned his headlong run into a fast turn holding the hayfork like a quarterstaff he managed to clip ice across the face with the handleend ice went down his nose spewing blood stone danced back and the two of them stared at each other for what seemed like forever the shields over both of the men were so tight it was as if they werent even there and the shields themselves if i touch em theyll kill me he sensed the shields roiling with the same sort of energy that had stunned him the last time he got too close all he could doall he dared dowas hold his own shields up and tight stones eyes stared into his and the most frightening thing at that moment was that there was no anger no animosity no emotion whatsoever in his expression there was only calculation he was being assessed and measured for the next time and there would be a next time then stone reached down hauled ice up to his feet the two moved so fast mags could hardly believe it stone glanced around quickly pulled on ices arm and they bolted running straight at the mob milling around the guards kirball field the mob of people who were only now beginning to understand that something strange was going on and then they were gone melted into the crowd frantically mags searched for the sense of them but those wretched shields had clamped down and all he got was the faint impression of the two of them retreating faster than any human should be able to run mags leaned against the wall arms folded over his chest face impassive there were some captives out of this fiasco the group in guard uniforms who had gone after amily unfortunately questioning them only led to a dead end the men in the stolen guard uniforms had been nothing more than hirelings who had been in the generous pay of ice and stone for fortnights oh but they were clever hirelings able to slip in and pass as guards because it seemed they had done it before many times before often enough in fact to have been recognized by several of the guard officers actually stationed here at the palace who assumed that since they were in uniform and on the grounds they belonged here it was stunningly clever there was always some turnover here the men had been supplied with the right people to reference the right things to say even the passwords which are not that hard to get one of the captains said in disgust weve gotten lax anyone with a right to be on the palace grounds could just loiter near the gatehouses when we change and overhear them we never thought to guard against someone on the inside as the men were questioned under truth spell they revealed that they even mingled with the guards in their chosen taverns down in haven until they were able to swap the right gossip these were very clever men indeedand ice and stone who ordered them to do all these things who kept them so well paid they were not the least bit interested in looking elsewhere they were brilliant unfortunately the false guards not only didnt know who had hired themother than vague descriptionsthey also had had no idea that the girl they had been sent to fetch was the daughter of the kings own they had thought this was all some ransom scheme when theyd finally been given their target once they discovered that they couldnt confess fast enough the truth spell wasnt even needed at that point it was clear they were terrified of what the kings ownand the kingmight do to them if they didnt cooperate it was just too bad that they knew so little pawel however looked to be a very different proposition and mags had taken his place in the interrogation room with hopes that he would learn something useful likewhy ice and stone had wanted to kidnap him the room was crowded to the poing of being stifling there were four guards two healers a herald whose name mags didnt know who was in charge of the questioning nikolas who was not being permitted to do anything but glare and mags pawel sat on a hard wooden chair with his head in his hands weeping mags wasnt even trying to read him he was pretty sure all hed get was a flood of incoherent emotions im sorry he said brokenly over and over again i am so very sorry hed been saying that for the last couple of candlemarks now mags was pretty sure he meant it so was the herald who had administered a truth spell to himthe kind that compelled you to tell the truth so were the two healers who had come to make sure he didnt do anyone any mischief and see to it that the truth spell didnt harm him any right now it seemed all it would let him do was say how sorry he was mags finally got tired of it he walked over to the man grabbed his shoulder and shoved him back in the chair so that he had to look up mags the presiding herald snapped warningly let him be you wont get anywhere by bullying him mags ignored the herald for the moment fine he growled into pawels face we unnerstan yere sorry now tell us what yer sorry about he put a good deal of mental force into that command and it seemed to snap pawel out of the weeping fit hed been caught up in pawel gulped coughed and began to stammer iim sorry i know mags glared no i mean it wasnt supposed to happen this way thisthis was all wrong i was supposed to go home i wasi was supposed to become a priest of vkandis karsite someone gasped whats thet sposed tmean mags growled pawel seemed mired in his own thoughts and memories his eyes were glazed and swollen and not really focusing on mags when i was a child i wanted to be a priest ive always wanted to be a priest but i didnt have the money for the loveoffering to become a blackrobe or the suns blessing to command demons to my will as a redrobe so so they told me if i served the son of the sun in another way theydtheyd he shook his head all my life all i ever wanted was to serve all my life and this was my chance they sent me here they told me how to fit in they got me a position in the kitchen all i had to do was wait wait a moment the presiding herald was leafing through some papers it says youve been serving in the palace and collegia kitchens since you were thirteen thats a good twenty years ago pawel nodded then hung his head i thought theyd forgotten about me but i stayed quiet i did what i was supposed to i prayed i waited for signs i stayed quiet i began to think that this was just their way of getting rid of me or that the sunlord had chosen another path for me maybe i was supposed to learn that you were not so bad after all i never saw the demons that they said you commanded i never saw all the evil things they said you white riders did you werent oppressing your people or forbidding them to follow the sunlords teachings down in haven things might not be that good everywhere but they werent any worse than in echtsten maybe i was supposed to come back on my own and tell the priests myself what i had learned but i was faithful to the duty i had been given and i stayed then those foreignersthe trading delegationone of them gave me the sign i didnt think there would be any harm in just doing what id promised all i ever did was tell them what i saw and heard theres no harm in that his tone grew increasingly desperate and then he sagged back down over his knees it was nothing i never saw anything that was important i never heard anything but what the trainees were gossiping about i didnt know any secrets where was the harm in telling what i knew th harm tellin em evthing bout how t get on up here pawel had given those men what they needed most the intimate knowledge of palace life that was how they had been able to come and go at will and who knew how much they had been able to learn with their own spying they told me they were from home i didnt know i never traveled much beyond echtsten on the north border until the blackrobes sent me here they told me they were from the south so i believed them even though they didnt pray to the sunlord at the proper times or pawel shook his head like a weary beast but i told myself that this was all because they were in disguise as i was so of course they wouldnt give themselves away but thenthere was something wrong with them the magician started seeing demoneyes everywhere he said the eyes were watching him magician someone said sounding puzzled what but whoever it was never completed the thought pawels shoulders shook i began to think maybe i was wrong about you that you were hiding something after all and when the magician went mad i was sure of it that wasnt us pawel said one of the healers as the herald in charge whispered to nikolas we dont know what that was you dont understand he wept i realized that when they tried to hurt the boy bear and then when they tried to kill all the companions after all this time i sawi finally saw it i finally believed it completely youre good people the priests are wrong about you oh sometimes you treated me like i wasnt there but wasnt i trying to act as if i wasnt there so you wouldnt notice me and i could see more i tried to make myself angry about that but then one day when i spoke up because i wanted to help lady amily those youngsters listened to me respected me even though all i ever did was clean up their plates mags blinked remembering when pawel had helped with the solution to bears bonebreak modeling problem they told me that you were demonsummoners that the companions were demons and for a while i was afraid of them until i saw the truth the companions they arent demons theyre nothing like the demons that the redrobes command lady amily was always kind to me the worst that has ever happened to me here was the cook shouting at me when he was out of temper youre all goodyou do good things he shook his head violently so when the newest ones came and they told me that once i answered all of their questions and did what they asked of me i could go home i thoughti thought this is why im here after all ill finish this and go home and if i just tell the truth if i just tell them back home what youre really like theyd see that theyre making a mistake and once i got back home and they made me a priest i could keep telling our people about you and there would be peace he broke down again weeping but thenthen they told me i had to get them guard uniforms so i did a piece here a piece there out of the laundry i tried not to think about what they might want uniforms for i told myself it was just to slip out of valdemar safely then they told me that i had to help them take away lady amily and the magpie trainee i told them i wouldntand one of themhe got into my room a locked room he got into my locked room in the middle of the night he told me that he was a redrobe and a demonsummoner and that if i didnt help him hed bring his demons to eat my soul and the demon would wear my body and i would never see home again i would die forever and never walk in the suns light he was shaking with grief and fear now the herald in charge looked at nikolas isnt there a temple of vkandis sunlord somewhere down in the city he asked yes ah i see where youre going ill mindspeak one of the city heralds to bring a priest up here but mags was shaking pawels shoulder until the man looked up at him again fust thing thet bastiche aint no priesta nothin he said sternly putting all the force of his mind behind his words to make the servant believe him neither of em is ye know thet pawel ye seen em do stuff no priest ever did ye ever heard tella priests learnin t run rooftops like cats heard tella priests thetd sneak bout like thieves heard tella priests thet fight as good as weaponsmaster pawel shook his head whas more you ever ask em fer a blessin bet they wouldn do it right pawel nodded slowly mags snorted what kinda priest wont een say a liddle blessin een th wust priest the falsest priest hell say a blessin t any that asks not them its cause they werent no priests an they werent no karsites they knew they didn know nuff teven fake a blessin an yed know thet when ye heard em mebbe yer people hired em they knowed ye was here and knowed th right signs an they got ye thelp em an they had tlearn that from someun so i reckon they got told when they got hired but they aint karsites they aint priests theyre jest fancy killers mags turned on his heel and walked back to the wall leaning against it with his arms crossed his head burned he hadnt much liked using his gift that way but neither nikolas nor the other herald had stopped him and it wasnt as if hed put anything into pawels head that wasnt already there all hed done really was make pawel see and acknowledge what he already knew still it didnt feel wrong but he wasnt sure it was entirely right either well done dallen said as the herald in charge took over the interrogation again alternately coaxing and stern well done for handling him and well done for doubting chosen you must walk a very narrow path and you know it never forget how narrow that path is mags acknowledged him wordlessly and he pondered the man before him not a good man not a bad man either just just a man he didnt hate pawel how could he but he didnt much like him at the moment either how could pawel have been here for so long and fail to see how wrong the people who had sent him were had his very faith made him don blinkers of his own free will and if faith made people do that then how did you get them to abandon what blinded them without breaking them right now mags wasnt sure he cared for religion of any sort plenty of priests had seen what was going on at the mine and done nothing priests had blinded pawel to what was right in front of him day in day out but then there were the priests that bear worked with eventually they had everything useful they were likely to get out of him and he was taken away mags didnt know what was going to be done with pawelhe wasnt entirely certain he cared pawel and the droppoints for his orders were both compromised now and he would have to be gotten away somewhere in case ice or stone decided to make sure he couldnt reveal any more than he already had we know why they wanted amily nikolas said after pawel was taken off but why did they want mags they did want himthe two men that mags calls ice and stone were after mags themselves maybe to keep amily quiet hazarded the herald in charge if they intended to hold her for any length of time they would have wanted a significant hold over her something or someone they could use to coerce her without actually hurting her they could threaten you but she would know that was hollow but if they had mags they could do anything they liked to him to make her cooperate well that was an ugly thought but it did fit in with stone and ices personalities the problem was that just didnt feel right to mags he had no evidence at all other than his instincts but well there was one thing there had been that moment when amily was safe and he was not when he was staring into stones facewatching the man calculate and assess iffen hed thought he could git away wi me heda grabbed me an left amily mags wasnt sure how he knew this he only knew that he was as certain of the truth of it as he was of his own name and that somehow this was directly related to the fact that the really crazed assassin the one that had taken bear had recognized him the hell is goin on had they somehow mistaken him for someone else it wasnt the first time the thought had crossed his mind and it drove him frantic that he had no more idea now than he had then there was one useful thing they had gotten out of pawel there were two more spies up here he didnt know who or what the first one was but he was absolutely certain that one of them was either a bard or a bardic trainee chapter it had taken the better part of a candlemark to relate everything that had happened thas it mags finished he had gotten amily bear and lena to all come out to his room after supper with the companions standing a watchful presence he was fairly certain no one was going to be able to overhear anything he told them amily had the single comfortable chair and mags paced restlessly lena and bear sprawled on his bed thas all i know amily yer pa wants ter wait till its a mite cooler afore they do yer leg nobody wants ye t be hurtin an swelterin at th same time an theres other reasons sorry i werent half listenin he shrugged finally sat down on the floor at her feet and she reached for his hand infections easier to get em in hot weather and itd be easier for you to get heat sickness too bear pondered it all well i reckon we can get you mostly done before the snow if we do it before harvest moon if you dont well then i just get to be pampered and lie about like a spoiled child next to the fire all winter and have people fetch and carry for me she said with a smile mags snorted like i kin see ye doin that not hardly he decided to risk getting teased about it later and stole a kiss right now he wanted all the kisses he could get he was still getting the shakes when he understood just how close their escape had been if amily hadnt been on dallen hed have been too busy fighting off ice and stone to help her all those men dressed in real guard uniforms had looked very convincing bear had been right theyd had the means to knock her unconscious and they could have carried her off under the guise of getting her help he tried to remind himself that they had all been prepared for something like that shed have been swarmed by herads and companions but all he could think about was amilys terrified face how close he had come to never seeing her again but the spy in bardic bears brows furrowed it has to be marchands pet it has to who else could it be mags expected lena to agree with bear immediately so obviously did bear they were both shocked when she shook her head it isnt she said decidedly it cant possibly be farris for one thing there isnt a deceitful bone in his body for another she bit her lip for another i know why father picked him now mags had a horrible vile thought and something of that must have shown on his face because amily took a quick glance at him and paled but lena was continuing twisting a bit of her hair around one finger this is going to take a long long explanation we got time mags pointed out i really wanta hear this she nodded you probably would never have noticed i actually dont think anyone but me has noticed but fathers compositions seem to come in lumps hell do a lot of new music then there wont be anything new for a while then hell do a lot more new music its not just that hes working on something long and complicated he doesnt work on anything at all hell do concerts and performances hell go to parties hed even come home to visit and when i was in his rooms the only music that was there was whatever he was learning i mean ive known that forever and even though i dont know any other bard who works that way i never actually thought it meant anythinguntil a few days ago you see ive been helping farris learn composition bear gave her a look of incredulous surprise you what but i thought he glowered a little at her i told you i thought you oughta avoid him altogether i was just taking mags advice lena said mags said if i was nice to him and he was horrid people would notice and he would look bad if i was nice to him and he was nice to my face but horrid behind my back people would notice that even more but if i was nice to him and he was nice back and grateful then id have a friend so no matter what i won if i was nice to him bear scrunched up his nose pushed his lenses back up and thought about that a while remind me never to cross you he told mags finally you seem so perfectly ordinary most of the time then you turn around and come up with something like this thatsits politicallevel scheming is what it is where do you come up with these things sometimes i wonder if youre manipulating me like that i wouldnt call it scheming amily said mildly he wasnt telling lena to do anything but be nice which is what she would rather do anyway he was just giving her the reasons why it was to her advantage mags shrugged uncomfortably what could he reply to that he wasnt really trying to be manipulative but it was so easy now for him to see how people worked take that apart and put it back together in a way that made things better being such an outsider was turning out to be as much of an advantage as it was a handicap id ruther hear what lena has tsay i really wanta know why shes so certainsure th spy aint farris lena took a deep breath i know this is roundabout but its important and it all has to do why i know its not farris when i was helping him with beginning composition i realized right away that hes good he definitely has creative gift his melodies are wonderful and they just flow out of him naturally and he works the way everyone else ive seen workshe always has songs hes working on even when he says hes finished something will set him off and hell look for a piece of paper to jot the music down on he cant stop and take a rest from it any more than he could take a rest from breathing so that doesnt mean he cant be a spy too bear said stubbornly in fact that would make him a better spy he could write things down in musical notation and no one would be the wiser and anyone suspicious of him would see he really was someone who belonged in bardic and not think any more about it thats true lena agreed butlook you have all been trying to figure out why father brought him here you assumed he was a spy and were and thinking it was because he somehow tricked father into it but thats not what happened at all what amily asked skeptically he told you what happened he didnt have to once i figured it all out lena frowned unhappily hes not some kind of scheming adult in a youngsters body he didnt trick father its the other way around fathers tricking him fathers using him aight mags scratched his head lena i caint see ary way bard marchand could be usin a youngling well not true he coul but evidently that wasnt the sort of using that lena meant im getting to that she replied three days after i helped farris with one of his own original melodies i heard father use that same melody for one of his own new songs or what he claimed was his new song she looked as if she had swallowed something bitter and when i asked farris about it the next day he was all i know isnt it fantastic its such a great honor my stupid little thing in one of bard marchands songs lena shook her head i tell you i thought i was going to be sick when he said that it took mags a few moments to unravel what it was that lena was saying he started to ask a question to make sure he understood her correctly but amily beat him to it you mean your father is stealing his proteges work and claiming it as his own amily asked incredulously oh he does change things rearranges it a bit and adds a lot to the melody he puts it into his style and he is certainly writing all the lyrics lena amended though she was still looking sour indeed but the melodies arent his the hardest partcoming up with the bare musiches not doing that and hes making farris think that hes doing farris a favor by stealing his music hes using farris and it isnt the first time either amily made a shushing motion at bear how would you know she asked because i did some checking in the archives every single one of those bursts of songwriting has been when hes had a protege or hes been somewhere way off away from haven amd come back with a whole new book of songs and his proteges i checked theyre always very poor he carts them off with him when they are about ready to produce their master work he says its to give them the space and isolation they need to work they mysteriously get offered a really comfortable permanent position somewhere far off and never come back and the work they send back as their master piece is just barely good enough to get them full scarlets mags looked at her askance his mind full of nefarious things that marchand could be doing ye dont thine aint murderin emis e lena looked at him shocked and shook her head no uh then she blinked actually in a way he is murdering them not physically but she bit her lip he takes someone who adores and admires him he takes the best of their work i bet the closer it gets to them getting their scarlets the more horror stories he tells about how hard life is on the road they were poor for the first time in their lives theyve been living in plenty and now hes telling them oh and by the way once you get your scarlets youll probably be poor again but then he takes them on one last trip with him he probably tells them that hes doing them this huge favor taking them somewhere quiet and luxurious so they can put all their energy into their master piece but thats not why hes taking them hes found a wealthy household off back of beyond of nowhere that desperately wants a bard of their own like a sort of prestige pet and hes already been priming them with his visits so this last time he brings his protege with him and says look see how much i esteem your regard for me i am bringing you my very own student offer him the position amilys eyes flashed anger oh that snake so of course they do and of course after all of marchands terror tales the poor thing cant believe his luck and takes it and father helps him with his master piece which is of course just barely good enough to pass and everyone says my goodness poor fellow just never lived up to his promise so sad but at least he has a position and he settles into to that position never realizing father used him all those years and now has just dumped him in a backwater to become someones fat little house bard happy to sit by the fire and be a trophy and write songs about horses and cows lena was clearly very angry by this point mags wasnt entirely certain why she was so angrythough he could certainly understand that it was extremely unethical for marchand to be stealing his proteges work and claiming it as his ownbut he had the feeling that amily understood perfectly and he figured eventually she could help him figure it out that wasnt what was important at the moment aight i know ye know bard business he said an im purty certainsure thet iffen ye say marchands doin this e is what i don unnerstand is why this means e aint a spy oh lena deflated a little well i suppose it doesnt its just this is why i know hes not using my father my father is using him farris isnt the conniving one its father you see aight so gimme nother reason this wasnt just baiting her mags trusted lenas instincts and he knew that if there was another reason shed articulate it once she thought about it i hmm she sat there with her brows furrowed with thought while bear held her hand well he never leaves bardic much less the grounds except to eat if you think i work hard you should see him all he ever thinks about is music i just dont think hed have any time to pass people messages hes very naive he desperately wants to think the best of everyone his people may be poor but they are awfully kind and hes very goodhearted she sighed i dont know how to say this mags but him being kind is something you just cant fake aight mags nodded i spect someuns gonna find a way t get truth spell on im tmake surea thet but i spect yer right so whatcher gonna do bout what yer pas doin a thin little smile crossed lenas lips i already have done something about it she said you know that a copy of everything a bard does is supposed to go in the archives here right no but ill take yer word fer it mags replied well i took the copy of that new song and i took the copy id made of the composition work she paused a moment well blast i need to explain something else now whenever we work on composition we take it to the teacher that same day and he or she dates and initials it this isnt just to prevent someone from stealing your work its to prevent anyone from claiming you stole his work so fathers song had the date he left it in the archive and fariss work was dated and it was pretty clear what came first i put them in a folder and i left them on bard litas desk lena looked like a very satisfied kitten one with a mousetail sticking out of the corner of her mouth and a smudge of cream on her nose mags blinked then turned to bear an you said i was bein all polticalconnivin an manipulational oh hush and thats not a word bear kissed lenas hand and she blushed that was fearfully clever it could have been anyone who left that on the desk its not like marchand hasnt irritated a lot of people around here im half tempted to tell bard lita it was me amily said thoughtfully but she wont ask all she needs is the evidence it speaks for itself thas a fact mags agreed but ye had that other prollem didn ye this time it wasnt a blush that reddened lenas cheeks it was a painful flush all i ever heard was the rumor she said no one would ever tell me directly theyd heard him say that and now that i know what i know about his composition look bear interrupted let me just ask this outright do you want him to be your pa cause ill tell you right now if my pa claimed i wasnt his id send the old blowhard a smoked ham and a thank you letter bear lena exclaimed shocked as mags and amily laughed well look whats he done for me nothing but give me gray hair before my time look bear pulled a lock of very dark hair away from his head see and whats marchand done for you he didnt even get you into bardic your grandpa did that lena wavered thats truebut its not me that im worried about mama would if the rumor got home mama would never dare go out in public again it would be horrible for her everyone would be trying to figure out who my real father was grandpapa would be mortified and hed blame mama tears sprang up in her eyes at the mere thought bear hastily put his arm around her hey there it hasnt happened yet its just been a couple of whispers your friends are pretty good at squashing em lord wess has been real good at that he says he just looks down his nose and drawls thatno wait let me see if i can do this right bear took his arm from around lena and stood up he slouched indolently against the wall and looked down his nose at all of them my dear old creature of course marchand would say something like that the fellow cannot bear the idea of anyone having more talent and adulation that he does when its a stranger can you imagine what hes thinking about being eclipsed by his own offspring and a girl at that hes already done what he can to keep her out of the public eye but that wont hold for much longer hes probably writhing in agony on his pillow at night at the mere thought that the words the great bard marchand would be applied to anyone but him since he cant do anything about the poor girls brilliance he probably decided to see if he couldnt separate her from the name and damn the consequences bear gave one of those odd laughs that wess did a sort of wheezing snigger of course the man is so wrapped up in his own consequence that he hasnt thought things through very well because if lena wasnt his then for all of his claims about how irresistible he is to women and how clever he is his own wife found him quite inferior to someone else altogether and hes been played the fool its something right out of one of those tavern songs where a woman bids goodbye to her husband at the front door and brings the lover in the back and when the husband asks about strange boots under the bed she tells him something ridiculous bear wheezed again just wait as soon as it dawns on him that hes set himself up to look like the doddering old man in a farce hell deny ever having said that mags applauded slowly as bear bowed and sat downboth for the performance and for lord wesss cleverness i imagine that got around pretty quick to marchand because according to lord wess he hasnt let out a peep about you not being his since bear continued backed himself into a bad corner with that one lena nodded slowly i justi she let out her breath in a huge sigh of mingled frustration and unhappiness i think about him using all those other bardic trainees and i just want toi dont know but he is immensely talented hes also immensely selfabsorbed for so long all i wanted was for him to take notice and be proud of me and now now i just dont really know what i want youll figure it out bear said with confidence you can do anything you put your mind to ive seen it not everything she shook her head but amily mags are you safe now is it over gotta be mags said theyd be insane t try t get amily after thet completely bonkers oh i don thin theyre gone they took on th job uv doin fer th karsites what th karsites aint been able tdo wi armies evthin i read offen em tells me once they git a job they stick ont till thet jobs done less they kin figger out how tbreak tcontract but they gotta be smart nough to know that snatchin amily aint gonna git em what they wants he tried to imagine himself into stone or ices head and failed utterly i dunno what theyre gonna do next they aint like thet crazy one nor th feller what tried tburn tstable they think thas all they do actually they be thinkin calculatin alla time they gotta be thinkin what they kin do an i caint reckon like they kin well good does this mean youre going to go back down into haven to spy with nikolas the light from the lone candle that was all mags was willing to have for light in this heat flickered across her face dunno well i know nikolas keepin the shop goin tis one uv is main ways tget is own spyin done but i dunno iffen im gonna go back down there soon things are kinda all of a muddle right now he frowned we still don know who tother two plants are up ere on th hill we gotta figger thet out quick an i don think makin evbody take a fealty oath unner truth spells the best ideer for fndin out someones suggesting that bear said surprised course its purt well guaranteed thet if theres a right bad idea someun on t council is gonna suggest it mags grimaced interacting with the court and the council was one part of being the kings own that he was just as glad he didnt have to do he might well envy nikolas the attendance at those fabulous high feasts he had heard about and wish he could see some of the fabled entertainmentsbut dealing with anyone highborn except those he knew were his friends and allies no at least not for a lot of years mags im not so sure about that amily said into the silence you said yourself these arent the sort of people that give up and the one thing they know they can use to get to papa is me he frowned a little with irritation but frowned more when bear gave an exaggerated sigh amily that doesnt make any sense bear began and amily got a stubbon look on her face and started to talk over him in a higher and slighty whiny voice and the more she talked the more he began to feel well he wasnt sure what he felt very irritated as she started out from the reasonable assumption that ice and stone were frighteningly clever appallingly inventive and terrifyingly well trained and spun that into a wild fantasy of strange unstoppable killers with one foot in the spirit world who had like some weird pelagirs creature gotten her scent and would not rest until they carried her off her tone grated on him and set up a headache just behind his cheekbones he began to harbor the exceedingly uncharitable notion thatwell although she had not liked all the restrictions she had liked being the center of attention and the praise shed gotten for being willing to play baitand now that attention was going to be taken away and she didnt want that to happen the attention she would get for having her leg worked on was passive and it was centered on a defect the attention she had gotten for being essential to laying the trap was active and centered on her bravery oh he could see that all too well and he didnt want to listen to the convoluted paranoid fantasy of someone who had turned into an attention addict not when it was distracting him from real danger and obscuring how he was supposed to solve it the room seemed way too hot he wanted to lie down or get a drink but most of all he wanted to be alone and suddenly as lena added her voice much more shrill than usual the gathering turned from supportive and friendly to argumentive and confrontational and mags had no idea how it had gotten that way or why wait yes he did know he just couldnt do anything about any of it because despite having survived the kidnapping nothing had changed well nothing except that right now the bare thought of how narrow their escape had been was making him feel sick paradoxically as more time passed he was getting more obsessive and anxious about that narrow escape in the short termhe would stand by what he said there was no way that ice and stone would make a second kidnapping attempt not this soon not when the whole hill was on alert but for the longterm paranoid fantasies aside amily probably was still in danger and she still could not defend herself or even run away with her leg the way it was now on the one hand if the shortterm could just extend to getting her leg fixed she would at least not be a literal sitting target but that bizarre story she was spinning around herself was the equivalent of the tale of the little boy who yelled for help in the woods once too often the more she talked the less anyone would even pretend to listen the less they listened the wilder her story would become eventually no one would take her or the danger she was in seriously and that would be when she was in the most danger of all he couldnt think he just could not think of a way to tell her this without making her angry everything else was oh gods the same old problemsnothing had actually been done about them bear and lena still were unable to grow spines and just deal with their parents and he still hadnt done anything remotely useful about these killers except to uncover that they were probably in the pay of the karsites and that had been by purest accident nothing had changed they were all circling the same stagnant problems accomplishing nothing and from the way things looked they would keep circling the same stagnant problems forever at that moment lenas voice hit a particularly piercing note at least to his ears and a lance of pain stabbed through his temple he clapped one hand to his head and swore at least that shut them up mags amily said are you all right no i aint all right an anybody not completely balled up i er own liddle center uf er own little universe d see thet headache he said between clenched teeth and when bear started to get up and come over to look at him he confronted bear with a snarl making him back up a pace don touch me bear i aint some whinging lil soft thing whuts never had wussn a broke nail all right its jest a headache bear fidgeted with his glasses sometimes headaches come from something worseyou might have i been looked over he snapped i been looked over good nobuddy found nothin he squinted at all of them i jest need somethin right now that aint squallin an whingin an argufyin like mebbe some peace bear frowned thats not a don say it he growled bear backed up another pace i think we should go lena whispered she lookedscared did he look that ferocious evidently he did amily looked as if there was something about him she was suddenly unsure of so unsure that she picked up her crutches from beside the chair by herself and struggled to her feet without any help from him i think we should go and let mags get some rest she said but she did it with a look at lena that somehow managed to imply that it was lena who was at fault or at least that was the way that lena reacted but mercifully before they could get into it again bear got them all out the door mags started to throw himself down on the now vacant bed when he realized that amily ive got it dallen informed him im not letting them past me till bear boosts amily up on mythere we go for one moment mags was even feeling a surge of resentment against dallen for interfering but he throttled it down and cursed himself for letting pain get to him that badly but this was without a doubt the worst headache he had ever had in his life for a moment he was tempted to call bear back and beg him to have a look but hed been looked at fourfivesix healers hed lost count theyd all gone over him to make sure he hadnt been poisoned secretly or cracked over the head or something else and theyd all said he was fine gotta be the heat this was the worst summer he could remember thanks he told dallen briefly and even that single word hurt his head to project quarrelsome voices and hoofbeats moved out of the stable it seemed as though now they were arguing about which of them had given mags the headache except of course that was not what they were fighting about it was just the excuse to fight they might not recognize as he had the underlying causes but they certainly felt those causes they knew all three of them that they were getting nowhere but at least two of the three werent willing or werent ready to do what they had to to solve their situation treat th cause an not th symptom he muttered but if you couldnt make yourself face the cause hellfires he growled he levered himself up out of his bed and laid down on the floor at least it was cooler there a lot cooler he closed his eyes and prepared to wait out the pain that at least was something he was good at but the next thing he knew it was morning chapter morning sadly did not bring much relief his room still felt stifling once he stood up his head throbbed and he felt vaguely nauseated he began to wonder if he had eaten something bador if those murdering bastards had somehow managed to poison him after all was this how that guide had felt and just brushed it off as something that would go away he didnt feel all that bad but he didnt feel all that good either dallen whispered something into his mindtoo faint to make out th hell he thought with irritation what he replied caint hear ye this time though still whispered the sense was clear youve overtaxed your gift it took both of us to fend off the attacks of ice and stones shieldconstructs holding your shields against it took more than either of us would have thought you were shouting for help so loudly that the gifted heard you down in haven then you helped interrogate pawel now youre paying for it bah well he wasnt going to use mindvoice then until it stopped hurting doing so would probably only make things worse he looked down at himself realized he was still dressed and opened the door into the stable he marched straight over to dallens stall is there anythin i kin do fer this he asked aloud dallen regarded him with his head tilted to the side then managed to make a strange sound after a moment mags recognized it as snoring sleept off eh dallen nodded well he wasnt going to get any sleep in that room all the things that made it so nice and warm in the winter were turning it into an oven and he was the bread look tellwhoeverim agonna find somewheres cool tsleep don care iffen i miss class don care iffen i miss food caint eat anyroad after a moment dallen nodded then rattled the chain on his water bucket that was easy enough to understand drink plenty of water aye i will he stopped long enough to take a pillow and one of his leather water bottles he filled the latter at the pump and trudged up through air that was positively leaden with heat and humidity to the palace that lower level where the crystal sphere was had been cool enough maybe there was another room down there he could borrow long enough to get some sleep but all the doors were locked except that one he opened the door and stepped just inside and the cool felt like a gift from the hand of a god even the lamp didnt seem to be giving off much heat he considered the room considered the crystal with a wary eye true he was not intending to use it but what if it oh used itself he drank from his water bottle while he considered the risk after all there was probably a reason why the thing was down here all by itself hidden away in a room hardly anyone seemed to visit on the other hand it hadnt done anything when he and amily had been here the benches were padded and with his pillow one would be as good as a bed but the breath of cold from the room finally persuaded him he closed the door behind himself sat down then laid himself down on his side fitted his back along the curve of the bench shoved his pillow under his head and closed his eyes it just felt so good even if he didnt actually get any sleep the cool made his head throb a lot less he drifted off into a semiconscious state that was not quite sleep and not quite wakefulness it felt as if there were something or someone in the room with him uneasily he tried to move but found he could not under other circumstances he might have panicked but he was in the palace whatever it was it would have had to get past so many protections it couldnt possibly be a danger and it wasnt actually doing anything it wasnt even paying any attention to him it was just there as if it had been there all along and he was only just noticing it he slowly became aware that it wasnt anything aliveat least not as he understood the state of being alive finally he knew what it was what it had to be it was the stone the stone became aware of him as soon as he became aware that the stone was what it was he felt it regarding him in a detached way perhaps he should have been alarmed but he wasnt and yet he knew he had sensed something similar recently from a source that did alarm him what was it where had he seen this before the shields the shields on ice and stone this was like those shields except for the part about trying to kill him so what were those shields and why were they like the stone anyway he felt the stone noticing becoming aware of that thought it didnt respond as such but something floated to the surface the stone had seen this before there was a strangely peaceful indifference to the stone it wasnt responding to him or to his emotions so much as responding to the mechanical stimulation of his question as he notquite drowsed the stone presented him with an answer ice and stone were each wearing a talisman this did not mean what he thought it meant to his mind a talisman was a religious token something meant to bring one closer to ones god and make it easier to reach the god when asking for help but to the stone a talisman was an item created by magic to protect hide and defend the bearer from attacks that were not physical like mental coercion or magic magic he thought involuntarily protects them from magic the reply wasnt a thought exactly it certainly wasnt framed in words but his own mind put it into words somehow of course magic just as the stone protects everything within its influence from magic from even the thought of magic thatdont make any sense it doesnt have to not to you the reply had come with such cheerful indifference that he couldnt take offense it would be like taking offense because the leaves were green instead of blue well if the stone knew so much and was answering questions so where are they near their talismans interfere with the stone the stone interferes with them the result is a pattern of confusion this means the stone cannot locate them oh mags drifted a while the ache in his head ebbed and was soothed as the stone became disturbed by it and moved to rectify the situation he came a little more awakeor maybe just awarewhen he sensed conflict it was nearby he groaned a little when he realized it was amily and her father fighting or rather amily was fighting nikolas was just standing there helplessly letting the tirade pour over him a brief flash told mags what had triggered it nikolas had suggested amily might be better off leaving haven for a while he had been going to suggest that she go with an entire group of her friendsmags includedand just for the summer until it was cool enough to fix her leg but she hadnt let him get that far she had worked herself up to the point of hysteria with her terrifying theories anyway this had just triggered some old old resentments you just want to be rid of me the words were distorted by sobbing you think i dont know that ive never figured it out youve always been angry because i lived and mother died and youve always been guilty because you werent there youve always resented me because you have to take care of me and thats a burden on you that the kings own doesnt need and youve always been disappointed in me because i wasnt the son you wanted and i was never chosen and nikolas wanted to say nonobut he couldnt because that would be a lie amily had poured out the bitter truth it wasnt all the truth how could it be he loved his daughter he was proud of her prouder than ever after she willingly made bait of herself even though she was terrified but every word she said was also true how could it not be he had adored his wife and her loss was an ache inside him that would never heal how could he not but feel guilt that he was not there and at the times when the ache was the worst how could he not look at amily and think why was it you and not her as for amily being a burdenshe was there was nothing she could do about that there was nothing he could do about the fact that he was not just a herald he was the kings own and that brought with it an entire load of additional responsibilities and he knew because he winced when he thought about it that there had been so many times when he had been laden down already and she had needed something and he had thought oh if only you were not here as for not being a son every man wants a son every man is filled with fear and unease along with delight at being presented with a daughter instead daughters belong to that strange delightful but incomprehensible womantribe but a son ah a son is a member of the mantribe a man can understand a son a man doesnt have to be afraid for a son and not being chosen oh that opened up a world of mingled relief and disappointmentwhat father doesnt want the best for his child and there was nothing better than having that perfect friend that perfect support that was a companion but relief that she would never know the endless selfsacrifice required of a herald never have to look at someone she loved and think if only you were not here mags pulled away from the fight feeling queasy that wasnt anything he wanted to know and how in hell was nikolas going to reconcile all of that how could anyone suddenly mags felt a lot more sympathy with jakyr who fled any hint of connection much less commitment maybe that was why nikolas had practically thrown amily at mags when he realized the two were attracted to each other mags could take her take the burden onto himself and leave nikolas free to only be the kings own and not amilys father mags could protect her when nikolas could notas nikolas had not been able to protect her and her mother mags would shoulder the burden and mags certainly wasnt disappointed with her no mags didnt want to know any of this not when he had felt that burden felt amily desperately clinging to him trying to infect him with her crazy theories so that he would make protecting her and being with her his priority and he felt the same frantic smothering that nikolas did the same desperate bewilderment as he faced two duties with only enough time energy and attention for one he blocked out the fight he didnt want to know any more didnt want to hear any more and somewhere deep inside him a little voice whispered that this might not be so bad he would miss her company if he used this as an excuse to break off the neverofficial betrothal but would he miss the burden but in turning away from one quarrel he was drawn to another lena was sitting in a little wilted heap in the herb garden talking while bear tried to get cuttings from the look of things she had started talking when she sat down and had not paused since will you stop whining bear snapped for cernos sake lena youre not a little girl anymore if you dont like what your precious father is doing tell him tell lita tell both of them to their faces tell that little rat farris how hes being used if you dont like how youre being treated say something get up on your hind legs and have it out with them for once in your life lena stared at him tears starting up in her eyes and stop crying bear spat that was cute when you were a little girl and passable when you first got here but hiding in your room and sulking and weeping until youre sick are just juvenile grow up the tears dried up as if a desert wind had sprung up lena glared at bear with her fists clenched at her sides grow up say what i feel have a confrontation grow up and face my father just like you did bear froze lenses slipping down on his nose mouth half open just like you just like you stood up to your father because you make such a shining example to follow mags winced frantically away from that fight as well what was wrong with them all why were they ripping into each other the stone stirred at his unhappiness it sensed his question it had an answer stagnation equals death well that answer had come right out of nowhere and made just about as much sense what was that supposed to mean anyway they are not dying mags felt a stab of irritation of course they werent dying that was pretty obvious what exactly was the stone trying to get at change is painful birth is painful creatures in pain lash out without knowing why and often without caring what they strike what are you anyway he thought at it resentfully the storage room for every cliche and wornout motto that was ever spoken in this kingdom yes uh what among many other things right now it was having a philosophical dialogue with him he was talking philosophy with a rock had this just gotten very very strange it already was you just hadnt noticed how could he have not you are looking outward so steadfastly you are not looking inward anymore now you sound like some sort of mystic yes you are all out of balance how would you know i am balance well that made him pause how can i how can we i am past and present i am not future there is no knowledge stored in me of what you will do only what you can do and what you have done in the past all of you so youre a library among other things many other things at this point he wasnt quite sure if he was hallucinating dreaming or the stone actually was communicating with him he wasnt using his mindvoice that much he was certain of because it would have hurt if he had been this was deeper than that at a level where he thought very clearly but very slowlywhere he was articulate but it wasnt exactly in words why are you talking to me you are a herald you are part of the web i am the heart of the web the web he thought he remembered that concept that all heralds and all companions were connected in a vast network like a spiderweband like a spiderweb something touching the web was felt by everything in it can you help me you must ask the right questions well wasnt that always the case he sighed in his sleep if it was sleep that was the problem what was the right question who am i that was it that was the one question that was never answered the one that lurked under the surface of everything he did just as amilys knowledge of her fathers feelings lurked and bear and lenas fear of confronting what they most desired approval from that was what lurked inside mags everyone else he knew everyone had a plan a map for what they were doing and every map had the same sort of starting point this is who you are this is what you came from this is where you are going people might refuse to follow the path on the map but they still had the map itself and it gave them the foundation for their entire lifewhether that life was spent in rebelling or in conforming no matter what they always had an anchor to keep them from drifting away entirely he had nothing he was only what other people thought they saw cole pieters had thought he saw a piece of human trash valuable only as long as it dragged rock out of his mine the priests that had visited had seen the offspring of banditslikely bad blood himself here at the collegiumhe was the star kirball playerhe was the pigignorant little slave boy who nevertheless fought tooth and nail to learnhe was amilys human crutchhe was bears rescuer but none of these were him or were all of them who am i he asked again who do you want to be what who do you want to be i dont understand what you want is an anchor but an anchor can be at the end of the line as well as the beginning who do you want to be make that your anchor oh oh yes sleep now he slept someone was shaking his shoulder he batted at whoever it was and tried to bury his head deeper into his pillow mags said a voice one he knew but couldnt put a name on mags wake up he really didnt want to wake up not when he was finally comfortable for the first time in days weeks he hadnt realized how poorly hed been sleeping until now classes could go hang for one day he was finally going to catch upso there the voice got sterner mags you cant stay here wake up thats an order oh well if it was an order but dammit it wasnt fair why shouldnt he be able to sleep late just once the only other time he got to sleep late was when he was in the infirmary he dragged himself up out of sleep and levered himself up off the bench with the help of the table herald caelen stopped shaking his shoulder and offered a hand to help him up he took it knuckling the eye that had been squashed into the pillow with the other hand sorry sir he said contritely mrooms like a damn furnace an i don thin i got a decent nights sleep this whole fortnight yes well theres a lot of that going around caelen replied pushing him forward a little past the threshold and closing the door firmly behind them both he motioned to mags to keep going along the corridor even those who were not in on the plans for amily were aware that there was something going on it made for a lot of uneasy sleep and the heat is not helping mebbe you oughter give people a turn down ere then mags said with a chuckle i was sleepin a treat he gave his hair a hasty comb with his fingers to settle it caelen gave him an odd sideways look most people would say the opposite really that seemed uncharacteristic of heralds or trainees uhwhy sir them benchesre purty soft good as a bed instead of answering caelen responded with a question did you have any dreams sense that you werent alone anything at all out of the ordinary mags made a face jest a good solid night since mosta my dreams is nightmares i spose not havin bad ones is outa th ordinary a very vague memory seemed to come near to the surface of his mind like an ornamental fish in a pool of green waterbut it retreated again before he got the shape of it and he shrugged it off nay sir i jest slept slept real good interesting well im tempted to tell you to continue to sleep down there until the weather breaks caelen said dryly youre the first cheerful person ive spoken to today everyone is quarrelling with everyone else its the same down in haven and there would probably be fighting all over town except that no one can muster the energy to fight he rubbed the back of his own neck i never thought id miss winter by this time they had reached the stairs going up reckon iffen ye aint gonna lemme sleep down ere im agonna sleep out i companions field he said following the dean up the stairs druther get et by bugs than bake you may regret saying that caelen replied absently there are some nasty surprises out there and being covered in noseeum bites is no joke i left your new class schedule in your room and while i hesitate to make personal recommendationsif i were you i would avoid my friends for a while mags winced he might have no memories of what hed dreamed ofif anythingbefore hed slept but he had very vivid memories of amily spinning fanciful tales of nearhysteria and bear and lena breaking into a quarrel before theyd left they was achin fer a fight when they left mroom he said carefully well lets just say they all got one caelen shook his head nikolas is down in haven and he was said to have left so quickly that even rolan was taken by surprise lena and bear had what was described to me as an epic and very public battle parted ways then bear promptly stalked down to the guard barracks and for reasons unknown to me had a shouting match with a guard healer by the name of cuburn lena spent the entire afternoon mewed up with master bard dean lita at the conclusion of which bard marchand was sent for and there was more shouting and marchand was forbidden any further contact with one of the other bardic trainees mags whistled an i slept through alla thet consider yourself lucky caelen replied this way you werent asked to take a side that is why i advise you to avoid them if you can when they emerged mags blinked in surprise the sun was going down i slep all day he exclaimed which is why i came to find you caelen slapped him lightly on the shoulder when you didnt appear at class and you were not in your room people were worried the only reason no one went into a panic was because dallen was not in the least bit disturbed dallen told my companion where you were and that you were sleeping off gift overuse aye thas what dallen tol me said tsleep er off it was so amazing not to have a headache try to get something to eat i order you to get plenty to drink and it wont hurt you to sleep more caelen told him now i need to go break up another contentious argument in the library remember my advice about your friends even amily at this juncture caelen stalked wearily off without even saying goodbye mags stood in the doorway feeling the heat pummel him and felt his refreshed spirits wilt and sink bear and lena at each others throats in public amily driving her father off here hed thought theyd at least solved their big problem for the short termbut solving it only seemed to have made everything else worse he groaned any appetite hed had was gone dallen ah you sound better aye sleepin heped reckon mebbe i better do some more on it cause from what caelen says jest by sayin heyla i cld start a war dallen snorted not just you come on along to the field ill show you a cool place for a liedown one with nothing in it to bite you don haveta ask me twice the mere thought of more sleep was intoxicating jest gimme time fer a washup an clean stuff i could sleep fer nother day chapter the next few days were spent in catching up with classwork and some very careful watching of what he said so that he didnt launch anyone else into a fight and tempers were very short no one seemed to be getting enough sleep everyone was dozing off in class and the grotto was full of people all the time so was the bathing room as people tried to cool off with baths the river was full of splashing bodies any place there was a marble or stone floor you could expect to find someone lying on it permission had been given to everyone in the three collegia to wear as little clothing as their modesty and the sensibilities of others would allow but it wasnt just the heat perhaps it was that so many people up here were gifted and irritation tended to spread but after the blowup in his rooms and after learning about the subsequent fights that lena and bear and amily and her father had had mags was determined not to contribute to the situation no matter what happened no matter what the provocation he refused to discuss anything other than classwork the weather and kirball he managed to sidestep every single potential quarrel that started brewing in his vicinity that way some though not all he was able to completely avert as for his friendswell things were not exactly friendly although he hadnt quarreled with any of them hed just snapped at them hed been a bit impolite but he hadnt actually said anything that bad but the other fights he had a confused memory of actually being there at the time of the other altercationshe hadnt been of course but finally he decided that someone who had been in earshot must have told him about it when he was feeling heatsick and the memories had leaked over certainly a lot of people knew the quarrels had taken place and certainly none of the parties had been making any attempt to keep their voices down lena and bear avoided him out of embarrassment maybe or maybe they had been advised by their respective deans not to go to him or amily until things calmed down amilyhe couldnt explain her silence she made no attempt to contact him for several days not even after he had a batch of mint drink that the cook was experimenting with sent round to her one the one hand he felt deeply hurt but on the other if he was going to follow caelens advicewhich he washe shouldnt be trying to talk with her anyway it was hard though theyd always been able to count on each other for sympathy and at least a ready listener he wasnt really having conversations with the rest of his friends so much as he was being a referee which wasnt any fun and just drained him he feltwell not miserable no matter what if things didnt sort themselves out by the time ice and stone were finally dealt with mags was determined to get it sorted out but aside from the enervating and irritating effect of the heat and the constant need to pick his way carefully among potential fights and missing his friends and really missing amily his spirits were decidedly low melancholy that was it he went to sleep in that relatively cool spot out in the field at night with a headache hed wake up without one and with the hope that things would be better hed endure the heat and the quarreling all day lena and bear and amily wouldnt even turn up at the same meals as he did and the drain of the heat and the headache would build all day long hed go to a fretful sleep feeling just a little sick from it nevertheless he was absolutely determined not to end up moping and hiding with dallen in companions field besides he wouldnt be that alone out there trainees and their companions were camped out all over the wretched place he kind of resented whoever it was that had staked out the chapel in the middle it had stone floors though it was said to be haunted by tylendels ghost at this point he was thinking a ghost just might be better company than some of the living he had already found out the same day what lena had been doing closeted with dean lita there had been plenty of people listening avidly when marchand was called in and there were enough who disliked machand that the story spread in a great deal of detail rather quickly as mags had rather cynically expected marchand claimed that he had been doing his proteges a favor and they had asked himindeed he claimed they had begged himto use their melodies in his songs from all reports he went on at great length about how he had taken simplistic little apprentice tunes not worthy of a moments notice and improved them out of all recognition of course all the proteges he had stolen work from were conveniently so far away that without using a herald to relay the testimony no one was going to learn the truth soon ah but marchand had a hidden card to play he had young farris brought in to prove his case this had not done him the good that he had thought it wouldthough that might have been because another bard had taken pains to explain that stealing someone elses work and claiming it as your own was a serious breach of bardic ethics so perhaps with his heroworship shaken a bit farris must have been less than successful at proving marchands innocence he did go on at some length that he considered having his tune used by marchand was an honor he didnt deserve however so they got a contradictory answer farris wasnt certain that hed given marchand the melody and the permissionbut he was certain that it was an honor and in his confused way he indicated that if marchand had asked he would have offered the tune with both hands mags would very much like to have heard litas thoughts about that as mags understood it teachers did use student work all the time but it was always with permission beforehand and with full credit not appropriated without or with illinformed consent and not without credit but with farris partially backing marchands claim there wasnt a great deal she could do other than rebuke him sternly for his carelessness in not giving full credit then according to the sources the volume of the discourse had been reduced to muttering more than that he didnt know since no one was there except lita lena farris and marchand himself lena wasnt talking to him and no one else was talking at all mags was quite certain that if outright theft could have been proved marchand would have been in very serious trouble indeed he suspected that lita was going to ask the heralds for a quiet little investigation into the matter but until they came back with answers marchand had skated by again as it was he was ordered to keep away from farris and not to take on a protege again ever whether or not he would actually do that mags was dubious marchand spent a lot of time away from court and the inquisitive eyes of his fellow bards it would be quite easy to aquire another talented youngster out there and just keep him away from the bardic collegium entirely he could teach this unofficial protege himself even find a position for him in some place that knew nothing of how the bardic collegium worked where if marchand said the protege was a bard and he wore scarlets well then he must be one marchand would have someone to steal tunes from and no one the wiser it just remained to be seen whether getting caught was enough to frighten him into doing his own work again and not resort to what would be fraud so much for marchand he was someone mags would rather not think about except of course it seemed that lena had finally been goaded into standing up against her father openly and that could only be a good thing meanwhile the search for ice and stone went on down in haven nikolas was not only hiding from his daughters temper mags knew he would be extending himself and his resources as far as he could to find the two karsite agents but these two were cut from a cloth that no one in valdemar had any experience with what had always worked before was not going to work now some people surrounding the king thought they had probably left already after all they had been thwarted in a very public manner and their identies had been compromised but mags wasnt so sure of that hed had a look at some of their thoughts these werent men who would take even that grave a setback as the reason to retreat for one thing even if they went back to karse rather than going back to wherever they called home they wouldnt find much of a welcome when they got there they knew enough about karse to threaten a karsite native with demons which meant that they knew very well such things were real and deadly the karsites would not tolerate failure from an unbeliever they barely tolerated it in their own ranks mags was damn certain that he wouldnt risk it for another the fact that they had executed their predecessors for failure indicated that they knew that were altogether likely to face a similar fate if they returned without fulfilling their contract and maybe they were the very best of their kindthey were certainly better than the first batch that had gone outbut even the best can be overwhelmed by sheer numbers and even the best have been trained by someone mags recalled the images hed caught from tempers mindthe harsh environment the rigid rules of behavior the unforgiving nature of tempers superiors no ice and stone would find no sympathy there and it wasat least according to all the history he had been readinga timehonored tradition for the master to eliminate the student who failed if mags had been in their shoes he would lie low wait until vigilance was relaxed and try some other way to at least give the appearance of destabilizing the crown or harming valdemar in a significant way what that could possibly be he had not a clue amily was probably no longer a target there really was no good reason to make her one even with collaborators on the hill everyone was looking out for her now if she so much as stabbed herself with a needle there would be people checking to make sure it had been an accident and the needle wasnt poisoned for all he knew though these men had some way of unleashing a plague on haven and summer was certainly the time to spread disease a plague could wipe out thousands very quickly and the highborn would certainly not be immune unless they left haven even if the king and his family didnt sicken and die it would lay low many of those also responsible for ruling the country orhot as it was dry as it wasif they spread across the city one night setting fires they could engulf the entire city in flames would the hill be spared possibly but in his nightmares he could imagine only too well a scenario in which it would not be where ice and stone set delayed fires of the type theyd tried to set before using candlesand meanwhile had brought wild rats up to the hill and the homes leading up to it affix a box full of smoldering tinder to the rat and turn it looseeventually it will be somewhere that will burninside walls in stables full of hay in a storage room do that fifty sixty seventy timesand the manors on the hill if not the palace will catch and burn the privileged seldom know how to deal with an emergency themselves they would be relying on the guard and the constabulary fire service but they would already be down in haven and stretched thin and then what everyone flees to the palace and in the confusion in the crush of panicked people running from their burning homes it would be easy for ice and stone to get inside the walls and start fires there they might not even need to murder the king or try to manipulate him through the kings own at that point with haven in ruins centuries of records destroyed an entire city homeless valdemar would be in chaos for decades and karse would have exactly what it wanted he tried not to think about such things or rather he tried not to think about such things after tentatively mindspeaking nikolas one night about the time he knew the shop was generally empty offering with great diffidence that these ideas had occurred to him and then waiting for an aswer as a properly respectful student should wed considered both of those scenarios nikolas replied but youre the one who has actually picked up some of their thoughts which gives you an edge in understanding how they might react to this setback well put a higher urgency on those possibilities thank you mags mags wasnt at all sure what higher urgency meant but at least someone would be on guard against those possibilities which allowed him to sleep a little better at night he did find out what had happened with the guard healer cuburn that particular spectacle had been very very public bear had stormed down to the barracks and in front of a large group of the guard and more who came when they heard the altercation confronted the man about spying on him for his father then he had unleashed a long tirade on the theme of old men who want their sons to be nothing more than copies but vastly inferior copies of themselves so they can preen about having a boy who duitifully follows in his fathers footsteps yet never have to worry about finding rivals in their own houses according to corwin who had actually been there bears rant had not only been scathing it had hit home with no few of the guard evidently bears father was not the only man who wanted to keep his son under his paternal thumb bound body and soul to whatever the family business or tradition was regardless of whether the boy was suited to it bear had gotten quite a few sympathetic hearers that he probably had not expected enough that when bear was done and had stormed back to healers collegium the captain of the guard had taken cuburn aside and suggested that his men were going to find it difficult to completely trust in someone who had taken the position with the guard for the purpose of spying on someone how could they trust anyone who was no better than a nosy old gossip cuburn had vigorously denied he was doing any such thing and swore that he had taken the job because he wanted to serve the guard who were the first defense of valdemar he swore he would prove it any way that the captain wanted he probably hadnt reckoned on the captain calling his bluff in that case the captain had said you wont object to my arranging a transfer mags didnt know if bear had heard about that part he also didnt know if the captain had actually gone through with asking for that transfer corwin had told him that transfers could take several moons so well he supposed they would only know the truth when cuburn was gone officially bear had been given a stern lecture by his dean unofficiallywell who knew he was still acting as disgruntled as his namesake after a long winters hibernation mags was perversely proud of him actually as proud as he was of lena bear didnt have his father in reach but he did have his fathers spy and he could be certain that every word he had spoken would get back to the man he really wanted to have words with but he couldnt tell them that because he hadnt seen so much as a thread of bardic trainee rust or healer trainee pale green since hed sent them out of his room all mags could do really was concentrate on his studies and on research in the library and the heralds archives to see if anything like ice and stone or the shields they wore had ever come up before and if so had there been any way of finding such things when the ones who were being shielded didnt want to be found he frequently found himself looking back with nostalgia on the time when the most urgent reason to be here was to find out who or what his parents had been then it had only been to prove that he was not the child of thieves and murderers now there was potentially an entire city at risk and he prayed for the weather to break because just maybe all it was going to need was a good hard rain and cooler weather to clear peoples heads since he was pretty sure that virtually everyone else in all of haven was praying for the same thing it was a wonder that the gods hadnt answered before this which dallend tell me an prolly any good priest aint how gods work which don seem fair tme when all were askin fer is a liddle rain he was up in the archives alone when the sound of light footsteps in the corridor warned him that he wasnt going to be alone much longer he sighed he really truly did not want to be bothered right now it was late enough that his daily headache had bloomed nicely behind his forehead and cheekbones and it was only the fact that it was still too hot to sleep in the field kept him up here in the archives and they were female footsteps from the sound of it unless it was a page pages usually didnt come up here unless they were sent so either some female was coming here or a page had been sent here and in either case it was more likely that the desired object of the persons search was mags and not a random volume of heraldic reports he abandoned the passage he had been working on and waited knowing he might as well if that unknown someone was coming here to do research herself he could go right back to what he was doing but if she was looking for him he wouldnt be allowed to get back to work without hearing what she wanted and probably coming up with an answer for her he just hoped it was something triviallike an answer to part of the classwork but when lena came in through the door he was actually shocked he would have expected to see almost anyone but lena lena he said incredulously she ducked her head a little diffidently i hope i didnt interrupt anything important at the moment there wasnt a trace of the bold little tiger who had faced down her father he closed the book and pushed it aside importat aye urgent not smuch oh good i need advice she said sitting down at the little table across from him oh bugger here it comes shes going to ask me for advice about its my father she sighed heavily he wants me to talk to you about an invitation for you and amily mags eyed her dubiously what sorta invitation twhat why men amily he wants you and amily to come to one of those private concerts she said with decidedly mixed emotions warring in her expression its in one of the mansion on the hill i just dont know what to think about him anymore ye think bout him ths same way ye think bout any other thief but whyd e ask fer me i the furst place he looked right into her eyes so she could see the sincerity there yourewell youre mags she replied as if that was answer enough you stopped that madman from burning the stable youre a brilliant kirball player and you saved amily lotsa people saved amily he pointed out with perfect truth she rolled her eyes you are either incredibly modest or incredibly dense she said crossly you act as if you arent anyone special but you saw how those young highborn treated you before you rescued amilylike a hero and now every single person at that concert is going want to talk to you flirt with you ask your opinon on things she shook her head slightly anyone who is there is going to lord it over everyone who wasnt if you turn up there which of course father knows he acts like a spoiled adolescent who just knows no matter how much trouble he gets into he can charm his way out of it this is probably part of the charming his way out of it because it gets im more people what think es next thing t a miracle worker id be sick cept itd take too much energy mags actually did feel a little sick did marchand ever stop trying to manipulate people was there ever a moment in his day that he wasnt scheming and plotting a way to make an already fabulous existence even better the man had adulation hordes of followers he was wealthy he could have virtually anything he wanted within reason but it never seemed to be anough for him hes asking amily too because you are the romantic couple the hero who risked his life to save her and all of that rot she paused i think whazzat sposed tmean he asked that i dont know because he could actually have taken litas lecture to heart this time and this could be a demonstration of good intentions or he could be even more crafty than i thought and its the appearance of good intentions designed to throw any sort of suspicions off she frowned i just dont know i cant tell and oh damn anyway she scrubbed fiercely at her eyes hes being nice to me after i was the one that told lita what he was doing he thanked me for bringing him to his senses i dont know if its real or if its because he knows he wont be able to get to you except through me i want it to be real i still want it even after all i know about him she looked up at him shoulders hunched do you think its real mags tried to figure out how to be sympathetic without being overly sympathetic and failed utterly erm he said and i am not going to cry she said fiercely bear was horrible about it but he was right i am not going to cry over this he doesnt deserve one bit of my concern right ah was all he could manage he studied his hands and thought well he said tentatively amily could stand ter get out i don mind bein shown round like a prize cause i kin git a chance t do th whole boy aint too bright act thet nikolas wants me ter do so hell marchands motives dont even come inter what i decide practically speakin i suppose she replied she didnt sound convinced an nother thing git im tinvite lord wess feller has a eye on im an es sharper nor a good knife i caint go sniffin round marchands head wout hes doin somethin gainst th law but wess wess kin watch yer pa an lissen an prolly git im tsay thins ed ruther not iffen yer pas fakin it reckon wessll winkle it out he smiled rather pleased with himself for thinking of that and made a mental note to add wess to his little company of helpers he didnt have anyone among the highborn just the people around master soren wess would be exceedingly useful and hed gotten the impression that wess would enjoy being exceedingly useful the young lord had often complained that as the third son he had about as much utility as a third leg but she began he shook his head don een bother tryin ter figger marchand out cause it don matter what is motive is point is we make im useful ter us an nothin else hasta matter jest keep yer head on thet cause otherwise es gonna get tyer yer gonna want im t be a real pa tye an yer back where ye was but her eyebrows creased what if he really is trying to do right she thought a moment well this concert thing does look rather bad theres no reason why he would want you and amily there except to increase his own prestige but maybe someone is going to be there that he thinks you or amily should meet i dunno iffen es finally doin right you dunno likely e don even know mags shrugged we got ter wait for it tplay out till then we jest make sure we use im cause damn sure iffen e aint walkin th straight path es tryin tuse us an iffen anythin e owes us fer bein sech a pisspoor father fair she sighed fair he held up a cautionary hand now i aint said yes yet thiss fer two and i gotta go talk tami he stopped looking at the faintly guilty expression she wore ye already did didn ye she sucked on her lower lip and looked at him out of the corner of her eye he didnt know whether to be cross or amused but amused was a lot less trouble than cross wimmin he sighed i dunno why im atellin ye bout tuggin yer pa round an makin im inter yer gamepiece when wimmin do thet natural as breathin she gave him an affronted look no we dont i aint agonna argue tis too bleedin hot targue all right ye kin tell yer pa were gonna go get trotted round like a couplea breedhorses at is stupid party when ist three days from now she said and kissed his cheek before she stood up thank you mags don thenk me he replied turning his attention back to the chronicle hed been picking through im figgerin tget plenny outa this les jest ope th eat breaks afore then or therell be folks pickin fights there too chapter bad enough that the heat hadnt broken but mags was going to have a to really push it to keep from looking like some sort of rude boor by turning up late for the wretched thing that marchand had arranged hed said yes assuming it was one of those evening concerts marchand liked to stage which would have been just fine no trouble at all but it wasnt it started with a party in the gardena garden that was supposed to be something special even by highborn standards with all sorts of cooling fountains and water features then dinner would be served at dusk the fountains would be hushed lanterns would be floated on the still surface of the water features and marchand would perform one small problem or not so small since mags didnt want to look as if he didnt care when the event was taking place classes were going to go practically right up to the time marchands little gathering was supposed to start mags was going to have just enough time to change into his good set of grays before throwing himself on dallen and literally galloping down to the event of course marchand had not bothered to see what mags schedule was before setting the time of the gathering if hed been taking amily pillion on dallen as he always had before this would have been impossible but amily had told him that she didnt mind going ahead of him especially since marchand was supplying her with a carriage and a burly footman to get her into and out of it so all he needed to worry about was getting himself down there and it turned out there actually was a legitimate connection with him and an equally legitimate reason why marchand might be doing him and the highborn mutual favors this was the home of one of marchands highborn patrons an avidone might almost say fanaticfollower of kirball fanatic enough that he was supplying horses to the riders in the interest of having the best possible games to watch now supplying horses to one team was one thing lord wesss father was doing it for mags team because his son was on it but supplying horses to all four that argued for someone who really was interested in the game as a pure gameand wanted to make sure that one team didnt win over another because of superior equipment mags was very interested to meet this man and talk to him it would be a fantastic change from talking and thinking about potential killers mags sprinted through the furnaceheat from his last class to the stables it felt as if he were wearing his kirball armor the heat weighed him down so much it also felt as if he were running in a dream the sort where you are running as fast as you can and getting nowhere at all dallen was already saddled and waiting the grooms had done as they promised mags dashed past his companion into his room hed laid his good grays out this morning by his own mental reckoning he was right on time he shed his trews and tunic washed himself down with tepid water from the basin on the stand and pulled on the trews yes he was going to be right on time right on timeuntil he heard an ominous rumble in the distance he was only halfclothed but he stuck his head out the window anywayto see storm clouds the color of crows wings boiling up out of the west and the next moment a blast of cold damp air gushed across the stableyard dropping the temperature from oven to wine cellar in next to no time even as he watched feeling a bit stunned an enormous lightning bolt slammed into the ground in the distance and thunder rolled and rumbled and shook the building oh hell we are not going to beat that not even if we left this moment dallen observed beat it wed be bare lucky not tdrown the clouds raced toward them as he pulled his head in and the shutters closed then finished dressing taking his time making sure that every tie was tied and every hem was neat while more thunder shook the stable and grew louder as the storm grew nearer because there was absolutely no point in rushing now im agonna look like i don care other folks gotta wait fer me or wuss like i was awaitin till evbody was there sos i could make some kinda grand entrance dammit then again the gathering was supposed to be in the garden outside and everyone at that party if they had not noticed the clouds boiling up had certainly heard the thunder and felt that blast of cold air right now people in expensive clothing that they did not want ruined would be making a headlong dash for shelter things would be utterly confused for a good long time probably wouldnt be sorted out until he got there with luck he might even be able to slip in without a fuss wind rattled the shutters and the first gush of rain hit them as he dug out his voluminous raincape and wrapped it around himself it had flaps that he could tie around his legs to keep them moreorless dry and he did so the oiled canvas was stiff but he wasnt going to have to perform any acrobatic maneuvers in it just get himself up into dallens saddle dallen laid his ears back when he saw mags i wish there were one of those for me oh hush do that thing ye did when ye shed alla thet dirt you werent supposed to notice that one of the grooms pulled a door open rain poured in and dallen still with his ears flat cantered out into it aye well theres a lotta thet goin round it was like standing under a waterfall orwell mags had never actually done that so it was what he imagined standing under a waterfall would be like he was glad that the cape had a hood and he had tied said hood up because otherwise the rain would have just poured in through the neckhole of this thing lightning lashed overhead and the thunder was almost continuous he couldnt hear anything mebbe i should git ye a cane tfeel yer way just remind me how much better this is than the oven we had this morning dallen replied keeping up the pace oh gods this is so much better nor th oven we ad this morn he replied with deep feeling cold he was actually cold it was glorious and his headache had completely vanished with the first chill blast of wind they passed the gate and the gate guards who huddled in their own raincapes with warm light showing at the open door they waved at mags grinning they must have felt the samemaybe more so guard uniforms were dark blue not the best color in the heat and they hadnt been given leave to wear as little as they could mags kept his head down to avoid being blinded by a sudden flash of lightning is there any odds well git hit he asked a little nervously ill see that we dont dallen replied youll mags was at a loss for words for a moment is thet somethin all on ye kin do aye why do you think with all the terrible storms they ride through heralds never get struck by lightning dallen seemed amused his ears were up again however i am not moving out of a walk the streets are too uncertain a walk seemed more than fast enough to mags the rain was coming down so fast that it wasnt able to flow into the drainage ditches on either side of the road and dallen was splashing through an ankledeep swiftly moving stream where the road had been thiss crazy aint never seen rain come down like this once in a very great while rather like the blizzard we got the year you arrived he felt dallens amusement did you bring extreme weather with you not thet i know of he peered gingerly under the rim of his hood but he couldnt make out where they were ow far are we anyroad at this rate about four times as long as it would have taken in good weather bah he wished he had a way to contact their host and apologize which was a little silly since their host was without a doubt very much aware of how bad the storm was and would surely not be annoyed at mags for being delayed hes more likely to thank you for coming at all dallen pointed out still he wondered if he could somehow tell amily what was going on after all he was able to make those who could not mindspeak hear him on the kirball teamhe should be able to make her hear him well if he could contact her at all the members of his kirball team were always nearby and were aware that he was going to do this they practiced it long before they did it on the field and mags was very familiar with how their minds felt hed deliberately avoided amilys mind shielding himself tightly around her so he wouldnt pick up any of her thoughts even by accident this was not just because that was the ethical way to do things but because he would have felt very uneasy invading her privacy like that even if it was inadvertent he hadnt even warned her by mindspeech when theyd been attackedthough he hadnt needed to since it was pretty obvious but if he could contact her at a distance at all this was certainly the time to do so all right lessee if i kin he closed his eyes and let his shields down just enough to send out a tentative thread of thought looking for heror rather for something that felt like her she couldnt be too far away now he and dallen were forced to stay on the road but thought could go in a straight line lots of thoughts most of them along the lines of oh my dear gods we are all going to wash down the side of the hill none of them at all familiar he quested a little farther finally he thought he sensed someone familiar amily he sent tentatively mags it was a mindscream full of fear and panic mags mags help me hel he felt the blow to her head that knocked her unconscious as if he were the one who had been hit dallen felt it too and without prompting lurched into a frantic splashing gallop heading for their hosts manor utterly heedless of his own safety mags pulled the hood off his head and peered through the rain knowing that with two forewardfacing eyes his vision was better right now than dallens was his heart raced and he was afire with anger and fear but somehow cold with it too it had to be ice and stone who else would have taken her he had been wrong everyone had been wrong they had been clever enough to realize that now was the time to try to snatch her precisely because everyone would think they would retreat and regroup after their failure as dallen charged through the rain he thought he saw something ahead of them there he shouted a carriage a carriage pulled by two horses that were galloping at breakneck speed dallen didnt bother to reply he just stretched his neck out and redoubled his efforts and mags locked his grip on the saddle horn closed his eyes and projected what had just happened to every herald he could reach straining until a bolt of pain lanced across his head and interrupted him now they knew not that any of them would be able to get here he opened his eyes and saw that dallen was gaining on the carriage he couldnt make out who it was that was lashing the horses so savagely and he couldnt sense anything human from it which could only mean those strange shields had locked down tight and ice and stone were for all intents and purposes invisible lightning hammered down and hit something just ahead and to the right of the carriage the horses shied sideways sending the carriage careening on two wheels before it dropped back down again the figure on the drivers box looked back he must have spotted them because he sawed at the reins and the horsesnow in a blind panicplunged to the other side of the road and skidded around a corner mag hadnt even seen he and dallen overshot dallen executed a musclepulling reverse and resumed the chase another lightning bolt hammered down and the horses shied this time the carriage skidded back and forth wildly and dallen had to drop back a little mags braced himself in the saddle he could see in dallens mind what he wanted to do come alongside so that mags could jump into the open carriage they could do it if dallen could get close enough then dallen without mags weight on him could surge ahead and shoulder the horses off the road while mags protected amily who must be lying on the floor of the carriage the driver looked back again saw them still on his tail and viciously heeled the horses over again the carriage slewed from side to side and again dallen had to drop back but the horses werent going to be able to keep this up for very long they didnt have the stamina that dallen did not even the fact that they were going downhill was going to help every hair on his body suddenly rose up and he smelled something sharp and dallen swerved violently sideways and another bolt of lightning struck where they had been the heat of it scorched his cheek it was so close and it seemed to suck all the breath out of his body and blind him all at onceand the thunder nearly flattened him into the saddle for a moment he fought for air mind utterly blank when his mind came back the carriage was lengths ahead of them and dallen was standing like a horse made of stone and both of them were steaming his whole body tingled painfully his skin felt burned and for a moment he had trouble thinking of what they were supposed to be doing suddenly dallen shook himself all over and lurched into a gallop again mags tried to make his mind work but it was moving slowly thoughts blundering around like blind beetles dallen closed the distance between themselves and the carriage and mags finally felt his mind staggering back to normal the driver wasnt looking back did he think theyd been struck had he somehow been the one that caused the strike it didnt matter all that mattered was the carriage and making the jump dallen closed the gap his nose was practically at the rear wheel now his head was alongside the rear wheel mags tensed and raised up in the stirrups this would take incredible timing rain torrented down making it even harder he would have to land right in the carriage because in this rain the chance of catching the side and saving himself wasnot good a little more just a little neither he nor dallen saw the object that hurtled out of the carriage into thembut they both felt it it was big and solid enough to slam into dallens neck and flank with terrible force and neither of them were ready for it dallen lost his footing started to go over fought for it hurtling sideways on the sluice that was the street as mags clung desperately to the saddle breath completely rammed out of him they both knew at the same moment when dallen was not going to be able to keep his feet mags flung up his arms to shield his head dallen fell with as much control as he could muster the pavement slammed into both of them and everything went black mags mags mags hurtled up out of unconsciousness like a panicked starling shooting into the sky his eyes flew open his body registered rain his mind recognized heralds and his memory shouted amily he tried to lurch to his feet someone held him down he flailed at them lemme go lemme go they got amily theyre gittin away lemme go a stranger in heralds whites grabbed his head in both hands and forced him to stop struggling mags its too late theyre long gone we got here to find you and dallen lying in the street and no sign of them he stared at the man without comprehension for a long long moment no he croaked nothey caint yes said the man with compassion but without any attempt to soften the blow they can and they did a million things raced through his mind he wanted to burst into tears he wanted to shove this fellow off him and go running down the street he wanted to scream or pull lightning down out of the sky himself or he did none of these things for none of them would get amily back instead he looked up into the strangers face whatwhat do i do he asked what do we do the stranger gave him a long searching look then nodded they wont kill her they wont even hurt her for now he said if theyd wanted to do that they wouldnt have gone to all this trouble so for now we go back where we have resources and you tell us everything you can think you can stand he took his hand off mags and his knee off mags chest mags lurched to his feet stumbled in the rain and looked around to his great relief he saw dallen also on his feet even if the companions head was hanging so low his nose touched the street dallen im all right bruised nothing broken and furious the companion raised his head and looked into mags face pure rage blazed at mags from the blue eyes anything broken asked the stranger dallen says no i meant you the stranger interrupted mags took a deep breathor tried to every muscle in his chest suddenly constricted painfully but there werent any stabbing sensations and he answered don thin so blessed cernos i have no idea how that happened do you see that the stranger pointed to a rectangular shape lying off to the side of the road mags guessed it was about at long as he was tall that was a seat in the carriage at a guess there was one of them driving and one on the floor making sure the girl didnt bounce out or come to and jump out he ripped out that seat and flung it at you when you came alongside it probably weighs about as much as you do oh well that explained what had hurtled into them you can thank all that game practice for keeping you both from breaking your necks the stranger who had an oddly familiar look to him raised his head rain streaming over him as he closed his eyes for a moment there everyone knows youre all intact friends are bringing nikolas up from haven he whistled shrilly and a moment later an extremely tall companion came trotting in through the rain curtains any sign the stranger asked his companion the companion blew out a disgusted snort and shook his head vigorously well it was worth trying if anything could track them in this muck it would be you the stranger sighed and turned back to mags all right lets get you into the saddle id rather you didnt walk too far until a healer has a chance to look at you obediently mags turned toward dallen but the strangers companion shouldered in between them the blue eyes bored into his not dallen hes in no better shape than you are said a crisp clear mindvoice with the sound of bells in it my saddle uh oh aight he replied blinking and with every muscle in his body screaming in protest he reached up to the saddle horn he managed that but he couldnt get his foot high enough to go into the stirrup before he could think he felt the stranger boost him so he did manage to scramble into place the strange herald started trudging up the street plowing with determination through the downpour his companion followed and dallen moved painfully alongside who is that he asked dallen half of his mind trying to figure out why the stranger looked so familiar the other half trying to think of some way any way he could find amily and get her back sedric dallen replied shortly that name was familiar youre lucky i was close and im a strong mindspeaker said sedric i have literally just gotten back from my first circuit i was waiting out the rain at master sorens when i heard you shouting you know master soren mags asked still thinking furiously but fruitlessly i should i just proposed to lydia there was a sort of grim amusement in his voice its a damn good thing she doesnt believe in evil portents i suppose evil lydia with his mind racing in a hundred directions he tried to make sense of that youyoure going to marry lydia she seems to think so im glad she knows what shes getting into or this would likely have sent her screaming away from me sedric waited for a moment for the two companions to catch up with him and he put a steadying hand on dallens shoulder when he stumbled a little if yourewhy didnt i know about this mags asked staring down at the young man because my dear naive trainee its generally not a good idea for the heir to the throne to broadcast his choice of wife when hes about to be away from the palace for two years sedric said dryly father tentatively approved when i left provided lydia felt the same when i got back reasonablewell my head knew it was reasonable even though my heart was sobbing worse than a mooncalf lover in one of marchands treacly ballads and we will not mention in polite company how other parts of me took the edict finally the words penetrated the fog of anger and grief and guilt that swirled around inside him sedric prince sedric herald prince sedric the son of king kirils first marriagemade when the king himself was still a very young princea marriage of state in which the poor bride very very much older than the prince had not survived the birth of her son a son who had been raised by the very young second wife the love match a situation that in ballads at least was not inclined to end well mother was incensed on my behalf he said fondly then sighed dammitall these bastards have a wretched sense of timing shed be beside herself with joy except that right now shes beside herself with worry over amily itsits all my mags began the grief starting to overpower everything else you can just stop that foolishness right now trainee sedric said fiercely looking up at him through the rain his eyes blazing as dallens had i know that you are thinking that if you had been with her she wouldnt be in their hands now it is not your fault it cannot possibly be your fault did you call this damned storm his relentless logic startled mags uh no there you are now listen to someone who knows from experience if you wallow in guilt you are wasting time you could be using to help figure out a way to get her back you have only so much time and so much thinking power so concentrate it all on her when mags nodded slowly he appeared satisfied and hunched his head down against the rain again now all i know is what ive been getting from fathers letters and in bits and pieces from everyone mindshouting right now begin at the beginning what in hell has been going on while i was gone chapter for all of sedrics grim determination no solutions presented themselves and mags felt himself teetering on the very brink of utter despair nikolas had already plunged headlong into that state and for once it was the king and queen who were trying to comfort the kings own not the other way around lena blamed herself she was the one after all who had persuaded mags and amily to leave the safety of the palace to go to marchands concert mags of course knew that this was his faulthe should have said no he could have asked to get off from that last class and gone with her he had done neither and this was the result marchand who had made all the arrangements babbled about them to anyone who would listen and had not thought anything amiss when a strange carriage and driver appeared instead of the one he had hired he blamed everyone but himself the karsite agents had made no contact nor any demands but that was only a matter of time or amilys lifeless body would turn up that was something no one wanted to think about but it hovered in the back of everyones thoughts like a specter if the karsite agents wanted to destroy the kings own now it would be heartbreakingly simple to do so they had to know that if that happened well mags would find them and kill them or die trying if amilys kidnapping had affected only those who loved her it would have been hideous but the situation was being made even worse by the fact that it was getting political with one faction demanding that nikolas resign his position as if he could another faction spinning hysterical suppositions about what demands the kidnappers were going to make and a third faction quite ready willing and able to declare war on karse and take the army across the border and we all know how well that works sedric had said dryly always supposing that the goal is to get an innocent girl slaughtered and send her father and probably a good portion of the heraldic circle insane by the time the third day of amilys captivity dawned every possible wild scheme had been floated from sending an army of bloodhounds which they didnt have to quarter haven to turning out and searching every single building within the boundary mags was nursing a cup of teawhich was just about all he could managewhen bear finally turned up and sat down beside him talk to me bear demanded seriously talk to me mags shook his head bear grabbed him by the shoulder look he said sharply im not asking you to talk to me because i want to go all softy oozywoozyoo on you and pat you on the shoulder and go there there i want you to talk to me because you havent offered up any ideas but i know you mags and i know there are ideas in there halfideers mebbe he muttered staring down at the tea thats the point theyre half ideas because theyre still in there bear tapped mags forehead if you talk about them youll move them outside into the light youll be able to get a good look at them and then you can turn them into whole ideas but you cant do that till you get them out right mags replied dispiritedly cause im so good at thet bear smacked him in the shoulder hard more than hard enough to make all those bruises shout in protest stop it bear said angrily or i swear by every god there is i will beat you senseless the mere idea of bear even trying to beat him senseless much less succeeding finally roused mags out of his lethargy he sighed aight look prollem is we don know where they got er we know they aint left haven cause a flea couldn leave haven right now the whole edge of city locked down when i yelled so they gotter be in haven ony nobody kin find er an nobody kin find them its them shields i aint niver seen anythin like em theylikeclamped down like a river clam when i got too near em an thets made them karsite bastards sos nobody kin find em its like they don exist bears brow furrowed as he was joined by a dispirited lena but they dont have a shield on amily do they mags shrugged i caint find er an neither kin er pa iffen they drugged er th way they drugged you there aint much there tfind anyroad bear nodded earnestly well i dont know if you cant find her and you cant find them can you find someone whos thinking about her or them then he shook his head no forget i said that practically everyone is thinking about her that wont help if only there were a way to find those shields a vague memory crossed his mind something to do with he sat up straight bear looked at him with speculation but he said nothing dallen whats thet stone he demanded he sensed dallen wincing its easier to say what it isnt its not alive and its not dead it cant think but it stores memories and the reason its all those things is because if all of the heralds and companions are like a giant spiderweb the stone is the hub in a sense its all of us all of us that are and all of us that ever were so if anybodyd ever seen anythin like them shields then how tfind emd be i th stone he demanded yes but dallens tone grew desperate it was never intended to be used that way all of the connections and the memories thats an accident am i gonna hurt it iffen i go pokin round i there no but it can hurt you mags took a long deep breath an iffen i dont how many people git hurt then there was a long long silence go to the stone take bear and lena tell bear to bring his emergency kit im getting some people who will meet you there waiting for them was sedric and mags nearly backed out of the idea right then and there because if using the stone to find out something could hurt him that was acceptable but hurting the heir to the throne sedric raised an eyebrow at the look on mags face did i grow a second head without noticing mags clenched his teeth puttin me i dangers one thing puttin you i stop right there nobody is putting me in danger this is what we are going to do sedric stopped and snorted we dont need to stand here in the open corridor and blabber about this first we are going to go in there and sit down then i will tell you what we are going to do reluctantly mags opened the door to the little room and bowed the heir inside he and bear and lena followed they all took seats around the table and sedric closed the door now everyone get comfortable bear you are here precisely because you are a healer with no gift which means that no matter what happens you wont be affected i have to tell you son your father has no clue how valuable that is ive been running the pelagir border and a healer you know isnt going to get sucked into a bad situation because he has a powerful gift is worth his weight in gold same on the karsite border the karsite demons go straight for the gifted healers as if you were the ones with targets painted on you bear looked at him in amazement they do sedric nodded now since you arent gifted i dont need to worry that if mags gets sucked into the stone youll follow youll be making sure mags doesnt get into any trouble if he starts to it will be up to you to break him out of the state hes in i assume you know a number of ways to do that bear nodded soberly he pulled off the shoulder bag that contained his emergency remedies and put it on the table open and ready lena you are here to help bear extract mags as a bard with projective powers you can jar mags loose by hitting him with emotion even a projective vision if you can manage it meanwhile i want you to look only at bear never at mags and doubly never at the stone lena actually brightened at that mags got the feeling that she had not only been feeling guilty she had been feeling useless i am here because i am a mindspeaker and i will actually be the one making notes on what mags finds out mags you do not have to remember anything you only have to extract the information ill be the one making sure it gets out of this wretched rock sedric looked around the table then pursed his lips we are waiting for one more mindspeaker to join us i dont know you at all and as you deduced father had a litter of kittens until i explained there would be someone who knows you well acting as a buffer between us now whobefore mags could finish that thought there was a tap at the door and gennie stepped shyly inside mags blinked then heaved an enormous sigh of relief if there was a single person in whose hands he trusted a mindlink other than dallen it was gennie she smiled at him and took a seat beside bear mags looked at the stone it didnt change at all for a moment he doubted not the wisdom but the logic of this but then he rolled his shoulders wincing a little at the aches and began his relaxation exercises all the while keeping his gaze fixed on the stone his eyes unfocused a moment when they focused again they seemed to be looking deep into the stone not the surface he felt gennie as a steady bulwark of a presence trustworthy and reliable felt sedric as a watchful overseer like a referee he felt an held breath leave him as a long sigh then felt as if he were sinking into sleep but it wasnt sleep it was a sort of communion ah its you again aye need to know something how to find those irritations that caught his attention why would the stone think of them as irritations because they are they are in the web not of the web and they cannot be dislodged an image passed through his mind of a useless bit of flotsam in a spiderweb every time the wind blew it vibrated the web irritating the spider but the spider could not get it out it was too big for her strength and she could not cut it free without destroying her creation he passed the image to gennie who passed it in turn to sedric thats interesting but it doesnt help me find them in the real world what do you really want i need to find them he repeated after a moment need not want dammit the thing was being all obtuse and mystical again need want werent they the same thing no he reined in his temper as he felt his control and his ability to communicate with the thing eroding need and want are sometimes incompatible now he groaned inwardly felt exasperation felt despair and again felt his connection with the stone slipping he clawed his way back and felt it regarding him dispassionately you are out of balance im those bastards have someone i trivial in the long run now anger filled him and the stone started to thrust him away until he throttled it down you are out of balance he went through his relaxation exercises again keeping the front of his mind calm while the back of his mind raced trying to figure out how to pry want he needed out of this thing obviously you couldnt force it it would just kick you out if you tried and you couldnt trick itit knew all the tricks you had to ask the right questionexactly the right question every time he felt emotion it tried to shake him out too what had it said i am balance it repeated in answer to his question all right take that at face value that this stone was a balance point and dallen had said that it was at the center of the web of heralds and companions so if he jiggled it with emotionthat jiggled the whole web the web was supposed to stay stable and being linked into it and feeling powerful emotion perturbed the whole thing no wonder it kept trying to kick him out yes maybe that was why other people werent able to get as deep into it as he was because as long as he had a problem he tended to think rather than feel he saved feeling for when he had the leisure to indulge in it yes he needed to know how to find the karsite agents and that was for everyone for all of valdemar trivial valdemar will persist it may weaken for a time but it will return so long as balance persists and i am balance miserablei wont get mad i wont get mad stupid damn thing doesnt it know if the karsites get their way if the karsites get their way this thing only knew what was and what had been it couldnt imagine or plan or do anything that required speculation it wasnt really alive so all it could do was repeat what it already knew if there arent any heralds or companions there wont be a web there wont be a valdemar there was a long long pause impossible thats what these irritations want and theyll get it too now he drew on every unlikely hysterical ridiculous scenario that amily had used to frighten herself with and exaggerated them a hundred times over he flung the whole house of cards at the stone and showed it nikolas going to pieces the king himself falling apart the monarchy in ruins the factions in the court taking advantage of the situation and bringing out every petty quarrel theyd ever had then the karsite army crossing the border with hordes of demons that sought out heralds and companions and killed them until there werent enough to sustain the web and the web itself collapsed when he was done he felt more exhausted than he ever had been in his life if hed had to crawl two paces to reach safety he would never have been able to he felt gennies alarm and her immediate instinct to get him to come out or pull him out herself mags not yet he replied instantly bear says not yet he repeated he waited this thing might not feel emotion and it might not exactly be alive but it didnt want to die either suddenly he was engulfed in a flood of information it overwhelmed him rolled over him then scooped him up and tossed him about like a cork on a raging river finally it tossed him out again leaving him so drained he could barely breathe what do you want i want to find amily he sagged back not expecting an answer which one is amily it seemed to think she was a herald she aint in the web a long long long pause give me your mind he was too weary to object too weary and too desperate to do anything but obey he completely opened his mind to the thing half expecting to be swallowed up in something immensely bigger than he was maybe to never come out again but that wasnt what happened although he did lose all but a germ of his self as he was stretched thin as gossamer on the wind that germ was held tight and cradled safely and finally he sensed amily wisps and hints and glimpses of druginduced nightmare and that was when the thing that held him magnified everything around that tenuous presence in a way he could never have managed alone there was someone with her not ice or stone someone else like smacking the kirball as hard as he could he flung what he got at gennie who caught it and relayed it on such a fragile connection could not be held for long not when he was as exhausted as he was it faded his hold on the stone faded you have what you need you have what you want hold the balance then he found himself lying on the table gasping like a fish out of water theyd been given a little room on the same lowerlevel hallway as the one with the stone in it furnished with chairs an ordinary table and pens and paper it was cool herebut not nearly as cool as the room with the stone bear read over sedrics notes on amily a second time and then a third sedric had taken the originals with him but hed left them a copy lena then divided up the pages and each of them made four copies of the pages they had bear had the ones at the end describing the impressions mags had gotten of amilys captor and the more he read the deeper his frown grew this doesnt make any sense he blurted i know mags sighed tis all like babblin i thin mebbe i was so tired by then i was seein things all cockeyed no thats not what i mean bear exclaimed this doesnt make any sense because it does make sense to me at least now youre the one not making sense bear lena chided you mean you dont see it he looked from face to face around the table they all shook their heads amilys been drugged like i was and theres a person with her all the time and that person is a healer lookhere he pointed at a passagethats something someone who is gifted does with someone who is drugged to make sure they dont burn through the drug too fast but that doesnt make any sense why would a healer do this because hes a karsite religious fanatic gennie suggested fanatics can justify practically any atrocity to themselves the more untenable their position becomes the harder they hold to it and the worse the things they are willing to do to support it she leaned over the table and put one hand seriously on top of bears bear not every healer thinks the way we do the way you do if they did there wouldnt be any karsite healers mags was still trying to put the pieces together whoever was minding amily was a healer would a healer hurt someun or kill em een iffen e was a karsite religious fanatic he asked slowly i i dont think so bear replied after a very long moment he might stand by and let her be hurt or killed but i dont think hed be able to do it himself i mean he could but he would have to be seriously crazy right insane you know sort of an antihealer as seriously insane as that crazy person who kidnapped me and theres nothing in these hints that looks that crazy to me he paused thoughtfully actually someone that crazy would be the wrong person to leave in charge of someone you wanted to keep in good shape they just plain wouldnt be able to do that they kind of feed on other peoples pain sometimes they feed on their own too if you left someone like that alone with amily hed definitely hurt her mags nodded aight could it mebbe be someun thets jest greedy bear looked at him oddly i suppose its possible he scratched his head i never actually met a greedy healer even my father isnt greedy just as bloody arrogant as marchand gennie said crisply bear flushed aye that but i know they have to exist therere plenty of rich people that want a healer all to themselves or want one who who wont take just anyone and i know therere healers that will do that he blinked and regarded mags curiously from behind his thick lenses you think someone could be greedy enough toto take the money of kidnappers to keep their captive healthy mags shrugged i seen a lotta good people since i come thaven but there was plentya priests what came by th mine an took cole pieters lovegifts an looked tother way at starvin kiddies iffen theres priests whatll do thet why not healers last possibility gennie said slowly someone who got in over his head eh it was mags turn to stare curiously someone who oh i dont know was like marchand didnt see any harm in blabbing everything he knew to someone who offered plenty of moneyand yes by the way under threat of truth spell marchand finally admitted that was what hes been doing i thought master bard lita was going to die of a brainstorm right then and there gennie smirked then sobered but what about someone who was taking bribes without thinking twice about it because he thought what was being asked seemed harmless enough then when the karsites grabbed amily they needed a healer so they lured him to a meeting and grabbed him as well now he knows whats going on he knows hes in over his head and all he can do is try to keep amily safe and pray we manage to figure out where they have her honestly i think thats the most likely they all looked at each other in that case marchand is our bardic informant and this healer is the other plant they said they had bear said weve filled in all the blank spaces so if thats true then whos missing from the hill healerside ill go interrupt the king and his emergency council gennie said standing up you lot see if you can figure out a way to find where amily is if they havent already mags nodded and they set aside the notes about amily and her captor and picked up the ones about the irritations mags closed his eyes for a moment as the letters began to swim in front of them webs and vibrations and it was all so complicated he wanted to sleep but no he couldnt he needed to the images that the stone had put in his mind swirled there again vibrations irritations vibrations interference irrita his eyes flew open just before he nodded off what if thet stone was bein literal again thats more likely than not dallen said after a moment thenall that fightin and squabblinthet wasnt jest cause of th heat it was cause them shields really are irritations he turned his mind to gennie and gently poked her still talking what marchand there he sensed her bitter amusement being grilled like a fish why i need t know iffen them rats he was talkin to was meetin him real close t palace he remembered now something that the stone had saidor that he thought it had saidwhen he had fallen asleep in its room that ice and stone were irritations because they were near he waited impatiently for the answer but he didnt push things it was one thing to be impatient quite another to impose that impatience on someone else who was doing you a favor he says he met with them almost every day lord lascal and his family close up their manor in the summer and move to their estate theres only a skeleton staff and everyone around here knows their gardens are pretty free to roam in thats where they met there was a pause he says he thinks they were actually living in a guesthouse on the grounds why well that figgers quickly he explained what the stone had told him and his idea that whatever the stone did worked against the shields that the karsite agents wore to act as an irritant to everyones temper so we look for places where the worst fights are happening and thats probably where they are she said right ill pass that on good job mags they just sent out pages to find out if there are any healers missing from up here ah now there was another reason to be impatient he got up to pace iffen they thin we got a chance at findin amily might could be they kill this healer an er tgether he muttered choking down his anguish at the mere thought so we gotta find em then we gotta get em away from er afore they figger out we actually know theyre there theres gotta be somethin thatll lure em out hell said bear looking extremely disgruntled there goes my plan well it wasnt a very good plan mags looked over at him so mebbe we kin use partf it mags tell bear that there is a healer missing cuburn oh thetll sit well but after bear got mad this bit of information would probably give him some satisfaction he told his friends what gennie had said bear blistered the air with oaths for a good long time when he finally calmed down mags gave him a level look ye done he asked cause iffen ye aint im done bear told him in utter disgust i should have guessed it would be him there never was a more venal aye mags interrupted ye said thet a couplea times what i wanter know is what was yer plan bear blinked at him as the question took him by surprise then shrugged oh its stupid and if we did it thered be more carnage bear sighed you know how when a little one goes missing you go around to all the neighbors and ask if theyve seen her and could they help look i was thinking if we sent out some of the guard and all the trainees with drawings of these bastards or of amily or both maybe somebody might have seen mags stared at him as a plan fully formed exploded in his head why are you looking at me like that cause lenad get mad at me if i kissed ye lissen he explained the whole thing lena and bear listened skeptically at first then their eyes got bigger and bigger until he finished now he demanded poke holes int tell me what aint gonna work the two of them looked at each other i cant think of anything bear said finally well other than the fact you might get killed thats certainly a drawback im countin on thet they seem t want me kickin he pointed out so less they figger out what im doinor they change their minds or you misread them entirely lena put in her eyes round and a little tearful and theyll just kill you he shrugged with an indifference he didnt feel they had a chance and didn that was once lena pointed out the second time they threw a huge great piece of wood at you when you were going at a full gallop if you hadnt been a heraldic trainee and on dallen and had all that training the weapons work and the kirball stuff gotta chance it that pretty much summed it up bear took a long deep breath all right then do we split up go gather all the trainees find that cousin explain this to everyone and mags snorted ell we do i may be crazy but i aint thet crazy he squared his shoulders no now i go talk tking an nikolas an th heir an whotheell else is there an let them poke holes innit then iffen they like it itll hev moren a ghost of a chance gennie tell em im comin he said gesturing to lena and bear and pulling open the door to the little palace room where theyd been left to think i gotta ideer chapter theyd narrowed the spot where the karsite agents had to be hiding down to a blockand it was pretty clear that there was something drastically wrong the closer they got it was a middling sort of area with a mix of cheap shops and houses on the outskirts of haven not the sort of bad neighborhood like the one where nikolas kept his shop but shabby and populated by common laborers the sort of place where you could have a pig or some chickens or even a cow in the yard and the neighbors wouldnt complain because they had the same you wouldnt notice noise here not even screaming because the children were shrieking and babies crying all the time but there were signs of trouble all the way there broken shutters a cart with a wheel off and people fighting over putting the wheel on arguments everywhere you looked and the closer you got to that designated block the more often the arguments had escalated into fistfights even the children werent playing they were chasing each other with mayhem in mind or rolling in the street squalling and tearing each others hair mags got a wide berth though because he was wearing whites whites and not grays for two reasons the first that the full heraldic uniform gave him a little more protection from the altercations around himand would give him a little more respect as he worked his way around the block the second whites made him stand out here and would make him a very visible moving target he worked his way from door to door shop to home exerting himself to form every word correctly so he didnt sound like someone easily dismissed there was no trace of his accent in his speech and he held himself as tall and straight as he could copying as well as he could the captain of the kings guard everyone answered him the uniform got him that they might snarl or eye him belligerently or look as if they would like to insult or even hit him but they answered when he showed them ice and stones portraits and asked have you seen these men hereabouts they were good likenesses the same herald who was going to help bear with his bone model had made it taking mags memories and turning them into a double portrait she was the one who worked for the city guard and constables taking the images of criminals out of victims minds and drawing them and mags figured that the two men would probably have someone other than themselves answering the doorthat healer provided they had the man sufficiently cowed to be trusted to do so or someone theyd hired to run their errands so they didnt have to leave amily every time he showed the picture he was watching for the flash of recognition before a blanket denial when he got it then following the plan he would walk away and wait for them to go for the bait their door watcher would certainly go tell them that here was a herald looking for them and they would come out to deal with him there would be a few moments before ice and stone realized who he was and went for a pursuit rather than just murdering him where he stood those moments he reckoned were going to be the ones of highest risk he had steeled himself for them he was going to have to be well very very good at dodging for what he hoped would be a very short period of time so when he knocked on another nondescript door and started to go into his speech then looked up into the face of stone himself there was a single moment of mutual paralysis the word he was going to say came out in a squeak and he was certain that he was going to die right then right there but he broke the spell first and now the long hours he had spent mentally rehearsing this plan over and over and over gave him the reactions of a ferret and put wings on his heels he ducked whirled and ran stones grasping hands met on air mags was already gone but not running down the street oh no hed already scouted his path a dash to the opposite side of the street up a rainbarrel swarm up the drainpipe and up onto the roof pause look back stone was just about to the barrel ice was three paces behind him holy they were fast now it was fear putting wings on his heels he couldnt yet judge how quick they would be over the rooftops where he had the advantage of being light he had to keep them engaged in the chase and not thinking of anything else no matter what happened he had to keep them running after him long enough for nikolas sedric and a group of handpicked heralds and guards to storm the house take down any opposition and get amily out of there that meant he had to stay just frustratingly out of reach and he had to do it without being able to read their level of frustration he scrambled over the rooftree took a couple running steps down the other side and leaped for the next house he kept his breathing and his pace eventiming his breaths with his acrobatics he could not afford to get winded this one had a bit of flat roof enough to make a good landing platform his landing was solid and he scrambled up the next roof using hands and feet he didnt have to look back now he could hear them hear their feet on the thatch since most of the buildings here had thatched roofs his heart was absolutely poundingand if he hadnt been able to hear them he would never have known that they were there at all they were completely invisible to his mind a tiny sound behind him was all the warning he had that one of them was about to try something he took a gamble and leaped sideways hit the thatch on his shoulder rolled down to the very edge of the roof timing the roll so that his feet were under him when he got there and made a huge leap out into thin air but he knew where he was and his hands closed on a bar that had once supported a sign he swung on it twice then kicked for the balcony farther along the wall nothing fancy and he barely made the catch but make it he did and he was off again using a stanchion to get back up to the roof there were still behind him but hed gotten a little breathing room then movement in the corner of his eye warned him something was going on he risked a glance ice was on the next roof over a flat one that was easier to run on using that fact to get ahead of him aight two can play thet he swerved toward the other roof the very one that ice was about to leave ice was so intent on getting ahead of him that he didnt notice what mags was doing he made a leap for the next roof to intercept mags except that mags was leaping for the roof he had just vacated landing and sprinting back in the direction he had just come from doubling back threw both of the men off by the time they recovered mags was two roofs ahead now he took just a moment to get a good look at them and guage their intentions without stopping of course he leaped for the next roof landed and rolled looked over his shoulder as he sprinted for the next still comin this one would be a twofooted landing and an upslope scramble he got a second look as he crested the ridgeline before he slid down the other side no weapons no obvious ones anyway probably knives somewhere on them but they werent going to throw knives at him on a run like this even if they did want him dead odds were hed dodge it under circumstances like this one no matter how good they were and no one with any sense throws his weapon away even if he has a second or a third well thets mags dallen called they have her shes safe that was possibly the best thing he had heard in a year and that meant he was free now to go to the nextand far more riskypart of his plan he angled his flight so that stone got a chance to cut him off he skidded to a halt on the edge of his roof stared for a heartbeat then dashed between them and hurtled over the side there were balconies there he caught the railing of the highest got his feet on it bounced off and let go caught the railing of the second bounced off let go dropped down to the street rolled to break his fall and ran like a scorched stoat back in the direction he had come from this was a big risk he knew they could run faster than he could on a flat and level surface he just had to hope that they would take enough time getting down from the roof that they wouldnt be able to catch him he had to be street level for this so did they he could not risk them getting even a glimpse of what waited for them just before he reached the square in front of the house they had taken dallen dashed out of a side street decked out in his kirball gear mags grabbed the saddle on the run jumped and bounced into it and as the two of them turned on a pennybit to face the two karsite agents he was in fantastic position to see their faces as they skidded to a halt and saw what was waiting for them all of the members of the four kirball teams all wearing whites all wearing his face now pick a target tkill ye bastards corwins cousin the illusionmaking herald was out here somewhere when mags had asked if were dressed alike kin ye make someun look like me the cousin had snorted and asked how many because there would have been the chance that when they realized they were trapped ice and stone would go for a kill but not if they couldnt tell which of their captors was the one theyd been told to capture the shock froze them long enough for the heralds and guards who had rescued amilyall but nikolas and sedricto close their escape route behind them their streetlevel escaperoute mags saw what was coming in the tensing of their muscles and the sudden flick of their eyes to the right then they moved impossibly fast they had dashed across the square and were halfway up a building before anyone had a chance to move but gennie screamed out the signal mags pip because hed planned for this too these men were no good to them dead and since those shields prevented mindmagic from striking them unconscious there was only one nonlethal way to take them down his hand was already on the kirball stick as the fetcherboostedand guided ball came screaming at him from the side now he let out every bit of his fury at these bastards and stood up in the stirrups and smacked the ball with every bit of strength he had pips ball wasnt going quite as fast so mags ballstill being guided by one of the fetchers from the other teamshit stone in the back hard enough to momentarily paralyze him he dropped off the building like the stone mags had named him for with ice falling a moment later they hit the ground and were swarmed by heralds and guardsmen mags jumped off dallens back and ran for them by the time he got there they were trussed hand and foot with so many separate bindings that you could scarcely see their clothing it was over it was finally over now he would have his answers now they would all have their answers he pushed his way in to stand next to stone who glared up at him the black eyes still opaque still unreadable we know who sent ye he said with quiet menace in his voice an we know why what we dont knowwhat i dont knowis why me whyd ye come after me i aint anythin but good at a game stone stared at him face impassive and then suddenly his expression changedfrom impassive to resigned what mags sensed the shields stir sensed thempoise to strike dallen threw his strength between the shields and mags but mags knew that he wasnt the target he had no time to do anything but fling himself on stone frantically tearing at the mans garments in a futile effort to find that talisman before stones eyes rolled up into his head as the shield contracted suddenly viciously around his mind like a hand crushing a grape it was too late stone just snuffed out heart and breathing stopping immediately as his mind vanished ice followed a heartbeat later and they were left with two rapidly cooling bodies far too many questions and no answers for any of them epilogue heyla mags said softly as amilys eyelids fluttered and she finally woke up she smiled up at him heyla she said is it good news or not so good news tis all good he said sitting down at her bedside and taking her hand in his everthin went jest like bear wanted e says not tworry thet ye caint feel nothin onea th others figgered out how tshut some pain stuff off fer a liddle sos ye kin git some sleep he says tis better nor givin ye bears nasty drinks she just smiled sleepily then her eyelids drifted shut mags continued to hold her hand savoring the momentary peace nikolas had already looked in on his daughter and been satisfied and everyone else seemed to have agreed to leave mags alone with her for a while and mags was not particularly eager to leave outside this room there was more activity going on than the palace had seen in quite some time mags knew about only part of it and not a huge part either marchand was already on his way to a permanent assignment as the bard and chronicler for a guard headquarters at the iftel border he was never to be allowed to leaveunder house arrest for the rest of his life lita had wanted to burn his gift out and send him to real imprisonment but truth spell wielded ruthlessly could not prove him to be anything worse than foolish and greedy cuburn was on his way to a similar fate as the permanent healerinresidence to prisoners at greyscarp prison he was never to be allowed to leave either and the only difference between him and the prisoners he cared for would be that there were no bars on his windows security at the palace and collegiawell it was not going to be anything like the same someone had sent down to the ambassador to the shinain to try to find out if they had ever heard of anyone who was at all like ice and stone if the little hints that mags had picked up were even remotely true there were sleeperagents of their own on the karsite side who were going to be activated with the sole purpose of discovering how the karsites had found these men and perhaps where they came from the bodies had been carefully preserved and were going to be delivered to a karsite border posta very unsubtle message that the best that karse could send was no match for the people of valdemar sedric had been assigned to study the stone because no one had ever guessed it was semialive that was fine with mags if he never had to talk to it again it would be too soon working on the assumption that it was only a matter of time before more of these mysterious assassins turned up in haven pretty much everyone had decided that getting amily ambulatory and trained to defend herself should be a priority right along with reinforcing palace security so bear and his team had gone into intense and detailed practiceso much so that the actual work on her leg turned out to be anticlimactic everything had gone well the result was everything anyone could have wanted outside this room the hill buzzed with so much activity that it looked like a hive preparing for winter in here in here was momentary peace it would not last past the moment he crossed the threshold but for now at least peace held mags and his love in the shelter of its hands and for right now this moment that was enough
