from the point of view of literature the great war of today has brought us into a new and closer sympathy with the england of the past dr woods and mr baltzly in their recent careful study of european warfare is war diminishing come to the conclusion that england during the period of her great activity in the world has been fighting about half the time we had begun to look on war as belonging to the past and insensibly fallen into the view of buckle that in england a love of war is as a national taste utterly extinct now we have awakened to realise that we belong to a people who have been fighting about half the time thus it is for instance that we witness a revival of interest in wordsworth not that wordsworth the highpriest of nature among the solitary lakes whom we have never forsaken but the wordsworth who sang exultantly of carnage as gods daughter today we turn to the warlike wordsworth the stern patriot hurling defiance at the enemies who threatened our island fortress as the authentic voice of england but this new sense of community with the past comes to us again and again on every hand when today we look back to the records of the past i chance to take down the epistles of erasmus and turn to the letters which the great humanist of rotterdam wrote from cambridge and london four hundred years ago when young henry viii had just suddenly in plunged into war one reads them today with vivid interest for here in the supple and sensitive brain of the old scholar we see mirrored precisely the same thoughts and the same problems which exercise the more scholarly brains of today erasmus as his pangerman friends liked to remind him was a sort of german but he was nevertheless what we should now call a pacifist he can see nothing good in war and he eloquently sets forth what he regards as its evils it is interesting to observe how even in its small details as well as in its great calamities war brought precisely the same experiences four centuries ago as today prices are rising every day erasmus declares taxation has become so heavy that no one can afford to be liberal imports are hampered and wine is scarce it is difficult even to get ones foreign letters in fact the preparations of war are rapidly changing the genius of the island thereupon erasmus launches into more general considerations on war even animals he points out do not fight save rarely and then with only those of other species and moreover not like us with machines upon which we expend the ingenuity of devils in every war also it is the noncombatants who suffer most the people build cities and the folly of their rulers destroys them the most righteous the most victorious war brings more evil than good and even when a real issue is in dispute it could better have been settled by arbitration the moral contagion of a war moreover lasts long after the war is over and erasmus proceeds to express himself freely on the crimes of fighters and fighting erasmus was a cosmopolitan scholar who habitually dwelt in the world of the spirit and in no wise expressed the general feelings either of his own time or ours it is interesting to turn to a very ordinary it may be typical englishman who lived a century later again in a period of war and also of quite ordinary and but moderately glorious war john rous a cambridge graduate of old suffolk family was in appointed incumbent of santon downham then called a town though now it has dwindled away almost to nothing here or rather at weeting or at brandon where he lived rous began two years later on the accession of charles i a private diary which was printed by the camden society sixty years ago and has probably remained unread ever since unless as in the present case by some person of antiquarian tastes interested in this remote corner of east anglia but today one detects a new streak of interest in this ancient series of miscellaneous entries where we find that war brought to the front the very same problems which confront us today santon downham lies in a remote and desolate and salubrious region not without its attractions today nor for all its isolation devoid of ancient and modern associations for here in weeting parish we have the great prehistoric centre of the flint implement industry still lingering on at brandon after untold ages a shrine of the archaeologist and here also or at all events near by at lackenheath doubtless a shrine also for all men in khaki the villager proudly points out the unpretentious little house which is the ancestral home of the kitcheners who lie in orderly rank in the churchyard beside the old church notable for its rarely quaint mediaeval carvings rous was an ordinary respectable type of country parson a solid englishman cautious and temperate in his opinions even in the privacy of his diary something of a country gentleman as well as a scholar and interested in everything that went on in the seasons crops in the rising price of produce in the execution of a youth for burglary or the burning of a woman for murdering her husband he frequently refers to the outbreak of plague in various parts of the country and notes for instance that cambridge is wondrously reformed since the plague there scholars frequent not the streets and taverns as before but he adds later on better information do worse and at the same time he is full of interest in the small incidents of nature around him and notes for instance how a crow had built a nest and laid an egg in the poke ofthe topsail of the windmill but rouss diary is not concerned only with matters of local interest all the rumours of the world reached the vicar of downham and were by him faithfully set down from day to day europe was seething with war these were the days of that famous thirty years war of which we have so often heard of late and from time to time england was joining in the general disturbance whether in france spain or the netherlands as usual the english attack was mostly from the basis of the fleet and never before rous notes had england possessed so great and powerful a fleet soon after the diary begins the english expedition to rochelle took place and a version of its history is here embodied rous was kept in touch with the outside world not only by the proclamations constantly set up at thetford on the corner post of the bell innstill the centre of that ancient townbut by as numerous and as varied a crop of reports as we find floating among us today often indeed of very similar character the vicar sets them down not committing himself to belief but with a patient confidence that time may tell us what we may safely think in the meanwhile measures with which we are familiar today were actively in progress recruits or voluntaries were being gathered up by the drum many soldiers mostly irish were billeted sometimes not without friction all over east anglia the coasts were being fortified the price of corn was rising and even the problem of international exchange is discussed with precise data by rous on one occasion in rous reports a discussion concerning the rochelle expedition which exactly counterparts our experience today he was at brandon with two gentlemen named paine and howlet when the former began to criticise the management of the expedition disputing the possibility of its success and then fell in general to speak distrustfully of the voyage and then of our war with france which he would make our king the cause of and so went on to topics of old popular discontent of the great cost the hazard to ships etc rous like a good patriot thought it foul for any man to lay the blame upon our own king and state i told them i would always speak the best of what our king and state did and think the best too till i had good grounds and then in his diary he comments that he saw hereby what he had often seen before that men be disposed to speak the worst of state business as though it were always being mismanaged and so nourish a discontent which is itself a worse mischief and can only give joy to false hearts that is a reflection which comes home to us today when we find the descendants of mr paine following so vigorously the example which the parson of downham reprobated that little incident at brandon however and indeed the whole picture of the ordinary english life of his time which rous sets forth suggest a wider reflection we realise what has always been the english temper it is the temper of a vigorous independent opinionated freespoken yet sometimes suspicious people among whom every individual feels in himself the impulse to rule it is also the temper of a people always prepared in the face of danger to subordinate these native impulses the one tendency and the other opposing tendency are alike based on the history and traditions of the race fifteen centuries ago sidonius apollinaris gazed inquisitively at the saxon barbarians most ferocious of all foes who came to aquitania with faces daubed with blue paint and hair pushed back over their foreheads shy and awkward among the courtiers free and turbulent when back again in their ships they were all teaching and learning at once and counted even shipwreck as good training one would think the bishop remarks that each oarsman was himself the archpirate these were the men who so largely went to the making of the anglosaxon and sidonius might doubtless still utter the same comment could he observe their descendants in england today every englishman believes in his heart however modestly he may conceal the conviction that he could himself organise as large an army as kitchener and organise it better but there is not only the instinct to order and to teach but also to learn and to obey for every englishman is the descendant of sailors and even this island of britain seemed to men of old like a great ship anchored in the sea nothing can overcome the impulse of the sailor to stand by his post at the moment of danger and to play his sailorly part whatever his individual convictions may be concerning the expedition to rochelle or the expedition to the dardanelles or even concerning his right to play no part at all that has ever been the englishmans impulse in the hour of peril of his island ship of state as today we see illustrated in an almost miraculous degree it is the saving grace of an obstinately independent and indisciplinable people yet let us not forget that this same english temper is shown not only in warfare not only in adventure in the physical world but also in the greater andmay we not sayequally arduous tasks of peace for to build up is even yet more difficult than to pull down to create new life a still more difficult and complex task than to destroy it our english habits of restless adventure of latent revolt subdued to the ends of law and order of uncontrollable freedom and independence are even more fruitful here in the organisation of the progressive tasks of life than they are in the organisation of the tasks of war that is the spirit in which these essays have been written by an englishman of english stock in the narrowest sense whose national and family instincts of independence and warfare have been transmuted into a preoccupation with the more constructive tasks of life it is a spirit which may give to these little essaysmostly produced while war was in progressa certain unity which was not designed when i wrote them odalton letters of sidonius vol ii p ii evolution and war the great war of today has rendered acute the question of the place of warfare in nature and the effect of war on the human race these have long been debated problems concerning which there is no complete agreement but until we make up our minds on these fundamental questions we can gain no solid ground from which to face serenely or at all events firmly the crisis through which mankind is now passing it has been widely held that war has played an essential part in the evolutionary struggle for survival among our animal ancestors that war has been a factor of the first importance in the social development of primitive human races and that war always will be an essential method of preserving the human virtues even in the highest civilisation it must be observed that these are three separate and quite distinct propositions it is possible to accept one or even two of them without affirming them all if we wish to clear our minds of confusion on this matter so vital to our civilisation we must face each of the questions by itself it has sometimes been maintainednever more energetically than today especially among the nations which most eagerly entered the present conflictthat war is a biological necessity war we are told is a manifestation of the struggle for life it is the inevitable application to mankind of the darwinian law of natural selection there are however two capital and final objections to this view on the one hand it is not supported by anything that darwin himself said and on the other hand it is denied as a fact by those authorities on natural history who speak with most knowledge that darwin regarded war as an insignificant or even nonexistent part of natural selection must be clear to all who have read his books he was careful to state that he used the term struggle for existence in a metaphorical sense and the dominant factors in the struggle for existence as darwin understood it were natural suitability to the organic and inorganic environment and the capacity for adaptation to circumstances one species flourishes while a less efficient species living alongside it languishes yet they may never come in actual contact and there is nothing in the least approaching human warfare the conditions much more resemble what among ourselves we may see in business where the better equipped species that is to say the big capitalist flourishes while the less well equipped species the small capitalist succumbs mr chalmers mitchell secretary of the london zoological society and familiar with the habits of animals has lately emphasised the contention of darwin and shown that even the most widely current notions of the extermination of one species by another have no foundation in fact thus the thylacine or tasmanian wolf the fiercest of the marsupials has been entirely driven out of australia and its place taken by a later and higher animal of the dog family the dingo but there is not the slightest reason to believe that the dingo ever made war on the thylacine if there was any struggle at all it was a common struggle against the environment in which the dingo by superior intelligence in finding food and rearing young and by greater resisting power to climate and disease was able to succeed where the thylacine failed again the supposed war of extermination waged in europe by the brown rat against the black rat is as chalmers mitchell points out pure fiction in england where this war is said to have been ferociously waged both rats exist and flourish and under conditions which do not usually even bring them into competition with each other the black rat mus rattus is smaller than the other but more active and a better climber he is the rat of the barn and the granary the brown or norway rat mus decumanus is larger but less active a burrower rather than a climber and though both rats are omnivorous the brown rat is more especially a scavenger he is the rat of sewers and drains the black rat came to northern europe firstboth of them probably being asiatic animalsand has no doubt been to some extent replaced by the brown rat who has been specially favoured by the modern extension of drains and sewers which exactly suit his peculiar tastes but each flourishes in his own environment neither of them is adapted to the others environment there is no war between them nor any occasion for war for they do not really come into competition with each other the cockroaches or blackbeetles furnish another example these pests are comparatively modern and their great migrations in recent times are largely due to the activity of human commerce there are three main species of cockroachthe oriental the american and the german or croton bugand they flourish near together in many countries though not with equal success for while in england the oriental is most prosperous in america the german cockroach is most abundant they are seldom found in actual association each is best adapted to a particular environment there is no reason to suppose that they fight it is so throughout nature animals may utilise other species as food but that is true of even the most peaceable and civilised human races the struggle for existence means that one species is more favoured by circumstances than another species there is not the remotest resemblance anywhere to human warfarewe may pass on to the second claim for war that it is an essential factor in the social development of primitive human races war has no part though competition has a very large part in what we call nature but when we come to primitive man the conditions are somewhat changed men unlike the lower animals are able to form large communities tribes as we call themwith common interests and two primitive tribes can come into a competition which is acute to the point of warfare because being of the same and not of two different species the conditions of life which they both demand are identical they are impelled to fight for the possession of these conditions as animals of different species are not impelled to fight we are often told that animals are more moral than human beings and it is largely to the fact that except under the immediate stress of hunger they are better able to live in peace with each other that the greater morality of animals is due yet we have to recognise this mischievous tendency to warfare so often though by no means always and in the earliest stages probably never found in primitive man was bound up with his superior and progressive qualities his intelligence his quickness of sense his muscular skill his courage and endurance his aptitude for discipline and for organisationall of them qualities on which civilisation is basedwere fostered by warfare with warfare in primitive life was closely associated the still more fundamental art older than humanity of dancing the dance was the training school for all the activities which man developed in a supreme degreefor love for religion for art for organised labourand in primitive days dancing was the chief military school a perpetual exercise in mimic warfare during times of peace and in times of war the most powerful stimulus to military prowess by the excitement it aroused not only was war a formative and developmental social force of the first importance among early men but it was comparatively free from the disadvantages which warfare later on developed the hardness of their life and the obtuseness of their sensibility reduced to a minimum the bad results of wounds and shocks while their warfare being free from the awful devices due to the devilry of modern man was comparatively innocuous even if very destructive its destruction was necessarily limited by the fact that those accumulated treasures of the past which largely make civilisation had not come into existence we may admire the beautiful humanity the finely developed social organisation and the skill in the arts attained by such people as the eskimo tribes which know nothing of war but we must also recognise that warfare among primitive peoples has often been a progressive and developmental force of the first importance creating virtues apt for use in quite other than military spheres the case is altered when we turn from savagery to civilisation the new and more complex social order while on the one hand it presents substitutes for war in so far as war is a source of virtues on the other hand renders war a much more dangerous performance both to the individual and to the community becoming indeed progressively more dangerous to both until it reaches such a climax of worldwide injury as we witness today the claim made in primitive societies that warfare is necessary to the maintenance of virility and courage a claim so fully admitted that only the youth furnished with trophies of heads or scalps can hope to become an accepted lover is out of date in civilisation for under civilised conditions there are hundreds of avocations which furnish exactly the same conditions as warfare for the cultivation of all the manly virtues of enterprise and courage and endurance physical or moral not only are these new avocations equally potent for the cultivation of virility but far more useful for the social ends of civilisation for these ends warfare is altogether less adapted than it is for the social ends of savagery it is much less congenial to the tastes and aptitudes of the individual while at the same time it is incomparably more injurious to society in savagery little is risked by war for the precious heirlooms of humanity have not yet been created and war can destroy nothing which cannot easily be remade by the people who first made it but civilisation possessesand in that possession indeed civilisation largely consiststhe precious traditions of past ages that can never live again embodied in part in exquisite productions of varied beauty which are a continual joy and inspiration to mankind and in part in slowly evolved habits and laws of social amenity and reasonable freedom and mutual independence which under civilised conditions war whether between nations or between classes tends to destroy and in so destroying to inflict a permanent loss in the material heirlooms of mankind and a serious injury to the spiritual traditions of civilisation it is possible to go further and to declare that warfare is in contradiction with the whole of the influences which build up and organise civilisation a tribe is a small but very closely knit unity so closely knit that the individual is entirely subordinated to the whole and has little independence of action or even of thought the tendency of civilisation is to create webs of social organisation which grow ever larger but at the same time looser so that the individual gains a continually growing freedom and independence the tribe becomes merged in the nation and beyond even this great unit bonds of international relationship are progressively formed war which at first favoured this movement becomes an ever greater impediment to its ultimate progress this is recognised at the threshold of civilisation and the large community or nation abolishes warfare between the units of which it is composed by the device of establishing law courts to dispense impartial justice as soon as civilised society realised that it was necessary to forbid two persons to settle their disputes by individual fighting or by initiating bloodfeuds or by arming friends and followers setting up courts of justice for the peaceable settlement of disputes the deathblow of all war was struck for all the arguments that proved strong enough to condemn war between two individuals are infinitely stronger to condemn war between the populations of twothirds of the earth but while it was a comparatively easy task for a state to abolish war and impose peace within its own boundariesand nearly all over europe the process was begun and for the most part ended centuries agoit is a vastly more difficult task to abolish war and impose peace between powerful states yet at the point at which we stand today civilisation can make no further progress until this is done solitary thinkers like the abbé de saintpierre and even great practical statesmen like sully and penn have from time to time realised this fact during the past four centuries and attempted to convert it into actuality but it cannot be done until the great democracies arewon over to a conviction of its inevitable necessity we need an international organisation of law courts which shall dispense justice as between nation and nation in the same way as the existing law courts of all civilised countries now dispense justice as between man and man and we further need behind this international organisation of justice an international organisation of police strong enough to carry out the decisions of these courts not to exercise tyranny but to ensure to every nation even the smallest that measure of reasonable freedom and security to go about its own business which every civilised nation now in some small degree at all events already ensures to the humblest of its individual citizens the task may take centuries to complete but there is no more urgent task before mankind today these considerations are very elementary and a year or two ago they might have seemed to manythough not to all of usmerely academic chiefly suitable to put before schoolchildren but now they have ceased to be merely academic they have indeed acquired a vital actuality almost agonisingly intense for one realises today that the considerations here set forth widely accepted as they are yet are not generally accepted by the rulers and leaders of the greatest and foremost nations of the world thus germany in its present prussianised state through the mouths as well as through the actions of those rulers and leaders denies most of the conclusions here set forth in germany it is a commonplace to declare that war is the law of nature that the struggle for existence means the arbitration of warfare that it is by war that all evolution proceeds that not only in savagery but in the highest civilisation the same rule holds good that human war is the source of all virtues the divinely inspired method of regenerating and purifying mankind and every war may properly be regarded as a holy war these beliefs have been implicit in the prussian spirit ever since the goths and vandals issued from the forests of the vistula in the dawn of european history but they have now become a sort of religious dogma preached from pulpits taught in universities acted out by statesmen from this prussian point of view whether right or wrong civilisation as it has hitherto been understood in the world is of little consequence compared to german militaristic kultur therefore the german quite logically regards the russians as barbarians and the french as decadents and the english as contemptibly negligible although the russians however yet dominated by a military bureaucracy moulded by teutonic influences as some maliciously point out are the most humane people of europe and the french the natural leaders of civilisation as commonly understood and the english however much they may rely on amateurish methods of organisation by emergency have scattered the seeds of progress over a large part of the earths surface it is equally logical that the germans should feel peculiar admiration and sympathy for the turks and find in turkey a state founded on military ideals their own ally in the present war that war from our present point of view is a war of states which use military methods for special ends often indeed ends that have been thoroughly evil against a state which still cherishes the primitive ideal of warfare as an end in itself and while such a state must enjoy immense advantages in the struggle it is difficult when we survey the whole course of human development to believe that there can be any doubt about the final issue for one who writes as an englishman it may be necessary to point out clearly that that final issue by no means involves the destruction or even the subjugation of germany it is indeed an almost pathetic fact that germany which idealises warfare stands to gain more than any country by an assured rule of international peace which would save her from warfare placed in a position which renders militaristic organisation indispensable the germans are more highly endowed than almost any people with the high qualities of intelligence of receptiveness of adaptability of thoroughness of capacity for organisation which ensure success in the arts and sciences of peace in the whole work of civilisation this is amply demonstrated by the immense progress and the manifold achievements of germany during forty years of peace which have enabled her to establish a prosperity and a good name in the world which are now both in peril germany must be built up again and the interests of civilisation itself which germany has trampled under foot demand that germany shall be built up again under conditions let us hope which will render her old ideals useless and out of date we shall then be able to assert as the mere truisms they are and not as a defiance flung in the face of one of the worlds greatest nations the elementary propositions i have here set forth war is not a permanent factor of national evolution but for the most part has no place in nature at all it has played a part in the early development of primitive human society but as savagery passes into civilisation its beneficial effects are lost and on the highest stages of human progress mankind once more tends to be enfolded this time consciously and deliberately in the general harmony of nature p chalmers mitchell evolution and the war on the advantages of war in primitive society see w macdougals social psychology ch xi it is doubtless a task beset by difficulties some of which are set forth in no hostile spirit by lord cromer thinking internationally nineteenth century july but the statement of most of these difficulties is enough to suggest the solutioniii war and eugenics in dealing with war it is not enough to discuss the place of warfare in nature or its effects on primitive peoples even if we decide that the general tendency of civilisation is unfavourable to war we have scarcely settled matters it is necessary to push the question further home primitive warfare among savages when it fails to kill may be a stimulating and invigorating exercise simply a more dangerous form of dancing but civilised warfare is a different kind of thing to a very limited extent depending on or encouraging the prowess of the individual fighting men and to be judged by other standards what precisely is the measurable effect of war if any on the civilised human breed if we want to know what to do about war in the future that is the question we have to answer wars are not paid for in wartime said benjamin franklin the bill comes later franklin who was a pioneer in many so fields seems to have been a pioneer in eugenics also by arguing that a standing army diminishes the size and breed of the human species he had however no definite facts wherewith to demonstrate conclusively that proposition even today it cannot be said that there is complete agreement among biologists as to the effect of war on the race thus we find a distinguished american zoologist chancellor starr jordan constantly proclaiming that the effect of war in reversing selection is a great overshadowing truth of history warlike nations he declares become effeminate while peaceful nations generate a fiercely militant spirit another distinguished american scientist professor ripley in his great work the races of europe likewise concludes that standing armies tend to overload succeeding generations with inferior types of men a cautious english biologist professor j arthur thomson is equally decided in this opinion and in his recent galton lecture sets forth the view that the influence of war on the race both directly and indirectly is injurious he admits that there may be beneficial as well as deteriorative influences but the former merely affect the moral atmosphere not the hereditary germ plasm biologically war means wastage and a reversal of rational selection since it prunes off a disproportionally large number of those whom the race can least afford to lose on the other hand another biologist dr chalmers mitchell equally opposed to war cannot feel certain that the total effect of even a great modern war is to deteriorate the stock while in germany as we know it is the generally current opinion scientific and unscientific equally among philosophers militarists and journalists that not only is war a biological necessity but that it is peace and not war which effeminates and degenerates a nation in germany indeed this doctrine is so generally accepted that it is not regarded as a scientific thesis to be proved but as a religious dogma to be preached it is evident that we cannot decide this question so vital to human progress except on a foundation of cold and hard fact whatever may be the result of war on the quality of the breed there can be little doubt of its temporary effect on the quantity the reaction after war may create a stimulating influence on the birthrate leading to a more or less satisfactory recovery but it seems clear that the drafting away of a large proportion of the manhood of a nation necessarily diminishes births at the present time english schools are sending out an unusually small number of pupils into life and this is directly due to the southafrican war fifteen years ago still more obvious is the direct effect of war apart from diminishing the number of births in actually pouring out the blood of the young manhood of the race in the very earliest stage of primitive humanity it seems probable that man was as untouched by warfare as his animal ancestors and it is satisfactory to think that war had no part in the first birth of man into the world even the long early stone age has left no distinguishable sign of the existence of warfare it was not until the transition to the late stone age the age of polished flint implements that we discern evidences of the homicidal attacks of man on man even then we are concerned more with quarrels than with battles for one of the earliest cases of wounding known in human records is that of a pregnant young woman found in the cromagnon cave whose skull had been cut open by a flint several weeks before death an indication that she had been cared for and nursed but again at the beginning of the new stone age in the caverns of the beaumeschaudes people who still used implements of the old stone type we find skulls in which are weapons of the new stone type evidently these people had come in contact with a more civilised race which had discovered war yet the old pacific race still lingered on as in the belgian people of the furfooz type who occupied themselves mainly with hunting and fishing and have their modern representatives if not their actual descendants in the peaceful lapps and eskimo it was thus at a late stage of human history though still so primitive as to be prehistoric that organised warfaredeveloped at the dawn of history war abounded the earliest literature of the aryanswhether greeks germans or hindusis nothing but a record of systematic massacres and the early history of the hebrews leaders in the worlds religion and morality is complacently bloodthirsty lapouge considers that in modern times though wars are fewer in number the total number of victims is still about the same so that the stream of bloodshed throughout the ages remains unaffected he attempted to estimate the victims of war for each civilised country during half a century and found that the total amounted to nine and a half millions while by including the napoleonic and other wars of the beginning of the nineteenth century he considered that that total would be doubled put in another form lapouge says the wars of a century spill gallons of blood enough to fill three million fortygallon casks or to create a perpetual fountain sending up a jet of gallons per hour a fountain which has been flowing unceasingly ever since the dawn of history it is to be noted also that those slain on the battlefield by no means represent the total victims of a war but only about half of them more than half of those who from one cause or another perished in the francoprussian war it is said were not belligerents lapouge wrote some ten years ago and considered that the victims of war though remaining about absolutely the same in number through the ages were becoming relatively fewer the great war of today would perhaps have disturbed his calculations unless we may assume that it will be followed by a tremendous reaction against war for when the war had lasted only nine months it was estimated that if it should continue at the present rate and as a matter of fact its scale has been much enlarged for another twelve months the total loss to europe in lives destroyed or maimed would be ten millions about equal to fivesixths of the whole young manhood of the german empire and nearly the same number of victims as lapouge reckoned as the normal war toll of a whole halfcentury of european civilisation it is scarcely necessary to add that all these bald estimates of the number of direct victims to war give no clue to the moral and material damageapart from all question of injury to the racedone by the sudden or slow destruction of so large a proportion of the young manhood of the world the ever widening circles of anguish and misery and destitution which every fatal bullet imposes on humanity for it is probable that for every ten million soldiers who fall on the field fifty million other persons at home are plunged into grief or poverty or some form of lifediminishing trouble the foregoing considerations have not however brought us strictly within the field of eugenics they indicate the great extent to which war affects the human breed but they do not show that war affects the quality of the breed and until that is shown the eugenist remains undisturbed there are various circumstances which at the outset and even in the absence of experimental verification make it difficult or impossible that even the bare mortality of war for the eugenical bearings of war are not confined to its mortality should leave the eugenist indifferent for war never hits men at random it only hits a carefully selected percentage of fit men it tends in other words to strike out temporarily or in a fatal event permanently from the class of fathers precisely that percentage of the population which the eugenist wishes to see in that class this is equally the case in countries with some form of compulsory service and in countries which rely on a voluntary military system for however an army is recruited it is only those men reaching a fairly high standard of fitness who are accepted and these even in times of peace are hampered in the task of carrying on the race which the less fit and the unfit are free to do at their own good pleasure nearly all the ways in which war and armies disturb the normal course of affairs seem likely to interfere with eugenical breeding and none to favour it thus at one time in the napoleonic wars the french age of conscription fell to eighteen while marriage was a cause of exemption with the result of a vast increase of hasty and illadvised marriages among boys certainly injurious to the race armies again are highly favourable to the spread of racial poisons especially of syphilis the most dangerous of all and this cannot fail to be in a marked manner dysgenic rather than eugenic the napoleonic wars furnished the first opportunity of testing the truth of franklins assertion concerning the disastrous effect of armies on the race by the collection of actual and precise data but the significance of the data proved unexpectedly difficult to unravel and most writers on the subject have been largely occupied in correcting the mistakes of their predecessors villermé in remarked that the long series of french wars up to must probably reduce the height of the french people though he was unable to prove that this was so dufau in was in a better position to judge and he pointed out in his traité de statistique that comparing and the number of young men exempted from the army had doubled in the interval even though the regulation height had been lowered this result however he held was not so alarming as it might appear and probably only temporary for it was seemingly due to the fact that in and the following years the male population was called to arms in masses even youths being accepted so that a vast number of precocious marriages of often defective men took place the result would only be terrible dufau believed if prolonged his results however were not altogether reliable for he failed to note the proportion of men exempted to those examined the question was investigated more thoroughly by tschuriloff in he came to the conclusion that the napoleonic wars had no great influence on stature since the regulation height was lowered in and abolished altogether for healthy men in and any defect of height in the next generation is speedily repaired tschuriloff agreed however that though the influence of war in diminishing the height of the race is unimportant the influence of war in increasing physical defects and infirmities in subsequent generations is a very different matter he found that the physical deterioration of war manifested itself chiefly in the children born eightyears afterwards and therefore in the recruits twentyeight years after the war he regarded it as an undoubted fact that the french army of half a million men in increased by per cent the proportion of hereditarily infirm persons he found moreover that the newborn of that is to say the military class of showed that infirmities had risen from per cent to per cent an increase of per cent nor is the status quo entirely brought back later on for the bad heredity of the increased number of defectives tends to be still further propagated even though in an attenuated form as a matter of fact tschuriloff found that the proportion of exemptions from the army for infirmity increased enormously from per cent in to per cent in declining later to per cent in though he is careful to point out that this result must not be entirely ascribed to the reversed selection of wars there could however be no doubt that most kinds of infirmities became more frequent as a result of military selection lapouges more recent investigation into the results of the francoprussian war of were of similar character when examining the recruits of he found that these children of the war were inferior to those born earlier and that there was probably an undue proportion of defective individuals among their fathers it cannot be said that these investigations finally demonstrate the evil results of war on the race the subject is complicated and some authorities like collignon in france and ammon in germanyboth it may be well to note army surgeonshave sought to smooth down and explain away the dysgenic effects of war but on the whole the facts seem to support those probabilities which the insight of franklin first clearly set forth it is interesting in the light of these considerations on the eugenic bearings of warfare to turn for a moment to those who proclaim the high moral virtues of war as a national regenerator it is chiefly in germany that for more than a century past this doctrine has been preached war invigorates humanity said hegel as storms preserve the sea from putrescence war is an integral part of gods universe said moltke developing mans noblest attributes the condemnation of war said treitschke is not only absurd it is immoral these brave sayings scarcely bear calm and searching examination at the best but putting aside all loftier appeals to humanity or civilisation a national regenerator which we have good reason to suppose enfeebles and deteriorates the race cannot plausibly be put before us as a method of ennobling humanity or as a part of gods universe only to be condemned on pain of seeing a company of german professors pointing the finger to our appalling immorality on their drillsergeants word of command at the same time this glorification of the regenerating powers of war quite overlooks the consideration that the fighting spirit tends to destroy itself so that the best way to breed good fighters is not to preach war but to cultivate peace which is what the germans have in actual practice done for over forty years past france the most military and the most gloriously military nation of the napoleonic era is now the leader in antimilitarism altogether indifferent to the lure of military glory though behind no nation in courage or skill belgium has not fought for generations and had only just introduced compulsory military service yet the belgians from their king and their cardinalarchbishop downwards threw themselves into the war with a high spirit scarcely paralleled in the worlds history and belgian commercial travellers developed a rare military skill and audacity all the world admires the bravery with which the germans face death and the elaborate detail with which they organise battle yet for all their perpetual glorification of war there is no sign that they fight with any more spirit than their enemies even if we were to feel ourselves bound to accept war as an integral part of gods universe we need not trouble ourselves to glorify war for when once war presents itself as a terrible necessity even the most peaceable of men are equal to the task this consideration brings us to those moral equivalents of war which william james was once concerned over when he advocated in place of military conscription a conscription of the whole youthful population to form for a certain number of years a part of the army enlisted against nature such a method of formally organising in the cause of civilisation instead of in the cause of savagery the old military traditions of hardihood and discipline may well have its value but the present war has shown us that in no case need we fear that these high qualities will perish in any vitally progressive civilisation for they are qualities that lie in the heart of humanity itself they are not created by the drillsergeant he merely utilises them for his own as we may perhaps think disastrous ends this present war has shown us that on every hand even in the unlikeliest places all the virtues of war have been fostered by the cultivation of the arts and sciences of peace ready to be transformed to warlike ends by men who never dreamed of war in france we find many of the most promising young scientists poets and novelists cheerfully going forth to meet their death on the other side we find a kreisler created to be the joy of the world ready to be trampled to death beneath the hoofs of cossack horses the friends of gordon mathison the best student ever turned out from the medical faculty of the melbourne university and a distinguished young physiologist who seemed to be destined to become one of the first physicians of his time viewed with foreboding his resolve to go to the front for wherever he was he had to be in the game they said and a few weeks later he was killed at gallipoli on the threshold of his career the qualities that count in peace are the qualities that count in war and the highspirited man who throws himself bravely into the dangerous adventures of peace is fully the equal of the hero of the battlefield and himself prepared to become that heroit would seem therefore on the whole that when the eugenist takes a wide survey of this question he need not qualify his disapproval of war by any regrets over the loss of such virtues as warfare fosters in every progressive civilisation the moral equivalents of war are already in full play peace as well as war develops the noblest attributes of man peace rather than war preserves the human sea from putrescence it is the condemnation of peace rather than the condemnation of war which is not only absurd but immoral we are not called upon to choose between the manly virtues of war and the effeminate degeneracy of peace the great war of today may perhaps help us to realise that the choice placed before us is of another sort the virtues of daring and endurance will never fail in any vitally progressive community of men alike in the causes of war and of peace but on the one hand we find those virtues at work in the service of humanity creating ever new marvels of science and of art adding to the store of the precious heirlooms of the race which are a joy to all mankind on the other hand we see these same virtues in the service of savagery extinguishing those marvels killing their creators and destroying every precious treasure of mankind within reach thatit seems to be one of the chief lessons of this waris the choice placed before us who are today called upon to build the world of the future on a firmer foundation than our own world has been set ds jordan war and the breed also articles on war and manhood in the eugenics review july and on the eugenics of war in the same review for oct j arthur thomson eugenics and war eugenics review april major leonard darwin journal royal statistical society march sets forth a similar view it is true that in the gourdon

unknown except as preached by the syndicalist philosopher georges sorel who insists quite in the german manner on the purifying and invigorating effects of a great foreign war although very unlike the german professors he holds that a great extension of proletarian violence will do just as well as war the recent expressions of the same doctrine in germany are far too numerous to deal with i may however refer to professor fritz wilkes ist der krieg sittlich berechtigt as being the work of a theologian and biblical scholar of vienna who has written a book on the politics of isaiah and discussed the germs of historical veridity in the history of abraham a worldhistory without war he declares would be a history of materialism and degeneration and again the solution is not weapons down but weapons up with pure hands and calm conscience let us grasp the sword he dwells of course on the supposed purifying and ennobling effects of war and insists that in spite of its horrors and when necessary war is a divine institution and a work of love the leaders of the worlds peace movement are thank god not germans but merely english and americans and he sums up with moltke that war is a part of the moral order of the world william james popular science monthly oct we still often fall into the fallacy of overestimating the advantages of military trainingwith its fine air of setup manliness and restrained yet vitalised disciplinebecause we are mostly compelled to compare such training with the lack of training fostered by that tame dull sedentary routine of which there is far too much in our present phase of civilisation the remedy lies in stimulating the heroic and strenuous sides of civilisation rather than in letting loose the ravages of war as nietzsche long since pointed out human alltoohuman section the vaunted national armies of modern times are merely a method of squandering the most highly civilised men whose delicately organised brains have been slowly produced through long generations in our day greater and higher tasks are assigned to men than patria and honor and the rough old roman patriotism has become dishonourable at the best behind the times the border of scotland and england was in ancient times it has been said a very paradise for murderers and robbers the warlike spirit was there very keen and deeds of daring were not too scrupulously effected for the culprit knew that nothing was easier and safer than to become an outlaw on the other side of the border yet these were the conditions that eventually made the border one of the great british centres of genius the welsh border was another and the home of a peculiarly capable and vigorous raceiv morality in warfare there are some idealistic persons who believe that morality and war are incompatible war is bestial they hold war is devilish in its presence it is absurd almost farcical to talk about morality that would be so if morality meant the code for ever unattained of the sermon on the mount but there is not only the morality of jesus there is the morality of mumbo jumbo in other words and limiting ourselves to the narrower range of the civilised world there is the morality of machiavelli and bismarck and the morality of st francis and tolstoy the fact is as we so often forget and sometimes do not even know morality is fundamentally custom the mores as it has been called of a people it is a body of conduct which is in constant motion with an exalted advanceguard which few can keep up with and a debased rearguard once called the blackguard a name that has since acquired an appropriate significance but in the substantial and central sense morality means the conduct of the main body of the community thus understood it is clear that in our time war still comes into contact with morality the pioneers may be ahead the main body is in the thick of it that there really is a morality of war and that the majority of civilised people have more or less in common a certain conventional code concerning the things which may or may not be done in war has been very clearly seen during the present conflict this moral code is often said to be based on international regulations and understandings it certainly on the whole coincides with them but it is the popular moral code which is fundamental and international law is merely an attempt to enforce that morality the use of expanding bullets and poison gases the poisoning of wells the abuse of the red cross and the white flag the destruction of churches and works of art the infliction of cruel penalties on civilians who have not taken up armsall such methods of warfare as these shock popular morality they are on each side usually attributed to the enemy they are seldom avowed and only adopted in imitation of the enemy with hesitation and some offence to the popular conscience as we see in the case of poison gas which was only used by the english after long delay while the french still hesitated the general feeling about such methods even when involving scientific skill is that they are barbarous as a matter of fact this charge of barbarism against those methods of warfare which shock our moral sense must not be taken too literally the methods of real barbarians in war are not especially barbarous they have sometimes committed acts of cruelty which are revolting to us today but for the most part the excesses of barbarous warfare have been looting and burning together with more or less raping of women and these excesses have been so frequent within the last century and still today that they may as well be called civilised as barbarous the sack of rome by the goths at the beginning of the fifth century made an immense impression on the ancient world as an unparalleled outrage st augustine in his city of god written shortly afterwards eloquently described the horrors of that time yet today in the new light of our own knowledge of what war may involve the ways of the ancient goths seem very innocent we are expressly told that they spared the sacred christian places and the chief offences brought against them seem to be looting and burning yet the treasure they left untouched was vast and incalculable and we should be thankful indeed if any belligerent in the war of today inflicted as little injury on a conquered city as the goths on rome the vague rhetoric which this invasion inspired scarcely seems to be supported by definitely recorded facts and there can be very little doubt that the devastation wrought in many old wars exists chiefly in the writings of rhetorical chroniclers whose imaginations were excited as we may so often see among the journalists of today by the rumour of atrocities which have never been committed this is not to say that no devastation and cruelty have been perpetrated in ancient wars it seems to be generally agreed that in the famous thirty years war which the germans fought against each other atrocities were the order of the day we are constantly being told in respect of some episode or other of the war of today that nothing like it has been seen since the thirty years war but the writers who make this statement with an offhand air of familiar scholarship never by any chance bring forward the evidence for this greater atrociousness of the thirty years war and one is inclined to suspect that this oftrepeated allusion to the thirty years war as the acme of military atrocity is merely a rhetorical flourish in any case we know that not so many years after the thirty years war frederick the great who combined supreme military gifts with freedom from scruple in policy and was at the sametime a great representative german declared that the ordinary citizen ought never to be aware that his country is at war nothing could show more clearly the military ideal however imperfectly it may sometimes have been attained of the old european world atrocities whether regarded as permissible or as inevitable certainly occurred but for the most part wars were the concern of the privileged upper class they were rendered necessary by the dynastic quarrels of monarchs and were carried out by a professional class with aristocratic traditions and a more or less scrupulous regard to ancient military etiquette there are many stories of the sufferings of the soldiery in old times in the midst of abundance on account of military respect for civilian property von der goltz remarks that there was a time when the troops camped in the cornfields and yet starved and states that in the prussian main army camped close to huge piles of wood and yet had no fires to warm themselves or cook their food the legend if legend it is of the french officer who politely requested the english officer opposite him to fire first shows how something of the ancient spirit of chivalry was still regarded as the accompaniment of warfare it was an occupation which only incidentally concerned the ordinary citizen the english especially protected by the sea and always living in open undefended cities have usually been able to preserve this indifference to the continental wars in which their kings have constantly been engaged and as we see even in the most unprotected european countries and the most profoundly warlike the great frederick set forth precisely the same ideal of war the fact seems to be that while war is nowadays less chronic than of old less prolonged and less easily provoked it is a serious fallacy to suppose that it is also less barbarous we imagine that it must be so simply because we believe on more or less plausible grounds that our life generally is growing less barbarous and more civilised but war by its very nature always means a relapse from civilisation into barbarism if not savagery we may sympathise with the endeavour of the european soldiers of old to civilise warfare and we may admire the remarkable extent to which they succeeded in doing so but we cannot help feeling that their romantic and chivalrous notions of warfare were absurdly incongruous the world in general might have been content with that incongruity but germany or more precisely prussia with its ancient genius for warfare has in the present war taken the decisive step in initiating the abolition of that incongruity by placing warfare definitely on the basis of scientific barbarism to do this is in a sense we must remember not a step backwards but a step forward it involved the recognition of the fact that war is not a game to be played for its own sake by a professional caste in accordance with fixed rules which it would be dishonourable to break but a method carried out by the whole organised manhood of the nation of effectively attaining an end desired by the state in accordance with the famous statement of clausewitz that war is state policy continued by a different method if by the chivalrous method of old which was indeed in large part still their own method in the previous francogerman war the germans had resisted the temptation to violate the neutrality of luxemburg and belgium in order to rush behind the french defences and had battered instead at the gap of belfort they would have won the sympathy of the world but they certainly would not have won the possession of the greater part of belgium and a third part of france it has not alone been military instinct which has impelled germany on the new course thus inaugurated we see here the final outcome of a reaction against ancient teutonic sentimentality which the insight of goldwin smith clearly discerned forty years ago humane sentiments and civilised traditions under the moulding hand of prussian leaders of kultur have been slowly but firmly subordinated to a political realism which in the military sphere means a masterly efficiency in the aim of crushing the foe by overwhelming force combined with panicstriking frightfulness in this conception that only is moral which served these ends the horror which this frightfulness may be expected to arouse even among neutral nations is from the german point of view a tribute of homage the military reputation of germany is so great in the world and likely to remain so whatever the issue of the present war that we are here faced by a grave critical issue which concerns the future of the whole world the conduct of wars has been transformed before our eyes in any future war the example of germany will be held to consecrate the new methods and the belligerents who are not inclined to accept the supreme authority of germany may yet be forced in their own interests to act in accordance with it the mitigating influence of religion over warfare has long ceased to be exercised for the international catholic church no longer possesses the power to exert such influence while the national protestant churches are just as bellicose as their flacks now we see the influence of morality over warfare similarly tending to disappear henceforth it seems we have to reckon with a conception of war which accounts it a function of the supreme state standing above morality and therefore able to wage war independently of morality necessitythe necessity of scientific effectivenessbecomes the sole criterion of right and wrong when we look back from the standpoint of knowledge which we have reached in the present war to the notions which prevailed in the past they seem to us hollow and even childish seventy years ago buckle in his history of civilisation stated complacently that only ignorant and unintellectual nations any longer cherished ideals of war his statement was part of the truth it is true for instance that france is now the most antimilitary of nations though once the most military of all but we see it is only part of the truth the very fact which buckle himself pointed out that efficiency has in modern times taken the place of morality in the conduct of affairs offers a new foundation for war when war is urged on scientific principle for the purpose of rendering effective the claims of state policy today we see that it is not sufficientfor a nation to cultivate knowledge and become intellectual in the expectation that war will automatically go out of fashion it is quite possible to become very scientific most relentlessly intellectual and on that foundation to build up ideals of warfare much more barbarous than those of assyria the conclusion seems to be that we are today entering on an era in which war will not only flourish as vigorously as in the past although not in so chronic a form but with an altogether new ferocity and ruthlessness with a vastly increased power of destruction and on a scale of extent and intensity involving an injury to civilisation and humanity which no wars of the past ever perpetrated moreover this state of things imposes on the nations which have hitherto by their temper their position or their small size regarded themselves as nationally neutral a new burden of armament in order to ensure that neutrality it has been proclaimed on both sides that this war is a war to destroy militarism but the disappearance of a militarism that is only destroyed by a greater militarism offers no guarantee at all for any triumph of civilisation or humanity what then are we to do it seems clear that we have to recognise that our intellectual leaders of old who declared that to ensure the disappearance of war we have but to sit still and fold our hands while we watch the beneficent growth of science and intellect were grievously mistaken war is still one of the active factors of modern life though by no means the only factor which it is in our power to grasp and direct by our energetic effort the world can be moulded it is the concern of all of us and especially of those nations which are strong enough and enlightened enough to take a leading part in human affairs to work towards the initiation and the organisation of this immense effort in so far as the great war of today acts as a spur to such effort it will not have been an unmixed calamity in so far as it may have been so that seems merely due to its great length to the fact that the absence of commissariat arrangements involved a more thorough method of pillage and to epidemics treitschke history of germany english translation by e and c paul vol i p von der goltz the nation in arms pp et seq this attitude was a final echo of the ancient truce of god that institution which was first definitely formulated in the early eleventh century in roussillon and was soon confirmed by the pope in agreement with nobles and barons was extended to the whole of christendom before the end of the century it ordained peace for several days a week and on many festivals and it guaranteed the rights and liberties of all those following peaceful avocations at the same time protecting crops livestock and farm implements it is interesting to observe how st augustine who was as familiar with classic as with christian life and thought perpetually dwells on the boundless misery of war and the supreme desirability of peace as a point at which pagan and christian are at one nihil gratius soleat audiri nihil desiderabilius concupisci nihil postremo possit melius inveniri sicut nemo est qui gaudere nolit ita nemo est qui pacem habere nolit city of god bk xix chs contemporary review v is war diminishing the cheerful optimism of those pacifists who looked for the speedy extinction of war has lately aroused much scorn there really seem to have been people who believed that new virtues of lovingkindness are springing up in the human breast to bring about the universal reign of peace spontaneously while we all still continued to cultivate our old vices of international greed suspicion and jealousy dr frederick adams woods in the challenging and stimulating study of the prevalence of war in europe from to the present day which he has lately written in conjunction with mr alexander baltzly easily throws contempt upon such pacifists all their beautiful arguments he tells us in effect count for nothing war is today raging more furiously than ever in the world and it is even doubtful whether it is diminishing that is the subject of the book dr woods and mr baltzly have written is war diminishing the method adopted by these authors is to count up the years of war since for each of the eleven chief nations of europe possessing an ancient history and to represent the results by the aid of charts these charts show that certainly there has been a great falling off in war during the period in question wars as therepresented to us seem to have risen to a climax in the century and to have been declining ever since the authors themselves however are not quite in sympathy with their own conclusion there is only dr woods declares a moderate amount of probability in favour of declining war he insists on the fact that the period under investigation represents but a very small fraction of the life of man he finds that if we take england several centuries further back and compare its number of waryears during the last four centuries with those during the preceding four centuries the first period shows years of war the second shows years a negligible difference while for france the corresponding number of waryears are and an actual and rather considerable increase there is the further consideration that if we regard not frequency but intensity of warif we could for instance measure a war by its total number of casualties we should doubtless find that wars are showing a tendency to everincreasing gravity on the whole dr woods is clearly rather discontented with the tendency of his own and his collaborators work to show a diminution of war and modestly casts doubt on all those who believe that the tendency of the worlds history is in the direction of such a diminution an honest and careful record of facts however is always valuable dr woods investigation will be found useful even by those who are by no means anxious to throw cold water over the too facile optimism of some pacifists and this little book suggests lines of thought which may prove fruitful in various directions not always foreseen by the authors dr woods emphasises the long period in the history of the human race during which war has flourished he seems to suggest that war after all may be an essential and beneficial element in human affairs destined to endure to the end just as it has been present from the beginning but has it been present from the beginning even though war may have flourished for many thousands of yearsand it was certainly flourishing at the dawn of historywe are still very far indeed from the dawn of human life or even of human civilisation for the more our knowledge of the past grows the more remote that dawn is seen to be it is not only seen to be very remote it is seen to be very important darwin said that it was during the first three years of life that a man learnt most that saying is equally true of humanity as a whole though here one must translate years into hundreds of thousands of years but neither infant man nor infant mankind could establish themselves firmly on the path that leads so far if they had at the very outset in accordance with dr woods formula for more recent ages fought about half the time an activity of this kind which may be harmless or even in some degree beneficial at a later stage would be fatally disastrous at an early stage war as mankind understands war seems to have no place among animals living in nature it seems equally to have had no place so far as investigation has yet been able to reveal in the life of early man men were far too busy in the great fight against nature to fight against each other far too absorbed in the task of inventing methods of selfpreservation to have much energy left for inventing methods of selfdestruction it was once supposed that the homeric stories of war presented a picture of life near the beginning of the world the homeric picture in fact corresponds to a stage in human barbarism certainly in its european manifestation a stage also passed through in northern europe where nearly fifteen hundred years ago the greek traveller posidonius found the celtic chieftains in britain living much like the people in homer but we now know that homer so far from bringing before us a primitive age really represents the end of a long stage of human development marked by a slow and steady growth in civilisation and a vast accumulation of luxury war is a luxury in other words a manifestation of superfluous energy not possible in those early stages when all the energies of men are taken up in the primary business of preserving and maintaining life so it was that war had a beginning in human history is it unreasonable to suppose that it will also have an end there is another way besides that of counting the worlds waryears to determine the probability of the diminution and eventual disappearance of war we may consider the causes of war and the extent to which these causes are or are not ceasing to operate dr woods passingly realises the importance of this test and even enumerates what he considers to be the causes of war without however following up his clue as he reckons them they are four in number racial economic religious and personal there is frequently a considerable amount of doubt concerning the cause of a particular war and no doubt the causes are usually mixed and slowly accumulative just as in disease a number of factors may have gradually combined to bring on the sudden overthrow of health there can be no doubt that the four causes enumerated have been very influential in producing war there can however be equally little doubt that nearly all of them are diminishing in their warproducing power religion which after the reformation seemed to foment so many wars is now practically almost extinct as a cause of war in europe economic causes which were once regarded as good and sound motives for war have been discredited though they cannot be said to be abolished in the middle ages fighting was undoubtedly a most profitable business not only by the booty which might thus be obtained but by the high ransoms which even down to the seventeenth century might be legitimately demanded for prisoners so that war with france was regarded as an english gentlemans best method of growing rich later it was believed that a country could capture the wealth of another country by destroying that countrys commerce and in the eighteenth century that doctrine was openly asserted even by responsible statesmen later the growth of political economy made clear that every nation flourishes by the prosperity of other nations and that by impoverishing the nation with which it traded a nation impoverishes itself for a tradesman cannot grow rich by killing his customers so it came about that as mill put it the commercial spirit which during one period of european history was the principal cause of war became one of itsstrongest obstacles though since mill wrote the old fallacy that it is a legitimate and advantageous method to fight for markets has frequently reappeared again the personal causes of war although in a large measure incalculable have much smaller scope under modern conditions than formerly under ancient conditions with power centred in despotic monarchs or autocratic ministers the personal causes of war counted for much in more recent times it has been said truly or falsely that the crimean war was due to the wounded feelings of a diplomatist under modern conditions however the checks on individual initiative are so many that personal causes must play an everdiminishing part in war the same can scarcely be said as regards dr woods remaining cause of war if by racialism we are to understand nationalism this has of late been a serious and evergrowing provocative of war internationalism of feeling is much less marked now than it was four centuries ago nationalities have developed a new selfconsciousness a new impulse to regain their old territories or to acquire new territories not only pangermanism panslavism and british imperialism like all other imperialisms but even the national ambitions of some smaller powers have acquired a new and dangerous energy they are not the less dangerous when as is indeed most frequently the case they merely represent the ambition not of the people as a whole but merely of a military or bureaucratic clique of a small chauvinistic group yet noisy and energetic enough to win over unscrupulous politicians a german soldier a young journalist of ability recently wrote home from the trenches i have often dreamed of a new europe in which all the nations would be fraternally united and live together as one people it was an end which democratic feeling seemed to be slowly preparing now this terrible war has been unchained fomented by a few men who are sending their subjects their slaves rather to the battlefield to slay each other like wild beasts i should like to go towards these men they call our enemies and say brothers let us fight together the enemy is behind us yes since i have been wearing this uniform i feel no hatred for those who are in front but my hatred has grown for those in power who are behind that is a sentiment which must grow mightily with the growth of democracy and as it grows the danger of nationalism as a cause of war must necessarily decrease there is however one group of causes of war of the first importance which dr woods has surprisingly omitted and that is the group of political causes it is by overlooking the political aspects of war that dr woods discussion is most defective supposed political necessity has been in modern times perhaps the very chief cause of war that is to say that wars are largely waged for what has been supposed to be the protection or the furtherance of the civilised organisation which orders the temporal benefits of a nation this is admirably illustrated by all three of the great european wars in which england has taken part during the past four centuries the war against spain the war against france and the present war against germany the fundamental motive of englands participation in all these wars has been what was conceived to be the need of englands safety it was essentially political a small island power dependent on its fleet and yet very closely adjoining the continental mainland is vitally concerned in the naval developments of possibly hostile powers and in the military movements which affect the opposite coast spain france and germany all successively threatened england by a formidable fleet and they all sought to gain possession of the coast opposite england to england therefore it seemed a measure of political selfdefence to strike a blow as each fresh menace arose in every case belgium has been the battlefield on land the neutrality of belgium is felt to be politically vital to england therefore the invasion of belgium by a great power is to england an immediate signal of war it is not only englands wars that have been mainly political the same is true of germanys wars ever since prussia has had the leadership of germany the political condition of a country without natural frontiers and surrounded by powerful neighbours is a perpetual source of wars which in germanys case have been by deliberate policy offensively defensive when we realise the fundamental importance of the political causation of warfare the whole problem of the ultimate fate of war becomes at once more hopeful the orderly growth and stability of nations has in the past seemed to demand war but war is not the only method of securing these ends and to most people nowadays it scarcely seems the best method england and france have fought against each other for many centuries they are now convinced that they really have nothing to fight about and that the growth and stability of each country are better ensured by friendship than by enmity there cannot be a doubt of it but where is the limit to the extension of that same principle france and germany england and germany have just as much to lose by enmity just as much to gain by friendship and alike on both sides the history of europe and the charts of mr baltzly clearly show that this consideration has really been influential we find that there is a progressive tendency for the nations of europe to abandon warfare sweden denmark and holland all vigorous and warlike peoples have long ceased to fight they have found their advantage in the abandonment of war but that abandonment has been greatly stimulated by awe of their mightierneighbours and therein again we have a clue to the probable course of the future for when we realise that the fundamental political need of selfpreservation and good order has been a main cause of warfare and when we further realise that the same ends may be more satisfactorily attained without war under the influence of a sufficiently firm external pressure working in harmony with the growth of internal civilisation we see that the problem of fighting among nations is the same as that of fighting among individuals once upon a time good order and social stability were maintained in a community by the method of fighting among the individuals constituting the community no doubt all sorts of precious virtues were thus generated and no doubt in the general opinion no better method seemed possible or even conceivable but as we know with the development of a strong central power and with the growth of enlightenment it was realised that political stability and good order were more satisfactorily maintained by a tribunal having a strong police force behind it than by the method of allowing the individuals concerned to fight out their quarrels between themselves fighting between national groups of individuals stands on precisely the same footing as fighting between individuals the political stability and good order of nations it is beginning to be seen can be more satisfactorily maintained by a tribunal having a strong police force behind it than by the method of allowing the individual nations concerned to fight out quarrels between themselves the stronger nations have for a large part imposed this peace upon the smaller nations of europe to the great benefit of the latter how can we impose a similar peace upon the stronger nations for their own benefit and for the benefit of the whole world to that task all our energies must be directed a long series of eminent thinkers and investigators from comte and buckle a century ago to dr woods and mr baltzly today have assured us that war is diminishing and even that the warlike spirit is extinct it is certainly not true that the warlike spirit is extinct even in the most civilised and peaceful peoples and we need not desire its extinction for it is capable of transformation into shapes of the finest use for humanity but the vast conflagration of today must not conceal from our eyes the great central fact that war is diminishing and will one day disappear as completely as the mediaeval scourge of the black death to reach this consummation all the best humanising and civilising energies of mankind will be needed it has been argued as by filippi carli la ricchezza e la guerra that the germans are especially unable to understand that the prosperity of other countries is beneficial to them whether or not under german control and that they differ from the english and french in believing that economic conquests should involve political conquests vi war and the birthrate during recent years the faith had grown among progressive persons in various countries not excluding germany that civilisation was building up almost impassable barriers against any great war these barriers were thought to be of various kinds even apart from the merely sentimental and humanitarian developments of pacific feeling they were especially of an economic kind and that on a double basis that of capital and that of labour it was believed on the one hand that the international ramifications of capital and the complicated commercial and financial webs which bind nations together would cause so vivid a realisation of the disasters of war as to erect a wholesomely steadying effect whenever the danger of war loomed in sight on the other hand it was felt that the international unity of interest among the workers the growth of labours favourite doctrine that there is no conflict between nations but only between classes and even the actual international organisation and bonds of the workers associations would interpose a serious menace to the plans of warmakers these influences were real and important but as we know when the decisive moment came the diplomatists and the militarists were found to be at the helm to steer the ship of state in each country concerned and those on board had no voice in determining the course in england only can there be said to have been any show of consulting parliament but at that moment the situation had already so far developed that there was little left but to accept it the great war of today has shown that such barriers against war as we at present possess may crumble away in a moment at the shock of the warmaking machine we are today forced to undertake a more searching inquiry into the forces which in civilisation operate against war i wish to call attention here to one such influence of fundamental character which has not been unrecognised but possesses an importance we are often apt to overlooka french gentleman well acquainted with the constitution of his country wrote thicknesse in told me above eight years since that france increased so rapidly in peace that they must necessarily have a war every twelve or fourteen years to carry off the refuse of the people recently a wellknown german socialist dr eduard david member of the reichstag and a student of the population question setting forth the same great truth in die neue generation for november states that it would have been impossible for germany to wage the present war if it had not been for the high german birthrate during the past halfcentury and the impossibility of this war would for dr david have been indeed tragic a more distinguished social hygienist professor max gruber of munich who took a leading part in organising that marvellous exposition of hygiene at dresden which has been germanys greatest service to real civilisation in recent years lately set forth an identical opinion the war he declares was inevitable and unavoidable and germany was responsible for it not he hastens to add in any moral sense but in a biological sense because in fortyfour years germans have increased in numbers from forty millions to eighty millions the war was therefore a biological necessity if we survey the belligerent nations in the war we may say that those which took the initiative in drawing it on or at all events were most prepared to welcome it were russia austria germany and serbia we may also note that these include nearly all the nations in europe with a high birthrate we may further note that they are all nations which putting aside their cultural summits and taking them in the massare among the most backward in europe the fall in the birthrate has not yet had time to permeate them on the other hand of the belligerent peoples of today all indications point to the french as the people most intolerant silently but deeply of the war they are so ably and heroically waging yet the france of the present with the lowest birthrate and the highest civilisation was a century ago the france of a birthrate higher than that of germany today the most militarist and aggressive of nations a perpetual menace to europe for all those among us who have faith in civilisation and humanity and are unable to believe that war can ever be a civilising or humanising method of progress it must be a daily prayer that the fall of the birthrate may be hastened it seems too elementary a point to insist on yet the mists of ignorance and prejudice are so dense the cataract of false patriotism is so thick that for many even the most elementary truths cannot be discerned in most of the smaller nations indeed an intelligent view prevails their smallness has on the one hand rendered them more open to international culture and on the other hand enabled them to outgrow the illusions of militarism there is a higher standard of education among them their birthrates are low and they accept that fact as a condition of progressive civilisation that is the case in switzerland as in norway and notably in holland it is not so in the larger nations here we constantly find even in those lands where the bulk of the population are civilised and reasonably levelheaded a small minority who publicly tear their hair and rage at the steady decline in the birthrate it is of course only the declining birthrate of their own country that they have in view for they are patriots which means that the fall of the birthrate in all other countries but their own is a source of much gratification woe to us they exclaim in effect if we follow the example of these wicked and degenerate peoples our nation needs men we have to populate the earth and to carry the blessings of our civilised culture all over the world in executing that high mission we cannot have too much cannonfodder in defending ourselves against the jealousy and aggression of other nations let us promote parentage by law let us repress by law every influence which may encourage a falling birthrate otherwise there is nothing left to us but speedy national disaster complete and irremediable this is not caricature though these apostles of racesuicide may easily arouse a smile by the verbal ardour of their procreative energy but we have to recognise that in germany for years past it has been difficult to take up a serious periodical without finding some anxiously statistical article about the falling birthrate and some wild recommendations for its arrest for it is the militaristic german who of all europeans is most worried by this fall indeed germans often even refuse to recognise it thus today we find professor gruber declaring that if the population of the german empire continues to grow at the rate of the first five years of the present century at the end of the century it will have reached by such a vast increase in population the professor complacently concludes germany will be rendered invulnerable we know what that means the presence of an invulnerable nation among nations that are vulnerable means inevitable aggression and war a perpetual menace to civilisation and humanity it is not along that line that hope can be found for the worlds future or even germanys future and gruber conveniently neglects to estimate what on his basis the population of russia will be at the end of the century but grubers estimate is altogether fallacious german births have fallen roughly speaking about one per thousand of the population every year since the beginning of the century and it would be equally reasonable to estimate that if they continue to fall at the present rate which we cannot of course anticipate births will altogether have ceased in germany long before the end of the century the german birthrate reached its climax forty years ago with per in it was per in per in per in an almost measurable period of time in all probability long before the end of the century it will have reached the same low level as that of france when there will be little difference between the invulnerability of france and of germany a consummation which for the worlds sake is far more devoutly to be wished than that anticipated by gruber we have to remember moreover that this tendency is by no means as we are sometimes tempted to suppose a sign of degeneration or of decay but on the contrary a sign of progress when we survey broadly that course of zoologicalevolution of which we are pleased to regard man as the final outcome we note that on the whole the mighty stream has become the less productive as it has advanced we note the same of the various lines taken separately we note also that intelligence and all the qualities we admire have usually been most marked in the less prolific species progress roughly speaking has proved incompatible with high fertility and the reason is not far to seek if the creature produced is more evolved it is more complex and more highly organised and that means the need for much time and much energy to attain this the offspring must be few and widely spaced it cannot be attained at all under conditions that are highly destructive the humble herring which evokes the despairing envy of our human apostles of fertility is largely composed of spawn and produces a vast number of offspring of which few reach maturity the higher mammals spend their lives in the production of a small number of offspring most of whom survive thus even before man began we see a fundamental principle established and the relationship between the birthrate and the deathrate in working order all progressive evolution may be regarded as a mechanism for concentrating an ever greater amount of energy in the production of ever fewer and ever more splendid individuals nature is perpetually striving to replace the crude ideal of quantity by the higher ideal of quality in human history these same tendencies have continually been illustrated the greeks our pioneers in all insight and knowledge grappled as professor myres has lately set forth and realised that they were grappling with this same problem even in the minoan age their population would appear to have been full to overflowing there were too many people in the world and to the old greeks the trojan war was the earliest divinelyappointed remedy wars famines pestilences colonisation widespread infanticide were the methods voluntary and involuntary by which this excessive birthrate was combated while the greatest of greek philosophers a plato or an aristotle clearly saw that a regulated and limited birthrate a eugenically improved race is the road to higher civilisation we may even see in greek antiquity how a sudden rise in industrialism leads to a crowded and fertile urban population the extension of slavery and all the resultant evils it was a foretaste of what was seen during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when a sudden industrial expansion led to an enormously high birthrate a servile urban proletariat that very word indicates as roscher has pointed out that a large family means inferiority and a consequent outburst of misery and degradation from which we are only now emerging as we are now able to realise the sudden expansion of the population accompanying the industrial revolution was an abnormal and from the point of view of society a morbid phenomenon all the evidence goes to show that previously the population tended to increase very slowly and social evolution was thus able to take place equably and harmoniously it is only gradually that the birthrate has begun to right itself again the movement as is well known began in france always the most advanced outpost of european civilisation it has now spread to england to germany to all europe to the whole world indeed in so far as the world is in touch with european civilisation and has long been well marked in the united states when we realise this we are also enabled to realise how futile how misplaced and how mischievous it is to raise the cry of racesuicide it is futile because no outcry can affect a worldwide movement of civilisation it is misplaced because the rise and fall of the population is not a matter of the birthrate alone but of the birthrate combined with the deathrate and while we cannot expect to touch the former we can influence the latter it is mischievous because by fighting against a tendency which is not only inevitable but altogether beneficial we blind ourselves to the advance of civilisation and risk the misdirection of all our energies how far this blindness may be carried we see in the false patriotism of those who in the decline of the birthrate fancy they see the ruin of their own particular country oblivious of the fact that we are concerned with a phenomenon of worldwide extension the whole tendency of civilisation is to reduce the birthrate as leroybeaulieu concludes in his comprehensive work on the population question we may go further and assert with the distinguished german economist roscher that the chief cause of the superiority of a highly civilised state over lower stages of civilisation is precisely a greater degree of forethought and selfcontrol in marriage and childbearing instead of talking about racesuicide we should do well to observe at what an appalling rate even yet the population is increasing and we should note that it is everywhere the poorest and most primitive countries and in every country as in germany the poorest regions which show the highest birthrate on every hand however are hopeful signs thus in russia where a very high birthrate is to some extent compensated by a very high deathratethe highest infantile deathrate in europethe birthrate is falling and we may anticipate that it will fall very rapidly with the extension of education and social enlightenment among the masses driven out of europe the alarmist falls back on the yellow peril but in japan we find amid confused variations of the birthrate and the deathrate nothing to indicate any alarming expansion of the population while as to china we are in the dark we only know that in china there is a high birthrate largely compensated by a very high deathrate we also know however that as lowes dickinson has lately reminded us the fundamental attitude of the chinese towards life is that of the most modern west and we shall probably find that with the growth of enlightenment the chinese will deal with their high birthrate in a far more radical and thoroughmanner than we have ever ventured on one last resort the wouldbe patriotic alarmist seeks when all others fail he is good enough to admit that a general decline in the birthrate might be beneficial but he points out it affects social classes unequally it is initiated not by the degenerate and the unfit whom we could well dispense with but by the very best classes in the community the welltodo and the educated one is inclined to remark at once that a social change initiated by its best social classes is scarcely likely to be pernicious where it may be asked if not among the most educated classes is any process of amelioration to be initiated we cannot make the world topsyturvy to suit the convenience of topsyturvy minds all social movements tend to begin at the top and to permeate downwards this has been the case with the decline in the birthrate but it is already well marked among the working classes and has only failed to touch the lowest social stratum of all too weakminded and too reckless to be amenable to ordinary social motives the rational method of meeting this situation is not a propaganda in favour of procreationa truly imbecile propaganda since it is only carried out and only likely to be carried out by the very class which we wish to sterilisebut by a wise policy of regulative eugenics we have to create the motives and it is not an impossible task which will act even upon the weakminded and reckless lowest social stratum these facts have a significance which many of us have failed to realise the great war has brought home the gravity of that significance it has been the perpetual refrain of the pangermanists for many years that the vast and sudden expansion of the german peoples makes necessary a new movement of the german nations into the world and a new enlargement of frontiers in other words war it is not only among the germans though among them it may have been more conscious that a similar cause has led to the like result it has ever been so the expanding nation has always been a menace to the world and to itself the arrest of the falling birthrate it cannot be too often repeated would be the arrest of all civilisation and of all humanity ralph thicknesse a years journey through france and spain p the last twelve words quoted are by miss ethel elderton in an otherwise

democracy when we read our newspapers today we are constantly met by ingenious plans for bringing to an end the activities of germany after the war german military activity it is universally agreed must be brought to an end germany will have no further need of a military system save on the most modest scale germany must also be deprived of any colonial empire and shut out from eastward expansion that being the case germany no longer needs a fleet and must be brought back to bismarcks naval attitude moreover the industrial activities of germany must also be destroyed the allied opponents of germany will henceforth manufacture for themselves or for one another the goods they have hitherto been so foolish as to obtain from germany and though this may mean cutting themselves aloof from the country which has hitherto been their own best customer that is a sacrifice to be cheerfully borne for the sake of principle it is further argued that the world has no need of german activities in science they are it appears much less valuable than we had been led to believe and in any case no selfrespecting people would encourage a science tainted by kultur the puzzled reader of these arguments overlooking the fallacies they contain may perhaps sometimes be tempted to ask but what are germans to be allowed to do the implied answer is clear nothingthe writers who urge these arguments with such conviction may be supposed to have an elementary knowledge of the history of the germans we are concerned that is to say with a people which has displayed an irrepressible energy in one field or another ever since the time more than fifteen hundred years ago when it excited the horror of the civilised world by sacking rome the same energy was manifested a thousand years later when the germans again knocked at the door of rome and drew away half the world from its allegiance to the church still more recently in yet other fields of industry and commerce and colonisation these same germans have displayed their energy by entering into more or less successful competition with that modern rome as some have termed it which has its seat in the british islands here is a peoplestill youthful as we count age in our european world for even the celts had preceded them by nearly a thousand yearswhich has successfully displayed its explosive or methodical force in the most diverse fields military religious economic from henceforth it is invited by an allied army of terrified journalists to expend these stupendous and irresistible energies on just nothing we know of course what would happen were it possible to subject germany to any such process of attempted repression whenever an individual or a mass of individuals is bidden to do nothing it merely comes about that the activities aimed at far from being suppressed are turned into precisely the direction most unpleasant for the wouldbe suppressors when in the germans tried to crush france the result was the reverse of that intended the effects of crushing had been even more startingly reverse on the other sideand this may furnish us with a precedentwhen napoleon trampled down germany two centuries ago after the brilliant victories of marlborough it was proposed to crush permanently the militarism of france but as swift wrote to archbishop king just before the peace of utrecht limiting france to a certain number of ships and troops was i doubt not to be compassed in spite of the exhaustion of france it was not even attempted in the present case when the war is over it is probable that germany will still hold sufficiently great pledges to bargain with in safeguarding her own vital interests if it were not so if it were possible to inflict permanent injury on germany that would be the greatest misfortune that could happen to us for it is clear that we should then be faced by a yet more united and yet more aggressively military germany than the world has seen in germany itself there is no doubt on this point germans are well aware that german activities cannot be brought to a sudden full stop and they are also aware that even among germanys present enemies there are those who after the war will be glad to become her friends any doubt or anxiety in the minds of thoughtful germans is not concerning the continued existence of german energy in the world but concerning the directions in which that energy will be exerted what is germanys greatest danger that is the subject of a pamphlet by rudolf goldscheid of vienna now published in switzerland with a preface by professor forel as originally written a year earlier because it is believed that in the interval its conclusions have been confirmed by events goldscheid is an independent and penetrating thinker in the economic field and the author of a book on the principles of social biology höherentwicklung und menschenökonomie which has been described by an english critic as the ablest defence of socialism yet written by the nature of his studies he is concerned with problems of human rather than merely national development but he ardently desires the welfare of germany and is anxious that that welfare shall be on the soundest and most democratic basis after the war he says there must necessarily be a tendency to approximate between the central powers and one or other of their present foes it is clear though this point is not discussed that italy whose presence in the triple alliance was artificial will not return while french resentment at german devastation is far too great to be appeased for a long period to come there remain therefore russia and england after the war german interests and german sympathies must gravitate either eastwards towards russia or westwards towards england which is it to be there are many reasons why germany should gravitate towards russia such a movement was indeed already in active progress before the war notwithstanding russias alliance with france and may easily become yet more active after the war when it is likely that the bonds between russia and france may grow weaker and when it is possible that the germans with their immense industry economy and recuperative power may prove to be in the best positionunless america cuts into finance russia industrially russia offers a vast field for german enterprise which no other country can well snatch away and german is already to some extent the commercial language of russia politically moreover a close understanding between the two supreme autocratic and antidemocratic powers of europe is of the greatest mutual benefit for any democratic movement within the borders of either power is highly inconvenient to the other so that it is to the advantage of both to stimulate each other in the task of repression it is this aspect of the approximation which arouses goldscheids alarm it is mainly on this ground that he advocates a counterbalancing approximation between germany and england which would lay germany open to the west and serve to develop her latent democratic tendencies he admits that at some points the interests of germany and england run counter to each other but at yet a greater number of points their interests are common it is only by the development of these commoninterests and the consequent permeation of germany by democratic english ideas that goldscheid sees any salvation from czarism for that is germanys greatest danger and at the same time the greatest danger to europe that is goldscheids point of view our english point of view is necessarily somewhat different with our politically democratic tendencies we see very little difference between russia and prussia as they are at present constituted we have no wish to be in very close political intimacy with either it so happens indeed that for the moment the chances of fellowship in war have brought us into a condition of almost sentimental sympathy with the russian people such as has never existed among us before but this sympathy amply justified as all who know russia agree is exclusively with the russian people it leaves the russian government the russian bureaucracy the russian political system all that goldscheid concentrates into the term czarism severely alone our hostility to these may be for the moment latent but it is as profound as it ever was czarism is even more remote from our sympathies than kaiserism all that has happened is that we cherish the pious hope that russia is becoming converted to our own ideas on these points although there is not the smallest item of solid fact to support that hope otherwise russian oppression of the finns is just as odious to us as prussian oppression of the poles and russian persecution of liberals as alien as german persecution of warprisoners our future policy in the opinion of many should however be to isolate germany as completely as possible from english influence and to cultivate closer relations with russia such a policy goldscheid argues will defeat its own ends the more stringently england holds aloof from germany the more anxiously will germany cultivate good relationships with russia such relationships as we know are easy to cultivate because they are much in the interests of both countries which possess so large an extent of common frontier and so admirably supply each others needs it may be added also that the russian commercial world is showing no keen desire to enter into close relations with england moreover after the war we may expect a weakening of french influence in russia for that influence was largely based on french gold and a france no longer able or willing to finance russia would no longer possess a strong hold over russia a russogerman understanding difficult to prevent in any case is inimical to the interests of england but it would be rendered inevitable by an attempt on the part of england to isolate germany such an attempt could not be carried out completely and would break down on its weakest side which is the east so that the way lies open to a league of the three kaisers the dreikaiserbündnis which would form a great island fortress of militarism and reaction amid the surrounding sea of democracy able to repress those immense possibilities of progress within its own walls which would have been liberated by contact with the vital currents outside so long as the war lasts it is the interest of england to strike germany and to strike hard that is here assumed as certain but when the war is over it will no longer be in the interests of england it will indeed be directly contrary to those interests to continue cultivating hostility provided that is that no rankling wounds are left the fatal mistake of bismarck in annexing alsacelorraine introduced a poison into the european organism which is working still but the russojapanese war produced a more amicable understanding than had existed before and the boer war led to still more intimate relationships between the belligerents it may be thought that the impression in england of german frightfulness and in germany of english treachery may prove ineffaceable but the germans have been considered atrocious and the english perfidious for a long time past yet that has not prevented english and germans fighting side by side at waterloo and on many another field nor has it stood in the way of german worship of the quintessential englishman shakespeare nor english homage to the quintessential german goethe the question of the future relations of england and germany may indeed be said to lie on a higher plane than that of interest and policy vitally urgent as their claims may be it is the merit of goldscheids little book thatwith faith in a future united states of europe in which every country would develop its own peculiar aptitudes freely and harmoniously he is able to look at the war from that european standpoint which is so rarely attained in england he sees that more is at stake than a mere question of national rivalries that democracy is at stake and the whole future direction of civilisation he looks beyond the enmities of the moment and he knows that unless we look beyond them we not only condemn europe to the prospect of unending war we do more we ensure the triumph of reaction and the destruction of democracy war and reaction are brethren on that point goldscheid is very sure and he foretells and laments the temporary demolition of democracy in england we have only too much reason to believe his prophetic words for since he wrote we have had a coalition government which is predominantly democratic liberal and labour and yet has been fatally impelled towards reaction and autocracy that the impulse is really fatal and inevitable we cannot doubt for we see exactly the same movement in france and even in russia where it might seem that reaction has so few triumphs to achieve the blood of the battlefield is the stream that drives the mills of reaction the elementary and fundamental fact that in democracy the officers obey the men while in militarism the men obey the officers is the key to the whole situation we see at once why all reactionaries are on the side of war and a military basis of society the fate of democracy in europe hangs on this question of adequate pacificationdemocratisation and pacification march side by side unless we realise that fact we are not competent to decide on a sound european policy for there is an intimate connection between a countrys external policy and its internal policy an internal reactionary policy means an external aggressive policy to shut out english influence from germany to fortify german junkerism and militarism to drive germany into the arms of a yet more reactionary russia is to create a perpetual menace alike to peace and to democracy which involves the arrest of civilisation however magnanimous the task may seem to some it is not only the interest of england but englands duty to europe to take the initiative in preparing the ground for a clear and good understanding with germany it is moreover only through england that france can be brought into harmonious relations with germany and when russia then approaches her neighbour it will be in sympathy with her more progressive western allies and not in reactionary response to a reactionary germany it is along such lines as these that amid the confusion of the present we may catch a glimpse of the europe of the future we have to remember that as goldscheid reminds us this war is making all of us into citizens of the world a worldwide outlook can no longer be reserved merely for philosophers some of the old bridges it is true have been washed away but on every side walls are falling and the petty fears and rivalries of european nations begin to look worse than trivial in the face of greater dangers as our eyes begin to be opened we see europe lying between the nether millstone of asia and the upper millstone of america it is not by constituting themselves a mutual suicide club that the nations of europe will avoid that peril a wise and farseeing worldpolicy can alone avail and the enemies of today will see themselves compelled even by the mere logic of events to join hands tomorrow lest a worse fate befall them in so doing they may not only escape possible destruction but they will be taking the greatest step ever taken in the organisation of the world which nation is to assume the initiative in such combined organisation that remains the fateful question for democracy treitschke in his history bk i ch iii has well described the elemental hatred which foreign injury pours into the veins of our goodnatured people for ever pursued by the question art thou yet on thy feet germania is the day of thy revenge at hand rudolf goldscheid deutschlands grösste gefahr institut orell füssli zürich one may remark that up to the outbreak of war fifty per cent of the import trade of russia has been with germany to suppose that that immense volume of trade can suddenly be transferred after the war from a neighbouring country which has intelligently and systematically adapted itself to its requirements to a remote country which has never shown the slightest aptitude to meet those requirements argues a simplicity of mind which in itself may be charming but when translated into practical affairs it is stupendous folly sir valentine chirol remarks of bismarck in an oxford pamphlet on germany and the fear of russiafriendship with russia was one of the cardinal principles of his foreign policy and one thing he always relied upon to make russia amenable to german influence was that she should never succeed in healing the polish sore in making these observations on the russians and the prussians i do not of course overlook the fact that all nations like individuals compound for sins they are inclined to by damning those they have no mind to and the english treatment of the conscientious objector in the great war has been just as odious as russian treatment of the finns or prussian treatment of war prisoners and even more foolish since it strikes at our own most cherished principles there is indeed another school which would like to shut off all foreign countries by a tariff wall and make the british empire mutually selfsupporting on the economic basis adopted by those three old ladies in decayed circumstances who subsisted by taking tea in one anothers houses even if partially successful as has lately been pointed out the greater the financial depression of germany the greater would be the advantage to russia of doing business with germany it may be proper to point out that i by no means wish to imply that democracy is necessarily the ultimate and most desirable form of political society but merely that it is a necessary stage for those peoples that have not yet reached it even treitschke in his famous history while idealising the prussian state always assumes that movement towards democracy is beneficial progress for the larger question of the comparative merits of the different forms of political society see an admirable little book by c delisle burns political ideals and see also the searching study political parties english translation by robert michels who while accepting democracy as the highest political form argues that practically it always works out as oligarchy professor ds jordan has quoted the letter of a german officer to a friend in roumania published in the bucharest adverul aug how difficult it was to convince our emperor that the moment had arrived for letting loose the war otherwise pacifism internationalism antimilitarism and so many other noxious weeds would have infected our stupid people that would have been the end of our dazzling nobility we have everything to gain by the war and all the chimeras and stupidities of democracy will be chased from the world for an infinite time let us be patient a japanese is reported to have said lately until europe has completed her harakiri viii feminism and masculinism during more than a century we have seen the slow but steady growth of the great womens movement of the movement of feminism in the wide sense of that term the conquests of this movement have sometimes been described by rhetorical feminists as triumphs over man that is scarcely true the champions of feminism have nearly as often been men as women and the forces of antifeminism have been the vague massive inert forces of an order which had indeed made the world in an undue degree a mans world but unconsciously and involuntarily and by an instrumentation which was feminine as well as masculine the advocates of womans rights have seldom been met by the charge that they were unjustly encroaching on the rights of man feminism has never encountered an aggressive and selfconscious masculinism now however when the claims of feminism are becoming practically recognised in our social life and some of its largest demands are being granted it is interesting to observe the appearance of a new attitude we are for the first time beginning to hear of masculinism just as feminism represents the affirmation of neglected rights and functions of womanhood so masculinism represents the assertion of the rights and functions of manhood which it is supposed the rising tide of feminism threatens to submerge those who proclaim the necessity of an assertion of the rights of masculinism usually hold up america as an awful example of the triumph of feminism thus fritz voechting in a book published in germany on the american cult of woman is appalled by what he sees in the united states to him it is the american danger and he thinks it may be traced partly to the influence of the matriarchal system of the american indians on the early european invaders and partly to the effects of coeducation in undermining the fundamental conceptions of feminine subordination this state of things is so terrible to the german mind which has a constitutional bias to masculinism that to herr voechting america seems a land where all the privileges have been captured by woman and nothing is left to man but like a good little boy to be seen and not heard that is a slight exaggeration as other germans even since the war have pointed out in german periodicals even if it were true however as a german feminist has remarked it would still be a pleasant variation from a rule we are so familiar with in the old world that it should be put forward at all indicates the growing perception of a cleavage between the claims of masculinism and the claims of feminism it is not altogether easy at present to ascertain whom we are to recognise as the champions and representatives of masculinism various notable figures are mentioned from nietzsche to mr theodore dreiser nietzsche however can scarcely be regarded as in all respects an opponent to feminism and some prominent feminists even count themselves his disciples one may also feel doubtful whether mr dreiser feels himself called upon to put on the armour of masculinism and play the part assigned to him another distinguished novelist mr robert herrick whose name has been mentioned in this connection is probably too wellbalanced too comprehensive in his outlook to be fairly claimed as a bannerbearer of masculinism the name of strindberg is most often mentioned but surely very unfortunately however great strindbergs genius and however acute and virulent his analysis of woman strindberg with his pronounced morbidity and sensitive fragility seems a very unhappy figure to put forward as the ideal representative of the virtues of masculinity much the same may be said of weininger the name of mr belfort bax once associated with william morris in the socialistic campaign may fairly be mentioned as a pioneer in this field for many years he has protested vigorously against the encroachment of feminism and pointed out the various privileges social and legal which are possessed by women to the disadvantage of men but although he is adistinguished student of philosophy it can scarcely be said that mr bax has clearly presented in any wide philosophic manner the demands of the masculinistic spirit or definitely grasped the contest between feminism and masculinism the name of william morris would be an inspiring battlecry if it could be fairly raised on the side of masculinism unfortunately however the masculine figures scarcely seem eager to put on the armour of masculinism they are far too sensitive to the charm of womanhood ever to rank themselves actively in any antifeministic party at the most they remain neutral thus it is that the new movement cannot yet be regarded as organised there is however a temptation for those among us who have all their lives been working in the cause of feminism to belittle the future possibilities of masculinism there can be no doubt that all civilisation is now and always has been to some extent on the side of feminism wherever a great development of civilisation has occurredwhether in ancient egypt or in later rome or in eighteenthcentury francethere the influence of woman has prevailed while laws and social institutions have taken on a character favourable to women the whole current of civilisation tends to deprive men of the privileges which belong to brute force and to confer on them the qualities which in ruder societies are especially associated with women whenever as in the present great european war brute force becomes temporarily predominant the causes associated with feminism are roughly pushed into the background it is indeed the war which gives a new actuality to this question war has always been regarded as the special and peculiar province of man indeed the sacred refuge of the masculine spirit and the ultimate appeal in human affairs that is not the view of feminism nor yet the standpoint of eugenics yet today in spite of all our homage to feminism and eugenics we witness the greatest war of the world it is an instructive spectacle from our present point of view we realise for one thing how futile it is for feminism to adopt the garb of masculine militancy the militancy of the suffragettes which looked so brave and imposing in times of peace disappeared like childs play at the first touch of real militancy that was patriotic of the suffragettes no doubt but it was also a necessary measure of selfpreservation for noncombatants who carry bombs about in time of war when armed sentries are swarming everywhere are not likely to have much time for hungerstriking we witness another feature of war which has a bearing on eugenics it is sometimes said that war is necessary for the preservation of heroic and virile qualities which without war and the cultivation of military ideals would be lost to the race and that so the race would degenerate today france which is the chief seat of antimilitarism and belgium a land of peaceful industrialism which had no military service until a few years ago and england which has always been content to possess a contemptible little army and russia whose popular ideals are humane and mystical have sent to the front swarms of professional men and clerks and artisans and peasants who had never occupied themselves with war at all yet these men have proved as heroic and even as skilful in the game of war as the men of germany where war is idolised and where the practice of military virtues and military exercises is regarded as the highest function alike of the individual and of the state we see that we need not any longer worry over the possible extinction of these heroic qualities what we may more profitably worry over is the question whether there is not some higher and nobler way of employing them than in the destruction of the finest fruits of civilisation and the slaughter of those very stocks on which eugenics mainly relies for its materials we can also realise today that war is not only an opportunity for the exercise of virtues it is also an opportunity for the exercise of vices war is hell said sherman and that is the opinion of most great reflective soldiers we see that there is nothing too brutal too cruel too cowardly too mean and too filthy for some at all events of modern civilised troops to commit whether by or against the orders of their officers in france a few months before the present war i found myself in a railway train at laon with two or three soldiers a young woman came to the carriage door but seeing the soldiers she passed on they were decent wellbehaved men and one of them remarked with a smile on the suspicion which the military costume arouses in women perhaps however it is a suspicion that is firmly based on ancient traditions there is the fatally seamy side of bepraised militarism and there feminism has a triumphant argument in this connection i may allude in passing to a little conflict between masculinism and feminism which has lately taken place in germany germany as we know is the country where the claims of masculinism are most loudly asserted and those of feminism treated with most contempt it is the country where the ideals of men and of women are in sharpest conflict there has been a great outcry among men in germany against the treachery and unworthiness of german women in bestowing chocolates and flowers on the prisoners as well as doing other little services for them the attitude towards prisoners approved by the menonetrusts it is not to be regarded as a characteristic outcome of masculinismis that of petty insults of spiteful cruelty and mean deprivations dr helene stöcker a prominent leader of the more advanced band of german feminists has lately published a protest against this treatment of enemies who are helpless unarmed and often woundedbased not on sentiment but on the highest and most rational groundswhich is an honour to german women and to their feminist leaders taken altogether it seems probable that when this most stupendous of wars is ended it will be feltnot only from the side of feminism but even of masculinismthat war is merely an eruption of ancient barbarism which in its present virulent forms would not have been tolerated even by savages such methods are hopelessly out of date in days when wars may be engineered by a small clique of ambitious politicians and selfinterested capitalists while whole nations fight with or without enthusiasm merely because they have no choice in the matter all the powers of civilisation are working towards the elimination of wars in the future it seems evident militarism will not furnish the basis for the masculinistic spirit it must seek other supports that is what will probably happen we must expect that the increasing power of women and of the feminine influence will be met by a more emphatic and a more rational assertion of the qualities of men and the masculine spirit in life it was unjust and unreasonable to subject women to conditions that were primarily made by men and for men it would be equally unjust and unreasonable to expect men to confine their activities within limits which are more and more becoming adjusted to feminine preferences and feminine capacities we are now learning to realise that the tertiary physical and psychic sexual differencesthose distinctions which are only found on the average but on the average are constant are very profound and very subtle a man is a man throughout a woman is a woman throughout and that difference is manifest in all the energies of body and soul the modern doctrine of the internal secretionsthe hormones which are the intimate stimulants to physical and psychic activity in the organismmakes clear to us one of the deepest and most allpervading sources of this difference between men and women the hormonic balance in men and women is unlike the generative ferments of the ductless glands work to different ends masculine qualities and feminine qualities are fundamentally and eternally distinct and incommensurate energy struggle daring initiative originality and independence even though sometimes combined with rashness extravagance and defect seem likely to remain qualities in which menon the average it must be rememberedwill be more conspicuous than women their manifestation will resist the efforts put forth to constrain them by the feminising influences of life such considerations have a real bearing on the problem of eugenics as i view that problem it is first of all concerned in part with the acquisition of scientific knowledge concerning heredity and the influences which affect heredity in part with the establishment of sound ideals of the types which the society of the future demands for its great tasks and in part perhaps even in chief partwith the acquisition of a sense of personal responsibility eugenic legislation is a secondary matter which cannot come at the beginning it cannot come before our knowledge is firmly based and widely diffused it cannot come until we are clear as to the ideals which we wish to see embodied in human character and human action it cannot come until the sense of personal responsibility towards the race is so widely spread throughout the community that its absence is universally felt to be either a crime or a disease i fear that point of view is not always accepted in england and still less in america it is widely held throughout the world that america is not only the land of feminism but the land in which laws are passed on every possible subject and with considerable indifference as to whether they are carried out or even whether they could be carried out this tendency is certainly well illustrated by eugenic legislation in the united states in the single point of sterilisation for eugenic ends and i select a point which is admirable in itself and for which legislation is perhaps desirableat least twelve states have passed laws yet most of these laws are a dead letter every one of them is by the best experts considered at some point unwise and the remarkable fact remains that the total number of eugenical sterilising operations performed in the states without any law at all is greater than the total of those performed under the laws so that the laws really seem to have themselves a sterilising effect on a most useful eugenic operation i refrain from mentioning the muddles and undesigned evils produced by other legislation of a much less admirable nature but i may perhaps be allowed to mention that it has seemed to some observers that there is a connection between the feminism of america and the american mania for hasty laws which will not and often cannot be carried out in practice certainly there is no reason to suppose that women are firmly antagonistic to such legislation nice pretty virtuous little laws complete in every detail seem to appeal irresistibly to the feminine mind and of course many men have feminine minds it is true that such laws are only meant for show but then women are so accustomed to things that are only meant for show and are well aware that if one attempted to use such things they would fall to pieces at once however that may be we shall probably find at last that we must fall back on the ancient truth that no external regulation however pretty and plausible will suffice to lead men and women to the goal of any higher social end we must realise that there can be no sure guide to fine living save that which comes from within and is supported by the firmly cultivatedsense of personal responsibility our prayer must still be the simple oldfashioned prayer of the psalmist create in me a clean heart o godand to hell with your laws in other words our aim must be to evolve a social order in which the sense of freedom and the sense of responsibility are both carried to the highest point and that is impossible by the aid of measures which are only beneficial for the children of perdition that there are such beings incapable alike either of freedom or of responsibility we have to recognise it is our business to care for themuntil with the help of eugenics we can in some degree extinguish their stocksin such refuges and reformatories as may be found desirable but it is not our business to treat the whole world as a refuge and a reformatory that is fatal to human freedom and fatal to human responsibility by all means provide the halt and the lame with crutches but do not insist that the sound and the robust shall never stir abroad without crutches the result will only be that we shall all become more or less halt and lame it is only by such a method as thisby segregating the hopelessly feeble members of society and by allowing the others to take all the risks of their freedom and responsibility even though we strongly disapprovethat we can look for the coming of a better world it is only by such a method as this that we can afford to give scope to all those varying and evercontradictory activities which go to the making of any world worth living in for conflict even the conflict of ideals is a part of all vital progress and each party to the conflict needs free play if that conflict is to yield us any profit that is why masculinists have no right to impede the play of feminism and feminists no right to impede the play of masculinism the fundamental qualities of man equally with the fundamental qualities of woman are for ever needed in any harmonious civilisation there is a place for masculinism as well as a place for feminism from the highest standpoint there is not really any conflict at all they alike serve the large cause of humanity which equally includes them both würdelose weiber die neue generation augsept havelock ellis man and woman fifth ed p the conception of sexuality as dependent on the combined operation of various internal ductless glands and not on the sexual glands proper alone has been especially worked out by professor w blair bell the sex complex hh laughlin the legal legislative and administrative aspects of sterilisation eugenics record office bulletin no ob i have discussed these already in a chapter of my book the task of social hygiene ix the mental differences of men and women the great war which has changed so many things has nowhere effected a greater change than in the sphere of womens activities in all the belligerent countries women have been called upon to undertake work which they had never been offered before europe has thus become a great experimental laboratory for testing the aptitudes of women the results of these tests as they are slowly realised cannot fail to have permanent effects on the sexual division of labour it is still too early to speak confidently as to what those effects will be but we may be certain that whatever they are they can only spring from deeplying natural distinctions the differences between the minds of men and the minds of women are indeed presented to all of us every day it should therefore we might imagine be one of the easiest of tasks to ascertain what they are and yet there are few matters on which such contradictory and often extravagant opinions are maintained for many people the question has not arisen there are no mental differences they seem to take for granted between men and women for others the mental superiority of man at every point is an unquestionable article of faith though they may not always go so far as to agree with the german doctor mobius who boldly wrote a book on the physiological weakmindedness of women for others again the predominance of men is an accident due to the influences of brute force let the intelligence of women have freer play and the world generally will be straightened out in these conflicting attitudes we may trace not only the confidence we are all apt to feel in our intimate knowledge of a familiar subject we have never studied but also the inevitable influence of sexual bias of such bias there is more thanone kind there is the egoistic bias by which we are led to regard our own sex as naturally better than any other could be and there is the altruistic bias by which we are led to find a charming and mysterious superiority in the opposite sex these different kinds of sexual bias act with varying force in particular cases it is usually necessary to allow for them notwithstanding the fantastic divergencies of opinion on this matter it seems not impossible to place the question on a fairly sound and rational base in so complex a question there must always be room for some variations of individual opinion for no two persons can approach the consideration of it with quite the same prepossessions or with quite the same experience at the outset there is one great fundamental fact always to be borne in mind the difference of the sexes in physical organisation that we may term the biological factor in determining the sexual mental differences a strong body does not involve a strong brain nor a weak body a weak brain but there is still an intimate connection between the organisation of the body generally and the organisation of the brain which may be regarded as an executive assemblage of delegates from all parts of the body fundamental differences in the organisation of the body cannot fail to involve differences in the nervous system generally and especially in that supreme collection of nervous ganglia which we term the brain in this way the special adaptation of womans body to the exercise of maternity with the presence of special organs and glands subservient to that object and without any important equivalents in mans body cannot fail to affect the brain we now know that the organism is largely under the control of a number of internal secretions or hormones which work together harmoniously in normal persons influencing body and mind but are liable to disturbance and are differently balanced and with a different action in the two sexes it is not we must remember by any means altogether the exercise of the maternal function which causes the difference the organs and aptitudes are equally present even if the function is not exercised so that a woman cannot make herself a man by refraining from childbearing in another way this biological factor makes itself felt and that is in the differences in the muscular systems of men and women these we must also consider fundamental although the extreme muscular weakness of average civilised women as compared to civilised men is certainly artificial and easily possible to remove by training yet even in savages among whom the women do most of the muscular work they seldom equal or exceed the men in strength any superiority when it exists being mainly shown in such passive forms of exertion as bearing burdens in civilisation even under the influence of careful athletic training women are unable to compete muscularly with men and it is a significant fact that on the variety stage there are very few strong women it would seem that the difficulty in developing great muscular strength in women is connected with the special adaptation of womans form and organisation to the maternal function but whatever the cause may be the resulting difference is one which has a very real bearing on the mental distinctions of men and women it is well ascertained that what we call mental fatigue expresses itself physiologically in the same bodily manifestation as muscular fatigue the avocations which we commonly consider mental are at the same time muscular and even the sensory organs like the eye are largely muscular it is commonly found in various great business departments where men and women may be said to work more or less side by side that the work of women is less valuable largely because they are not able to bear additional strain under pressure of extra work they give in before men do it is noteworthy that the claims for sick benefit made by women under the national insurance system in england have proved much greater even three times greater than the actuaries anticipated beforehand while the sick insurance societies of germany france austria and switzerland also report that women are ill oftener and for longer periods than men largely no doubt that is due to the special strain and the rigid monotony of our modern industrial system but not entirely nearly two hundred years ago in swift wrote of women to bolingbroke i protest i never knew a very deserving person of that sex who had not too much reason to complain of illhealth the regulations of the world have been mainly made by men on the instinctive basis of their own needs and until women have a large part in making them on the basis of their needs women are not likely to be so healthy as men this by no means necessarily implies any mental inferiority it is much more the result of muscular inferiority even in the arts muscular qualities count for much and are often essential since a solid muscular system is needed even for very delicate actions the arts of design demand muscular qualities to play the violin is a muscular strain and only a robust woman can become a famous singer the greater precocity of girls is another aspect of the biological factor in sexual mental differences it is a psychic as well as a physical fact this has been shown conclusively by careful investigation in many parts of the civilised world and notably in america where the school system renders such sexual comparison easy and reliable at all ages there can now be no doubt that a girl at let us say the age of fourteen is on the average taller and heavier than a boy at the same age though the degrees of this difference and the precise age at which it occurs vary with the individual and the race corresponding to this is a mental difference in many branches of study though not all the girl of fourteen is superior to the boy quicker more intelligent gifted with a better memory precocity however is a quality of dubious virtue it is frequently found indeed in men of the highest genius but on the other hand it is found among animals and among savages and is here of no good augurymany observers of the lower races have noted how the child is highly intelligent and well disposed but seems to degenerate as he grows older in the comparison of girls and boys both as regards physical and mental qualities it is constantly found that while the girls hold their own and in many respects more than hold their own with boys up to the age of fifteen or sixteen after that the girls remain almost or quite stationary while in the boys the curve of progress is continued without interruption some people have argued hypothetically that the greater precocity of girls is an artificial product of civilisation due to the confined life of girls produced as it were by the artificial overheating of the system in the hothouse of the home this is a mistake the same precocity of girls appears to exist even among the uncivilised and independently of the special circumstances of life it is even found among animals also and is said to be notably obvious in giraffes it will hardly be argued that the female giraffe leads a more confined and domestic life than her brother yet another aspect of the biological factor is to be found in the bearing of heredity on this question to judge by the statements that one sometimes sees men and women might be two distinct species separately propagated the conviction of some men that women are not fitted to exercise various social and political duties and the conviction of some women that men are a morally inferior sex are both alike absurd for they both rest on the assumption that women do not inherit from their fathers nor men from their mothers nothing is more certain than thatwhen of course we put aside the sexual characters and the special qualities associated with those charactersmen and women on the average inherit equally from both of their parents allowing for the fact that that heredity is controlled and modified by the special organisation of each sex there are indeed various laws of heredity which qualify this statement and notably the tendency whereby extremes of variation are more common in the male sexso that genius and idiocy are alike more prevalent in men but on the whole there can be no doubt that the qualities of a man or of a woman are a more or less varied mixture of those of both parents and even when there is no blending both parents are almost equally likely to be influential in heredity the good qualities of the one parent will therefore benefit the child of the opposite sex and the bad qualities will equally be transmitted to the offspring of opposite sex there is another element in the settlement of this question which may also be fairly called objective and that is the historical factor we are prone to believe that the particular status of the sexes that prevails among ourselves corresponds to a universal and unchangeable order of things in reality this is far from being the case it may indeed be truly said that there is no kind of social position no sort of avocation public or domestic among ourselves exclusively appertaining to one sex which has not at some time or in some part of the world belonged to the opposite sex and with the most excellent results we regard it as alone right and proper for a man to take the initiative in courtship yet among the papuans of new guinea a man would think it indecorous and ridiculous to court a girl it was the girls privilege to take the initiative in this matter and she exercised it with delicacy and skill and the best moral results until the shocked missionaries upset the native system and unintentionally introduced looser ways there is again no implement which we regard as so peculiarly and exclusively feminine as the needle yet in some parts of africa a woman never touches a needle that is mans work and a wife who can show a neglected rent in her petticoat is even considered to have a fair claim for a divorce innumerable similar examples appear when we consider the human species in time and space the historical aspect of this matter may thus be said in some degree to counterbalance the biological aspect if the fundamental constitution of the sexes renders their mental characters necessarily different the difference is still not so pronounced as to prevent one sex sometimes playing effectively the parts which are generally played by the other sex it is not necessary to go outside the white european race to find evidences of the reality of this historical factor of the question before us it would appear that at the dawn of european civilisation women were taking a leading part in the evolution of human progress various survivals which are enshrined in the myths and legends of classic antiquity show us the most ancient deities as goddesses and moreover we encounter the significant fact that at the origin nearly all the arts and industries were presided over by female not by male deities in greece as well as in asia minor india and egypt as paul lafargue has pointed out woman seems to have taken divine rank before men all the first inventions of the more useful arts and crafts except in metals are ascribed to goddesses the muses presided over poetry and music long before apollo isis was the lady of bread and demeter taught men to sow barley and corn instead of eating each other thus even among our own forefathers we may catch a glimpse of a state of things which as various anthropologists have shown notably otis mason in his womans share in primitive culture we may witness in the most widely separated parts of the world thus among the xosa kaffirs as well as other abantu stocks fritsch states that the man claims for himself war hunting occupation with cattle all household cares even the building of the house as well as the cultivation of the ground are womans affair hardly in the most laborious work will a man lend a hand so that when today we see women entering the most various avocations that is not a dangerous innovation but perhaps merely a return to ancient and natural conditions it is not until specialisation becomes necessary and until men are relieved from the constant burden of battle and the chase that the frequent superiority of woman is lost the modern industrial activities are dangerous when they are dangerous not because the work is too hardfor the work of primitive women is harderbut because it is an unnaturally and artificially dreary and monotonous work which stifles the mind depresses the spirits and injures thebody so that it is said per cent of married women who have been factory girls are treated for pelvic disorders before they are thirty it is the conditions of womens work which need changing in order that they may become like those of primitive women so various that they develop the mind and fortify the body this however is an evil which will be righted by the development of the mechanical side of industry for machines tend constantly to become larger heavier speedier more numerous and more automatic requiring fewer workers to tend them and these more frequently men it may be added that the early predominance of woman in the work of civilisation is altogether independent of that conception of a primitive matriarchate or government of women which was set forth some fifty years ago by bachofen and has since caused so much controversy descent in the female line not uncommonly found among primitive peoples undoubtedly tended to place women in a position of great influence but it by no means necessarily involved any gynecocracy or rule of women and such rule is merely a hypothesis which by some enthusiasts has been carried to absurd lengths we see therefore that when we are approaching the question of the mental differences of the sexes among ourselves today it is not impossible to find certain guiding clues which will save us from running into extravagance in either direction without doubt the only way in which we can obtain a satisfactory answer to the numerous problems which meet us when we approach the question is by experiment i have indeed insisted on the importance of these preliminary biological and historical considerations mainly because they indicate with what safety and freedom from risk we may trust to experiment the sexes are far too securely poised by organic constitution and ancient tradition for any permanently injurious results to occur from the attempt to attain a better social readjustment in this matter when the experiment fails individuals may to some extent suffer but social equilibrium swiftly and automatically rights itself practically however nearly every social experiment of this kind means that certain restrictions limiting the duties or privileges of women are removed and when artificial coercions are thus taken away it can merely happen as mary wollstonecraft long ago put it that by the common law of gravity the sexes fall into their proper places that we may be sure will be the final result of the interesting experiments for which the laboratory today is furnished by all the belligerent countries definitely formulated statistical data of these results are scarcely yet available but we may study the action of this natural process on one great practical experiment in mental sexual differences which has been going on for some time past at one time in the various administrations of the international postal union there was a sudden resolve to introduce female labour to a very large extent it was thought that this would be cheaper than male labour and equally efficient there was consequently a great outcry at the ousting of male labour the introduction of the thin end of a wedge which would break up society we can now see that that outcry was foolish within recent years nearly all the countries which previously introduced women freely into their postal and telegraph services are now doing so only under certain conditions and some are ceasing to admit them at all this great practical experiment carried out on an immense scale in thirtyfive different countries has on the whole shown that while women are not inferior to men at all events within the ordinary range of work the substitution of a female for a male staff always means a considerable increase of numbers that women are less rapid than men less able to undertake the higher grade work less able to exert authority over others more lacking both in initiative and in endurance while they require more sick leave and lose interest and energy on marriage the advantages of female labour are thus to some extent neutralised and in the opinions of the administrations of some countries more than neutralised by certain disadvantages the general result is that men are found more fitted for some branches of work and women more fitted for other branches the result is compensation without any tendency for one sex to oust the other it may indeed be objected that in practical life no perfectly satisfactory experiments exist as to the respective mental qualities of men and women since men and women are never found working under conditions that are exactly the same for both sexes if however we turn to the psychological laboratory where it is possible to carry on experiments under precisely identical conditions the results are still the same there are nearly always differences between men and women but these differences are complex and manifold they do not always agree they never show any general piling up of the advantages on the side of one sex or of the other in reactiontime in delicacy of sensory perception in accuracy of estimation and precision of movement there are nearly always sexual differences a few that are fairly constant many that differ at different ages in various countries or even in different groups of individuals we cannot usually explain these differences or attach any precise significance to them any more than we can say why it is that at all events in america blue is most often the favourite colour of men and red of women we may be sure that these things have a meaning and often a really fundamental significance but at present for the most part they remain mysterious to us when we attempt to survey and sum up all the variegated facts which science and practical life are slowly accumulating with reference to the mental differences between men and women we reach two main conclusions on the one hand there is a fundamental equality of the sexes it would certainly appear that women vary within a narrower range than men that is to say that the two extremes of genius and of idiocy are both more likely to show themselves in men this implies that the pioneers in progress are most likely to be men that indeed may be said to be a biological fact in allthat concerns the evolution of ornamental characters the male leads in him we see the trend which evolution is taking the female and young afford us the measure of their advance along the new line which has to be taken in the human sphere of the arts and sciences similarly men not women take the lead that men were the first decorative artists rather than women is indicated by the fact that the natural objects designed by early prehistoric artists were mainly women and wild beasts that is to say they were the work of masculine hunters executed in idle intervals of the chase but within the range in which nearly all of us move there are always many men who in mental respects can do what most women can do many women who can do what most men can do we are not justified in excluding a whole sex absolutely from any field in so doing we should certainly be depriving the world of some portion of its executive ability the sexes may always safely be left to find their own levels on the other hand the mental diversity of men and women is equally fundamental it is rooted in organisation the wellintentioned efforts of many pioneers in womens movements to treat men and women as identical and as it were to force women into masculine moulds were both mischievous and useless women will always be different from men mentally as well as physically it is well for both sexes that it should be so it is owing to these differences that each sex can bring to the worlds work various aptitudes that the other lacks it is owing to these differences also that men and women have their undying charm for each other we cannot change them and we need not wish to see for instance blair bells the sex complex though the deductions drawn in this book must not always be accepted without qualifications g

courtship of animal p x the white slave crusade during recent years we have witnessed a remarkable attemptmore popular and more international in character than any beforeto deal with that ancient sexual evil which has for some time been picturesquely described as the white slave traffic less than forty years ago professor sheldon amos wrote that this subject can scarcely be touched upon by journalists and can never form a topic of common conversation nowadays churches societies journalists legislators have all joined the ranks of the agitators not only has there been no voice on the opposite side which was scarcely to be expectedfor there has never been any anxiety to cry aloud the defence of white slavery from the housetopsbut there has been a new and noteworthy conquest over indifference and over that sacred silence which was supposed to encompass all sexual topics with suitable darkness the banishment of that silence in the cause of social hygiene is indeed not the least significant feature of this agitation it is inevitable however that these periodical fits of virtuous indignation by which society is overtaken should speedily be spent the victim of the moral fever finds himself exhausted by the struggle scarcely able to cope with the complications of the disease and at the best only too anxious to forget what he has passed through he has an uneasy feeling that in the course of his delirium he has said and done many foolish things which it would now be unpleasant to recall too precisely there is no use in attempting to disguise the fact that this is what happened in the white slave traffic agitation it became clear that we had been largely misled in regard to the evils to be combated and that we were seduced into sanctioning various remedies for these evils which in cold blood it is impossible to approve of even if we could believe them to be effective it is not even clear that all those who have talked about the white slave traffic have been quite sure what they meant by the term some people indeed have seemed to think that it meant prostitution in general that is of course an absurd misapprehension we are concerned with a trade which flourishes on prostitution but that trade is not itself the trade or as some prefer to call it the profession of prostitutes indeed the prostitute under ordinary conditions andunharassed by persecution is in many respects anything but a slave she is much less a slave than the ordinary married woman she is not fettered in humble dependence on the will of a husband from whom it is the most difficult thing in the world to escape she is bound to no man and free to make her own terms in life while if she should have a child that child is absolutely her own and she is not liable to have it torn from her arms by the hands of the law apart from arbitrary and accidental circumstances due to the condition of social feeling the prostitute enjoys a position of independence which the married woman is still struggling to obtain the white slave traffic therefore is not prostitution it is the commercialised exploitation of prostitutes the independent prostitute living alone scarcely lends herself to the white slave trader it is on houses of prostitution where the less independent and usually weakerminded prostitutes are segregated that the traffic is based such houses cannot even exist without such traffic there is little inducement for a girl to enter such a house in full knowledge of what it involves on her own initiative the proprietors of such houses must therefore give orders for the goods they desire and it is the business of procurers by persuasion misrepresentation deceit intoxication to supply them the white slave traffic as kneeland states is thus not only a hideous reality but a reality almost wholly dependent on the existence of houses of prostitution and as the authors of the social evil state it is the most shameful species of business enterprise in modern times in this intimate dependence of the white slave traffic on houses of prostitution there lies it may be pointed out a hope for the future we are concerned for the most part with the more coarsegrained part of the masculine population and with the more ignorant degraded and weakminded part of the army of prostitutes although much has been said of the enormous extension of the white slave traffic during recent years it is important to remember that that extension is chiefly marked in connection with the great new centres of population in the younger countries it is fostered by the conditions prevailing in crude youthful prosperous but incompletely blended communities which have too swiftly attained luxury but have not yet attained the more humane and refined developments of civilisation and among whom women are often scarce although there are not yet any very clear signs of the decay of prostitution in civilisation there can hardly be a doubt that civilisation is unfavourable to houses of prostitution they offer no inducements to the more intelligent and independent prostitutes and their inmates usually present little attraction to any men save those whose demands are of the humblest character there is therefore a tendency to the natural and spontaneous decay of organised houses of prostitution under modern civilised conditions the prostitute and her clients alike shun such houses along this line we may foresee the disappearance of the white slave traffic apart altogether from any social or legal attempts at its direct suppression it is sometimes said that the relation of the isolated prostitute to her souteneur constitutes a form of white slavery undoubtedly that may sometimes be the case we are here in a confused field where the facts are complicated by a number of considerations and where circumstances may very widely differ for the fancy boyselected from affection by the prostitute herselfmay easily become the souteneur or cadet as he is termed in new york who seduces and trains to prostitution a large number of girls the prostitute is so often a little weak in character and a little defective in intelligence she is so often regarded as a legitimate prey by the world in which she moves and a legitimate object of contempt and oppression by the social world above her and its legal officers that she easily becomes abjectly dependent on the man who in some degree protects her from this extortion contempt and oppression even though he sometimes trains her to his own ends and exploits her professional activities for his own advantage these circumstances so often occur that some investigators consider that they represent the general rule no doubt they are the most conspicuous cases but they can scarcely be regarded as representing the normal relations of the prostitute to the man she is attracted to she is earning her own living and if she possesses a little modicum of character and intelligence she knows that she can choose her own lover and dismiss him when she so pleases he may beat her occasionally but all over the world this is not always displeasing to the primitively feminine woman it is indeed true as kneeland remarks that many prostitutes do not believe their lovers care for them unless they beat them up occasionally the woman in this position is not more of a white slave than many wives and some husbands who submit to the whims and tyrannies of their conjugal partners with indeed the additional hardship and misfortune that they are legally bound to them and the souteneur although from the respectable point of view he has put himself into a lowdown moral position is after all not so very unlike those parasitic wives who on a higher social level live lazily on their husbands professional earnings and sometimes give much less than the souteneur in return when however we put aside the complicated question of the prostitutes relationship to the man who is her lover protector and bully we have to recognise that there really is a white slave traffic carried on in a ruthlesslybusinesslike manner and on an international scale with watchful agents men and women ever ready to detect and lure the victims but even this too amply demonstrated fact was not found sufficiently highly spiced by the white slave traffic agitators it was necessary to excite the public mind by sensational incidents everyone was told stories as of incidents that had lately occurred in the next street of innocent refined and wellbred girls who were snatched away by infamous brigands beneath the eyes of their friends to be immured in dungeons of vice and never more heard of such incidents if they ever occurred would be too bizarre to be justifiably taken into account in great social movements but it is even doubtful whether they ever occur the white slave traders are not heroes of romance even of infamous romance less so indeed than many more ordinary criminals they are engaged in a very definite and very profitable business they have no need to run serious risks the world is full of girls who are overworked illpaid ignorant weak vain greedy lazy or even only afflicted with a little innocent love of adventure and it is among these that white slave traders may easily find what their business demands while experience enables them to detect the most likely subjects careful inquiry even among those who have made it their special business to collect all the evidence that can be brought together to prove the infamous character of the white slave traffic has apparently failed to furnish any reliable evidence of these sensational stories it is easy to find prostitutes who are often dissatisfied with the life in what occupation is it not easy but it is not easy to find prostitutes who cannot escape from that life when they sufficiently wish to do so and are willing to face the difficulty of finding some other occupation the very fact that the whole object of their exploitation is to bring them in contact with men belonging to the outside world is itself a guarantee that they are kept in touch with that world mrs billingtongrieg a wellknown pioneer in social movements has carefully investigated the alleged cases of forcible abduction which were so freely talked about when the white slave bill was passed into law in england but even the vigilance societies actively engaged in advocating the bill could not enable her to discover a single case in which a girl had been entrapped against her will no other result could reasonably have been expected when so many girls are willing and even eager to be persuaded there is little need for the risky adventure of capturing the unwilling the uneasy realisation of these facts cannot fail to leave many honest vicecrusaders with unpleasant memories of their past it is not only in regard to alleged facts but also in regard to proposed remedies that the white slave agitation may properly be criticised in england it distinguished itself by the ferocity with which the lash was advocated and finally legalised benevolent bishops joined with genteel old maids in calling loudly for whips and even in desiring to lay them personally on the backs of the offenders notwithstanding that these crusaders were nominally christians the followers of a master who conspicuously reserved his indignation not for sinners and lawbreakers but for selfsatisfied saints and scrupulous lawkeepersjust the same kind of excellent people in fact who are most prone to become vicecrusaders here again it is probable many unpleasant memories have been stored up it is well recognised by criminologists that the lash is both a barbarous and an ineffective method of punishment the history of flagellation as collas states in his great work on this subject is the history of a moral bankruptcy the survival of barbarous punishments from barbarous days when ferocious punishments were a matter of course and the death penalty was inflicted for horsestealing without in the least diminishing that offence may be intelligible but the reenactment of such measures in socalled civilised days is an everlasting discredit to those who advocate it and a disgrace to the community which permits it this was pointed out at the time by a large body of social reformers and will no doubt be realised at leisure by the persons concerned in the agitation apart altogether from its barbarity the lash is peculiarly unsuited for use in the white slave trade because it will never descend on the back of the real trader the whip has no terrors for those engaged in illegitimate financial transactions for in such transactions the principal can always afford to arrange that it shall fall on a subordinate who finds it worth while to run the risks this method has long been practised by those who exploit prostitution for profit to increase the risks merely means that the subordinate must be more heavily paid that means that the whole business must be carried on more actively to cover the increased risks and expenses it is a very ancient fact that moral legislation increases the evil it is designed to combat it is necessary to point out some of the unhappy features of this agitation not in order to minimise the evils it was directed against nor to insinuate that they cannot be lessened but as a warning against the reaction which follows such illconsidered efforts the fiery zealot in a fury of blind rage strikes wildly at the evil he has just discovered and then flings down his weapon glad to forget all about his momentary rage and the errors it led him into it is not so that ancient evils are destroyed evils it must be remembered that derive their vitality in part from human nature and in part from the structure of our society by ensuring that our workers and especially our women workers are decently paid so that they can live comfortably on their wages we shall not indeed have abolished prostitution which is more than an economic phenomenon but we shall more effectually check the white slave trader than by the most draconic legislation the most imaginative vicecrusader ever devised and when we ensure that these same workers have ample time andopportunity for free and joyous recreation we shall have done more to kill the fascination of the white slave traffic than by endless police regulations for the moral supervision of the young no doubt the element of human nature in the manifestations we are concerned with will still be at work an obscure instinct often acting differently in each sex but tending to drive both into the same risks here we need even more fundamental social changes it is sheer foolishness to suppose that when we raise our little dams in the path of a great stream of human impulse that stream will forthwith flow calmly back to its source we must make our new channels concurrently with our dams if we wish to influence prostitution we must remake our marriage laws and modify our whole conception of the sexual relationships in the meanwhile we can at least begin today a task of education which must slowly though surely undermine the white slave traders stronghold such an education needs to be not merely instruction in the facts of sex and wise guidance concerning all the dangers and risks of the sexual life it must also involve a training of the will a development of the sense of responsibility such as can never be secured by shutting our young people up in a hothouse sheltered from every fortifying breath of the outside world certainly there are many among usand precisely the most hopeless persons from our present point of viewwho can never grow into really responsible persons neither should they ever have been born it is our business to see that they are not born and that if they are they are at least placed under due social guardianship so that we may not be tempted to make laws for society in general which are only needed by this feeble and infirm folk thus it is that when we seek to deal with the white slave trader and his victims and his patrons we have to realise that they are all very much as we have made them moulded by their parents before birth nourished on their mothers knees the task of making them over again next time and making them better is a revolutionary task but it begins at home and there is no home in which some part of the task cannot be carried out it is possible that at some period in the worlds history not only will the white slave traffic disappear but even prostitution itself and it is for us to work towards that day but we may be quite sure that the social state which sees the last of the social evil will be a social state very unlike ours the nature of prostitution and of the white slave traffic and their relation to each other may clearly be studied in such valuable firsthand investigations of the subject as the social evil with special reference to conditions existing in the city of new york nd edition edited by era seligman putnams commercialised prostitution in new york city by gj kneeland new york century co prostitution in europe by abraham flexner new york century co the social evil in chicago by the vicecommission of chicago as regards prostitution in england and its causes i should like to call attention to an admirable little book downward paths published by bell sons the literature of the subject is however extensive and a useful bibliography will be found in the firstnamed volume this is especially true of many regions in america both north and south where a hideous mixture of disparate nationalities furnishes conditions peculiarly favourable to the white slave traffic when prosperity increases see for instance the wellinformed and temperately written book by miss jane addams a new conscience and an ancient evil see havelock ellis sex in relation to society studies in the psychology of sex vol vi ch vii the white slave traffic english review june it is just just the same in america mr brandwhitlock when mayor of toledo thoroughly investigated a sensational story of this kind brought to him in great detail by a social worker and found that it possessed not the slightest basis of truth it was he remarks in an able paper on the white slave forum feb simply another variant of the story that had gone the rounds of the continents a story which had been somehow psychologically timed to meet the hysteria which the pulpit the press and the legislature had displayed gf collas geschichte des flagellantismus vol i p i have brought together some of the evidence on this point in the chapter on immorality and the law in my book the task of social hygiene the idea is cherished by many especially among socialists that prostitution is mainly an economic question and that to raise wages is to dry up the stream of prostitution that is certainly a fallacy unsupported by careful investigators though all are agreed that the economic condition of the wageearner is one factor in the problem thus commissioner adelaide cox at the head of the womens social wing of the salvation army speaking from a very long and extensive acquaintance with prostitutes while not denying that women are often wickedly underpaid finds that the cause of prostitution is essentially a moral one and cannot be successfully fought by other than moral weaponswestminster gazette dec nd in a yet wider sense it may be said that the question of the causes of prostitution is essentially social this is a very important clue indeed in dealing with the problem of prostitution it is the weakminded unintelligent girl goddard states in his valuable work on feeblemindedness who makes the white slave traffic possible dr hickson found that over per cent of the women brought before the morals court in chicago were distinctly feebleminded and dr olga bridgeman states that among the girls committed for sexual delinquency to the training school of geneva illinois per cent were feebleminded by the binet tests and to be regarded as helpless victims walter clarke social hygiene june and journal of mental science jan p there are fallacies in these figures but it would appear that about half of the prostitutes in institutions are to be regarded as mentally defective xi the conquest of venereal disease the final report of the royal commission on venereal diseases has brought to an end an important and laborious investigation at what many may regard as an unfavourable moment perhaps however the moment is not so unfavourable as it seems there is no period when venereal diseases flourish so exuberantly as in war time and we shall have a sad harvest to gather here when the war is over moreover the war is teaching us to face the real facts of life more frankly and more courageously than ever before and there is no field scarcely even a battlefield where a training in frankness and courage is so necessary as in this of venereal disease it is difficult even to say that there is any larger field for it has been found possible to doubt whether the great war of today when all is summed up will have produced more death disease and misery than is produced in the ordinary course of events during a single generation by venereal disease there are as every man and woman ought to know two main and quite distinct diseases any other being unimportant poetically termed venereal because chiefly though not by any means only propagated in the intercourse over which the roman goddess venus once presided these two diseases are syphilis and gonorrhoea both these diseases are very serious often terrible in their effects on the individual attacked and both liable to be poisonous to the race there has long been a popular notion that while syphilis is indeed an awful disease gonorrhoea may be accepted with a light heart that we now know is a grave mistake gonorrhoea may seem trivial at the outset but its results especially for a woman and her children when it allows her to have any are anything but trivial while its greater frequency and the indifference with which it is regarded still further increase its dangers about the serious nature of syphilis there is no doubt it is a comparatively modern disease not clearly known in europe before the discovery of america at the end of the fifteenth century and by some authorities today supposed to have been imported from america but it soon ravaged the whole of our world and has continued to do so ever since during recent years it has perhaps shown a slight tendency to decrease though nothing to what could be achieved by systematic methods but its evils are still sufficiently alarming exactly how common it is cannot be ascertained with certainty at least per cent probably more of the population in our large cities have been infected by syphilis some before birth in for an average strength of men in the english navy nearly days were lost as a result of venereal disease while among soldiers in the home army for the same year an average of nearly men were constantly sick from the same cause we may estimate from this small example how vast must be the total loss of working power due to venereal disease moreover in sir william oslers words of the killing diseases syphilis comes third or fourth its prevalence varies in different regions and different social classes the mortality rate from syphilis for males above fifteen is highest for unskilled labour then for the group intermediate between unskilled and skilled labour then for the upper and middle class followed by the group intermediate between this class and skilled labour while skilled labour textile workers and miners follow and agricultural labourers come out most favourably of all these differences do not represent any ascending grade in virtue or sexual abstinence but are dependent upon differences in social condition thus syphilis is comparatively rare among agricultural labourers because they associate only with women they know and are not exposed to the temptation of strange women while it is high among the upper class because they are shut out from sexual intimacy with women of their own class and so resort to prostitutes on the whole however it will be seen the poison of syphilis is fairly diffused among all classes this poison may work through many years or even the whole of life and its early manifestations are the least important it may begin before birth thus one recent investigation shows that in syphilitic families there were only seemingly healthy children to infant deaths stillbirths and miscarriages as against in healthy families the great majority of these failures being infant deaths and thus representing a large amount of wasted energy and expense syphilis is again the most serious single cause of the most severe forms of brain disease and insanity this often coming on many years after the infection and when the early symptoms were but slight blindness and deafness from the beginning of life are in a large proportion of cases due to syphilis there is indeed no organ of the body which is not liable to break down often with fatal results through syphilis so that it has been well said that a doctor who knows syphilis thoroughly is familiar with every branch of his profession gonorrhoea is a still commoner disease than syphilis how common it is very difficult to say it is also an older disease for the ancient egyptians knew it and the biblical king esarhaddon of assyria as the records of his court show once caught it it seems to some people no more serious than a common cold yet it is able to inflict much prolonged misery on its victims while on the race its influence in the long run is even more deadly than that of syphilis for gonorrhoea is the chief cause of sterility in women that is to say in from to per cent of such cases while of cases of sterility in men which form a quarter to a third of the whole gonorrhoea is the cause in from to per cent the inflammation of the eyes of the newborn leading to blindness is also in per cent cases due to gonorrhoea in the mother and this occurs in over six per births three years ago a royal commission was appointed to investigate the best methods of controlling venereal disease as smallpox typhus and to a large extent typhoid have already been controlled the commission was well composed not merely of officials and doctors but of experienced men and women in various fields and the final report is signed by all the members any difference of opinion being confined to minor points which it is unnecessary to touch on here and to two members only the recommendations are conceived in the most practical and broadminded spirit they are neither faddy nor goodygoody some indeed may wish that they had gone further the commission leave over for later consideration the question of notifying venereal disease as other infectious diseases are notified and there is no recommendation for the provision of preventive methods against infection for use before intercourse such as are officially favoured in germany but at both these points the commissioners have been wise for they are points to which sections of public opinion are still strongly hostile as they stand the recommendations should carry conviction to all serious and reasonable persons already indeed the government without opposition has expressed its willingness to undertake the financial burden which the commission would impose on it the main recommendations made by the commission if we put aside the suggestions for obtaining a more exact statistical knowledge may be placed under the heads of treatment and prevention as regards the first it is insisted that measures should be taken to render the best modern treatment which should be free to all readily available for the whole community in such a way that those affected will have no hesitation in taking advantage of the facilities thus offered the means of treatment should be organised by county councils and boroughs under the local government board which should have power to make independent arrangements when the local authorities fail in their duties institutional treatment should be provided at all general hospitals special arrangements made for the treatment of outpatients in the evenings and no objection offered to patients seeking treatment outside their own neighbourhoods the expenditure should be assisted by grants from imperial funds to the extent of per cent it may be added that however heavy such expenditure may be an economy can scarcely fail to be effected the financial cost of venereal disease today is so vast as to be beyond calculation it enters into every field of life it is enough merely to consider the significant little fact that the cost of educating a deaf child is ten times as great as that of educating an ordinary child under the head of prevention we may place such a suggestion as that the existence of infective venereal disease should constitute legal incapacity for marriage even when unknown and be a sufficient cause for annulling the marriage at the discretion of the court but by far the chief importance under this head is assigned by the commission to education and instruction we see here the vindication of those who for years have been teaching that the first essential in dealing with venereal disease is popular enlightenment there must be more careful instructionthrough all types and grades of educationon the sexual relations in regard to conduct while further instruction should be provided in evening continuation schools as well as factories and works with the aid of properly constituted voluntary associations these are sound and practical recommendations which as the government has realised can be put in action at once a few years ago any attempt to control venereal disease was considered by many to be almost impious such disease was held to be the just visitation of god upon sin and to interfere would be wicked we know better now a large proportion of those who are most severely struck by venereal disease are newborn children and trustful wives while a simple kiss or the use of towels and cups in common has constantly served to spread venereal disease in a family even when we turn to the commonest method of infection we have still to remember that we are dealing largely with inexperienced youths with loving and trustful girls who have yielded to the deepest and most volcanic impulse of their natures and have not yet learnt that that impulse is a thing to be held sacred for their own sakes and the sake of the race in so far as there is sin it is sin which must be shared by those who have failed to train and enlighten the young a pharisaic attitude is not only highly mischievous in its results but is here altogether out of place much harm has been done in the past by the action of benefit societies in withholding recognition and treatment from venerealdisease it is evident that this thought was at the back of the minds of those who framed these wise recommendations we cannot expect to do away all at once with the feeling that venereal disease is shameful it may not even be desirable but we can at least make clear that in so far as there is any shame it must be a question between the individual and his own conscience from the point of view of science syphilis and gonorrhoea are just diseases like cancer and consumption the only diseases with which they can be compared in the magnitude and extent of their results and therefore it is best to speak of them by their scientific names instead of trying to invent vague and awkward circumlocutions from the point of view of society any attitude of shame is unfortunate because it is absolutely essential that these diseases should be met in the open and grappled with methodically and thoroughly otherwise as the commission recognises the sufferer is apt to become the prey of ignorant quacks whose inefficient treatment is largely responsible for the development of the latest and worst afflictions these diseases produce when not effectually nipped in the bud that they can be thus cut shortfar more easily than consumption to say nothing of canceris the fact which makes it possible to hope for a conquest over venereal disease it is a conquest that would make the whole world more beautiful and deliver love from its ugliest shadow but the victory cannot be won by science alone not even in alliance with officialdom it can only be won through the enlightened cooperation of the whole nation the increase of venereal disease during the great war has been noted alike in germany france and england thus as regards france gaucher has stated at the paris academy of medicine journal de medicine may th that since mobilisation syphilis had increased by nearly one half alike among soldiers and civilians it had much increased in quite young people and in elderly men in germany neisser a leading authority states deutsche medizinische wochenschrift th jan that the prevalence of venereal disease is much greater than in the war of and that every day many thousands not to say tens of thousands of otherwise ablebodied men are withdrawn from the service on this account the chief is iwan bloch who in his elaborate work der ursprung der syphilis vols has fully investigated the evidence n bishop harman the influence of syphilis on the chances of progeny british medical journal feb th it is true that in my book sex in relation to society ch viii i have stated my belief that notification as in the case of other serious infectious diseases is the first step in the conquest of venereal disease i still think it ought to be so but a yet more preliminary step is popular enlightenment as to the need for such notification the recommendations seem to me to go as far as it is possible to go at the moment in englishspeaking countries without producing friction and opposition in so far as they are carried out the recommendations will ensure the necessary popular enlightenmentxii the nationalisation of health it was inevitable that we should some day have to face the problem of medical reorganisation on a social basis along many lines social progress has led to the initiation of movements for the improvement of public health but they are still incomplete and imperfectly coordinated we have never realised that the great questions of health cannot safely be left to municipal tinkering and the patronage of bumbledom the result is chaos and a terrible waste not only of what we call hard cash but also of sensitive flesh and blood health there cannot be the slightest doubt is a vastly more fundamental and important matter than education to say nothing of such minor matters as the post office or the telephone system yet we have nationalised these before even giving a thought to the nationalisation of health at the present day medicine is mainly in the hands as it was two thousand years ago of the private practitioner his mental status has indeed changed today he is submitted to a long and arduous training in magnificently equipped institutions all the laboriously acquired processes and results of modern medicine and hygiene are brought within the students reach and when he leaves the hospital often with the largest and noblest conception of the physicians place in life what do we do with him he becomes a private practitioner which means as duclaux the late distinguished director of the pasteur institute put it that we place him on the level of a retail grocer who must patiently stand behind his counter without the privilege of advertising himself until the public are pleased to come and buy advice or drugs which are usually applied for too late to be of much use and may be thrown away at the buyers good pleasure without the possibility of any protest by the seller it is little wonder that in many cases the doctors work and aims suffer under such conditions his nature is subdued to what it works in he clings convulsively to his counter and its retail methods the fact isand it is a fact that is slowly becoming apparent to allthat the private practice of medicine is out of date it fails to answer the needs of our time there are various reasons why this should be the case but two are fundamental in the first place medicine has outgrown the capacity of any individual doctor the only adequate private practitioner must have a sound general knowledge of medicine with an expert knowledge of a dozen specialties that is to say he must give place to a staff of doctors acting coordinately for the present system or lack of system by which a patient wanders at random from private practitioner to specialist from specialist to specialist ad infinitum is altogether mischievous moreover not only is it impossible for the private practitioner to possess the knowledge required to treat his patients adequately he cannot possess the scientific mechanical equipment nowadays required alike for diagnosis and treatment and every day becoming more elaborate more expensive more difficult to manipulate it is installed in our great hospitals for the benefit of the poorest patient it could perhaps be set up in a millionaires palace but it is hopelessly beyond the private practitioner though without it his work must remain unsatisfactory and inadequate in the second place the whole direction of modern medicine is being changed and to an end away from private practice our thoughts are not now mainly bent on the cure of disease but on its prevention medicine is becoming more and more transformed into hygiene and in this transformation though the tasks presented are larger and more systematic they are also easier and more economical these two fundamental tendencies of modern medicinegreater complexity of its methods and the predominantly preventive character of its aimsalone suffice to render the position of the private practitioner untenable he cannot cope with the complexity of modern medicine he has no authority to enforce its hygiene the medical system of the future must be a national system coordinating all the conditions of health at the centre we should expect to find a minister of health and every doctor of the state would give his whole time to his work and be paid by salary which in the case of the higher posts would be equal to that now fixed for the higher legal offices for the chief doctor in the state ought to be at least as important an official as the lord chancellor hospitals and infirmaries would be alike nationalised and in place of the present antagonism between hospitals and the bulk of the medical profession every doctor would be in touch with a hospital thus having behind him a fully equipped and staffed institution for all purposes of diagnosis consultation treatment and research also serving for a centre of notification registration preventive and hygienic measures in every district the citizen would have a certain amount of choice as regards the medical man to whom he may go for advice but no one would be allowed to escape the medical supervision and registration of his district for it is essential that the central health authority of every district should know the health conditions of all the inhabitants of the district only by some such organised and coordinated system as this can the primary conditions of health and preventive measures against disease be genuinely socialisedthese views were put forward by the present writer twenty years ago in a little book on the nationalisation of health which though it met with wide approval was probably regarded by most people as utopian since then the times have moved a new generation has sprung up and ideas which twenty years ago were brooded over by isolated thinkers are now seen to be in the direct line of progress they have become the property of parties and matters of active propaganda even before the introduction of state insurance professor benjamin moore in his able book the dawn of the health age anticipating the actual march of events formulated a state insurance scheme which would lead on as he pointed out to a genuinely national medical service and later dr macilwaine in a little book entitled medical revolution again advocated the same changes the establishment of a ministry of health a medical service on a preventive basis and the reform of the hospitals which must constitute the nucleus of such a service it may be said that for medical men no longer engaged in private practice it is easy to view the disappearance of private practice with serenity but it must be added that it is precisely that disinterested serenity which makes possible also a clear insight into the problems and a wider view of the new horizons of medicine thus it is that today the dreamers of yesterday are justified the great scheme of state insurance was certainly an important step towards the socialisation of medicine it came short indeed of the complete nationalisation of health as an affair of state but that could not possibly be introduced at one move apart even from the difficulty of complete reorganisation the two great vested interests of private medical practice on the one hand and friendly societies on the other would stand in the way a complicated transitional period is necessary during which those two interests are conciliated and gradually absorbed it is this transitional period which state insurance has inaugurated to compare small things to greatas we may for the same laws run all through nature and societythis scheme corresponds to the ancient ptolomaean system of astronomy with its painfully elaborate epicycles which preceded and led on to the sublime simplicity of the copernican system we need not anticipate that the transitional stage of national insurance will endure as long as the ancient astronomy professor moore estimated that it would lead to a completely national medical service in twentyfive years and since the introduction of that method he has too optimistically reduced the period to ten years we cannot reach simplicity at a bound we must first attempt to systematise the recognised and established activities and adjust them harmoniously the organised refusal of the medical profession at the outset to carry on under the conditions offered the part assigned to it in the great national insurance scheme opened out prospects not clearly realised by the organisers no doubt its immediate aspects were unfortunate it not only threatened to impede the working of a very complex machine but it dismayed many who were not prepared to see doctors apparently taking up the position of the syndicalists and arguing that a profession which is essential to the national welfare need not be carried out on national lines but can be run exclusively by itself in its own interests such an attitude however usefully served to make clear how necessary it is becoming that the extension of medicine and hygiene in the national life should be accompanied by a corresponding extension in the national government if we had had a council of national health as well as of national defence or a board of health as well as a board of trade a minister of health with a seat in the cabinet any scheme of insurance would have been framed from the outset in close consultation with the profession which would have the duty of carrying it out no subsequent friction would have been possible had the insurance scheme been so framed it is perhaps doubtful whether it would have been so largely based on the old contract system club medical practice has long been in discredit alike from the point of view of patient and doctor it furnishes the least satisfactory form of medical relief for the patient less adequate than that he could obtain either as a private patient or as a hospital patient the doctor on his side though he may find it a very welcome addition to his income regards club practice as semicharitable and moreover a form of charity in which he is often imposed on he seldom views his club patients with much satisfaction and unless he is a selfsacrificing enthusiast it is not to them that his best attention his best time his most expensive drugs are devoted to perpetuate and enlarge the club system of practice and to glorify it by affixing to it a national seal of approval was therefore a somewhat risky experiment not wisely to be attempted without careful consultation with those most concerned another point might then also have become clear the whole tendency of medicine is towards a recognition of the predominance of hygiene the modern aim is to prevent disease the whole national system of medicine is being slowly though steadily built up in recognition of the great fact that the interests of health come before the interests of disease it has been an unfortunate flaw in the magnificent scheme of insurance that this vital fact was not allowed for that the oldfashioned notion that treatment rather than prevention is the object of medicine was still perpetuated and that nothing was done to coordinate the insurance scheme with the existing health services it seems probable that in a service of state medical officers the solution may ultimately be found such a solution would indeed immensely increase the value of the insurance scheme and in the end confer far greater benefits than at present on the millions of people who would come under its operation for there can be no doubt the club system is not only unscientific it is also undemocratic it perpetuates what was originally a semicharitable and secondrate method of treatment of the poorer classes a state medical officer devoting his whole time and attention to his state patients hasno occasion to make invidious distinctions between public and private patients a further advantage of a state medical service is that it will facilitate the inevitable task of nationalising the hospitals whether charitable or poorlaw the insurance act as it stands opens no definite path in this direction but nowadays so vast and complicated has medicine become even the most skilful doctor cannot adequately treat his patient unless he has a great hospital at his back with a vast army of specialists and researchworkers and a manifold instrumental instalment a third and even more fundamental advantage of a state medical service is that it would help to bring treatment into touch with prevention the private practitioner as such inside or outside the insurance scheme cannot conveniently go behind his patients illness but the state doctor would be entitled to ask why has this man broken down the states guardianship of the health of its citizens now begins at birth is tending to be carried back before birth and covers the school life if a man falls ill it is nowadays legitimate to inquire where the responsibility lies it is all very well to patch up the diseased man with drugs or what not but at best that is a makeshift method the consumptive sanatoriums have aroused enthusiasm and they also are all very well but the charity organisation society has shown that only about per cent of those who pass through such institutions become fit for work it is not more treatment of disease that we want it is less need for treatment and a state medical service is the only method by which medicine can be brought into close touch with hygiene the present attitude of the medical profession sometimes strikes people as narrow unpatriotic and merely selfinterested but the insurance act has brought a powerful ferment of intellectual activity into the medical profession which in the end will work to finer issues a significant sign of the times is the establishment of the state medical service association having for its aim the organisation of the medical profession as a state service the nationalisation of hospitals and the unification of preventive and curative medicine to many in the medical profession such schemes still seem utopian they are blind to a process which has been in ever increasing action for more than half a century and which they are themselves taking part in every day the result sometimes is that the ambitious doctor seeks to become a specialist in at least one subject and instals a single expensive method of treatment to which he enthusiastically subjects all his patients this would be comic if it were not sometimes rather tragic xiii eugenics and genius the cry is often heard today from those who watch with disapproval the efforts made to discourage the reckless procreation of the degenerate and the unfit you are stamping out the germs of genius it is widely held that genius is a kind of flower unknown to the horticulturist which only springs from diseased roots make the plant healthily sound and your hope of blossoms is gone you will see nothing but leaves or according to the happier metaphor of lombroso the work of genius is an exquisite pearl and pearls are the product of an obscure disease to the medical mind especially it has sometimes been naturally and properly no doubt a source of satisfaction to imagine that the loveliest creations of human intellect may perhaps be employed to shed radiance on the shelves of the pathological museum thus we find eminent physicians warning us against any effort to decrease the vigour of pathological processes and influential medical journals making solemn statements in the same sense already i read in a recent able and interesting editorial article in the british medical journal eugenists in their kind enthusiasm are threatening to stamp out the germs of possible genius now it is quite easy to maintain that the health happiness and sanity of the whole community are more precious even than genius it is so easy indeed that if the question of eugenics were submitted to the referendum on this sole ground there can be little doubt what the result would be there are not many people even in the most highly educated communities who value the possibility of a new poem symphony or mathematical law so highly that they would sacrifice their own health happiness and sanity to retain that possibility for their offspring of course we may declare that a majority which made such a decision must be composed of very lowminded uncultured people altogether lacking in appreciation of pathology and reflecting no credit on the eugenic cause they supported but there can be little doubt that we should have to admit their existence we need not hasten however to place the question on this ground it is first necessary to ascertain what reason there isto suppose that a regard for eugenic considerations in mating would tend to stamp out the germs of genius is there any reason at all that is the question i am here concerned with the antieugenic argument on this point whenever any argument is brought forward consists in pointing to all sorts of men of genius and of talent who it is alleged were poor citizens physical degenerates the prey of all manner of constitutional diseases sometimes candidates for the lunatic asylum which they occasionally reached the miscellaneous data which may thus be piled up are seldom critically sifted and often very questionable for it is difficult enough to obtain any positive biological knowledge concerning great men who died yesterday and practically impossible in most cases to reach an unquestionable conclusion as regards those who died a century or more ago many of the most positive statements commonly made concerning the diseases even of modern genius are without any sure basis the case of nietzsche who was seen by some of the chief specialists of the day is still really quite obscure so is that of guy de maupassant rousseau wrote the fullest and frankest account of his ailments and the doctors made a postmortem examination yet nearly all the medical expertsand they are manywho have investigated rousseaus case reach different conclusions it would be easy to multiply indefinitely the instances of great men of the past concerning whose condition of health or disease we are in hopeless perplexity this fact is however one that as an argument works both ways and the important point is to make clear that it cannot concern us no eugenic considerations can annihilate the man of genius when he is once born and bred if eugenics is to stamp out the man of genius it must do so before he is born by acting on his parents nor is it possible to assume that if the man of genius apart from his genius is an unfit person to procreate the race therefore his parents not possessing any genius were likewise unfit to propagate it is easy to find persons of high ability who in other respects are unfit for the ends of life illbalanced in mental or physical development neurasthenic valetudinarian the victims in varying degrees of all sorts of diseases yet their parents without any high ability were to all appearance robust healthy hardworking commonplace people who would easily pass any ordinary eugenic tests we know nothing as to the action of two seemingly ordinary persons on each other in constituting heredity how hypertrophied intellectual aptitude comes about what accidents normal or pathological may occur to the germ before birth nor even how strenuous intellectual activity may affect the organism generally we cannot argue that since these persons apart from their genius were not seemingly the best people to carry on the race therefore a like judgment should be passed on their parents and the germs of genius thus be stamped out we only arrive at the crucial question when we ask have the characters of the parents of men of genius been of such an obviously unfavourable kind that eugenically they would nowadays be dissuaded from propagation or under a severe régime of compulsory certificates the desirability of which i am far indeed from assuming be forbidden to marry have the parents of genius belonged to the unfit that is a question which must be answered in the affirmative if this objection to eugenics has any weight yet so far as i know none of those who have brought forward the objection have supported it by any evidence of the kind whatever thirty years ago dr maudsley dogmatically wrote there is hardly ever a man of genius who has not insanity or nervous disorder of some form in his family but he never brought forward any evidence in support of that pronouncement nor has anyone else if we put aside the efforts of more or less competent writerslike lombroso in his man of genius and nisbet in his insanity of geniusto rake in statements from all quarters regarding the morbidities of genius often without any attempt to authenticate criticise or sift them and never with any effort to place them in due perspective it so happens that some years ago with no relation to eugenic considerations i devoted a considerable amount of attention to the biological characters of british men of genius considered so far as possible on an objective and impartial basis the selection that is to say was made so far as possible without regard to personal predilections in accordance with certain rules from the dictionary of national biography in this way one thousand and thirty names were obtained of men and women who represent the flower of british genius during historical times only excluding those persons who were alive at the end of the last century what proportion of these were the offspring of parents who were insane or mentally defective to a serious extent if the view of maudsleythat there is hardly ever a man of genius who is not the product of an insane or nervouslydisordered stockhad a basis of truth we should expect that in one or other parents of the man of genius actual insanity had occurred in a very large proportion of cases per cent would be a moderate estimate but what do we find in not per cent can definite insanity be traced among the parents of british men and women of genius no doubt this result is below the truth the insanity of the parents must sometimes have escaped the biographers notice but even if we double the percentage to escape this source of error the proportion still remains insignificant there is more to be said if the insanity of the parent occurred early in life we should expect it to attract attention more easily than if it occurred late in life those parents of men of genius falling into insanity late in life the critic may argue escape notice but it is precisely to this group to which all the ascertainably insane parents of british men of genius belong there is not a single recorded instance so far as i have been able to ascertain in which the parent had been definitely and recognisably insane before the birth of the distinguished child so that any prohibition of the marriage ofpersons who had previously been insane would have left british genius untouched in all cases the insanity came on late in life and it was usually without doubt of the kind known as senile dementia this was so in the case of the mother of bacon the most distinguished person in the list of those with an insane parent charles lambs father we are told eventually became imbecile turners mother became insane the same is recorded of archbishop tillotsons mother and of archbishop leightons father this brief list includes all the parents of british men of genius who are recorded and not then always very definitely as having finally died insane in the description given of others of the parents of our men of genius it is not however difficult to detect that though they were not recognised as insane their mental condition was so highly abnormal as to be not far removed from insanity this was the case with grays father and with the mothers of arthur young and andrew bell even when we allow for all the doubtful cases the proportion of persons of genius with an insane parent remains very low less than per cent senile dementia though it is one of the least important and significant of the forms of insanity and is entirely compatible with a long and useful life must not however be regarded when present in a marked degree as the mere result of old age entirely normal people of sound heredity do not tend to manifest signs of pronounced mental weakness or abnormality even in extreme old age we are justified in suspecting a neurotic strain though it may not be of severe degree this is indeed illustrated by our records of british genius some of the eminent men of genius on my list at least twelve suffered before death from insanity which may probably be described as senile dementia but several of these were somewhat abnormal during earlier life like swift or had a child who became insane like bishop marsh in these and in other cases there has doubtless been some hereditary neurotic strain it is clearly however not due to any intensity of this strain that we find the incidence of insanity in men of genius as illustrated for example by senile dementia so much more marked than its incidence on their parents there is another factor to be invoked here convergent morbid heredity if a man and a woman each with a slight tendency to nervous abnormality marry each other there is a much greater chance of the offspring manifesting a severe degree of nervous abnormality than if they had married entirely sound partners now both among normal and abnormal people there is a tendency for like to mate with like the attraction of the unlike for each other which was once supposed to prevail is not predominant except within the sphere of the secondary sexual characters where it clearly prevails so that the ultramasculine man is attracted to the ultrafeminine woman and the feminine man to the boyish or mannish woman apart from this people tend to marry those who are both psychically and physically of the same type as themselves it thus happens that nervously abnormal people become mated to the nervously abnormal this is well illustrated by the british men of genius themselves although insanity is more prevalent among them than among their parents the same can scarcely be said of them in regard to their wives it is notable that the insane wives of these men of genius are almost as numerous as the insane men of genius though it rarely happens as in the case of southey that both husband and wife go out of their minds but in all these cases there has probably been a mutual attraction of mentally abnormal people it is to this tendency in the parents of men of genius leading to a convergent heredity that we must probably attribute the undue tendency of the men of genius themselves to manifest insanity each of the parents separately may have displayed but a minor degree of neuropathic abnormality but the two strains were fortified by union and the tendency to insanity became more manifest this was for instance the case as regards charles lamb the nervous abnormality of the parents in this case was less profound than that of the children but it was present in both under such circumstances what is called the law of anticipation comes into play the neurotic tendency of the parents increased by union is also antedated so that definite insanity occurs earlier in the life of the child than if it had appeared at all it occurred in the life of the parent lambs father only became weakminded in old age but since the mother also had a mentally abnormal strain lamb himself had an attack of insanity early in life and his sister was liable to recurrent insanity during a great part of her life notwithstanding however the influence of this convergent heredity it is found that the total insanity of british men and women of genius is not more so far as can be ascertainedeven when slight and dubious cases are includedthan per cent that ascertainable proportion must be somewhat below the real proportion but in any case it scarcely suggests that insanity is an essential factor of genius let us however go beyond the limits of british genius and consider the evidence more freely there is for instance tasso who was undoubtedly insane for a good part of his life and has been much studied by the pathologists degaudenzi who has written one of the best psychopathological studies of tasso shows clearly that his father bernardo was a man of high intelligence of great emotional sensibility with a tendency to melancholy as well as a mystical idealism of somewhat weak character and prone to invoke divine aid in the slightest difficulty it was a temperament that might be considered a little morbid outside a monastery but it was not insane nor is there any known insanity among his near relations this mans wife porzia tassos mother arouses the enthusiasm of all who ever mention her as a creature of angelic perfection no insanity here either but something of the same undue sensitiveness and melancholy as in the father the same absence of the coarser and more robust virtuesmoreover she belonged to a family by no means so angelic as herself not insane but abnormalmalevolent cruel avaricious almost criminal the most scrupulous modern alienist would hesitate to deprive either bernardo or porzia of the right to parenthood yet as we know the son born of this union was not only a worldfamous poet but an exceedingly unhappy abnormal and insane man let us take the case of another still greater and more famous man rousseau it cannot reasonably be doubted that at some moments in his life at all events and perhaps during a considerable period rousseau was definitely insane we are intimately acquainted with the details of the life and character of his relations and of his ancestry we not only possess the full account he set forth at the beginning of his confessions but we know very much more than rousseau knew geneva was paternalpaternal in the most severe sensein scrutinising every unusual act of its children and castigating every slightest deviation from the straight path the whole life of the citizens of old geneva may be read in genevan archives and not a scrap of information concerning the conduct of rousseaus ancestors and relatives as set down in these archives but has been brought to the light of day if there is any great man of genius whom the activities of these fanatical eugenists would have rendered impossible it must surely have been rousseau let us briefly examine his parentage rousseaus father was the outcome of a fine stock which for two generations had been losing something of its fine qualities though without sinking anywhere near insanity criminality or pauperism the rousseaus still exercised their craft with success they were on the whole esteemed jeanjacquess father was generally liked but he was somewhat unstable romantic with no strong sense of duty hottempered easily taking offence the mother from a modern standpoint was an attractive highly accomplished and admirable woman in her neighbours eyes she was not quite puritanical enough highspirited independent adventurous fond of innocent gaiety but a devoted wife when at last at the age of thirty she married more than once before marriage she was formally censured by the ecclesiastical authorities for her little insubordinations and these may be seen to have a certain significance when we turn to her father he was a thorough mauvais sujet with an incorrigible love of pleasure and constantly falling into welldeserved trouble for some escapade with the young women of geneva thus on both sides there was a certain nervous instability an uncontrollable wayward emotionality but of actual insanity of nervous disorder of any decided abnormality or downright unfitness in either father or mother not a sign isaac rousseau and susanne bernard would have been passed by the most ferocious eugenist it is again a case in which the chances of convergent heredity have produced a result which in its magnitude in its heights and in its depths none could foresee it is one of the most famous and most accurately known examples of insane genius in history and we see what amount of support it offers to the ponderous dictum concerning the insane heredity of genius let us turn from insanity to grave nervous disease epilepsy at once comes before us all the more significantly since it has been considered more especially by lombroso to be the special disease through which genius peculiarly manifests itself it is true that much importance here is attached to those minor forms of epilepsy which involve no gross and obvious convulsive fit the existence of these minor attacks is in the case of men of genius usually difficult to disprove and equally difficult to prove it certainly should not be so as regards the major form of epilepsy yet among the thousand and thirty persons of british genius i was only able to find epilepsy mentioned twice and in both cases incorrectly for the national biographer had attributed it to lord herbert of cherbury through misreading a passage in herberts autobiography while the epileptic fits of sir wr hamilton in old age were most certainly not true epilepsy without doubt no eugenist could recommend an epileptic to become a parent but if epilepsy has no existence in british men of genius it is improbable that it has often occurred among their parents the loss to british genius through eugenic activity in this sphere would probably therefore have been nil putting aside british genius however one finds that it has been almost a commonplace of alienists and neurologists even up to the present day to present glibly a formidable list of mighty men of genius as victims of epilepsy thus i find a wellknown american alienist lately making the unqualified and positive statement that mahomet napoleon molière handel paganini mozart schiller richelieu newton and flaubert were epileptics while still more recently a distinguished english neurologist declaring that the worlds history has been made by men who were either epileptics insane or of neuropathic stock brings forward a similar and still larger list to illustrate that statement with alexander the great julius caesar the apostle paul luther frederick the great and many others thrown in though unfortunately he fails to tell us which members of the group he desires us to regard as epileptic julius caesar was certainly one of them but the statement of suetonius not an unimpeachable authority in any case that caesar had epileptic fits towards the close of his life is disproof rather than proof of true epilepsy of mahomet and st paul also epilepsy is alleged as regards the first the most competent authorities regard the convulsive seizures attributed to the prophet as perhaps merely a legendary attempt to increase the awe he inspired by unmistakable evidence of divine authority the narrative of st pauls experience on the road to damascus is very unsatisfactory evidence on which to base a medical diagnosis and it may be mentioned that in the course of a discussion in the columns of the british medical journal during as many as six different views were put forward as to the nature of the apostles thorn in the flesh the evidence on which richelieu who was undoubtedly a man of very fragile constitution is declared to be epileptic is of the very slenderest character for the statement that newton was epileptic there is absolutely no reliable evidence at all and i am quite ignorant of the grounds on which mozart handel and schiller are declared epileptics the evidence for epilepsy innapoleon may seem to carry slightly more weight for there is that in the moral character of napoleon which we might very well associate with the epileptic temperament it seems clear that napoleon really had at times convulsive seizures which were at least epileptoid thus talleyrand describes how one day just after dinner it may be recalled that napoleon was a copious and exceedingly rapid eater passing for a few minutes into josephines room the emperor came out took talleyrand into his own room ordered the door to be closed and then fell down in a fit bourrienne however who was napoleons private secretary for eleven years knew nothing about any fits it is not usual in a true epileptic fit to be able to control the circumstances of the seizure to this extent and if napoleon who lived so public a life furnished so little evidence of epilepsy to his environment it may be regarded as very doubtful whether any true epilepsy existed and on other grounds it seems highly improbable of all these distinguished persons in the list of alleged epileptics it is naturally most profitable to investigate the case of the latest flaubert for here it is easiest to get at the facts maxime du camp a friend in early life though later incompatibility of temperament led to estrangement announced to the world in his souvenirs that flaubert was an epileptic and goncourt mentions in his journal that he was in the habit of taking much bromide but the fits never began until the age of twentyeight which alone should suggest to a neurologist that they are not likely to have been epileptic they never occurred in public he could feel the fit coming on and would go and lie down he never lost consciousness his intellect and moral character remained intact until death it is quite clear that there was no true epilepsy here nor anything like it flaubert was of fairly sound nervous heredity on both sides and his father a distinguished surgeon was a man of keen intellect and high character the novelist who was of robust physical and mental constitution devoted himself strenuously and exclusively to intellectual work it is not surprising that he was somewhat neurasthenic if not hysterical and dumesnil who discusses this question in his book on flaubert concludes that the fits may be called hysterical attacks of epileptoid form it may well be that we have in flauberts case a clue to the epilepsy of the other great men who in this matter are coupled with him they were nearly all persons of immense intellectual force highly charged with nervous energy they passionately concentrated their energy on the achievement of life tasks of enormous magnitude involving the highest tension of the organism under such conditions even in the absence of all bad heredity or of actual disease convulsive discharges may occur we may see even in healthy and sound women that occasionally some physiological and unrelieved overcharging of the organism with nervous energy may result in what is closely like a hysterical fit while even a violent fit of crying is a minor manifestation of the same tendency the feminine element in genius has often been emphasised and it may well be that under the conditions of the geniuslife when working at high pressure we have somewhat similar states of nervous overcharging and that from time to time the tension is relieved naturally and spontaneously by a convulsive discharge this at all events seems a possible explanation it is rather strange that in these recklessly confident lists of eminent epileptics we fail to find the one man of distinguished genius whom perhaps we are justified in regarding as a true epileptic dostoievsky appears to have been an epileptic from an early age he remained liable to epileptic fits throughout life and they plunged him into mental dejection and confusion in many of his novels we find pictures of the epileptic temperament evidently based on personal experience showing the most exact knowledge and insight into all the phases of the disease moreover dostoievsky in his own person appears to have displayed the perversions and the tendency to mental deterioration which we should expect to find in a true epileptic so far as our knowledge goes he really seems to stand alone as a manifestation of supreme genius combined with epilepsy yet as dr loygue remarks in his medicopsychological study of the great russian novelist epilepsy only accounts for half of the man and leaves unexplained his passion for work the dualism of epilepsy and genius is irreducible there is one other still more recent man of true genius though not of the highest rank who may possibly be counted as epileptic vincent van gogh the painter a brilliant and highly original artist he was a definitely abnormal man who cannot be said to have escaped mental deterioration simple and humble and suffering recklessly sacrificing himself to help others always in trouble van gogh had many points of resemblance to dostoievsky he has indeed been compared to the idiot immortalised by dostoievsky in some aspects an imbecile in some aspects a saint yet epilepsy no more explains the genius of van gogh than it explains the genius of dostoievsky thus the impression we gain when laying aside prejudice we take a fairly wide and impartial survey of the facts or even when we investigate in detail the isolated facts to which significance is most often attached by no means supports the notion that genius springs entirely or even mainly from insane and degenerate stocks in some cases undoubtedly it is found in such stocks but the ability displayed in these cases is rarely perhaps never of any degree near the highest it is quite easy to point to persons of a certain significance especially in literature and art who though themselves sanepossess many near relatives who are highly neurotic and sometimes insane such cases however are far from justifying any confident generalisations concerning the intimate dependence of genius on insanity we see moreover that to conclude that men of genius are rarely or never the offspring of a radically insane parentage is not to assume that the parents of men of genius are usually of average normal constitution that would in any case be improbable apart from the tendency to convergent heredity already emphasised there is a wider tendency to slight abnormality a minor degree of inaptness for ordinary life in the parentage of genius i found that in per cent cases certainly much below the real mark of the british people of genius one parent generally the father had shown abnormality from a social or parental point of view he had been idle or extravagant or restless or cruel or intemperate or unbusinesslike in the great majority of these cases unsuccessful the father of dickens represented by his son in micawber who was always vainly expecting something to turn up is a good type of these fathers of genius shakespeares father may have been of much the same sort george merediths father again who was too superior a person for the outfitting business he inherited but never succeeded in being anything else is another example of this group of fathers of genius the father in these cases is a link of transition between the normal stock and its brilliantly abnormal offshoot in this transitional stage we see as it were the stock reculer pour mieux sauter but it is in the son that the great leap is made manifest this peculiarity will serve to indicate that in a large proportion of cases the parentage of genius is not entirely sound and normal we must dismiss absolutely the notion that the parents of persons of genius tend to exhibit traits of a grossly insane or nervously degenerate character the evidence for such a view is confined to a minute proportion of cases and even then is usually doubtful but it is another matter to assume that the parentage of genius is absolutely normal and still less can we assert that genius always springs from entirely sound stocks the statement is sometimes made that all families contain an insane element that statement cannot be accepted there are many people including people of a high degree of ability who can trace no gross mental or nervous disease in their families unless remote branches are taken into account not many statistics bearing on this point are yet available but jenny roller in a very thorough investigation found at zurich in that healthy people had in per cent cases directly and in per cent cases indirectly and altogether a neuropathic heredity while otto diem in found that the corresponding percentages were still higher and it should not therefore be matter for surprise if careful investigation revealed a traceable neuropathic element at least as frequent as this in the families which produce a man of genius it may further i believe be argued that the presence of a neuropathic element of this kind in the ancestry of genius is frequently not without a real significance aristotle said in his poetics that poetry demanded a man with a touch of madness though the ancients who frequently made a similar statement to this had not our modern ideas of neuropathic heredity in their minds but merely meant that inspiration simulated insanity yet a touch of madness a slight morbid strain usually neurotic or gouty in a preponderantly robust and energetic stock seems to be often of some significance in the evolution of genius it appears to act one is inclined to think as a kind of ferment leading to a process out of all relation to its own magnitude in the sphere of literary genius milton flaubert and william morris may help to illustrate this precious fermentative influence of a minor morbid element in vitally powerful stocks without some such ferment as this the energy of the stock one may well suppose might have been confined within normal limits the rare and exquisite flower of genius we know required an abnormal stimulation only in this sense is there any truth at all in lombrosos statement that the pearl of genius develops around a germ of disease but this is the utmost length to which the facts allow us to go in assuming the presence of a morbid element as a frequent constituent of genius even then we only have one of the factors of genius to which moreover undue importance cannot be attached when we remember how often this ferment is present without any resultant process of genius and we are in any case far removed from any of those gross nervous lesions which all careful guardianship of the race must tend to eliminate thus we are brought back to the point from which we started would eugenics stamp out genius there is no need to minimise the fact that a certain small proportion of men of genius have displayed highly morbid characters nor to deny that in a large proportion of cases a slightly morbid strain may with care be detected in the ancestry of genius but the influence of eugenic considerations can properly be brought to bear only in the case of grossly degenerate stocks here so far as our knowledge extends the parentage of genius nearly always escapes the destruction of genius and its creation alike elude the eugenist if there is a tendency in modern civilisation towards a diminution in the manifestations of geniuswhich may admit of questionit can scarcely be due to any threatened elimination of corrupt stocks it may perhaps more reasonably be sought in the haste and superficiality which our present phase of urbanisation fosters and only the most robust genius can adequately withstand a danish alienist lange has however made an attempt on a statistical basis to show a connection between mental ability and mental degeneracy f lange degeneration in families translated from the danish he deals with families which have provided insane or neuropathic persons within a few generations and during the same period alarge number also of highly distinguished members cabinet ministers bishops artists poets etc but lange admits that the forms of insanity found in these families are of a slight and not severe character while it is clear that the forms of ability are also in most cases equally slight they are mostly old families such as naturally produce highlytrained and highly placed individuals moreover langes methods and style of writing are not scientifically exact and he fails to define precisely what he means by a family his investigation indicates that there is a frequent tendency for men of ability to belong to families which are not entirely sound and that is a conclusion which is not seriously disputed havelock ellis a study of british genius dr cabanès indiscrétions de lhistoire rd series similarly concludes that while in temperament napoleon may be said to belong to the epileptic class he was by no means an epileptic in the ordinary sense kanngiesser prager medizinische wochenschrift no suggests that from his slow pulse to napoleons attacks may have originated in the heart and vessels genuine epilepsy usually comes on before the age of twentyfive it very rarely begins after twentyfive and never after thirty lw weber münchener medizinische wochenschrift july th and aug th in genuine epilepsy also loss of consciousness accompanies the fits the exceptions to this rule are rare though audenino a pupil of lombroso who sought to extend the sphere of epilepsy believes that the exceptions are not so rare as is commonly supposed archivio di psichiatria fasc vi moreover true epilepsy is accompanied by a progressive mental deterioration which terminates in dementia in the craig colony for epileptics of new york among epileptics this progressive deterioration is very rarely absent lancet march st but it is not found in the distinguished men of genius who are alleged to be epileptic epileptic deterioration has been elaborately studied by maccurdy psychiatric bulletin new york april see eg elizabeth du quesne van gogh personal recollections of vincent van gogh p these epileptic attacks are however but vaguely mentioned and it would seem that they only appeared during the last years of the artists life xiv the production of ability the growing interest in eugenics and the worldwide decline in the birthrate have drawn attention to the study of the factors which determine the production of genius in particular and high ability in general the interest in this question thus freshly revived and made more acute by the results of the great war is not indeed new it is nearly half a century since galton wrote his famous book on the heredity of genius or as he might better have described the object of his investigation the heredity of ability at a later date my own study of british genius collectively summarised all the biological data available concerning the parentage and birth of the most notable persons born in england while numerous other studies might also be named such investigations are today acquiring a fresh importance because while it is becoming realised that we are gaining a new control over the conditions of birth the production of children has itself gained in importance the world is no longer bombarded by an exuberant stream of babies good bad and indifferent in quality with mankind to look on calmly at the struggle for existence among them whether we like it or not the quantity is relatively diminishing and the question of quality is beginning to assume a supreme significance what are the conditions which assure the finest quality in our children a german scientist dr vaerting of berlin published on the eve of the war a little book on the most favourable age in parents for the production of children of ability das günstigste elterliche zeugungsalter he approaches the question entirely in this new spirit not as a merely academic topic of discussion but as a practical matter of vital importance to the welfare of society he starts with the assertion that our century has been called the century of the child and for the child all manner of rights are now being claimed but the prime right of all the right of the child to the best ability that his parents are able to transmit to him is never even so much as considered yet this right is the root of all childrens rights and when the mysteries of procreation have been so far revealed as toenable this right to be won we shall at the same time dr vaerting adds renew the spiritual aspect of the nations the most easily ascertainable and measurable factor in the production of ability and certainly a factor which cannot be without significance is the age of the parents at the childs birth it is this factor with which vaerting is mainly concerned as illustrated by over one hundred german men of genius concerning whom he has been able to obtain the required data later on he proposes to extend the inquiry to other nations vaerting findsand this is probably the most original though as we shall see not the most unquestionable of his findingsthat the fathers who are themselves of no notable intellectual distinction have a decidedly more prolonged power of procreating distinguished children than is possessed by distinguished fathers the former that is to say may become the fathers of eminent children from the period of sexual maturity up to the age of fortythree or beyond when however the father is himself of high intellectual distinction vaerting finds that he was nearly always under thirty and usually under twentyfive years of age at his distinguished sons birth although the proportion of youthful fathers in the general population is relatively small the eleven youngest fathers on vaertings list from twentyone to twentyfive years of age were with one exception themselves more or less distinguished while the fifteen oldest from thirtynine to sixty years of age were all without exception undistinguished among these sons are to be found much greater names goethe bach kant bismarck wagner etc than are to be found among the sons of young and more distinguished fathers for here there is only one name frederick the great of the same calibre the elderly fathers belonged to large cities and were mostly married to wives very much younger than themselves vaerting notes that the most eminent geniuses have most frequently been the sons of fathers who were not engaged in intellectual avocations at all but earned their livings as simple craftsmen he draws the conclusion from these data that strenuous intellectual energy is much more unfavourable than hard physical labour to the production of ability in the offspring intellectual workers therefore he argues must have their children when young and we must so modify our social ideals and economic conditions as to render this possible that the mother should be equally young is not he holds necessary he finds some superiority indeed provided the father is young in somewhat elderly mothers and there were no mothers under twentythree the rarity of genius among the offspring of distinguished parents is attributed to the unfortunate tendency to marry too late and vaerting finds that the distinguished men who marry late rarely have any children at all speaking generally and apart from the production of genius he holds that women have children too early before their psychic development is completed while men have children too late when they have already in the years of their highest psychic generative fitness planted their most precious seed in the mud of the street the eldest child was found to have by far the best chance of turning out distinguished and in this fact vaerting finds further proof of his argument the third son has the next best chance and then the second the comparatively bad position of the second being attributed to the too brief interval which often follows the birth of the first child he also notes that of all the professions the clergy come beyond comparison first as the parents of distinguished sons who are however rarely of the highest degree of eminence lawyers following while officers in the army and physicians scarcely figure at all vaerting is inclined to see in this order especially in the predominance of the clergy the favourable influence of an unexhausted reserve of energy and a habit of chastity on intellectual procreativeness this is one of his main conclusions it so happens that in my own study of british genius with which dr vaerting was unacquainted when he made his first investigation i dealt on a larger scale and perhaps with somewhat more precise method with many of these same questions as they are illustrated by english genius vaertings results have induced me to reexamine and to some extent to manipulate afresh the english data my results like dr vaertings showed a special tendency for genius to appear in the eldest child though there was no indication of notably early marriage in the parents i also found a similar predominance of the clergy among the fathers and a similar deficiency of army officers and physicians the most frequent age of the father was thirtytwo years but the average age of the father at the distinguished childs birth was years and when the fathers were themselves distinguished their age was not as vaerting found in germany notably low at the birth of their distinguished sons but higher than the general average being years there have been fifteen distinguished english sons of distinguished fathers but instead of being nearly always under thirty and usually under twentyfive as vaerting found in germany the english distinguished father has only five times been under thirty and among these five only twice under twentyfive moreover precisely the most distinguished of the sons francis bacon and william pitt had the oldest fathers and the least distinguished sons the youngest fathers i made some attempt to ascertain whether different kinds of genius tend to be produced by fathers who were at different periods of life i refrained from publishing the results as i doubted whether the numbers dealt with were sufficiently large to carry anyweight it may however be worth while to record them as possibly they are significant i made four classes of men of genius men of religion poets practical men and scientific men and sceptics it must not of course be supposed that in this last group all the scientific men were sceptics or all the sceptics scientific the average age of the fathers at the distinguished sons birth was in the first group years in the second and third groups years and in the last group years it may be noted however that the youngest father of all in the history of british genius aged sixteen produced napier who introduced logarithms it is difficult not to believe that as regards at all events the two most discrepant groups the first and last we here come on a significant indication it is not unreasonable to suppose that in the production of men of religion in whose activity emotion is so potent a factor the youthful age of the father should prove favourable while for the production of genius of a more coldly intellectual and analytic type more elderly fathers are demanded if that should prove to be so it would become a source of happiness to religious parents to have their children early while irreligious persons should be advised to delay parentage it is scarcely necessary to remark that the age of the mothers is probably quite as influential as that of the fathers concerning the mothers however we always have less precise information my records so far as they go agree with vaertings for german genius in indicating that an elderly mother is more likely to produce a child of genius than a very youthful mother there were only fifteen mothers recorded under twentyfive years of age while thirteen were over thirtynine years the most frequent age of the mothers was twentyseven on all these points we certainly need controlling evidence from other countries thus before we insist with vaerting that an elderly mother is a factor in the production of genius we may recall that even in germany the mothers of goethe and nietzsche were both eighteen at their distinguished sons birth a rule which permits of such tremendous exceptions scarcely seems to bear the strain of emphasis it must always be remembered that while the study of genius is highly interesting and even it is probable not without significance for the general laws of heredity we must not too hastily draw conclusions from it to bear on practical questions of eugenics genius is rare and abnormal laws meant to apply to the general population must be based on a study of the general population vaerting who is alive to the practical character which such problems are today assuming realises how inadequate it is to confine our study to genius marro in his valuable book on puberty some years ago brought forward interesting data showing the result of the age of the parents on the moral and intellectual characters of schoolchildren in north italy he found that children with fathers below twentysix at their birth showed the maximum of bad conduct and the minimum of good they also yielded the greatest proportion of children of irregular troublesome or lazy character but not of really perverse children who were equally distributed among fathers of all ages the largest number of cheerful children belonged to young fathers while the children tended to become more melancholy with ascending age of the fathers young fathers produced the largest proportion of intelligent as well as of troublesome children but when the very exceptionally intelligent children were considered separately they were found to be more usually the offspring of elderly fathers as regards the mothers marro found that the children of young mothers under twentyone are superior both as regards conduct and intelligence though the more exceptionally intelligent children tended to belong to more mature mothers when the parents were both in the same agegroup the immature and the elderly groups tended to produce more children who were unsatisfactory both as regards conduct and intelligence than the intermediate group but we need to have such inquiries made on a more wholesale and systematic scale they are no longer of a merely speculative character we no longer regard children as the gifts of god flung into our helpless hands we are beginning to realise that the responsibility is ours to see that they come into the world under the best conditions and at the moments when their parents are best fitted to produce them vaerting proposes that it should be the business of all school authorities to register the ages of the pupils parents this is scarcely a provision to which even the most susceptible parent could reasonably object though there is no cause to make the declaration compulsory where a conscientious objection existed and in any case the declaration would not be public it would be an advantagethough this might be more difficult to obtainto have the date of the parents marriage and of the birth of previous children as well as some record of the fathers standing in his occupation but even the ages of the parents alone would teach us much when correlated with the school position of the pupil in intelligence and in conduct it is quite true that there are unavoidable fallacies we are not as in the case of genius dealing with people whose lifework is complete and open to the whole worlds examination the good and clever child is not necessarily the forerunner of the firstclass man or woman and many capable and successful men have been careless in attendance at lectures and rebellious to discipline moreover the prejudice and limitations of the teachers have also to be recognised yet when we are dealing with millions most of these fallacies would be smoothed out we should be once for all in a position to determine authoritatively the exact bearing of one of the simplest and most vital factors of the betterment of the race we should be in

which i have not seen the reference is to the century of the child by ellen key who writes english translation p my conviction is that the transformation of human nature will take place not when the whole of humanity becomes christian but when the whole of humanity awakens to the consciousness of the holiness of generation this consciousness will make the central work of society the new race its

and divorce we contemplate our marriage system with satisfaction we remember the many unquestionable evidences in favour of it and we marvel that it so often proves a failure for while we remember the evidence in favour of it we forget the evidence against it and we overlook the important fact that our favourable evidence is largely based on the vision of an abstract or idealised monogamy which fails to correspond to the detailed and ever varying system which in practice we cherish we point to the fact that monogamic marriage has probably flourished throughout the history of the world that it exists among savages even among animals but we fail to observe how far that monogamy differs from ours even assuming that our monogamy is a real monogamy and not a disguised polygamy especially in the fact that it is a free union and only subject to the inherent penalties that follow its infraction not to external penalties ours is not free our faith in its natural virtues is not quite so firm as we assert we are always meddling with it and worrying over its health and anxiously trying to bolster it up we are not by any means willing to let it rest on the sanction of its own natural or divine laws our feeling is as james hinton used ironically to express it poor god with no one to help him the fact is that when we compare our civilised marriage system with marriage as it exists in nature we fail to realise a fundamental distinction our marriage system is made up of two absolutely different elements which cannot blend on the one hand it is the manifestation of our deepest and most volcanic impulses on the other hand it is an elaborate web of regulationslegal ecclesiastical economicwhich is today quite out of relation to our impulses on the one hand it is a force which springs from within on the other hand it is a force which presses on us from without one says broadly that these two elements of marriage as we understand it are out of relation to each other but there is an important saving qualification to be made the inner impulse is not without law and the external pressure is not without an ultimate basis of nature that is to say that under free and natural conditions the inner impulse tends to develop itself not licentiously but with its own order and restraints while on the other hand our inherited regulations are largely the tradition of ancient attempts to fix and register that natural order and restraint the disharmony comes in with the fact that our regulations are traditional and ancient not our own attempts to fix and register the natural order but inextricably mixed up with elements that are entirely alien to our civilised habits of life whatever our attitude towards mediaeval canon law may bewhether reverence or indifference or disgustit yet holds us and is ingrained into our marriage system today canon law was a good and vital thing under the conditions which produced it the survival of canon law today with the antiquated and ascetic conception of the subordination of women associated with it is the chief reason why we in the twentieth century have not yet progressed so far towards a reasonable system of marriage as the romans had reached on the basis of their law nearly two thousand years ago marriage is conditioned both by inner impulse and outward pressure but a healthy impulse bears within it an order and restraint of its own while a truly moral outward pressure is based not on the demands of mediaeval days but on the demands of our own day how far this is from being the case yet we find well illustrated by our divorce methods all our modern culture favour a sense of the sacredness of the sexual relations we cherish a delicate reserve concerning all the intimacies of personal relationship but when the magic word divorce is uttered we fling all our civilisation to the winds and in the desecratedname of law we proceed to an inquisition which scarcely differs at all from those public tests of mediaeval lawcourts which now we dare not venture even to put into words it is true that we are not bound to be consistent when it is an advantage to be inconsistent and if there were a method in our madness it would be justified but there is no method from first to last the history of divorce read it for instance in howards matrimonial institutions is an ever shifting record of cruel blunders and ridiculous absurdities divorce began in modern times in flagrant injustice to one of the two partners the wife and it has endedif we may hope that the end is approachingin imbecilities that to future ages will be incredible for no legal jargon has ever been invented that will express the sympathies and the antipathies of human relationship they even escape the subtlest expression lawmakers have tortured their brains to devise formulas which will cover the legitimate grounds for divorce how vain their efforts are is sufficiently shown by the fact that by no chance can they ever agree on their formulas and that they are changing them constantly with feverish haste dimly realising that they are but the antiquated representatives of mediaevalism and that soon their occupation will be gone for ever the reasons for the making or the breaking of human relationships can never be formulated the only result of such legal formulas is that they bring law into contempt because they have to be ingeniously and methodically cheated in order to adapt them in any degree to civilised human needs thus such laws not only degrade the name of law but they degrade the whole community which tolerates them there is only one ultimate reason for either marriage or divorce and that is that the two persons concerned consent to the marriage or consent to the divorce why they consent is no concern of any third party and maybe they cannot even put it into words at the same time let us not forget marriage and divorce are a very real concern of the state and law cannot ignore either it is the business of the state to see to it that no interests are injured the contract of marriage and the contract of divorce are private matters but it is necessary to guard that no injury is thereby done to either of the contracting persons or to third parties or to the community as a whole the state may have a right to say what persons are unfit for marriage or at all events for procreation the state must take care that the weaker party is not injured the state is especially bound to watch over the interests of children and this involves in the best issue that each child shall have two effective parents whether or not those parents are living together a large scopewe are beginning to recognisemust be left alike to freedom of marriage and freedom of divorce but the state must mark out the limits within which that freedom is exercised the loosening hold of the state on marriage is by no means connected with any growing sense of the value of divorce at the best it is probable that divorce is merely a necessary evil one of the chief reasons why we should seek to promote education in relation to sexual relationships and to inculcate the responsibilities of such relationships so making the approach to marriage more circumspect is in order to obviate the need for divorce for divorce is always a confession of failure very often indeed it involves not only a confession of failure in one particular marriage but of failure for marriage generally one notes how often the people who fail in a first marriage fail even more hopelessly in the second they have chosen the wrong partners but one suspects that for them all partners will prove the wrong partners one sometimes hears nowadays that a succession of marriage relationships is desirable in order to develop character but that depends on many things it very much depends on what character there is to develop a man may have relationships with a hundred women and develop much less character out of his experience and even acquire a much less intimate knowledge of women than the man who has spent his life in an endless series of adventures with one woman it depends a good deal on the man and not a little on the woman thus the work of marriage in the world must depend entirely on the nature of that world a fine marriage system can only be produced by a fine civilisation of which it is the exquisite flower laws cannot better marriage even education by itself is powerless necessary as it is in conjunction with other influences the loverelationships of men and women must develop freely and with due allowance for the variations which the complexities of civilisation demand but these relationships touch the whole of life at so infinite a number of points that they cannot even develop at all save in a society that is itself developing graciously and harmoniously do not expect to pluck figs from thistles as a society is so will its marriages be it is this artificial and external pressure which often produces a revolt against marriage the author of a remarkable paper entitled our incestuous marriage in the forum dec advocates a reform of social marriage customs in conformance with the freedomloving modern nature and the introduction of a fresh atmosphere for married life in which personality can be made to appear so sacred and free that marriage will be undertaken and borne as lightly and gracefully as a secret sin see sir james donaldson woman her position and influence in ancient greece and rome also sb kitchins excellent history of divorce this author believes that the tendency in modern civilisation is to return to the simple principles of roman law involving divorce by consent see also havelock ellis sex in relation to society ch xxvi the meaning of the birthrate the history of educated opinion concerning the birthrate and its interpretation during the past seventy years is full of interest the actual operative factorsnatural pathological economic social and educationalin raising or lowering the birthrate are numerous and complicated and it is difficult to determine exactly how large a part each factor plays but without determining that at all it is still very instructive to observe the evolution of popular intelligent opinion concerning the significance of a high and a low birthrate popular opinion on this matter may be said to have passed through three stages i am referring to western europe and more particularly to england and germany for it must be remembered that in this matter england and germany are running a parallel course england happens to be on the whole a little ahead having reached its period of full expansion at a somewhat earlier period than germany but each people is pursuing the same course in the first stagelet us say about the middle of the last century and the succeeding thirty yearsthe popular attitude was one of jubilant satisfaction in a high and rising birthrate there had been an immense expansion of industry the whole world seemed nothing but a great field for the energetic and industrial nations to exploit workers were needed to keep up with the expansion and to keep down wages to a rate which would make industrial expansion easy soldiers and armaments were needed to protect the movements of expansion it seemed to the more exuberant spirits that a vast british empire or a mighty pangermany might be expected to cover the whole world france with its low and falling birthrate was looked down at with contempt as a decadent country inhabited by a degenerate population no attempts to analyse the birthrate to ascertain what are really the biological social and economic accompaniments of a high birthrate made any impression on the popular mind they were drowned in the general shout of exultation that era of optimism was followed by a swift reaction towards the upward movement of the birthrate began to be arrested it soon began steadily to fall as it is continuing to do today in france it is falling slowly in italy more rapidly in england and prussia still more rapidly as however the fall began earliest in france the birthrate is lower there than in the other countries named for the same reason it is lower in england than in prussia although england stands in this respect at almost exactly the same distance from prussia today as thirty years ago the fall having occurred at the same rate in both countries it is quite possible that in the future it may become more rapid in prussia than in england for the birthrate of berlin is lower than the birthrate of london and urbanisation is proceeding at a more rapid rate in germany than in england the realisation of such facts as these produced a period of pessimism which marks the second stage in this evolution the great movement of expansion which seemed to promise so much to ambitious nations anxious for worldpower was being arrested moreover it began to be realised that the rapid growth of a community was accompanied by phenomena which had not been foreseen by the enthusiasts of the first period of optimism they had arguednot indeed verbally but in effectthat the higher the birthrate the cheaper labour and lives would become and the cheaper labour and lives were the easier it would be for a nation with its industrial armies and its military armies to get ahead of other rival nations but they had not realised that with the growth of popular education in modern democratic states cheap labour is no longer willing to play without protest this humble and suffering part in national progress the workers of the nations began to declare clearly or obscurely as they were able that they no longer intended to sell their labour and their lives so cheaply the rising birthrate of the middle of the nineteenth century coincided with and to a large extent doubtless produced the organisation of labour trades unions the political activity of the working classes socialism as well as the extreme forms of anarchism and syndicalism it was when these movements began to attain a high degree of organisation and power that the birthrate began to decline thus the pessimists of the second period were faced by horrors on both sides on the one hand they saw that the everincreasing rate of human production which seemed to them the essential condition of national social even moral progress had not only stopped but was steadily diminishing on the other hand they saw that even in so far as it was maintained it involved under modern conditions nothing but social commotion and economic disturbance there are still many pessimists of this second period alive among us and actively proclaiming their gospel of despair alike in england and in germany but a new generation is growing up and this question is now entering a third period the new generation rejects alike the passive optimism of the first period and the passive pessimism of the second period its attitude is hopeful but it realises that mere hope is vain unless there is clear intellectual vision and unless there is individual and social action in accordance with that vision it is today beginning to be seen that the old notion of progress by means of reckless multiplication is vain it can only beeffected at a ruinous cost of death disease poverty and misery we see this in the past history of western europe as we still see it in the history of russia any progress effected along that lineif progress it can be calledis now barred for it is absolutely opposed to those democratic conceptions which are ever gaining greater influence among us moreover we are now better able to analyse demographic phenomena and we are no longer satisfied with any crude statements regarding the birthrate we realise that they need interpretation they have to be considered in relation to the sexconstitution and the ageconstitution of the population and above all they must be viewed in relation to the infant mortalityrate the bad aspect of the french birthrate is not so much its lowness as that it is accompanied by a high infantile mortality the fact that the german birthrate is higher than the english ceases to be a matter of satisfaction when it is realised that german infantile mortality is vastly greater than english a high birthrate is no sign of a high civilisation but we are beginning to feel that a high infantile deathrate is a sign of a very inferior civilisation a low birthrate with a low infant deathrate not only produces the same increase in the population as a high birthrate with the high deathrate which always accompanies it for there are no examples of a high birthrate with a low deathrate but it produces it in a way which is far more worthy of our admiration in this matter than the way of russia and china where opposite conditions prevail it used to be thought that small families were immoral we now begin to see that it was the large families of old which were immoral the excessive birthrate of the early industrial period was directly stimulated by selfishness there were no laws against childlabour children were produced that they might be sent out when little more than babies to the factories and the mines to increase their parents incomes the diminished birthrate has accompanied higher moral transformation it has introduced a finer economy into life diminished death disease and misery it is indirectly and even directly improving the quality of the race the very fact that children are born at longer intervals is not only beneficial to the mothers health and therefore to the childrens general welfare but it has been proved to have a marked and prolonged influence on the physical development of children social progress and a higher civilisation we thus see involve a reduced birthrate and a reduced deathrate the fewer the children born the fewer the risks of death disease and misery to the children that are born the fact that civilisation involves small families is clearly shown by the tendency of the educated and upper social classes to have small families as the proletariat class becomes educated and elevated disciplined to refinement and to foresightas it were aristocratisedit also has small families civilisational progress is here in a line with biological progress the lower organisms spawn their progeny in thousands the higher mammals produce but one or two at a time the higher the race the fewer the offspring thus diminution in quantity is throughout associated with augmentation in quality quality rather than quantity is the racial ideal now set before us and it is an ideal which as we are beginning to learn it is possible to cultivate both individually and socially the day is coming as engel remarks in his useful book on the elements of child protection when fatherhood and motherhood will only be permitted to the strong that is why the new science of eugenics or racial hygiene is acquiring so immense an importance in the past racial selection has been carried out crudely by the destructive wasteful and expensive method of elimination through death in the future it will be carried out far more effectively by conscious and deliberate selection exercised not merely before birth but before conception and even before mating it is idle to suppose that such a change can be exerted by mere legislation for which besides our scientific knowledge is still inadequate we cannot indeed desire any compulsory elimination of the unfit or any regulated breeding of the fit such notions are idle man can only be bred from within through the medium of his intelligence and will working together under the control of a high sense of responsibility galton who recognised the futility of mere legislation to elevate the race believed that the hope of the future lay in eugenics becoming a part of religion the good of the race lies not in the production of a superman but of a superhumanity this can only be attained through personal individual development the increase of knowledge the sense of responsibility towards the race enabling men to act in accordance with responsibility the leadership in civilisation belongs not to the nation with the highest birthrate but to the nation which has thus learnt to produce the finest men and women for a more detailed discussion of these points see the authors task of social hygiene xvii civilisation and the birthrateit was inevitable that the great war of today should lead to an outcry in all the countries engaged for more children and larger families in germany and in austria in france and in england panicstricken fanatics are found who preach to the people that the birthrate is falling and the nation is decaying no scheme is too wild for the supposed benefit of the country in a fierce coming fight for commercial supremacy as well as with due regard to the requirements in cannon fodder of another great war twenty years hence it may be well however to pause before we listen to these quixotic plans we may then find reason to think not only that any attempt to arrest the falling birthrate is scarcely likely to be effective in view of the fact that it affects not one country only but all the countries that count but that even if it could be successful it would be mischievous whatever the results of the war may be one result is fairly certain and that is that under the most favourable circumstances every country will emerge laden with misery and debt whatever prosperity may follow living will be expensive for a long time to come and the incomes of all classes heavily burdened a bounty on babies would hardly make up for these difficulties the happy family under the conditions that seem to be immediately ahead of us is likely to be the small family the large familyas indeed has been the case in the pastis likely to be visited by disease and death but there is more to be said than this we must dismiss altogether the statement so often made that a falling birthrate means an old and dying community the germans have for years been making this remark contemptuously regarding the french but today they have to recognise a vitality in the french which they had not expected while in recent years also their own birthrate has been falling more rapidly than that of france nor is it true that a falling birthrate means a falling population the french birthrate has long been steadily falling yet the french population has been steadily increasing all the time though less rapidly than it would had not the deathrate been abnormally high it is not the number of babies born that counts but the net result in surviving children an enormous number of babies are born in china but an enormous number die while still babies so that it is better to have a few babies of good quality than a large number of indifferent quality for the falling birthrate is more than compensated by the falling deathrate that is what we are attaining in england and as we know our steadily falling birthrate results in a steadily growing population there is still more to be said small families and a falling birthrate are not merely no evil they are a positive good they are a gain for humanity they represent an evolutionary rise in nature and a higher stage in civilisation we are here in the presence of great fundamental principles of progress which have been working through life from the beginning at the beginning of life on the earth reproduction ran riot of one minute organism it is estimated that if its reproduction were not checked by death or destruction in thirty days it would form a mass a million times larger than the sun the congereel lays fifteen million eggs and if they all grew up and reproduced themselves on the same scale in two years the whole sea would become a wriggling mass of fish as we approach the higher forms of life reproduction gradually dies down the animals nearest to man produce few offspring but they surround them with parental care until they are able to lead independent lives with a fair chance of surviving the whole process may be regarded as a mechanism for slowly subordinating quantity to quality and so promoting the evolution of life to ever higher stages this process which is plain to see on the largest scale throughout living nature may be more minutely studied as it acts within a narrower range in the human species here we statistically formulate it in the terms of birthrate and deathrate by the mutual relationship of the two courses of the birthrate and the deathrate we are able to estimate the evolutionary rank of a nation and the degree in which it has succeeded in subordinating the primitive standard of quantity to the higher and later standard of quality it is especially in europe that we can investigate this relationship by the help of statistics which in some cases extend for nearly a century back we can trace the various phases through which each nation passes the effects of prosperity the influence of education and sanitary improvement the general complex development of civilisation in each case moving forward though not regularly and steadily to higher stages by means of a falling birthrate which is to some extent compensated by a falling deathrate the two rates nearly always running parallel so that a temporary rise in the birthrate is usually accompanied by a rise in the deathrate by a return that is to say towards the conditions which we find at the beginning of animal life and a steady fall in the birthrate is always accompanied by a fall in the deathrate the modern phase of this movement soon after which our precise knowledge begins may be said to date from the industrial expansion due to the introduction of machinery which professor marshall places in england about the year that represents the beginning of an era in which all civilised and semicivilised countries are still living for the earlier centuries we lack precise data but we are able to form certain probable conclusions the population of a country in those ages seems to have grown very slowly and sometimes even to have retrograded at the end of the sixteenth century the population of england and wales is estimated at five millions and at the end of the seventeenth at six millionsonly per cent increase during the centuryalthough during the nineteenth century the population nearly quadrupled this very gradual increase of the population seems to have been by no means due to a very low birthrate but to a very high deathrate throughout the middle ages a succession of virulent plagues andpestilences devastated europe smallpox which may be considered the latest of these used to sweep off large masses of the youthful population in the eighteenth century the result was a certain stability and a certain wellbeing in the population as a whole these conditions being however maintained in a manner that was terribly wasteful and distressing the industrial revolution introduced a new era which began to show its features clearly in the early nineteenth century on the one hand a new motive had arisen to favour a more rapid increase of population small children could tend machinery and thereby earn wages to increase the family takings this led to an immediate result in increased population and increased prosperity but on the other hand the rapid increase of population always tended to outrun the rapid increase of prosperity and the more so since the rise of sanitary science began to drive back the invasions of the grosser and more destructive infectious diseases which had hitherto kept the population down the result was that new forms of disease distress and destitution arose the old stability was lost and the new prosperity produced unrest in place of wellbeing the social consciousness was still too immature to deal collectively with the difficulties and frictions which the industrial era introduced and the individualism which under former conditions had operated wholesomely now acted perniciously to crush the souls and bodies of the workers whether men women or children as we know the increase of knowledge and the growth of the social consciousness have slowly acted wholesomely during the past century to remedy the first evil results of the industrial revolution the artificial and abnormal increase of the population has been checked because it is no longer permissible in most countries to stunt the minds and bodies of small children by placing them in factories an elaborate system of factory legislation was devised and is still ever drawing fresh groups of workers within its protective meshes sanitary science began to develop and to exert an enormous influence on the health of nations at the same time the supreme importance of popular education was realised the total result was that the nature of prosperity began to be transformed instead of being as it had been at the beginning of the industrial era a direct appeal to the gratification of gross appetites and reckless lusts it became an indirect stimulus to higher gratifications and more remote aspirations foresight became a dominating motive even in the general population and a mans anxiety for the welfare of his family was no longer forgotten in the pleasure of the moment the social state again became more stable and mere prosperity was transformed into civilisation this is the state of things now in progress in all industrial countries though it has reached varying levels of development among different peoples it is thus clear that the birthrate combined with the deathrate constitutes a delicate instrument for the measurement of civilisation and that the record of their combined curves registers the upward or downward course of every nation the curves as we know tend to be parallel and when they are not parallel we are in the presence of a rare and abnormal state of things which is usually temporary or transitional it is instructive from this point of view to study the various nations of europe for here we find a large number of small nations each with its own statistical system confined within a small space and living under fairly uniform conditions let us take the latest official figures which are usually for and attempt to measure the civilisation of european countries on this basis beginning with the lowest birthrate and therefore in gradually descending rank of superiority we find that the european countries stand in the following order france belgium ireland sweden the united kingdom switzerland norway scotland denmark holland the german empire prussia finland spain austria italy hungary serbia bulgaria roumania russia if we take the deathrate similarly beginning with the lowest rate and gradually proceeding to the highest we find the following order holland denmark norway sweden switzerland the united kingdom belgium scotland prussia the german empire finland ireland france italy austria serbia spain bulgaria hungary roumania russia now we cannot accept the birthrates and deathrates of the various countries exactly at their face value temporary conditions as well as the special composition of a population not to mention peculiarities of registration exert a disturbing effect roughly and on the whole however the figures are acceptable it is instructive to find how closely the two rates agree the agreement is indeed greater at the bottom than at the top the eight countries which constitute the lowest group as regards birthrate are the identical eight countries which furnish the heaviest deathrates that was to be expected a very high birthrate seems fatally to involve a very high deathrate but a very low birthrate as we see in the cases of france and ireland is not invariably associated with a very low deathrate though it is never associated with a high deathrate this seems to indicate that those qualities in a highly civilised nation which restrain the production of offspring do not always or at once produce the eugenic racial qualities possessed by hardier peoples living under simpler conditions but with these reservations it is not difficult to combine the two lists in a fairly concordant order of descending rank most readers will agree that taking the european populations in bulk without regard to the production of genius for men of genius are always a very minute fraction of a nation the european populations which they are accustomed to regard as standing at the head in the general diffusion of character intelligence education and wellbeing are allincluded in the first twelve or thirteen nations which are the same in both lists though they do not follow the same order these peoples as peoplesthat is without regard to their size their political importance or their production of genius represent the highest level of democratic civilisation in europe it is scarcely necessary to add that various countries outside europe equal or excel them the deathrate of the united states so far as statistics show is the same as that of sweden that of ontario still better is the same as denmark while the deathrate of the australian commonwealth with a medium birthrate is lower than that of any european country and new zealand holds the worlds championship in this field with the lowest deathrate of all on the other hand some extraeuropean countries compare less favourably with europe japan with a rather high birthrate has the same high deathrate as spain and chile with a still higher birthrate has a higher deathrate than russia so it is that among human peoples we find the same laws prevailing as among animals and the higher nations of the world differ from those which are less highly evolved precisely as the elephant differs from the herring though within a narrower range that is to say by producing fewer offspring and taking better care of them the whole of this evolutionary process we have to remember is a natural process it has been going on from the beginning of the living world but at a certain stage in the higher development of man without ceasing to be natural it becomes conscious and deliberate it is then that we have what may properly be termed birth control that is to say that a process which had before been working slowly through the ages attaining every new forward step with waste and pain is henceforth carried out voluntarily in the light of the high human qualities of reason and foresight and selfrestraint the rise of birth control may be said to correspond with the rise of social and sanitary science in the first half of the nineteenth century and to be indeed an essential part of that movement it is firmly established in all the most progressive and enlightened countries of europe notably in france and in england in germany where formerly the birthrate was very high birth control has developed with extraordinary rapidity during the present century in holland its principle and practice are freely taught by physicians and nurses to the mothers of the people with the result that there is in holland no longer any necessity for unwanted babies and this small country possesses the proud privilege of the lowest deathrate in europe in the free and enlightened democratic communities on the other side of the globe in australia and new zealand the same principles and practice are generally accepted with the same beneficent results on the other hand in the more backward and ignorant countries of europe birth control is still little known and death and disease flourish this is the case in those eight countries which come at the bottom of both our lists even in the more progressive countries however birth control has not been established without a struggle which has frequently ended in a hypocritical compromise its principles being publicly ignored or denied and its practice privately accepted for at the great and vitally important point in human progress which birth control represents we really see the conflict of two moralities the morality of the ancient world is here confronted by the morality of the new world the old morality knowing nothing of science and the process of nature as worked out in the evolution of life based itself on the early chapters of genesis in which the children of noah are represented as entering an empty earth which it is their business to populate diligently so it came about that for this morality still innocent of eugenics recklessness was almost a virtue children were given by god if they died or were afflicted by congenital disease it was the dispensation of god and whatever imprudence the parents might commit the pathetic faith still ruled that god will provide but in the new morality it is realised that in these matters divine action can only be made manifest in human action that is to say through the operation of our own enlightened reason and resolved will prudence foresight selfrestraintvirtues which the old morality looked down on with benevolent contemptassume a position of the first importance in the eyes of the new morality the ideal woman is no longer the meek drudge condemned to endless and often ineffectual childbearing but the free and instructed woman able to look before and after trained in a sense of responsibility alike to herself and to the race and determined to have no children but the best such were the two moralities which came into conflict during the nineteenth century they were irreconcilable and each firmly rooted one in ancient religion and tradition the other in progressive science and reason nothing was possible in such a clash of opposing ideas but a feeble and confused compromise such as we still find prevailing in various countries of old europe it was not a satisfactory solution however inevitable and especially unsatisfactory by the consequent obscurantism which placed difficulties in the way of spreading a knowledge of the methods of birth control among the masses of the population for the result has been that while the more enlightened and educated have exercised a control over the size of their families the poorer and more ignorantwho should have been offered every facility and encouragement to follow in the same pathhave been left through a conspiracy of secrecy to carry on helplessly the bad customs of their forefathers this social neglect has had the result that the superior family stocks have been hampered by the recklessness of the inferior stocks we may see these two moralities in conflict today in america up till recently america had meekly accepted at old europes hands the traditional prescription of our mediterranean book of genesis with its fascinating oldworld fragrance of mount ararat on the surface the ancient morality had been complacently almost unquestionably accepted in america even to the extent of permitting a vast extension of abortiona criminal practice which ever flourishes wherebirthcontrol is neglected but today we suddenly see a new movement in the united states in a flash america has awakened to the true significance of the issue with that direct vision of hers that swift practicality of action and above all that sense of the democratic nature of all social progress we see her resolutely beginning to face this great problem in her own vigorous native tongue we hear her demanding what in the thunder is all the secrecy about anyhow and we cannot doubt that americas own answer to that demand will be of immense significance to the whole world thus it is that as we get to the root of the matter the whole question becomes clear we see that there is really no standing ground in any country for the panicmonger who bemoans the fall of the birthrate and storms against small families the falling birthrate is a worldwide phenomenon in all countries that are striving toward a higher civilisation along lines which nature laid down from the beginning we cannot stop it if we would and if we could we should merely be impeding civilisation it is a movement that rights itself and tends to reach a just balance it has not yet reached that balance with us in this country that may be seen by anyone who has read the letters from mothers lately published under the title of maternity by the womens cooperative guild there is still far more misery caused by having too many babies than by having too few a bonus on babies would be a misfortune alike for the parents and the statewhether bestowed at birth as proposed in new zealand or at the age of twelve months as proposed in france or fourteen years as proposed in englandunless it were confined to children who were not merely alive at the appointed age but able to pass examination as having reached a definitely high standard the falling birthrate which it must be remembered is affecting all civilised countries should be a matter for joy rather than for grief but we need not therefore fold our hands and do nothing there is still much to be effected for the protection of motherhood and the better care of children we cannot and should not attempt to increase the number of children but we may well attempt to work for their better quality there we shall be on very safe ground more knowledge is necessary so that all wouldbe parents may know how they may best become parents and how they may if necessary best avoid it procreation by the unfit should be if not prohibited by law at all events so discouraged by public opinion that to attempt it would be counted disgraceful much greater public provision is necessary for the care of mothers during the months before as well as during the period after the childs birth the system of schools for mothers needs to be universalised and systematically carried out along such lines as these we may hope to increase the happiness of the people and the strength of the state we need not worry over the falling birthrate those who wish to study the latest restatements of opinions in england may be recommended to read the report of the commission of inquiry into great britains falling birthrate appointed in by the national council of public morals under the title of the declining birthrate its causes and effects xviii birth control i reproduction and the birthrate the study of the questions relating to sex so actively carried on during recent years has become more and more concentrated on to the practical problems of marriage and the family that was inevitable it is only reasonable that with our growing scientific knowledge of the mysteries of sex we should seek to apply that knowledge to those questions of life which we must ever regard as central how can we add to the stability or to the flexibility of marriage how can we most judiciously regulate the size of our families at the outset however we cannot too deeply impress upon our minds the fact that these questions are not new in the world if we try to find an answer to them by confining our attention to the phenomena presented by our own species at our own particular moment of civilisation it is very likely indeed that we may fall into crude superficial even mischievous conclusions the fact is that these questions which are agitating us today have agitated the world ever since it has been a world of life at all the difference is that whereas we seek to deal with them consciously voluntarily and deliberately throughout by far the greater part of the worlds life they have been dealt with unconsciously by methods of trial and error ofperpetual experiment which has often proved costly but has all the more clearly brought out the real course of natural progress we cannot solve problems so ancient and deeply rooted as those of sex by merely rational methods which are only of yesterday to be of value our rational methods must be the revelation in deliberate consciousness of unconscious methods which go far back into the remote past our conscious deliberate and purposive methods carried out on the plane of reason will not be sound unless they are a continuation of those methods which have already in the slow evolution of life been found sound and progressive on the plane of instinct this must be borne in mind by those peoplealways to be found among us though not always on the side of social advancewho desire their own line of conduct in matters of sex to be so closely in accord with natural and divine law that to question it would be impious a medical friend of my own when once in the dentists chair under the influence of nitrous oxide anaesthesia a condition as william james showed which frequently leads us to believe we are solving the problems of the universe imagined himself facing the almighty and insistently demanding the real object of the existence of the world and the almightys answer came in one word reproduction my friend is a man of philosophic mind and the solution of the mystery of the worlds purpose thus presented to him in vision may perhaps serve as a simple and ultimate statement of the object of life from the very outset the great object of nature to our human eyes seems to be primarily reproduction in the long run indeed an effort after economy of method in the attainment of an ever greater perfection but primarily reproduction this tendency to reproduction is indeed so fundamental it is impressed on vital organisation with so great a violence of emphasis that we may regard the course of evolution as much more an effort to slow down reproduction than to furnish it with any new facilities we must remember that reproduction appears in the history of life before sex appears the lower forms of animal and plant life often reproduce themselves without the aid of sex and it has even been argued that reproduction and sex are directly antagonistic that active propagation is always checked when sexual differentiation is established the impression one gains of sexuality remarks professor coulter foremost of american botanists is that it represents reproduction under peculiar difficulties bacteria among primitive plants and protozoa among primitive animals are patterns of rapid and prolific reproduction though sex begins to appear in a rudimentary form in very lowly forms of life even among the protozoa and is at first compatible with a high degree of reproduction a single infusorian becomes in a week the ancestor of millions that is to say of far more individuals than could proceed under the most favourable conditions from a pair of elephants in five centuries while huxley calculated that the progeny of a single parthenogenetic aphis under favouring circumstances would in a few months outweigh the whole population of china that proviso under favouring conditionsis of great importance for it reveals the weak point in this early method of natures for conducting evolution by enormously rapid multiplication creatures so easily produced could be and were easily destroyed no time had been spent on imparting to them the qualities that would enable them to lead what we should call in our own case long and useful lives yet the method of rapid multiplication was not readily or speedily abandoned by nature still speaking in our human way we may say that she tried to give it every chance among insects that have advanced so far as the white ants we find that the queen lays eggs at an enormous rate during the whole of her active life according to some estimates at the rate of a day even in the more primitive members of the great vertebrate group to which we ourselves belong reproduction is sometimes still on almost as vast a scale as among lower organisms thus among herrings nearly eggs have been found in a single female but the herring nevertheless does not tend to increase in the seas for it is everywhere preyed upon by whales and seals and sharks and birds and not least by man thus early we see the connection between a high deathrate and a high birthrate the evidence against reckless reproduction at last however proved overwhelming with whatever hesitation nature finally decided once and for all that it was better from every point of view to produce a few superior beings than a vast number of inferior beings for while the primary end of nature may be said to be reproduction there is a secondary end of scarcely less equal urgency and that is evolution in other words while nature seems to our human eyes to be seeking after quantity she is also seeking and with ever greater eagerness after quality now the method of rapid and easy reproduction it had become clear not only failed of its own end for the inferior creatures thus produced were unable to maintain their position in life but it was distinctly unfavourable to any advance in quality the method of sexual reproduction which had existed in a germinal form more or less from the beginning asserted itself ever more emphatically and a method like that of parthenogenesis or reproduction by the female unaided by the male illustrated by the aphis which had lingered on even beside sexual reproduction absolutely died out in higher evolution now the fertilisation involved by the existence of two sexes is as weismann insisted simply an arrangement which renders possible the intermingling of two different hereditary tendencies the object of sex that is to say is by no means to aid reproduction but rather to subordinate and check reproduction in order to evolve higher and more complex beings here we come to the great principle which herbert spencer developed at length in his principles of biology that as he put itindividuation and genesis vary inversely whence it followed that advancing evolution must be accompanied by declining fertility individuation which means complexity of structure has advanced as genesis the unrestricted tendency to mere multiplication has receded this involves a diminished number of offspring but an increased amount of time and care in the creation and breeding of each it involves also that the reproductive life of the organism is shortened and more or less confined to special periods it begins much later it usually ends earlier and even in its period of activity it tends to fall into cycles nature we see who at the outset had endowed her children so lavishly with the aptitude for multiplication grown wiser now expends her fertile imagination in devising preventive checks on reproduction for her childrens use the result is that though reproduction is greatly slackened evolution is greatly accelerated the significance of sex as coulter puts it lies in the fact that it makes organic evolution more rapid and far more varied it is scarcely necessary to emphasise that a highly important and indeed essential aspect of this greater individuation is a higher survival value the more complex and better equipped creature can meet and subdue difficulties and dangers to which the more lowly organised creature that came beforeproduced wholesale in a way which nature seems now to look back on as cheap and nastysuccumbed helplessly without an effort the idea of economy begins to assert itself in the world it became clear in the course of evolution that it is better to produce really good and highly efficient organisms at whatever cost than to be content with cheap production on a wholesale scale they allowed greater developmental progress to be made and they lasted better even before man began it was proved in the animal world that the deathrate falls as the birthrate falls if we wish to realise the vast progress in method which has been made even within the limits of the vertebrates to which we ourselves belong we have but to compare with the lowly herring already cited the highly evolved elephant the herring multiplies with enormous rapidity and on a vast scale and it possesses a very small brain and is almost totally unequipped to grapple with the special difficulties of its life to which it succumbs on a wholesale scale a single elephant is carried for about two years in his mothers womb and is carefully guarded by her for many years after birth he possesses a large brain his muscular system is as remarkable for its delicacy as for its power and is guided by the most sensitive perceptions he is fully equipped for all the dangers of his life save for those which have been introduced by the subtle devilry of modern man and though a single pair of elephants produces so few offspring yet their high cost is justified for each of them has a reasonable chance of surviving to old age the contrast from the point of view of reproduction of the herring and the elephant the low vertebrate and the high vertebrate well illustrates the tendency of evolution it clearly brings before us the difference between natures earlier and later methods the ever growing preference for quality of offspring over quantity it has been necessary to touch on the wider aspects of reproduction in nature even when our main concern is with particular aspects of reproduction in man for unless we understand the progressive tendency of reproduction in nature we shall probably fail to understand it in man with these preliminary observations we may now take up the question as it affects man it is not easy to ascertain the exact tendencies of reproduction in our own historical past or among the lower races of today on the whole it seems fairly clear that under ordinary savage and barbarous conditions rather more children are produced and rather more children die than among ourselves there is in other words a higher birthrate and a higher infantile deathrate a high birthrate with a low deathrate seems to have been even more exceptional than among ourselves for under inelastic social conditions the community cannot adjust itself to the rapid expansion that would thus be rendered necessary the community contracts as it were on this expanding portion and largely crushes it out of life by the forces of neglect poverty and disease the only part of europe in which we can today see how this works out on a large scale is russia for here we find in an exaggerated form conditions which once tended to rule all over europe side by side with the beginnings of better things with scientific progress and statistical observation yet in russia up till recently if not even still there has only been about one doctor to every twelve thousand inhabitants and the witchdoctor has flourished smallpox scarlet fever diphtheria typhoid and syphilis also flourish and not only flourish but show an enormously higher mortality than in other european countries more significant still famine and typhus the special disease of filth and overcrowding and miseryboth of them banished save in the most abnormal times from the rest of europehave in modern times ravaged russia on a vast scale ignorance superstition insanitation filth bad food impure water lead to a vast mortality among children which has sometimes destroyed more than half of them before they reach the age of five so that enormously high as the russian birthrate is the deathrate has sometimes exceeded it nor is it found as some wouldbe sagacious persons confidently assert that the high birthrate is justified by the better quality of the survivors on the contrary there is a very large proportion of chronic and incurable diseases among the survivors blindness and other defects abound and though there are many very large and fine people in russia the average stature of the russians is lower than that of most european peoplesrussia is in the era of expanding industrialisma fateful period for any people as we shall see directlyand the results resemble those which followed and to some extent exist still further west the workers whose hours often extended to twelve or fourteen frequently had no homes but slept in the factory itself in the midst of the machinery or in a sort of dormitory above it with a minimum of space and fresh air men and women promiscuously on wooden shelves one above the other under the eye of government inspectors whose protests were powerless to effect any change this is always and everywhere even among so humane a people as the russians the natural and inevitable result of a high birthrate in an era of expanding industrialism here is the goal of unrestricted reproduction the same among men as among herrings this is the ideal of those persons whether they know it or not who in their criminal rashness would dare to arrest that fall in the birthrate which is now beginning to spread its beneficent influence in every civilised land we have no means of ascertaining precisely the birthrate in western europe before the nineteenth century but the estimates of the population which have been made by the help of various data indicate that the increase during a century was very moderate in england for instance families scarcely seem to have been very large and even apart from wars many plagues and pestilences during the eighteenth century more especially smallpox constantly devastated the population so that with these checks on the results of reproduction the population was able to adjust itself to its very gradual expansion the mortality fell heavily on young children as we observe in old family records where we frequently find two or even three children of the same christian name the first child having died and its name been given to a successor during the last quarter of the eighteenth century a new phase of social life profoundly affecting the reproductive habits of the community made its appearance in western europe at first in england this was the new industrial era due to the introduction of machinery all the social methods of gradual though awkward adaptation to a slow expansion were dislocated easy expansion of population became a possibility for factories were constantly springing up and hands were always in demand moreover these hands could be children for it was possible to tend machinery at a very early age the richest family was the family with most children the population began to expand rapidly it was an era of prosperity but when it began to be realised what this meant it was seen that such prosperity was far from an enviable condition a community cannot suddenly adjust itself to a sudden expansion still less can it adjust itself to a continuous rapid expansion disease misery and poverty flourished in this prosperous new industrial era filth and insanitation immorality and crime were fostered by overcrowding in illbuilt urban areas ignorance and stupidity abounded for the child placed in the monotonous routine of the factory when little more than an infant was deprived alike of the education of the school and of the world higher wages brought no higher refinement and were squandered on food and drink on the lowest vulgar tastes such prosperity was merely a brutalising influence it meant nothing for the growth of civilisation and humanity then a wholesome movement of reaction set in the betterment of the environmentthat was the great task that social pioneers and reformers saw before them they courageously set about the herculean task of cleansing this augean stable of prosperity the era of sanitation began the endless and highly beneficent course of factory legislature was inaugurated that is the era which in every progressive country of the world we are living in still the final tendency of it however was not foreseen by its great pioneers or even its humble daylabourers of the present time for they were not attacking reproduction they were fighting against bad conditions and may even have thought that they were enabling reproduction to expand more freely they had not realised that to improve the environment is to check reproduction being indeed the one and only way in which undue reproduction can be checked that may be said to be an aspect of the opposition between genesis and individuation on which herbert spencer insisted for by improving the environment we necessarily improve the individual who is rooted in that environment it is not we must remember a matter of conscious and voluntary action that is clearly manifest by the fact that it occurs even among the most primitive microorganisms when placed under unfavourable conditions as to food and environment they tend to pass into a reproductive phase and by sporulation or otherwise begin to produce new individuals rapidly it is the same in man improve the environment and reproduction is checked that is as professor benjamin moore has said the simple biological reply to good economic conditions it is only among the poor the ignorant and the wretched that reproduction flourishes the tendency of civilisation as leroybeaulieu concludes is to reduce the birthrate those who desire a high birthrate are desiring whether they know it or not the increase of poverty ignorance and wretchedness so far we have been dealing with fundamental laws and tendencies which were established long before man appeared on the earth although man has often illustrated and still illustrates their inevitable character we have not been brought in contact with the influence of conscious design and deliberate intention at this point we reach a totally new aspect of reproductionii the origin and results of birth control in tracing the course of reproduction we have so far been concerned with what are commonly considered the blind operations of nature in the absence of conscious and deliberate volition we have seen that while at the outset nature seems to have impressed an immense reproductive impetus on her creatures all her energy since has been directed to the imposition of preventive checks on that reproductive impetus the end attained by these checks has been an extreme diminution in the number of offspring a prolongation of the time devoted to the breeding and care of each new member of the family in harmony with its greatly prolonged life a spacing out of the intervals between the offspring and as a result a vastly greater development of each individual and an ever better equipment for the task of living all this was slowly attained automatically without any conscious volition on the part of the individuals even when they were human beings who were the agents now occurred a change which we may regard as in some respects the most momentous sudden advance in the whole history of reproduction the process of reproductive progress became conscious and deliberately volitional we often fancy that when natural progress becomes manifested in the mind and will of man it is somehow unnatural it is one of the wisest of shakespeares utterances in one of the most mature of his plays that nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean this is an art which does mend nature change it rather but the art itself is nature birth control when it ceases to be automatic and becomes conscious is an art but it is an art directed precisely to the attainment of ends which nature has been struggling after for millions of years and being consciously and deliberately an art it is enabled to avoid many of the pitfalls which the unconscious method falls into it is an art but the art itself is nature it is always possible for the narroweyed fanatic to object to the employment of birth control precisely as he might object to the use of clothes as unnatural but if we look more deeply into the matter we see that even clothes are not truly unnatural a vast number of creatures may be said to be born in clothes clothes so naturally such that when stripped from the animals they belong to we are proud to wear them ourselves even our own ancestors were born in clothes which they lost by the combined or separate action of natural selection sexual selection and the environment which action however has not sufficed to abolish the desirability of clothes so that the impulse by which we make for ourselves clothes is merely a conscious and volitional form of an impulse which in the absence of consciousness and will had acted automatically it is just the same with the control and limitation of reproductive activity it is an attempt by openeyed intelligence and foresight to attain those ends which nature through untold generations has been painfully yet tirelessly struggling for the deliberate cooperation of man in the natural task of birthcontrol represents an identification of the human will with what we may if we choose regard as the divinely appointed law of the world we can well believe that the great pioneers who a century ago acted in the spirit of this faith may have echoed the thought of kepler when on discovering his great planetary law he exclaimed in rapture o god i think thy thoughts after thee as a matter of fact however it was in no such spirit of ecstasy that the pioneers of the movement for birth control acted the divine command is less likely to be heard in the whirlwind than in the still small voice these great pioneers were thoughtful cautious hardheaded men who spoke scarcely above a whisper and were far too modest to realise that a great forward movement in natural evolution had in them begun to be manifested early man could not have taken this step because it is even doubtful whether he knew that the conjunction of the sexes had anything to do with the production of offspring which he was inclined to attribute to magical causes later although intelligence grew the uncontrolled rule of the sexual impulse obtained so firm a grip on men that they laughed at the idea that it was possible to exercise forethought and prudence in this sphere at the same time religion and superstition came into action to preserve the established tradition and to persuade people that it would be wicked to do anything different from what they had always done but a saner feeling was awakening here and there in various parts of the world at last under the stress of the devastation and misery caused by the reproductive relapse of the industrial era this feeling voiced by a fewdistinguished men began to take shape in action the pioneers were english among them malthus occupies the first place that distinguished man in his great and influential work the principle of population in emphasised the immense importance of foresight and selfcontrol in procreation and the profound significance of birth limitation for human welfare malthus relied however on ascetic selfrestraint a method which could only appeal to the few he had nothing to say for the prevention of conception in intercourse that was suggested twenty years later very cautiously by james mill the father of john stuart mill in the encyclopedia britannica four years afterwards mills friend the radical reformer francis place advocated this method more clearly finally in robert dale owen the son of the great robert owen published his moral physiology in which he set forth the ways of preventing conception while a little later the drysdale brothers ardent and unwearying philanthropists devoted their energies to a propaganda which has been spreading ever since and has now conquered the whole civilised world it was not however in england but in france so often at the head of an advance in civilisation that birth control first became firmly established and that the extravagantly high birthrate of earlier times began to fall this happened in the first half of the nineteenth century whether or not it was mainly due to voluntary control in england the movement came later and the steady decline in the english birthrate which is still proceeding began in in the previous year there had been a famous prosecution of bradlaugh and mrs besant for disseminating pamphlets describing the methods of preventing conception the charge was described by the lord chief justice who tried the case as one of the most illadvised and injudicious ever made in a court of justice but it served an undesigned end by giving enormous publicity to the subject and advertising the methods it sought to suppress there can be no doubt however that even apart from this trial the movement would have proceeded on the same lines the times were ripe the great industrial expansion had passed its first feverish phase social conditions were improving education was spreading the inevitable character of the movement is indicated by the fact that at the very same time it began to be manifested all over europe indeed in every civilised country of the world at the present time the birthrate as well as usually the deathrate is falling in every country of the world sufficiently civilised to possess statistics of its own vital movement the fall varies in rapidity it has been considerable in the more progressive countries it has lingered in the more backward countries if we examine the latest statistics for europe usually those for we find that every country without exception with a progressive and educated population and a fairly high state of social wellbeing presents a birthrate below per we also find that every country in europe in which the mass of the people are primitive ignorant or in a socially unsatisfactory condition even although the governing classes may be progressive or ambitious shows a birthrate above per france great britain belgium holland the scandinavian countries and switzerland are in the first group russia austrohungary italy spain and the balkan countries are in the second group the german empire was formerly in this second group but now comes within the first group and has carried on the movement so energetically that the birthrate of berlin is already below that of london and that at the present rate of decline the birthrate of the german empire will before long sink to that of france outside europe in the united states just as much as in australia and new zealand the same great progressive movement is proceeding with equal activity the wide survey of the question of birth limitation here taken may seem to some readers unnecessary why not get at once to matters of practical detail but if we think of it our wide survey has been of the greatest practical help to us it has for instance settled the question of the desirability of the adoption of methods of preventing conception and finally silenced those who would waste our time with their fears lest it is not right to control conception we know now on whose side are the laws of god and nature we realise that in exercising control over the entrance gate of life we are not only performing consciously and deliberately a great human duty but carrying on rationally a beneficial process which has more blindly and wastefully been carried on since the beginning of the world there are still a few persons ignorant enough or foolish enough to fight against the advance of civilisation in this matter we can well afford to leave them severely alone knowing that in a few years all of them will have passed away it is not our business to defend the control of birth but simply to discuss how we may most wisely exercise that control many ways of preventing conception have been devised since the method which is still the commonest was first introduced so far as our certainly imperfect knowledge extends by a clever jew onan genesis chap xxxviii whose name has since been wrongly attached to another practice with which the mosaic record in no way associates him there are now many contraceptive methods some dependent on precautions adopted by the man others dependent on the woman others again which take the form of an operation permanently preventing conception and therefore not to be adopted save by couples who already have as many children as they desire or else who ought never to have children at all and thus wisely adopt a method of sterilisation it is unnecessary here even if it were otherwise desirable to discuss these various methods in detail it is even useless to do so for we must bear in mind that no method can be absolutely approved or absolutely condemned each may be suitable under certain conditions and for certain couples and it is not easy to recommend any method indiscriminately we need to know the intimate circumstances of individual cases for the most part experience is the final test forel compared the use of contraceptive devices to the use of eyeglasses and it is obvious that without expert advice the results in either case may sometimes be mischievous or atall events ineffective personal advice and instruction are always desirable in holland nurses are medically trained in a practical knowledge of contraceptive methods and are thus enabled to enlighten the women of the community this is an admirable plan considering that the use of contraceptive measures is now almost universal it is astonishing that there are yet so many socalled civilised countries in which this method of enlightenment is not everywhere adopted until it is adopted and a necessary knowledge of the most fundamental facts of the sexual life brought into every home the physician must be regarded as the proper adviser it is true that until recently he was generally in these matters a blind leader of the blind nowadays it is beginning to be recognised that the physician has no more serious and responsible duty than that of giving help in the difficult path of the sexual life very frequently indeed even yet he has not risen to a sense of his responsibilities in this matter it is as well to remember however that a physician who is unable or unwilling to give frank and sound advice in this most important department of life is unlikely to be reliable in any other department if he is not up to date here he is probably not up to date anywhere whatever the method adopted there are certain conditions which it must fulfil even apart from its effectiveness as a contraceptive in order to be satisfactory most of these conditions may be summed up in one the most satisfactory method is that which least interferes with the normal process of the act of intercourse every sexual act is or should be a miniature courtship however long marriage may have lasted no outside mental tension or nervous apprehension must be allowed to intrude any contraceptive proceeding which hastily enters the atmosphere of love immediately before or immediately after the moment of union is unsatisfactory and may be injurious it even risks the total loss of the contraceptive result for at such moments the intended method may be ineffectively carried out or neglected altogether no method can be regarded as desirable which interferes with the sense of satisfaction and relief which should follow the supreme act of loving union no method which produces a nervous jar in one of the parties even though it may be satisfactory to the other should be tolerated such considerations must for some couples rule out certain methods we cannot however lay down absolute rules because methods which some couples may find satisfactory prove unsatisfactory in other cases experience aided by expert advice is the only final criterion when a contraceptive method is adopted under satisfactory conditions with a due regard to the requirements of the individual couple there is little room to fear that any injurious results will be occasioned it is quite true that many physicians speak emphatically concerning the injurious results to husband or to wife of contraceptive devices although there has been exaggeration and prejudice has often been imported into this question and although most of the injurious results could have been avoided had trained medical help been at hand to advise better methods there can be no doubt that much that has been said under this head is true considering how widespread is the use of these methods and how ignorantly they have often been carried out it would be surprising indeed if it were not true but even supposing that the nervously injurious effects which have been traced to contraceptive practices were a thousandfold greater than they have been reported to beinstead of as we are justified in believing considerably less than they are reportedshall we therefore condemn contraceptive methods to do so would be to ignore all the vastly greater evils which have followed in the past from unchecked reproduction it would be a condemnation which if we exercised it consistently would destroy the whole of civilisation and place us back in savagery for what device of man since man had any history at all has not proved sometimes injurious every one of even the most useful and beneficent of human inventions has either exercised subtle injuries or produced appalling catastrophes this is not only true of mans devices it is true of natures in general let us take for instance the elevation of mans ancestors from the quadrupedal to the bipedal position the experiment of making a series of fourfooted animals walk on their hindlegs was very revolutionary and risky it was far far more beset by dangers than is the introduction of contraceptives we are still suffering all sorts of serious evils in consequence of natures action in placing our remote ancestors in the erect position yet we feel that it was worth while even those physicians who most emphasise the evil results of the erect position do not advise that we should go on allfours it is just the same with a great human device the introduction of clothes they have led to all sorts of new susceptibilities to disease and even tendencies to direct injury of many kinds yet no one advocates the complete disuse of all clothing on the ground that corsets have sometimes proved harmful it would be just as absurd to advocate the complete abandonment of contraceptives on the ground that some of them have sometimes been misused if it were not indeed that we are familiar with the lengths to which ignorance and prejudice may go we should question the sanity of anyone who put forward so foolish a proposition every great step which nature and man have taken in the path of progress has been beset by dangers which are gladly risked because of the advantages involved we have still to enumerate some of the immense advantages which man has gained in acquiring a conscious and deliberate control of reproduction iiibirth control in relation to morality and eugenics anyone who has followed this discussion so far will not easily believe that a tendency so deeply rooted in nature as birth control can ever be in opposition to morality it can only seem to be so when we confuse the eternal principles of morality whatever they may be with their temporary applications which are always becoming modified in adaptation to changing circumstances we are often in danger of doing injustice to the morality of the past and it is important even in order to understand the morality of the present that we should be able to put ourselves in the place of those for whom birth control was immoral to speak of birth control as having been immoral in the past is indeed to underestimate the case it was not only immoral it was unnatural it was even irreligious it was almost criminal we must remember that throughout the christian world the divine command increase and multiply has seemed to echo down the ages from the beginning of the world it was the authoritative command of a tribal god who was according to the scriptural narrative addressing a world inhabited by eight people from such a point of view a worlds population of several thousand persons would have seemed inconceivably vast though today by even the most austere advocate of birth limitation it would be allowed with a smile but the old religious command has become a tradition which has survived amid conditions totally unlike those under which it arose in comparatively modern times it has been reinforced from unexpected quarters on the one hand by all the forces that are opposed to democracy and on the other by all the forces of wouldbe patriotic militarism both alike clamouring for plentiful and cheap men even science under primitive conditions was opposed to birth control creation was regarded as a direct process in which mans will had no part and knowledge of nature was still too imperfect for the recognition of the fact that the whole course of the worlds natural history has been an erection of barriers against wholesale and indiscriminate reproduction thus it came about that under the old dispensation which is now for ever passing away to have as many children as possible and to have them as often as possibleprovided certain ritual prescriptions were fulfilledseemed to be a religious moral natural scientific and patriotic duty today the conditions have altogether altered and even our own feelings have altered we no longer feel with the ancient hebrew who has bequeathed his ideals though not his practices to christendom that to have as many wives and concubines and as large a family as possible is both natural and virtuous as well as profitable we realise moreover that the divine commands so far as we recognise any such commands are not external to us but are manifested in our own deliberate reason and will we know that to primitive men who lacked foresight and lived mainly in the present only that divine command could be recognisable which sanctified the impulse of the moment while to us who live largely in the future and have learnt foresight the divine command involves restraint on the impulse of the moment we no longer believe that we are divinely ordered to be reckless or that god commands us to have children who as we ourselves know are fatally condemned to disease or premature death providence which was once regarded as the attribute of god we regard as the attribute of men providence prudence selfrestraintthese are to us the characteristics of moral men and those persons who lack these characteristics are condemned by our social order to be reckoned among the dregs of mankind it is a social order which in the sphere of procreation could not be reached or maintained except by the systematic control of offspring we may realise the difference between the morality of today and the morality of the past when we come to details we may consider for instance the question of the chastity of women according to the ideas of the old morality which placed the whole question of procreation under the authority after god of men women were in subjection to men and had no right to freedom no right to responsibility no right to knowledge for it was believed if entrusted with any of these they would abuse them at once that view prevails even today in some civilised countries and middleclass italian parents for instance will not allow their daughter to be conducted by a man even to mass for they believe that as soon as she is out of their sight she will be unchaste that is their morality our morality today however is inspired by different ideas and aims at a different practice we are by no means disposed to rate highly the morality of a girl who is only chaste so long as she is under her parents eyes for us indeed that is much more like immorality than morality we are today vigorously pursuing a totally different line of action we wish women to be reasonably free we wish them to be trained in the sense of responsibility for their own actions we wish them to possess knowledge more especially in that sphere of sex once theoretically closed to them which we now recognise as peculiarly their own domain nowadays moreover we are sufficiently well acquainted with human nature to know not only that at best the chastity merely due to compulsion or to ignorance is a poor thing but that at worst it is really the most degraded and injurious form of unchastity for there are many ways of avoiding pregnancy besides the use of contraceptives and such ways can often only be called vicious destructive to purity and harmful to health our ideal woman today is not she who is deprived of freedom and knowledge in the cloister even though only the cloister of her home but the woman who being instructed from early life in the facts of sexual physiology and sexual hygiene is also trained in the exercise of freedom and selfresponsibility and able to be trusted to choose and to follow the path which seems to her rightthat is the only kind of morality which seems to us real and worth while and in any case we have now grown wise enough to know that no degree of compulsion and no depth of ignorance will suffice to make a girl good if she doesnt want to be good so that even as a matter of policy it is better to put her in a position to know what is good and to act in accordance with that knowledge the relation of birth control to morality is however by no means a question which concerns women alone it equally concerns men here we have to recognise not only that the exercise of control over procreation enables a man to form a union of faithful devotion with the woman of his choice at an earlier age than would otherwise be possible but it further enables him throughout the whole of married life to continue such relationship under circumstances which might otherwise render them injurious or else undesirable to his wife that the influence thus exerted by preventive methods would suffice to abolish prostitution it would be foolish to maintain for prostitution has other grounds of support but even within the sphere of merely prostitutional relationships the use of contraceptives and the precautions and cleanliness they involve have an influence of their own in diminishing the risks of venereal disease and while the interests of those who engage in prostitution are by some persons regarded as negligible we must always remember that venereal disease spreads far beyond the patrons of prostitution and is a perpetual menace to others who may become altogether innocent victims so that any influence which tends to diminish venereal disease increases the wellbeing of the whole community apart from the relationship to morality although the two are intimately combined we are thus led to the relationship of birth control to eugenics or to the sound breeding of the race here we touch the highest ground and are concerned with our best hopes for the future of the world for there can be no doubt that birth control is not only a precious but an indispensable instrument in moulding the coming man to the measure of our developing ideals without it we are powerless in the face of the awful evils which flow from random and reckless reproduction with it we possess a power so great that some persons have professed to see in it a menace to the propagation of the race amusing themselves with the idea that if people possess the means to prevent the conception of children they will never have children at all it is not necessary to discuss such a grotesque notion seriously the desire for children is far too deeply implanted in mankind and womankind alike ever to be rooted out if there are today many parents whose lives are rendered wretched by large families and the miseries of excessive childbearing there are an equal number whose lives are wretched because they have no children at all and who snatch eagerly at any straw which offers the smallest promise of relief to this craving certainly there are people who desire marriage but some for very sound and estimable reasons and others for reasons which may less well bear examinationdo not desire any children at all so far as these are concerned contraceptive methods far from being a social evil are a social blessing for nothing is so certain as that it is an unmixed evil for a community to possess unwilling undesirable or incompetent parents birth control would be an unmixed blessing if it merely enabled us to exclude such persons from the ranks of parenthood we desire no parents who are not both competent and willing parents only such parents are fit to father and to mother a future race worthy to rule the world it is sometimes said that the control of conception since it is frequently carried out immediately on marriage will tend to delay parenthood until an unduly late age birth control has however no necessary result of this kind and might even act in the reverse direction a chief cause of delay in marriage is the prospect of the burden and expense of an unrestricted flow of children into the family and in great britain since with the extension of the use of contraceptives there has been a slight but regular increase not only in the general marriage rate but in the proportion of early marriages although the general mean age at marriage has increased the ability to control the number of children not only enables marriage to take place at an early age but also makes it possible for the couple to have at least one child soon after marriage the total number of children are thus spaced out instead of following in rapid succession it is only of recent years that the eugenic importance of a considerable interval between births has been fully recognised as regards not only the motherthis has long been realisedbut also the children the very high mortality of large families has long been known and their association with degenerate conditions and with criminality the children of small families in toronto canada are taller than those of larger families as is also the case in oakland california where the average size of the family is smaller than in toronto of recent years moreover evidence has been obtained that families in which the children are separated from each other by intervals of more than two years are both mentally and physically superior to those in which the interval is shorter thus ewart found in a northern english manufacturing town that children born at an interval of less than two years after the birth of the previous child remain notably defective even at the age of six both as regards intelligence and physical development when compared with children born at a longer interval and with firstborn children they are on the average three inches shorter and three pounds lighter than firstborn children such observations need to be repeated in various countries but if confirmed it is obvious that they represent a fact of the most vital significancethus when we calmly survey in however summary a manner the great field of life affected by the establishment of voluntary human control over the production of the race we can see no cause for anything but hope it is satisfactory that it should be so for there can be no doubt that we are here facing a great and permanent fact in civilised life with every rise in civilisation indeed with all evolutionary progress whatever there is what seems to be an automatic fall in the birthrate that fall is always normally accompanied by a fall in the deathrate so that a low birthrate frequently means a high rate of natural increase since most of the children born survive thus in the civilised world of today notwithstanding the low birthrate which prevails as compared with earlier times the rate of increase in the population is still as leroybeaulieu points out appalling nearly half a million a year in great britain over half a million in austrohungary and threequarters of a million in germany when we examine this excess of births in detail we find among them a large proportion of undesired and undesirable children there are two opposed alternative methods working to diminish this proportion the method of preventing conception with which we have here been concerned and the method of preventing live birth by producing abortion there can be no doubt about the enormous extension of this latter practice in all civilised countries even although some of the estimates of its frequency in the united states where it seems especially to flourish may be extravagant the burden of excessive children on the overworked underfed mothers of the working classes becomes at last so intolerable that anything seems better than another child id rather swallow the druggists shop and the man in it than have another kid as miss elderton reports a woman in yorkshire said now there has of late years arisen a movement especially among german women for bringing abortion into honour and repute so that it may be carried out openly and with the aid of the best physicians this movement has been supported by lawyers and social reformers of high position it may be admitted that women have an abstract right to abortion and that in exceptional cases that right should be exerted yet there can be very little doubt to most people that abortion is a wasteful injurious and almost degrading method of dealing with the birthrate a feeble apology for recklessness and improvidence a society in which abortion flourishes cannot be regarded as a healthy society therefore a community which takes upon itself to encourage abortion is incurring a heavy responsibility i am referring more especially to the united states where this condition of things is most marked for there cannot be any doubt about it just as all those who work for birth control are diminishing the frequency of abortion so every attempt to discourage birth control promotes abortion we have to approach this problem calmly in the light of nature and reason we have each of us to decide on which side we shall range ourselves for it is a vital social problem concerning which we cannot afford to be indifferent there is here no desire to exaggerate the importance of birth control it is not a royal road to the millennium and as i have already pointed out like all other measures which the course of progress forces us to adopt it has its disadvantages yet at the present moment its real and vital significance is acutely brought home to us flinders petrie discussing those great migrations due to the unrestricted expansion of barbarous races which have devastated europe from the dawn of history remarks we deal lightly and coldly with the abstract facts but they represent the most terrible tragedies of all humanitythe wreck of the whole system of civilisation protracted starvation wholesale massacre can it be avoided that is the question before all others to the statesman who looks beyond the present time
