murder ed anne perry berkeley new york december going back first published eastvale enterprise inc introduction i remember once talking to a famous crime writer about getting a short story out of my home being burgled and she replied i get a short story out of everything that certainly put me in my place it also serves as a useful opening to this introduction because some writers i know find that short stories come easily whereas i dont i think this is partly because i have become so used to thinking in terms of the novel with the broad canvas it offers that its hard to work in miniature i carry a novel around in my head for a long time at least a year waking and sleeping and this gives me time to get under the skin of the characters and the story also plotting is probably the most difficult part of writing for me and being asked to write a short story which so often depends on a plot twist a clever diversion or a surprising revelation guarantees that ill get the laundry done and probably the ironing too that said there is nevertheless a great deal of satisfaction to be had from writing short stories partly of course its the quick payoff a short story is by definition short consequently you get that wonderful rush of having finished something far more quickly than you do with a novel but it isnt only the instant gratification that makes short stories so attractive to me its also the new possibilities they offer when you work primarily as a series writer as i do most of your time goes into the creation of that series that of course is as it should be i wouldnt be writing the inspector banks books if i didnt want to but theres always the temptation to try something different and to risk a week or so doing this is a lot easier than to risk a year or more on a project that might easily meet with rejection short stories also offer a wonderful opportunity for the series writer to spread his or her wings and fly to new exotic places to meet different people and to try out different techniques the inspector banks series is set for the most part in yorkshire but these stories range from toronto to paris from florida to california the banks books are thirdperson narratives while many of the stories are firstperson banks is a policeman but youll find very few policemen between these covers a number of the stories such as murder in utopia and missing in action are set in different periods of history while short stories come from the same seeds as novels usually they come as ideas that can only be developed into short stories innocence was one exception to this rule after writing the story i couldnt let go and went on to write an entire novel from reeds point of view expanding the events of the story but my publishers turned it down i put it aside for a while then thought that perhaps if banks was there it might work better thus reed became owen and innocence became innocent graves both the short story and the novel won arthur ellis awards in canada a sense of place has always been important in my work and is no less so here in florida one december i witnessed a christmas singalong around the swimming pool santa in his usual outfit leading the crowd on electric piano only this took place in twentysevendegree heat and they were singing white christmas something i think they dont usually have down there needless to say the absurdity of the scene was not lost on me and in some land in florida santa ends up in the pool with his electric piano thrown after him still plugged in the first historical story i wrote the two ladies of rose cottage was inspired by both a place and by my interest in thomas hardy i once paid a visit to the house where he was born in bockhampton dorset and stood in the room where he was cast aside as dead by the doctor who delivered him only to be revived by a quickthinking nurse as i looked out of his upstairs window on much the same view he often enjoyed as he wrote his early books this short story of murder and deceit ranging over more than a hundred years began to form in my mind and hardy himself even makes a brief appearance in it other stories have their origins in such diverse sources as an unusual piece of information carrion fragments of dreams fan mail stories recounted by others the wrong hands and memory lane and research for other works i doubt that i would ever have written in flanders fields or missing in action for example if i hadnt spent so much time researching the second world war for in a dry season sometimes as in gone to the dawgs and the dukes wife i was asked for a story on a specific topic in these cases american football and shakespeare respectively but no matter how much or how little is given or demanded there is always a lot to change and more to add all subjected to the constant what if of the writers imagination while i did mention earlier that most of the stories here represent a break from inspector banks there are three banks short stories in the collection in a way they were the hardest for me to write because im so used to giving banks plenty of space theres little room for significant character or plot development in a short story or for the creation of multiple points of view still it was impossible to resist the temptation to try especially to have banks attempt to solve the mystery of a man who claims to have been murdered in a previous lifetime as happens in summer rain youll have to judge the results for yourself finally the inspector banks novella going back is a special case and has never been published before i wrote it early in so it came between in a dry season and cold is the grave at that point i didnt know that i was going to send banks home to deal with his old school friends disappearance in the summer that never was and i wanted to show him interacting with his family and responding to the place where he grew up in manuscript it reached pages too long for any of the magazines or anthologies that regularly published my stories and too short for separate book publication and so it sat there gathering dust until i came to write the summer that never was when i incorporated parts of the novella into the novel mostly details about the street banks grew up on his relationship with his parents the music he listened to and the books he read as an adolescent when i came to revise going back for this collection i had to shift it chronologically so that it now falls between the summer that never was and playing with fire i also had to try to avoid too much repetition of details i had cannibalized for the novel without spoiling the original conception it was a difficult balancing act but i hope you enjoy the final result along with the rest of the stories in this collection peter robinson february summer rain an inspector banks story and exactly how many times have you died mr singer fourteen thats fourteen ive managed to uncover they say that each human being has lived about twenty incarnations but its the last one im telling you about see i died by violence i was murdered detective constable susan gay made a note on the yellow pad in front of her when she looked down she noticed that she had doodled an intricate pattern of curves and loops a bit like spaghetti junction during the few minutes she had been talking to jerry singer she tried to keep the scepticism out of her voice ahhah and when was this sir nineteen sixtysix july that makes it exactly thirtytwo years ago this week i see jerry singer had given his age as thirtyone which meant that he had been murdered a year before he was born how do you know it was nineteen sixtysix susan asked singer leaned forward he was a remarkably intense young man susan noticed thin to the point of emaciation with glittering green eyes behind wirerimmed glasses he looked as if the lightest breeze would blow him away his fine red hair had a gossamer quality that reminded susan of spiders webs he wore jeans a red tshirt and a grey anorak its shoulders darkened by the rain though he said he came from san diego california susan could detect no trace of suntan its like this he began theres no fixed period between incarnations but my channeller told me channeller susan interrupted shes a kind of spokesperson for the spirit world a medium not quite singer managed a brief smile but close enough more of a mediator really oh i see said susan who didnt go on well she told me there would be a period of about a year between my previous incarnation and my present one how did she know she just knows it varies from one soul to another some need a lot of time to digest what theyve learned and make plans for the next incarnation some souls just cant wait to return to another body he shrugged after some lifetimes you might simply just get tired and need a long rest after some mornings too susan thought ok she said lets move on is this your first visit to yorkshire its my first trip to england period ive just qualified in dentistry and i thought id give myself a treat before i settled down to the daily grind susan winced was that a pun singer wasnt smiling a new age dentist now there was an interesting combination she thought can i read your tarot cards for you while i drill perhaps you might like to take a little astral journey to neptune while im doing your root canal she forced herself to concentrate on what singer was saying so you see he went on as ive never been here before it must be real mustnt it susan realized she had missed something what well it was all so familiar the landscape everything and its not only the déjà vu i had there was the dream too we havent even approached this in hypnotic regression yet so susan held up her hand hang on a minute youre losing me what was so familiar oh i thought id made that clear not to me the place where i was murdered it was near here in swainsdale banks was sitting in his office with his feet on the desk and a buff folder open on his lap when susan gay popped her head around the door the top button of his white shirt was undone and his tie hung askew that morning he was supposed to be working on the monthly crime figures but instead through the halfopen window he listened to the summer rain as it harmonized with michael nymans soundtrack from the piano playing quietly on his portable cassette his eyes were closed and he was daydreaming of waves washing in and out on a beach of pure white sand the ocean and sky were the brightest blue he could imagine and tall palm trees dotted the landscape the pastel village that straddled the steep hillside looked like a cubist collage sorry to bother you sir susan said but it looks like weve got a right one here banks opened his eyes and rubbed them he felt as if he were coming back from a very long way its all right he said i was getting a bit bored with the crime statistics anyway he tossed the folder onto his desk and linked his hands behind his head well what is it susan entered the office its sort of hard to explain sir try susan told him about jerry singer as he listened bankss blue eyes sparkled with amusement and interest when susan had finished he thought for a moment then sat up and turned off the music why not he said its been a slow week lets live dangerously bring him in he fastened his top button and straightened his tie a few moments later susan returned with jerry singer in tow singer looked nervously around the office and took the seat opposite banks the two exchanged introductions then banks leaned back and lit a cigarette he loved the mingled smells of smoke and summer rain perhaps youd better start at the beginning he said well said singer turning his nose up at the smoke ive been involved in regressing to past lives for a few years now partly through hypnosis its been a fascinating journey and ive discovered a great deal about myself he sat forward and rested his hands on the desk his fingers were short and tapered for example i was a merchants wife in venice in the fifteenth century i had seven children and died giving birth to the eighth i was only twentynine in my next incarnation i was an actor in a troupe of elizabethan players the lord chamberlains men i remember playing bardolph in henry v in after that i i get the picture said banks i dont mean to be rude mr singer but maybe we can skip to the twentieth century singer paused and frowned at banks sorry well as i was telling detective constable gay here its the least clear one so far i was a hippie at least i think i was i had long hair wore a caftan bellbottom jeans and i had this incredible sense of déjà vu when i was driving through swainsdale yesterday afternoon where exactly it was just before fortford i was coming from helmthorpe where im staying theres a small hill by the river with a few trees on it all bent by the wind maybe you know it banks nodded he knew the place the hill was in fact a drumlin a kind of humpbacked mound of detritus left by the retreating ice age six trees grew on it and they had all bent slightly to the southeast after years of strong northwesterly winds the drumlin was about two miles west of fortford is that all banks asked all yes banks leaned forward and rested his elbows on the desk you know there are plenty of explanations for déjà vu dont you mr singer perhaps youve seen a place very similar before and only remembered it when you passed the drumlin singer shook his head i understand your doubts he said and i cant offer concrete proof but the feeling is unmistakable i have been there before in a previous life im certain of it and thats not all theres the dream dream yes ive had it several times the same one its raining like today and im passing through a landscape very similar to what ive seen in swainsdale i arrive at a very old stone house there are people and their voices are raised maybe in anger or laughter i cant tell but i start to feel tense and claustrophobic theres a baby crying somewhere and it wont stop i climb up some creaky stairs when i get to the top i find a door and open it then i feel that panicky sensation of endlessly falling and i usually wake up frightened banks thought for a moment thats all very interesting he said but have you considered that you might have come to the wrong place were not usually in the business of interpreting dreams and visions singer stood his ground this is real he said a crime has been committed against me he poked himself in the chest with his thumb the crime of murder the least you can do is do me the courtesy of checking your records his odd blend of naivety and intensity charged the air banks stared at him then looked at susan whose face showed sceptical interest never having been one to shy away from what killed the cat banks let his curiosity get the better of him yet again all right he said standing up well look into it where did you say you were staying banks turned right by the whitewashed sixteenthcentury rose and crown in fortford and stopped just after he had crossed the small stone bridge over the river swain the rain was still falling obscuring the higher green dale sides and their latticework of drystone walls lyndgarth a cluster of limestone cottages and a church huddled around a small village green looked like an impressionist painting the raindarkened ruins of devraulx abbey just up the hill to his left poked through the trees like a setting for camelot banks rolled his window down and listened to the rain slapping against leaves and dancing on the rivers surface to the west he could see the drumlin that jerry singer had felt so strongly about today it looked ghostly in the rain and it was easy to imagine the place as some ancient barrow where the spirits of bronze age men lingered but it wasnt a barrow it was a drumlin created by glacial deposits and jerry singer hadnt been a bronze age man in his previous lifetime he had been a sixties hippie or so he believed leaving the window down banks drove through lyndgarth and parked at the end of gristhorpes rutted driveway in front of the squat limestone farmhouse inside he found gristhorpe staring gloomily out of the back window at a pile of stones and a halfcompleted drystone wall the superintendent he knew had taken a weeks holiday and hoped to work on the wall which went nowhere and closed in nothing but he hadnt bargained for the summer rain which had been falling nonstop for the past two days he poured banks a cup of tea so strong you could stand a spoon up in it offered some scones and they sat in gristhorpes study a paperback copy of trollopes the vicar of bullhampton lay on a small table beside a worn and scuffed brown leather armchair do you believe in reincarnation banks asked gristhorpe considered the question a moment no why banks told him about jerry singer then said i wanted your opinion besides you were here then werent you gristhorpes bushy eyebrows knit in a frown nineteen sixtysix yes i was here but thats over thirty years ago alan my memorys not what it used to be besides what makes you think theres anything in this other than some new age fantasy i dont know that there is banks answered at a loss how to explain his interest even to the broadminded gristhorpe boredom partly and the oddness of singers claim the certainty the man seemed to feel about it but how could he tell his superintendent that he had so little to do he was opening investigations into the supernatural there was a sort of innocence about him he said and he seemed so sincere about it so intense the best lack all conviction while the worstare full of passionate intensity w b yeats gristhorpe replied perhaps anyway ive arranged to talk to jenny fuller about it later today jenny was a psychologist who had worked with the eastvale police before good idea said gristhorpe all right then just for arguments sake lets examine his claim objectively hes convinced he was a hippie murdered in swainsdale in summer nineteen sixtysix right banks nodded and he thinks this because he believes in reincarnation he had a déjà vu and hes had a recurring dream true now gristhorpe went on leaving aside the question of whether you or i believe in reincarnation or indeed whether there is such a thing a philosophical speculation we could hardly settle over tea and scones anyway he doesnt give us a hell of a lot to go on does he thats the problem i thought you might remember something gristhorpe sighed and shifted in his chair the scuffed leather creaked in nineteen sixtysix i was a thirtyyearold detective sergeant in a backwoods division in fact we were nothing but a subdivision then and i was the senior detective most of the time i investigated burglaries the occasional outbreak of sheep stealing marketstall owners fencing stolen goods he sipped some tea we had one or two murders really interesting ones ill tell you about someday but not a lot what im saying alan is that no matter how poor my memory is id remember a murdered hippie and nothing fits the bill nothing im not saying we didnt have a few hippies around but none of them got murdered i think your mr singer must be mistaken banks put his mug down on the table and stood up to leave better get back to the crime statistics then he said gristhorpe smiled so thats why youre so interested in this cock and bull story cant say i blame you sorry i cant help wait a minute though he added as they walked to the door there was old bert athertons lad i suppose that was around the time youre talking about give or take a year or two banks paused at the door atherton aye owns a farm between lyndgarth and helmthorpe or did hes dead now i only mention it because athertons son joseph was something of a hippie what happened fell down the stairs and broke his neck family never got over it as i said old man atherton died a couple of years back but his missis is still around youd no reason to suspect anything gristhorpe shook his head none at all the athertons were a decent hardworking family apparently the lad was visiting them on his way to scotland to join some commune or other he fell down the stairs its a pretty isolated spot and it was too late when the ambulance arrived especially as they had to drive a mile down country lanes to the nearest telephone box they were really devastated he was their only child what made him fall he wasnt pushed if thats what youre thinking there was no stair carpet and the steps were a bit slippery according to his dad joseph was walking around without his slippers on and he slipped in his stockinged feet and youve no reason to doubt him no i did have one small suspicion at the time though what according to the postmortem joseph atherton was a heroin addict though he didnt have any traces of the drug in his system at the time of his death i thought he might have been smoking marijuana or something up in his room that might have made him a bit unsteady on his feet did you search the place gristhorpe snorted nay alan there was no sense bringing more grief on his parents what would we do if we found something charge them with possession i see your point banks opened the door and put up his collar against the rain i might dig up the file anyway he called running over to the car enjoy the rest of your week off gristhorpes curse was lost in the sound of the engine starting up and the finale of mussorgskys great gate of kiev on classic fm blasting out from the radio which banks had forgotten to switch off in addition to the cells and the charge room the lower floor of eastvale divisional headquarters housed old files and records the dank room was lit by a single bare light bulb and packed with dusty files so far banks had checked nineteen sixtyfive and sixtysix but found nothing on the atherton business give or take a couple of years gristhorpe had said without much hope banks reached for nineteen sixtyfour that was a bit too early for hippies he thought especially in the far reaches of rural north yorkshire in nineteen sixtyfour he remembered the beatles were still recording ballads like ill follow the sun and old rockers like long tall sally john hadnt met yoko and there wasnt a sitar within earshot the rolling stones were doing not fade away and its all over now the kinks had a huge hit with you really got me and the charts were full of dusty springfield peter and gordon the dave clark five and hermans hermits so nineteen sixtyfour was a writeoff as far as dead hippies were concerned banks looked anyway maybe joseph atherton had been way ahead of his time or perhaps jerry singers channeller had been wrong about the time between incarnations why was this whole charade taking on such an aura of unreality bankss stomach rumbled apart from that scone at gristhorpes he hadnt eaten since breakfast he realized he put the file aside though there hardly seemed any point looking further ahead than nineteen sixtysix he did so out of curiosity just as he was feeling success slip away he came across it joseph atherton coroners verdict accidental death there was only one problem it had happened in according to the athertons statement their son wrote to say he was coming to see them en route to scotland he said he was on his way to join some sort of commune and arrived at eastvale station on the london train at three fortyfive in the afternoon july by ten oclock that night he was dead he didnt have transport of his own so his father had met him at the station in the land rover and driven him back to the farm banks picked up a sheet of lined writing paper yellowed around the edges a separate sheet described it as an anonymous note received at the eastvale police station about a week after the coroners verdict all it said in block capitals was ask atherton about the red volkswagen next came a brief interview report in which a pc wythers said he had questioned the athertons about the car and they said they didnt know what he was talking about that was that banks supposed it was remotely possible that whoever was in the red volkswagen had killed joseph atherton but why would his parents lie according to the statement they spent the evening together at the farm eating dinner catching up on family news then joseph went up to his room to unpack and came down in his stockinged feet maybe hed been smoking marijuana as gristhorpe suggested anyway he slipped at the top of the stairs and broke his neck it was tragic but hardly what banks was looking for he heard a sound at the door and looked up to see susan gay found anything sir she asked maybe said banks one or two loose ends but i havent a clue what it all means if anything im beginning to wish id never seen mr jerry singer susan smiled do you know sir she said he almost had me believing him banks put the file aside did he i suppose it always pays to keep an open mind he said thats why were going to visit mrs atherton the atherton farm was every bit as isolated as gristhorpe had said and the relentless rain had muddied the lane at one point banks thought they would have to get out and push but on the third try the wheels caught and the car lurched forward the farmyard looked neglected bedraggled weeds poked through the mud part of the barn roof had collapsed and the wheels and tines of the old hayrake had rusted mrs atherton answered their knock almost immediately banks had phoned ahead so their arrival wouldnt frighten her after all a woman living alone in such a wild place couldnt be too careful she led them into the large kitchen and put the kettle on the aga the stonewalled room looked clean and tidy enough but banks noted an underlying smell like old greens and meat rotting under the sink mrs atherton carried the aura of the sickroom about with her her complexion was as grey as her sparse hair her eyes were dull yellow with milky blue irises and the skin below them looked dark as a bruise as she made the tea she moved slowly as if measuring the energy required for each step how on earth banks wondered did she manage up here all by herself yorkshire grit was legendary and often as close to foolhardiness as anything else he thought she put the teapot on the table well just let it mash a minute she said now what is it you want to talk to me about banks didnt know how to begin he had no intention of telling mrs atherton about jerry singers previous lifetime or of interrogating her about her sons death which didnt leave him many options how are you managing he asked first mustnt grumble it must be hard taking care of this place all by yourself nay theres not much to do these days jack crocker keeps an eye on the sheep ive nobbut got a few cows to milk no poultry nay its not worth it any more not with these battery farms anyway seeing as youre a copper i dont suppose you came to talk to me about the farming life did you come on spit it out lad banks noticed susan look down and smile well he said i hate to bring up a painful subject but its your sons death we want to talk to you about mrs atherton looked at susan as if noticing her for the first time a shadow crossed her face then she turned back to banks our joseph she said but hes been dead nigh on thirty years i know that said banks we wont trouble you for long theres nowt else to add she poured the tea fussed with milk and sugar and sat down again you said your son wrote and said he was coming aye did you keep the letter what the letter ive not seen any mention of it anywhere its not in the file well it wouldnt be would it we dont leave scraps of paper cluttering up the place so you threw it out aye bert or me she looked at susan again that was my husband god rest his soul besides she said how else would we know he was coming we couldnt afford a telephone back then i know said banks but nobody had asked at the railway station whether bert atherton actually had met his son there and now it was too late he sipped some tea it tasted as if the teabag had been used before i dont suppose you remember seeing a red volkswagen in the area around that time do you no they asked us that when it first happened i didnt know owt about it then and i dont know owt now was there anyone else in the house when the accident occurred no of course there werent do you think i wouldnt have said if there were look young man what are you getting at do you have summat to tell me summat i should know banks sighed and took another sip of weak tea it didnt wash away the taste of decay that permeated the kitchen he signalled to susan and stood up no he said no ive nothing new to tell you mrs atherton just chasing will o the wisps thats all well im sorry but youll have to go chase em somewhere else lad ive got work to do the queens arms was quiet late that afternoon rain had kept the tourists away and at four oclock most of the locals were still at work in the offices and shops around the market square banks ordered a pork pie then he and jenny fuller took their drinks to an isolated corner table and settled down the first long draught of theakstons bitter washed the archive dust and the taste of decay from bankss throat well said jenny raising her glass of lager in a toast to what do i owe the honour she looked radiant banks thought thick red hair tumbling over her shoulders emerald green eyes full of humour and vitality a fresh scent that cut through the atmosphere of stale smoke and made him think of childhood apple orchards though banks was married he and jenny had once come very close to getting involved and every now and then he felt a pang of regret for the road not taken reincarnation said banks clinking glasses jenny raised her eyebrows you know ill drink to most things she said but really alan isnt this going a bit far banks explained what had happened so far that day by the time he had finished the barman delivered his pork pie along with a large pickled onion as jenny mulled over what he had said he sliced the pie into quarters and shook a dollop of hp sauce onto his plate to dip them in fantasy she said finally would you care to elaborate if you dont believe in reincarnation then there are an awful lot of strange phenomena you have to explain in more rational ways now im no expert on parapsychology but most people who claim to have lived past lifetimes generally become convinced through hypnosis dreams and déjà vu experiences like the ones you mentioned or by spontaneous recall whats that exactly what it sounds like remembering past lifetimes out of the blue children playing the piano without lessons people suddenly speaking foreign languages that kind of thing or any memory you have but cant explain something that seems to have come from beyond your experience you mean if im walking down the street and i suddenly think of a roman soldier and remember some sort of latin phrase then im recalling a previous lifetime jenny gave him a withering look dont be so silly alan of course i dont think that some people might though people are limitlessly gullible it seems to me especially when it comes to life after death no what i mean is that this is the kind of thing believers try to put forward as proof of reincarnation and how would a rational psychologist explain it she might argue that what a person recalls under hypnosis in dreams or wherever is simply a web of fantasy woven from things that person has already seen or heard and maybe forgotten but he says hes never been here before theres television books films banks finished his pork pie took a swig of theakstons and lit a silk cut so youre saying that maybe our mr singer has watched one too many episodes of all creatures great and small jenny tossed back her hair and laughed it wouldnt surprise me she looked at her watch then drained her glass look im sorry but i must dash and with that she jumped up pecked him on the cheek and left jenny was always dashing it seemed sometimes he wondered where banks thought over what she had said it made sense more sense than singers reincarnation theory and more sense than suspecting joseph athertons parents of covering up their sons murder but there remained the unsubstantiated story of the letter and the anonymous note about the red volkswagen if somebody else had driven joseph atherton to the farm then his parents had been lying about the letter why and who could it have been two days later sorting through his post banks found a letter addressed to him in longhand it stood out like a sore thumb among the usual bundle of circulars and official communications he spread it open on his desk in front of him and read dear mr banks im not much of a one for letter writing so you must forgive me any mistakes i didnt get much schooling due to me being a sickly child but my father always told us it was important to read and write your visit last week upset me by raking up the past id rather forget i dont know what made you come and ask those questions but they made me think it is time to make my peace with god and tell the truth after all these years what we told the police was not true our joseph didnt write to say he was coming and bert didnt pick him up at the station joseph just turned up out of the blue one afternoon in that red car i dont know who told the police about the car but i think it might have been len grimond in the farm down the road because he had fallen out with bert over paying for repairs to a wall anyway it wasnt our josephs car there was an american lass with him called annie and she was driving they had a baby with them that they said was theirs i suppose that made him our grandson but it was the first time we ever heard about him our joseph hadnt written or visited us for four years and we didnt know if he was alive or dead he was a bonny little lad about two or three with the most solemn look on his face well it was plain from the start that something was wrong we tried to behave like good loving parents and welcome them into our home but the girl was moody and she didnt want to stay the baby cried a lot and i dont think he had been looked after properly though its not my place to say and joseph was behaving very peculiar his eyes looked all glassy with tiny pupils we didnt know what was the matter i think from what he said that he just wanted money they wouldnt eat much though i cooked a good roast for them and yorkshire puddings too but our joseph just picked at his food and the girl sat there all sulky holding the baby and wanting to go she said she was a vegetarian after wed finished the dinner joseph got very upset and said he had to go to the toilet by then bert was wondering what was going on and also a bit angry at how they treated our hospitality even if joseph was our son joseph was a long time in the toilet bert called up to him but he didnt answer the girl said something about leaving him alone and laughed but it wasnt a nice laugh we thought something might be wrong with him so bert went up and found joseph with a piece of string tied around his arm heating something in a spoon with a match it was one of our silver anniversary spoons he had taken from the kitchen without asking we were just ignorant farmers and didnt know what was happening in crime and drugs and everything like you do mr banks but we knew our joseph was doing something bad bert lost his temper and pulled joseph out of the toilet when they were at the top of the stairs joseph started swearing at his father using such words ive never heard before and would blush to repeat thats when bert lost his temper and hit him on gods honour he didnt mean to hurt him joseph was our only son and we loved him even though he was breaking my heart but when bert hit him joseph fell down the stairs and when he got to the bottom his head was at such a funny angle i knew he must have broken his neck the girl started screaming then took the baby and ran outside and drove away we have never seen her again or our grandson and dont know what has become of him there was such a silence like you have never heard when the sound of the car engine vanished in the distance and joseph was laying at the bottom of the stairs all twisted and broken we tried to feel his pulse and bert even put a mirror to his mouth to see if his breath would mist it but there was nothing i know we should have told the truth and we have regretted it for all those years we were always brought up to be decent honest folk respecting our parents and god and the law bert was ashamed that his son was a drug addict and didnt want it in the papers i didnt want him to go to jail for what he had done because it was really an accident and it wasnt fair he was suffering more than enough anyway because he had killed his only son so i said we must throw away all the drugs and needle and things and take our josephs shoes off and say he slipped coming down the stairs we knew that the police would believe us because we were good people and we had no reason to lie that was the hardest part the laces got tied in knots and i broke my fingernails and in the end i was shaking so much i had to use the scissors and that is gods honest truth mr banks i know we did wrong but bert was never the same after not a day went by when he didnt cry about what hed done and i never saw him smile ever again to this day we still do not know what has become of our grandson but whatever it is we hope he is healthy and happy and not as foolish as his father by the time you read this letter ill be gone to my resting place too for two years now i have had cancer and no matter what operations they do it is eating me away i have saved my tablets now that i have taken the weight off my conscience i can only hope that the good lord sees fit to forgive me my sins and take me unto his bosom yours sincerely betty atherton banks put the letter aside and rubbed his left eye with the back of his hand outside the rain was still falling providing a gentle background for finzis clarinet concerto on the portable cassette banks stared at the sheets of blue vellum covered in betty athertons crabbed hand then he cursed slammed his fist on the desk went to the door and shouted for susan gay her name is catherine anne singer said susan the next afternoon and she was relieved to talk to me as soon as i told her we werent after her for leaving the scene of a crime she comes from somewhere called garden grove california like a lot of young americans she came over to do europe in the sixties the three of them banks susan and jenny fuller sat over drinks at a dimpled coppertopped table in the queens arms listening to the summer rain tap against the diamonds of coloured glass and shes jerry singers mother banks asked susan nodded yes i just asked him for her telephone number i didnt tell him why i wanted it banks nodded good go on well she ended up living in london it was easy enough to get jobs that paid under the counter places where nobody asked too many questions eventually she hooked up with joseph atherton and they lived together in a bedsit in notting hill joseph fancied himself as a musician then who didnt said banks he remembered taking a few abortive guitar lessons himself sorry go on theres not a lot to add sir she got pregnant wouldnt agree to an abortion though apparently joseph tried to persuade her she named the child jerry after some guitarist joseph liked called jerry garcia luckily for jerry annie wasnt on heroin she drew the line at hash and lsd anyway they were off to join some buddhist commune in the wilds of scotland when joseph said they should drop in on his parents on the way and try to get some money she didnt like the idea but she went along with it anyway everything happened exactly as mrs atherton described it annie got scared and ran away when she got back to london she decided it was time to go home she sold the car and took out all her savings from the bank then she got the first flight she could and settled back in california she went to university and ended up working as a marine biologist in san diego she never married and she never mentioned her time in england or that night at the atherton farm to jerry she told him his father had left them when jerry was still a baby he was only two and a half at the time of athertons death and as far as he was concerned he had spent his entire life in southern california banks drained his pint and looked at jenny cryptomnesia she said come again cryptomnesia it means memories youre not consciously aware of a memory of an incident in your own life that youve forgotten jerry singer was present when his grandfather knocked his father down the stairs but as far as he was concerned consciously hed never been to swainsdale before so how could he remember it when he got mixed up in the new age scene these memories he didnt know he had started to seem like some sort of proof of reincarnation sometimes banks thought to himself things are better left alone the thought surprised him because it went against the grain of both his job and his innate curiosity but what good had come from jerry singer presenting himself at the station three days ago none at all perhaps the only blessing in the whole affair was that betty atherton had passed away peacefully as she had intended in her pillinduced sleep now she wouldnt suffer any more in this world and if there were a god banks thought he surely couldnt be such a bastard as to let her suffer in the next one either sir sorry susan i was miles away i asked who was going to tell him you or me ill do it said banks with a sigh its no good trying to sit on it all now but i need another pint first my shout as he stood up to go to the bar the door opened and jerry singer walked in he spotted them at once and walked over he had that strange naive intense look in his eyes banks instinctively reached for his cigarettes they told me you were here singer said awkwardly pointing back through the door towards the tudorfronted police station across the street im leaving for home tomorrow and i was just wondering if youd found anything out yet fan mail the letter arrived one sunny thursday morning in august along with a visa bill and a royalty statement dennis quilley carried the mail out to the deck of his beaches home stopping by the kitchen on the way to pour himself a gin and tonic he had already been writing for three hours straight and he felt he deserved a drink first he looked at the amount of the royalty cheque then he put aside the visa bill and picked up the letter carefully as if he were a forensic expert investigating it for prints postmarked toronto and dated four days earlier it was addressed in a small precise hand and looked as if it had been written with a finenibbed calligraphic pen but the post code was different that had been hurriedly scrawled in with a ballpoint whoever it was quilley thought had probably got his name from the telephone directory and had then looked up the code in the post office just before mailing pleased with his deductions quilley opened the letter written in the same neat and mannered hand as the address it said dear mr quilley please forgive me for writing to you at home like this i know you must be very busy and it is inexcusable of me to intrude on your valuable time believe me i would not do so if i could think of any other way i have been a great fan of your work for many years now as a collector of mysteries too i also have first editions of all your books from what i have read i know you are a clever man and i hope just the man to help me with my problem for the past twenty years my wife has been making my life a misery i put up with her for the sake of the children but now they have all gone to live their own lives i have asked her for a divorce but she just laughed in my face i have decided finally that the only way out is to kill her and that is why i am seeking your advice you may think this is insane of me especially saying it in a letter but it is just a measure of my desperation i would quite understand it if you went straight to the police and i am sure they would find me and punish me believe me ive thought about it even that would be preferable to the misery i must suffer day after day if you can find it in your heart to help a devoted fan in his hour of need please meet me on the roof lounge of the park plaza hotel on wednesday august at two pm i have taken the afternoon off work and will wait longer if for any reason you are delayed dont worry i will recognize you easily from your photo on the dust jacket of your books yours in hope a fan the letter slipped from quilleys hand he couldnt believe what hed just read he was a mystery writer he specialized in devising ingenious murders but for someone to assume that he did the same in real life was absurd could it be a practical joke he picked up the letter and read through it again the mans whining tone and clichéd style seemed sincere enough and the more quilley thought about it the more certain he became that none of his friends was sick enough to play such a joke assuming that it was real then what should he do his impulse was to crumple up the letter and throw it away but should he go to the police no that would be a waste of time the real police were a terribly dull and literalminded lot they would probably think he was seeking publicity he found that he had screwed up the sheet of paper in his fist and he was just about to toss it aside when he changed his mind wasnt there another option go go and meet the man find out more about him find out if he was genuine surely there would be no obligation in that all he had to do was turn up at the park plaza at the appointed time and see what happened quilleys life was fine no troublesome woman to torment him plenty of money mostly from american sales a beautiful lakeside cottage near huntsville a modicum of fame the esteem of his peers but it had been rather boring of late here was an opportunity for adventure of a kind besides he might get a story idea out of the meeting why not go and see he finished his drink and smoothed the letter on his knee he had to smile at that last bit no doubt the man would recognize him from his bookjacket photo but it was an old one and had been retouched in the first place his cheeks had filled out a bit since then and his thinning hair had acquired a sprinkling of grey still he thought he was a handsome man for fifty handsome clever and successful smiling he picked up both letter and envelope and went back to the kitchen in search of matches there must be no evidence over the next few days quilley hardly gave a thought to the mysterious letter as usual in summer he divided his time between writing in toronto where he found the city worked as a stimulus and weekends at the cottage there he walked in the woods chatted to locals in the lodge swam in the clear lake and idled around getting a tan evenings he would open a bottle of chardonnay reread p g wodehouse and listen to bach it was an ideal life quiet solitary independent when wednesday came though he drove downtown parked in the multistorey at cumberland and avenue road then walked to the park plaza it was another hot day the tourists were out in force across bloor street by the royal ontario museum many of them americans from buffalo rochester or detroit the men in loudchecked shirts photographing everything in sight their wives in tight shorts looking tired and thirsty quilley took the elevator up to the nineteenth floor and wandered through the bar an oldeworlde place with deep armchairs and framed reproductions of old colonial scenes on the walls it was busier than usual and even though the windows were open the smoke bothered him he walked out onto the roof lounge and scanned the faces within moments he noticed someone looking his way the man paused for just a split second perhaps to translate the dustjacket photo into reality then beckoned quilley over with raised eyebrows and a twitch of the head the man rose to shake hands then sat down again glancing around to make sure nobody had paid the two of them undue attention he was short and thin with sandy hair and a pale grey complexion as if he had just come out of hospital he wore wirerimmed glasses and had a habit of rolling his tongue around in his mouth when he wasnt talking first of all mr quilley the man said raising his glass may i say how honoured i am to meet you he spoke with a pronounced english accent quilley inclined his head im flattered mr er peplow frank peplow yes mr peplow but i must admit im puzzled by your letter a waiter in a burgundy jacket came over to take quilleys order he asked for an amstel peplow paused until the waiter was out of earshot puzzled what i mean is quilley went on struggling for the right words whether you were serious or not whether you really do want to peplow leaned forward behind the lenses his pale blue eyes looked sane enough i assure you mr quilley that i was that i am entirely serious that woman is ruining my life and i cant allow it to go on any longer speaking about her brought little spots of red to his cheeks quilley held his hand up all right i believe you i suppose you realize i should have gone to the police but you didnt i could have they might be here watching us peplow shook his head mr quilley if you wont help id even welcome prison dont think i havent realized that i might get caught that no murder is perfect all i want is a chance its worth the risk the waiter returned with quilleys drink and they both sat in silence until he had gone quilley was intrigued by this drab man sitting opposite him a man who obviously didnt even have the imagination to dream up his own murder plot what do you want from me he asked i have no right to ask anything of you i understand that peplow said i have absolutely nothing to offer in return im not rich i have no savings i suppose all i want really is advice encouragement if i were to help quilley said if i were to help then id do nothing more than offer advice is that clear peplow nodded does that mean you will if i can and so dennis quilley found himself helping to plot the murder of a woman hed never met with a man he didnt even particularly like later when he analysed his reasons for playing along he realized that that was exactly what he had been doing playing it had been a game a cerebral puzzle just like thinking up a plot for a book and he never at first gave a thought to real murder real blood real death peplow took a handkerchief from his top pocket and wiped the thin film of sweat from his brow you dont know how happy this makes me mr quilley at last i have a chance my life hasnt amounted to much and i dont suppose it ever will but at least i might find some peace and quiet in my final years im not a well man he placed one hand solemnly over his chest ticker not fair is it ive never smoked i hardly drink and im only fiftythree but the doctor has promised me a few years yet if i live right all i want is to be left alone with my books and my garden tell me about your wife quilley prompted peplows expression darkened shes a cruel and selfish woman he said and shes messy she never does anything around the place too busy watching those damn soap operas on television day and night she cares about nothing but her own comfort and she never overlooks an opportunity to nag me or taunt me if i try to escape to my collection she mocks me and calls me dull and boring im not even safe from her in my garden i realize i have no imagination mr quilley and perhaps even less courage but even a man like me deserves some peace in his life dont you think quilley had to admit that the woman really did sound awful worse than any he had known and he had met some shrews in his time he had never had much use for women except for occasional sex in his younger days even that had become sordid and now he stayed away from them as much as possible he found as he listened that he could summon up remarkable sympathy for peplows position what do you have in mind he asked i dont really know thats why i wrote to you i was hoping you might be able to help with some ideas your books you seem to know so much in my books quilley said the murderer always gets caught well yes said peplow of course but thats because the genre demands it isnt it i mean your inspector baldry is much smarter than any real policeman im sure if youd made him a criminal he would always get away there was no arguing with that quilley thought how do you want to do it he asked a domestic accident electric shock say gadget in the bathtub she must have a hair curler or a dryer peplow shook his head eyes tightly closed oh no he whispered i couldnt i couldnt do anything like that no more than i could bear the sight of her blood hows her health unfortunately said peplow she seems obscenely robust how old is she fortynine any bad habits mr quilley my wife has nothing but bad habits the only thing she wont tolerate is drink for some reason and i dont think she has other men though thats probably because nobody will have her does she smoke like a chimney quilley shuddered how long ever since she was a teenager i think before i met her does she exercise never what about her weight her diet well you might not call her fat but youd be generous in saying she was fullfigured she eats too much junk food ive always said that and eggs she loves bacon and eggs for breakfast and shes always stuffing herself with cream cakes and tarts hmmm said quilley taking a sip of amstel she sounds like a prime candidate for a heart attack but its me who peplow stopped as comprehension dawned yes i see you mean one could be induced quite do you think you could manage that well i could if i didnt have to be there to watch but i dont know how poison i dont know anything about poison never mind give me a few days to look into it ill give you advice remember but thats as far as it goes understood quilley smiled good another beer no id better not shell be able to smell this one on my breath and ill be in for it already id better go quilley looked at his watch twothirty he could have done with another amstel but he didnt want to stay there by himself besides at three it would be time to meet his agent at the four seasons and there he would have the opportunity to drink as much as he wanted to pass the time he could browse in book city fine he said ill go down with you outside on the hot busy street they shook hands and agreed to meet in a weeks time on the back patio of the madison avenue pub it wouldnt do to be seen together twice in the same place quilley stood on the corner of bloor and avenue road among the cameraclicking tourists and watched peplow walk off towards the st george subway station now that their meeting was over and the spell was broken he wondered again what the hell he was doing helping this pathetic little man it certainly wasnt altruism perhaps the challenge appealed to him after all people climb mountains just because theyre there and then there was peplows mystery collection there was just a chance that it might contain an item of great interest to quilley and that peplow might be grateful enough to part with it wondering how to approach the subject at their next meeting quilley wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand and walked towards the bookshop atropine hyoscyamine belladonna quilley flipped through dreisbachs handbook of poisoning one evening at the cottage poison seemed to have gone out of fashion these days and he had only used it in one of his novels about six years ago that had been the old standby cyanide with its familiar smell of bitter almonds which he had so often read about but never experienced the small black handbook had sat on his shelf gathering dust ever since writing a book of course one could generally skip over the problems of acquiring the stuff give the killer a job as a pharmacist or in a hospital dispensary for example in real life getting ones hands on poison might prove more difficult so far he had read through the sections on agricultural poisons household hazards and medicinal poisons the problem was that whatever peplow used had to be easily available prescription drugs were out even if peplow could persuade a doctor to give him barbiturates for example the prescription would be on record and any death in the household would be regarded as suspicious barbiturates wouldnt do anyway and nor would such common products as paint thinner insecticides and weed killers they didnt reproduce the symptoms of a heart attack near the back of the book was a list of poisonous plants that shocked quilley by its sheer length he hadnt known just how much deadliness there was lurking in fields gardens and woods rhubarb leaves contained oxalic acid for example and caused nausea vomiting and diarrhoea the bark wood leaves or seeds of the yew had a similar effect boxwood leaves and twigs caused convulsions celandine could bring about a coma hydrangeas contained cyanide and laburnums brought on irregular pulse delirium twitching and unconsciousness and so the list went on lupins mistletoe sweet peas rhododendron a poisoners delight even the beautiful poinsettia which brightened up so many toronto homes each christmas could cause gastroenteritis most of these plants were easy to get hold of and in many cases the active ingredients could be extracted simply by soaking or boiling in water it wasnt long before quilley found what he was looking for beside oleander the note read see digitalis and there it was set out in detail digitalis occurred in all parts of the common foxglove which grew on waste ground and woodland slopes and flowered from june to september acute poisoning would bring about death from ventricular fibrillation no doctor would consider an autopsy if peplows wife appeared to die of a heart attack given her habits especially if peplow fed her a few smaller doses first to establish the symptoms quilley set aside the book it was already dark outside and the downpour that the humid cloudy day had been promising had just begun rain slapped against the asphalt roof tiles gurgled down the drainpipe and pattered on the leaves of the overhanging trees in the background it hissed as it fell on the lake distant flashes of lightning and deep rumblings of thunder warned of the coming storm happy with his solitude and his cleverness quilley linked his hands behind his head and leaned back in the chair out back he heard the rustling of a small animal making its way through the undergrowth a raccoon perhaps or even a skunk when he closed his eyes he pictured all the trees shrubs and wild flowers around the cottage and marvelled at the deadly potential so many of them contained the sun blazed down on the back patio of the madison a small garden protected from the wind by high fences quilley wore his sunglasses and nursed a pint of conners ale the place was packed skilled and pretty waitresses came and went trays laden with baskets of chicken wings and golden pints of lager the two of them sat out of the way at a white table in a corner by the metal fire escape a striped parasol offered some protection but the sun was still too hot and too bright peplows wife must have given him hell about drinking the last time because today he had ordered only a coke it was easy quilley said you could have done it yourself the only setback was that foxgloves dont grow wild here like they do in england but youre a gardener you grow them peplow shook his head and smiled its the gift of clever people like yourself to make difficult things seem easy im not particularly resourceful mr quilley believe me i wouldnt have known where to start i had no idea that such a book existed but you did because of your art even if i had known id hardly have dared buy it or take it out of the library for fear that someone would remember but youve had your copy for years a simple tool of the trade no mr quilley please dont underestimate your contribution i was a desperate man now youve given me a chance at freedom if theres anything at all i can do for you please dont hesitate to say id consider it an honour this collection of yours quilley said what does it consist of british and canadian crime fiction mostly i dont like to boast but its a very good collection try me go on just mention a name e c r lorac about twenty of the inspector macdonalds first editions mint condition anne hocking everything but nights candles trotton peplow raised his eyebrows good lord thats an obscure one do you know youre the first person ive come across whos ever mentioned that do you have it oh yes peplow smiled smugly x j trotton signed in blood published it turned up in a pile of junk i bought at an auction some years ago its rare but not very valuable came out in britain during the war and probably died an immediate death it was his only book as far as i can make out and there is no biographical information perhaps it was a pseudonym for someone famous quilley shook his head im afraid i dont know have you read it good lord no i dont read them it could damage the spines many of them are fragile anything i want to read like your books i also buy in paperback mr peplow quilley said slowly you asked if there was anything you could do for me as a matter of fact there is something you can give me for my services yes the trotton peplow frowned and pursed his thin lips why on earth for my own collection of course im especially interested in the war period peplow smiled ah so thats how you knew so much about them id no idea you were a collector too quilley shrugged modestly he could see peplow struggling visualizing the gap in his collection but finally the poor man decided that the murder of his wife was more important to him than an obscure mystery novel very well he said gravely ill mail it to you how can i be sure peplow looked offended im a man of my word mr quilley a bargain is a bargain he held out his hand gentlemans agreement all right quilley believed him youll be in touch when its done yes perhaps a brief note in with the trotton if you can wait that long say two or three weeks fine im in no hurry quilley hadnt examined his motives since the first meeting but he had realized as he passed on the information and instructions that it was the challenge he responded to more than anything else for years he had been writing crime novels and in providing peplow with the means to kill his slatternly overbearing wife quilley had derived some vicarious pleasure from the knowledge that he inspector baldrys creator could bring off in real life what he had always been praised for doing in fiction quilley also knew that there were no real detectives who possessed baldrys curious mixture of intellect and instinct most of them were thick plodders and they would never realize that dull mr peplow had murdered his wife with a bunch of foxgloves of all things nor would they ever know that the brains behind the whole affair had been none other than his dennis quilleys the two men drained their glasses and left together the corner of bloor and spadina was busy with tourists and students lining up for charcoalgrilled hot dogs from the street vendor peplow turned towards the subway and quilley wandered among the artsy crowd and the rollerbladers on bloor street west for a while then he settled at an openair cafe over a daiquiri and a slice of kiwifruit cheesecake to read the globe and mail now he thought as he sipped his drink and turned to the arts section all he had to do was wait one day soon a small package would arrive for him peplow would be free of his wife and quilley would be the proud owner of one of the few remaining copies of x j trottons one and only mystery novel signed in blood three weeks passed and no package arrived occasionally quilley thought of mr peplow and wondered what had become of him perhaps he had lost his nerve after all that wouldnt be surprising quilley knew that he would have no way of finding out what had happened if peplow chose not to contact him again he didnt know where the man lived or where he worked he didnt even know if peplow was his real name still he thought it was best that way no contact even the trotton wasnt worth being involved in a botched murder for then at ten oclock one warm tuesday morning in september the doorbell chimed quilley looked at his watch and frowned too early for the postman sighing he pressed the save command on his pc and walked down to answer the door a stranger stood there an overweight woman in a yellow polkadot dress with short sleeves and a low neck she had piggy eyes set in a round face and dyed red hair that looked limp and lifeless after a cheap perm she carried an imitation crocodileskin handbag quilley must have stood there looking puzzled for too long the womans eyes narrowed and her rosebud mouth tightened so much that white furrows radiated from the red circle of her lips may i come in she asked stunned quilley stood back and let her enter she walked straight over to a wicker armchair and sat down the basketwork creaked under her from there she surveyed the room with its waxed parquet floor stone fireplace and antique ontario furniture nice she said clutching her handbag on her lap quilley sat down opposite her her dress was a size too small and the material strained over her red fleshy upper arms and pinkish bosom the hem rode up as she crossed her legs exposing a wedge of fat mottled thigh primly she pulled it down again over her dimpled knees im sorry to appear rude said quilley regaining his composure but who the hell are you my name is peplow the woman said gloria peplow im a widow quilley felt a tingling sensation along his spine the way he always did when fear began to take hold of him he frowned and said im afraid i dont know you do i weve never met the woman replied but i think you knew my husband i dont recall any peplow perhaps youre mistaken gloria peplow shook her head and fixed him with her piggy eyes he noticed they were black or as near as im not mistaken mr quilley you didnt only know my husband you also plotted with him to murder me quilley flushed and jumped to his feet thats absurd look if youve come here to make insane accusations like that youd better go he stood like an ancient statue one hand pointing dramatically towards the door mrs peplow smirked oh sit down you look very foolish standing there like that quilley continued to stand this is my home mrs peplow and i insist that you leave now mrs peplow sighed and opened the gilded plastic clasp on her purse she took out a shoppers drug mart envelope picked out two colour photographs and dropped them next to the wedgwood dish on the antique wine table by her chair leaning forward quilley could see clearly what they were one showed him standing with peplow outside the park plaza and the other caught the two of them talking outside the scotiabank at bloor and spadina mrs peplow flipped the photos over and quilley saw that they had been datestamped by the processors you met with my husband at least twice to help him plan my death thats ridiculous i do remember him now ive seen the picture i just couldnt recollect his name he was a fan we talked about mystery novels im very sorry to hear that hes passed away he had a heart attack mr quilley and now im all alone in the world im very sorry but i dont see mrs peplow waved his protests aside quilley noticed the dark sweat stain on the tight material around her armpit she fumbled with the catch on her purse again and brought out a pack of export lights and a book of matches i dont allow smoking in my house quilley said it doesnt agree with me pity she said lighting the cigarette and dropping the spent match in the wedgwood bowl she blew a stream of smoke directly at quilley who coughed and fanned it away listen to me mr quilley she said and listen good my husband might have been stupid but im not he was not only a pathetic and boring little man he was also an open book dont ask me why i married him he wasnt even much of a man if you know what i mean do you think i havent known for some time that he was thinking of ways to get rid of me i wouldnt give him a divorce because the one thing he did the only thing he did was provide for me and he didnt even do that very well id have got half if we divorced but half of what he earned isnt enough to keep a bag lady id have had to go to work and i dont like that idea so i watched him he got more and more desperate more and more secretive when he started looking smug i knew he was up to something mrs peplow quilley interrupted this is all very well but i dont see what it has to do with me you come in here and pollute my home with smoke then you start telling me some fairy tale about your husband a man i met casually once or twice im busy mrs peplow and quite frankly id rather you left and let me get back to work im sure you would she flicked a column of ash into the wedgwood bowl as i was saying i knew he was up to something so i started following him i thought he might have another woman unlikely as it seemed so i took my camera along i wasnt really surprised when he headed for the park plaza instead of going back to the office after lunch one day i watched the elevator go up to the nineteenth floor the bar so i waited across the street in the crowd for him to come out again as you know i didnt have to wait very long he came out with you and it was just as easy the next time ive already told you mrs peplow he was a mystery buff a fellow collector thats all yes yes i know he was him and his stupid catalogues and collection still she mused it had its uses thats how i found out who you were id seen your picture on the book covers of course if i may say so it does you more than justice she looked him up and down as if he were a side of beef hanging in a butchers window he cringed as i was saying my husband was obvious i knew he must be chasing you for advice he spends so much time escaping to his garden or his little world of books that it was perfectly natural he would go to a mystery novelist for advice rather than to a real criminal i imagine you were a bit more accessible too a little flattery and you were hooked just another puzzle for you to work on look mrs peplow let me finish she ground out her cigarette butt in the bowl foxgloves indeed do you think he could manage to brew up a dose of digitalis without leaving traces all over the place do you know what he did the first time he put just enough in my big mac to make me a bit nauseous and make my pulse race but he left the leaves and stems in the garbage can you believe that oh i became very careful in my eating habits after that mr quilley anyway your little plan didnt work im here and hes dead quilley paled my god you killed him didnt you he was the one with the bad heart not me she lit another cigarette you can hardly blackmail me for plotting with your husband to kill you when hes the one whos dead said quilley and as for evidence theres nothing no mrs peplow i think youd better go and think yourself lucky i dont call the police mrs peplow looked surprised what are you talking about i have no intention of blackmailing you for plotting to kill me then what mr quilley my husband was blackmailing you thats why you killed him quilley slumped back in his chair i what she took a sheet of paper from her purse and passed it over to him on it were just two words trotton quilley he recognized the neat handwriting thats a photocopy mrs peplow went on the originals where i found it slipped between the pages of a book called signed in blood by x j trotton do you know that book mr quilley vaguely ive heard of it oh have you it might also interest you to know that along with that book and the slip of paper locked away in my husbands files is a copy of your own first novel i put it there quilley felt the room spinning around him i i peplow had given him the impression that gloria was stupid but that was turning out to be far from the truth my husbands only been dead for two days if the doctors look theyll know that hes been poisoned for a start theyll find high levels of potassium and then theyll discover eosinophilia do you know what they are mr quilley i looked them up theyre a kind of white blood cell and you find lots of them around if theres been any allergic reaction or inflammation if i was to go to the police and say id been suspicious about my husbands behaviour over the past few weeks that i had followed him and photographed him with you and if they were to find the two books and the slip of paper in his files well i think you know what theyd make of it dont you especially if i told them he came home feeling ill after a lunch with you its not fair quilley said banging his fist on the chair arm its just not bloody fair life rarely is but the police arent to know how stupid and unimaginative my husband was theyll just look at the note read the books and assume he was blackmailing you she laughed even if frank had read the trotton book im sure hed have only noticed an influence at the most but you and i know what really went on dont we it happens more often than people think a few years ago i read in the newspaper about similarities between a book by colleen mccullough and the blue castle by lucy maud montgomery id say that was a bit obvious wouldnt you it was much easier in your case much less dangerous you were very clever mr quilley you found an obscure novel and you didnt only adapt the plot for your own first book you even stole the character of your series detective there was some risk involved certainly but not much your book is better without a doubt you have some writing talent which x j trotton completely lacked but he did have the germ of an original idea and it wasnt lost on you was it quilley groaned thirteen solid police procedurals twelve of them all his own work but the first yes a deliberate adaptation of a piece of ephemeral trash he had seen what trotton could have done and had done it himself serendipity or so it had seemed when he found the dusty volume in a secondhand bookshop in victoria years ago all he had had to do was change the setting from london to toronto alter the names and set about improving upon the original and now the hell of it was that he would have been perfectly safe without the damn book he had simply given in to the urge to get his hands on peplows copy and destroy it it wouldnt have mattered really signed in blood would have remained unread on peplows shelf if only the bloody fool hadnt written that note even if the police cant make a murder charge stick mrs peplow went on i think your reputation would suffer if this got out oh the great reading public might not care perhaps a trial would even increase your sales you know how ghoulish people are but the plagiarism would at the very least lose you the respect of your peers i dont think your agent and publisher would be very happy either am i making myself clear pale and sweating quilley nodded how much he whispered pardon i said how much how much do you want to keep quiet oh its not your money im after mr quilley or may i call you dennis well not only money anyway im a widow now im all alone in the world she looked around the room her piggy eyes glittering then gave quilley one of the most disgusting looks hed ever had in his life ive always fancied living near the lake she said reaching for another cigarette live here alone do you innocence francis must be late surely reed thought as he stood waiting on the bridge by the railway station he was beginning to feel restless and uncomfortable the handles of his holdall bit into his palm and he noticed that the rain promised in the forecast that morning was already starting to fall wonderful here he was over two hundred miles away from home and francis hadnt turned up but reed couldnt be sure about that perhaps he was early they had made the same arrangement three or four times over the past five years but for the life of him reed couldnt remember the exact time theyd met reed turned and noticed a plump woman in a threadbare blue overcoat come struggling against the wind over the bridge towards him she pushed a large pram in which two infants fought and squealed excuse me he called out as she neared him could you tell me what time school gets out the woman gave him a funny look either puzzlement or irritation he couldnt decide which and answered in the clipped nasal accent peculiar to the midlands half past three then she hurried by giving reed a wide berth he was wrong for some reason he had got it into his mind that francis finished teaching at three oclock it was only twentyfive past now so there would be at least another fifteen minutes to wait before the familiar red escort came into sight the rain was getting heavier and the wind lashed it hard against reeds face a few yards up the road from the bridge was the bus station which was attached to a large modern shopping centre all glass and escalators reed could stand in the entrance there just beyond the doors where it was warm and dry and still watch for francis at about twentyfive to four the first schoolchildren came dashing over the bridge and into the bus station satchels swinging voices shrill and loud with freedom the rain didnt seem to bother them reed noticed hair lay plastered to skulls beads of rain hung on the tips of noses most of the boys ties were askew their socks hung loose around their ankles and their shoelaces snaked along the ground it was a wonder they didnt trip over themselves reed smiled remembering his own schooldays and how alluring the girls looked as they ran smiling and laughing out of the rain into the shelter of the mall not the really young ones the unformed ones but the older longlimbed girls newly aware of their breasts and the swelling of their hips they wore their clothes carelessly blouses hanging out black woolly tights twisted or torn at the knees to reed there was something wanton in their disarray these days of course they probably all knew what was what but reed couldnt help but feel that there was also a certain innocence about them a naive carefree grace in the way they moved and a casual freedom in their laughter and gestures life hadnt got to them yet they hadnt felt its weight and seen the darkness at its core mustnt get carried away reed told himself with a smile it was all very well to joke with bill in the office about how sexy the schoolgirls who passed the window each day were but it was positively unhealthy to mean it or god forbid attempt to do anything about it he couldnt be turning into a dirty old man at thirtyfive could he sometimes the power and violence of his fantasies worried him but perhaps everyone else had them too it wasnt something you could talk about at work he didnt really think he was abnormal after all he hadnt acted them out and you couldnt be arrested for your fantasies could you where the hell was francis reed peered out through the glass windblown rain lashed across the huge plate windows and distorted the outside world all detail was obliterated in favour of the overall mood greyglum and dreamlike reed glanced at his watch again after four oclock the only schoolchildren left now were the stragglers the ones who lived nearby and didnt have to hurry for a bus they sauntered over the bridge shoving each other playing tag hopping and skipping over the cracks in the pavement oblivious to the rain and the wind that drove it francis ought to be here by now worried reed went over the arrangements again in his mind he knew that hed got the date right because hed written it down in his appointment book reed had tried to call the previous evening to confirm but no one had answered if francis had been trying to get in touch with him at work or at home he would have been out of luck reed had been visiting another old friend this one in exeter and elsie the office receptionist could hardly be trusted to get her own name right when five oclock came and there was still no sign of francis reed picked up his holdall again and walked back down to the station it was still raining but not so fast and the wind had dropped the only train back home that night left birmingham at nineforty and didnt get to carlisle until well after midnight by then the local buses would have stopped running and he would have to get a taxi was it worth it there wasnt much alternative really a hotel would be too expensive still the idea had its appeal a warm room with a soft bed shower colour television and maybe even a bar downstairs where he might meet a girl he would just have to decide later anyway if he did want to catch the train he would have to take the eightfifty from redditch to get to birmingham in time that left three hours and fifty minutes to kill as he walked over the bridge and up towards the town centre in the darkening evening reed noticed two schoolgirls walking in front of him they must have been kept in detention he thought or perhaps theyd just finished games practice no doubt they had to do that even in the rain one looked dumpy from behind but her friend was a dream long wavy hair tumbling messily over her shoulders short skirt flicking over her long slim thighs white socks fallen around her ankles leaving her shapely calves bare reed watched the tendons at the back of her knees flex and loosen as she walked and thought of her struggling beneath him his hands on her soft throat they turned down a side street and reed carried on ahead shaking off his fantasy could francis have got lumbered with taking detention or games he wondered or perhaps he had passed by without even noticing reed sheltering from the rain he didnt know where franciss school was or even what it was called somehow the subject had just never come up also the village where francis lived was about eight miles away from redditch and the local bus service was terrible still he could phone if francis were home hed come out again and pick reed up after phoning and getting no answer reed walked around town for a long time looking in shop windows and wondering about how to get out of the mess he was in his holdall weighed heavy in his hand finally he got hungry and ducked out of the light rain into the tandoori palace it was still early just after six and the place was empty apart from a young couple absorbed in one another in a dim corner reed had the waiters undivided attention he ordered pakoras tandoori and dhal the food was very good and reed ate it too fast after the spiced tea he took out his wallet to pay he had some cash but he had decided to have a pint or two and he might have to take a taxi home from the station best hang on to the paper money the waiter didnt seem to mind taking plastic even for so small a sum and reed rewarded him with a generous tip next he tried francis again but the phone just rang and rang why didnt the bugger invest in an answering machine reed cursed then he realized he didnt even have one himself hated the things francis no doubt felt the same way if you were out tough tittie you were out and that was that outside the street lights reflected in oily puddles on the roads and pavements after walking off his heartburn for half an hour thoroughly soaked and out of breath reed ducked into the first pub he saw the locals eyed him suspiciously at first then ignored him and went back to their drinks pint of bitter please reed said rubbing his hands together in a sleeve glass if youve got one sorry sir the landlord said reaching for a mug the locals bring their own oh very well nasty night yes said reed very from these parts no just passing through ah the landlord passed over a brimming pint mug took reeds money and went back to the conversation hed been having with a roundfaced man in a pinstripe suit reed took his drink over to a table and sat down over the next hour and a half he phoned francis four more times but still got no reply he also changed pubs after each pint but got very little in the way of a friendly greeting finally at about twenty to nine knowing he couldnt bear to wake up in such a miserable town even if he could afford a hotel he went back to the station and took the train home because of his intended visit to francis reed hadnt planned anything for the weekend at home the weather was miserable anyway so he spent most of his time indoors reading and watching television or down at the local he tried franciss number a few more times but still got no reply he also phoned camille hoping that her warm lithe body and her fondness for experiment might brighten up his saturday night and sunday morning but all he got was her answering machine on monday evening just as he was about to go to bed after a long day catching up on boring paperwork the phone rang grouchily he picked up the receiver yes terry yes this is francis where the hell did you come all the way down on friday of course i bloody well did i thought we had an oh god look im sorry mate really i am i tried to call that woman at work whats her name elsie thats the one she said shed give you a message i must admit she didnt sound as if she quite had her wits about her but id no choice reed softened a little what happened my mother you know shes been ill for a long time yes well she died last wednesday i had to rush off back to manchester look i really am sorry but you can see i couldnt do anything about it cant you its me who should be sorry reed said to hear about your mother i mean yes well at least therell be no more suffering for her maybe we could get together in a few weeks sure just let me know when all right ive still got stuff to do you know things to organize how about if i call you back in a couple of weeks great ill look forward to it bye bye and im sorry terry really reed put the phone down and went to bed so that was it the mystery solved the following evening just after hed arrived home from work reed heard a loud knock at his door when he opened it he saw two strangers standing there at first he thought they were jehovahs witnesses who else came to the door in pairs wearing suits but these two didnt quite look the part true one did look a bit like a bible salesman chubby with a cheerful earnest expression on a face fringed by a neatly trimmed dark beard but the other painfully thin with a long pockmarked face looked more like an undertaker except for the way his sharp blue eyes glittered with intelligent suspicion mr reed mr terence j reed the cadaverous one said in a deep quiet voice just like the way reed imagined a real undertaker would speak and wasnt there a hint of the midlands nasal quality in the way he slurred the vowels yes im terry reed what is it what do you want reed could already see over their shoulders his neighbours spying from their windows little corners of white netcurtain twitched aside to give a clear view were police officers sir mind if we come in for a moment they flashed their identity cards but put them away before reed had time to see what was written there he backed into the hallway and they took their opportunity to enter as soon as they had closed the door behind them reed noticed the one with the beard start glancing around him taking everything in while the other continued to hold reeds gaze finally reed turned and led them into the living room he felt some kind of signal pass between them behind his back nice place youve got the thin one said while the other prowled the room picking up vases and looking inside opening drawers an inch or two then closing them again look what is this reed said is he supposed to be poking through my things i mean do you have a search warrant or something oh dont mind him the tall one said hes just like that insatiable curiosity by the way my names bentley detective superintendent bentley my colleague over there goes by the name of inspector rodmoor were from the midlands regional crime squad he looked to see reeds reactions as he said this but reed tried to show no emotion at all i still dont see what you want with me he said just routine said bentley mind if i sit down be my guest bentley sat in the rocker by the fireplace and reed sat opposite on the sofa a mug of halffinished coffee stood between them on the glasstopped table beside a couple of unpaid bills and the latest radio times would you like something to drink reed offered bentley shook his head what about him reed glanced over nervously towards inspector rodmoor who was looking through his bookcase pulling out volumes that caught his fancy and flipping through them bentley folded his hands on his lap just try to forget hes here but reed couldnt he kept flicking his eyes edgily from one to the other always anxious about what rodmoor was getting into next mr reed bentley went on were you in redditch on the evening of november last friday that was reed put his hand to his brow which was damp with sweat let me think now yes yes i believe i was why what sorry i asked why why were you in redditch what was the purpose of your visit he sounded like an immigration control officer at the airport reed thought i was there to meet an old university friend he answered ive been going down for a weekend once a year or so ever since he moved there and did you meet him as a matter of fact no i didnt reed explained the communications breakdown with francis bentley raised an eyebrow rodmoor rifled through the magazine rack by the fireplace but you still went there bentley persisted yes i told you i didnt know hed be away look do you mind telling me what this is about i think i have a right to know rodmoor fished a copy of mayfair out of the magazine rack and held it up for bentley to see bentley frowned and reached over for it the cover showed a shapely blonde in skimpy pink lace panties and camisole stockings and a suspender belt she was on her knees on a sofa and her round behind faced the viewer her face was also turned towards the camera and she looked as if shed just been licking her glossy red lips the thin strap of the camisole had slipped over her upper arm nice bentley said looks a bit young though dont you think reed shrugged he felt embarrassed and didnt know what to say bentley flipped through the rest of the magazine pausing over the colour spreads of naked women in fetching poses its not illegal you know reed burst out you can buy it in any newsagents its not pornography thats a matter of opinion isnt it sir said inspector rodmoor taking the magazine back from his boss and replacing it bentley smiled dont mind him lad he said hes a methodist now where were we reed shook his head do you own a car bentley asked no do you live here by yourself yes ever been married no girlfriends some but not to live with no magazines enough for you eh now just a minute sorry bentley said holding up his skeletal hand pretty tasteless of me that was out of line why couldnt reed quite believe the apology he sensed very strongly that bentley had made the remark on purpose to see how he would react he hoped hed passed the test you were going to tell me what all this was about was i why dont you tell me about what you did in redditch last friday evening first inspector rodmoor will join us here by the table and take notes no hurry take your time and slowly trying to remember all the details of that miserable washedout evening five days ago reed told them at one point bentley asked him what hed been wearing and inspector rodmoor asked if they might have a look at his raincoat and holdall when reed finished the heavy silence stretched on for seconds what were they thinking about he wondered were they trying to make up their minds about him what was he supposed to have done finally after they had asked him to go over one or two random points rodmoor closed his notebook and bentley got to his feet thatll be all for now sir for now we might want to talk to you again dont know have to check up on a few points first well just take the coat and the holdall with us if you dont mind sir inspector rodmoor will give you a receipt be available will you in his confusion reed accepted the slip of paper from rodmoor and did nothing to stop them taking his things im not planning on going anywhere if thats what you mean bentley smiled he looked like an undertaker consoling the bereaved good well well be off then and they walked towards the door arent you going to tell me what its all about reed asked again as he opened the door for them they walked out onto the path and it was inspector rodmoor who turned and frowned thats the funny thing about it sir he said that you dont seem to know believe me i dont rodmoor shook his head slowly anybody would think you dont read your papers and they walked down the path to their rover reed stood for a few moments watching the curtains opposite twitch and wondering what on earth rodmoor meant then he realized that the newspapers had been delivered as usual the past few days so they must have been in with magazines in the rack but he had been too disinterested too tired or too busy to read any of them he often felt like that news was more often than not depressing the last thing one needed on a wet weekend in carlisle quickly he shut the door on the gawping neighbours and hurried towards the magazine rack he didnt have far to look the item was on the front page of yesterdays paper under the headline midlands murder shock it read the quiet midlands town of redditch is still in shock today over the brutal slaying of schoolgirl debbie harrison debbie failed to arrive home after a late hockey practice on friday evening police found her partially clad body in an abandoned warehouse close to the town centre early saturday morning detective superintendent bentley in charge of the investigation told our reporter that police are pursuing some positive leads they would particularly like to talk to anyone who was in the area of the bus station and noticed a strange man hanging around the vicinity late that afternoon descriptions are vague so far but the man was wearing a light tan raincoat and carrying a blue holdall he read and reread the article in horror but what was even worse than the words was the photograph that accompanied it he couldnt be certain because it was a poor shot but he thought it was the schoolgirl with the long wavy hair and the socks around her ankles the one who had walked in front of him with her dumpy friend the most acceptable explanation of the police visit would be that they needed him as a possible witness but the truth was that the strange man hanging around the vicinity wearing a light tan raincoat and carrying a blue holdall was none other than himself terence j reed but how did they know hed been there the second time the police called reed was at work they marched right into the office brazen as brass and asked him if he could spare some time to talk to them down at the station bill only looked on curiously but frank the boss was hardly able to hide his irritation reed wasnt his favourite employee anyway he hadnt been turning enough profit lately nobody spoke during the journey and when they got to the station one of the local policemen pointed bentley towards a free interview room it was a bare place grey metal desk ashtray three chairs bentley sat opposite reed and inspector rodmoor sat in a corner out of his line of vision bentley placed the folder hed been carrying on the desk and smiled his funeral directors smile just a few further points terry hope i dont have to keep you long so do i reed said look i dont know whats going on but shouldnt i call my lawyer or something oh i dont think so it isnt as if weve charged you or anything youre simply helping us with our enquiries arent you besides do you actually have a solicitor most people dont come to think of it reed didnt have one he knew one though another old university friend had gone into law and practised nearby reed couldnt remember what he specialized in let me lay my cards on the table as it were bentley said spreading his hands on the desk you admit you were in redditch last friday evening to visit your friend weve been in touch with him by the way and he verifies your story what puzzles us is what you did between say four and eightthirty a number of people saw you at various times but theres at least an hour or more here and there that we cant account for ive already told you what i did bentley consulted the file he had set on the desk you ate at roughly six oclock is that right about then yes so you walked around redditch in the rain between five and six and between sixthirty and seven hardly a pleasant aesthetic experience id imagine i told you i was thinking things out i looked in shops got lost a couple of times did you happen to get lost in the vicinity of simmons street i dont know the street names of course not much of a street really more an alley it runs by a number of disused warehouses now wait a minute if youre trying to tie me in to that girls murder then youre way off beam perhaps i had better call a solicitor after all ah said bentley glancing over at rodmoor so you do read the papers i did after you left of course i did but not before id have known what you were on about then wouldnt i and while were on the subject how the hell did you find out i was in redditch that evening you used your credit card in the tandoori palace bentley said the waiter remembered you and looked up his records reed slapped the desk there that proves it if id done what you seem to be accusing me of id hardly have been as daft as to leave my calling card would i bentley shrugged criminals make mistakes just like everybody else otherwise wed never catch any and im not accusing you of anything at the moment you can see our problem though cant you your story sounds thin very thin i cant help that its the truth what state would you say you were in when you went into the tandoori palace state yes your condition reed shrugged i was wet i suppose a bit fed up i hadnt been able to get in touch with francis hungry too would you say you appeared agitated not really no but someone who didnt know you might just assume that you were i dont know maybe i was out of breath oh why well id been walking around for a long time carrying my holdall it was quite heavy yes of course so you were wet and breathless when you ate in the restaurant what about the pub you went into just after seven oclock what about it did you remain seated long i dont know what you mean did you just sit and sip your drink have a nice rest after a heavy meal and a long walk well i had to go the toilet of course and i tried phoning francis a few more times so you were up and down a bit like a yoyo eh but i had good reason i was stranded i desperately wanted to get in touch with my friend yes of course cast your mind back a bit earlier in the afternoon at about twenty past three you asked a woman what time the schools came out yes i i couldnt remember francis is a teacher so naturally i wanted to know if i was early or late it was starting to rain but youd visited him there before you said so hed picked you up at the same place several times i know i just couldnt remember if it was three oclock or four i know it sounds silly but its true dont you ever forget little things like that so you asked the woman on the bridge that was you yes look id hardly have done that would i if i mean like with the credit card id hardly have advertised my intentions if i was going to you know bentley raised a beetleblack eyebrow going to what terry reed ran his hands through his hair and rested his elbows on the desk it doesnt matter this is absurd ive done nothing im innocent dont you find schoolgirls attractive bentley went on in a soft voice after all it would only be natural wouldnt it they can be real beauties at fifteen or sixteen cant they proper little temptresses some of them ill bet right prickteasers just think about it short skirts bare legs firm young tits doesnt it excite you terry dont you get hard just thinking about it no it doesnt reed said tightly im not a pervert bentley laughed nobodys suggesting you are it gets me going i dont mind admitting perfectly normal id say to find a fifteenyearold schoolgirl sexy my methodist inspector might not agree but you and i know different terry dont we all that sweet innocence wrapped up in a soft desirable young body doesnt it just make your blood sing and wouldnt it be easy to get a bit carried away if she resisted put your hands around her throat no reed said again aware of his cheeks burning what about those women in the magazine terry the one we found at your house thats different dont tell me you buy it just for the stories i didnt say that im normal i like looking at naked women just like any other man some of them seemed very young to me for christs sake theyre models they get paid for posing like that i told you before that magazines freely available theres nothing illegal about it reed glanced over his shoulder at rodmoor who kept his head bent impassively over his notebook and you like videos too dont you weve had a little talk with mr hakim in your corner shop he told us about one video in particular youve rented lately soft porn i suppose youd call it nothing illegal true at least not yet but a bit dodgy id wonder about a bloke who watches stuff like that its a free country im a normal single male i have a right to watch whatever kind of videos i want schools out bentley said quietly a bit over the top wouldnt you say but they werent real schoolgirls the lead was thirty if she was a day besides i only rented it out of curiosity i thought it might be a bit of a laugh and was it i cant remember but you see what i mean dont you it looks bad the subjectmatter the image it all looks a bit odd fishy well its not im perfectly innocent and thats the truth bentley stood up abruptly and rodmoor slipped out of the room you can go now the superintendent said its been nice to have a little chat thats it for the moment yes but dont leave town bentley laughed you really must give up those american cop shows though its a wonder you find time to watch them with all those naughty videos you rent they warp your sense of reality cop shows and sex films life isnt like that at all thank you ill bear that in mind reed said i take it i am free to go of course bentley gestured towards the door reed left he was shaking when he got out onto the wet chilly street thank god the pubs were still open he went into the first one he came to and ordered a double scotch usually he wasnt much of a spirits drinker but these he reminded himself as the fiery liquor warmed his belly were unusual circumstances he knew he should go back to work but he couldnt face it bills questions franks obvious disapproval no he ordered another double and after hed finished that he went home for the afternoon the first thing he did when he got into the house was tear up the copy of mayfair and burn the pieces in the fireplace one by one after that he tore up his video club membership card and burned that too damn hakim terence j reed it is my duty to arrest you for the murder of deborah susan harrison reed couldnt believe this was happening not to him the world began to shimmer and fade before his eyes and the next thing he knew rodmoor was bent over him offering a glass of water a benevolent smile on his bible salesmans face the next few days were a nightmare reed was charged and held until his trial date could be set there was no chance of bail given the seriousness of his alleged crime he had no money anyway and no close family to support him he had never felt so alone in his life as he did those long dark nights in the cell nothing terrible happened none of the things hed heard about in films and documentaries he wasnt sodomized nor was he forced to perform fellatio at knife point he wasnt even beaten up mostly he was left alone in the dark with his fears he felt all the certainties of his life slip away from him almost to the point where he wasnt even sure of the truth any more guilty or innocent the more he proclaimed his innocence the less people seemed to believe him had he done it he might have done he felt like an inflatable doll full of nothing but air manoeuvred into awkward positions by forces he could do nothing about he had no control over his life any more not only couldnt he come and go as he pleased he couldnt even think for himself any more solicitors and barristers and policemen did that for him and in the cell in the dark everything seemed to close in on him and some nights he had to struggle for breath when the trial date finally arrived reed felt relief at least he could breathe in the large airy courtroom and soon it would be all over one way or another in the crowded court reed sat still as stone in the dock steadily chewing the edges of his newly grown beard he heard the evidence against him all circumstantial all convincing if the police surgeon had found traces of semen in the victim an expert explained then they could have tried for a genetic match with the defendants dna and that would have settled reeds guilt or innocence once and for all but in this case it wasnt so easy there had been no seminal fluid found in the dead girl the forensics people speculated from the state of her body that the killer had tried to rape her found he was impotent and strangled her in his ensuing rage a woman called maggie with whom reed had had a brief fling a year or so ago was brought onto the stand the defendant had been impotent with her it was established on several occasions towards the end of their relationship and he had become angry about it more than once using more and more violent means to achieve sexual satisfaction once he had gone so far as to put his hands around her throat well yes he had hed been worried during the time with maggie he had been under a lot of stress at work drinking too much as well and he hadnt been able to get it up so what happens to everyone and shed wanted it like that too the rough way putting his hands around her throat had been her idea something shed got from a kinky book shed read and hed gone along with her because she told him it might cure his impotence now she made the whole sordid episode sound much worse than it had been she also admitted she had been just eighteen at the time as well and as he remembered shed said she was twentythree besides he had been impotent and violent only with maggie they could have brought on any number of other women to testify to his gentleness and virility though no doubt if they did he thought his promiscuity would count just as much against him what did he have to do to appear as normal as he needed to be as he had once thought he was the witnesses for the prosecution all arose to testify against reed like the spirits from virgils world of the dead though they were still alive they seemed more like spirits to him insubstantial unreal the woman from the bridge identified him as the shiftylooking person who had asked her what time the schools came out the indian waiter and the landlord of the pub told how agitated reed had looked and acted that evening other people had spotted him in the street apparently following the murdered girl and her friend mr hakim was there to tell the court what kind of videos reed had rented lately including schools out and even bill told how his colleague used to make remarks about the schoolgirls passing by you know hed get all excited about glimpsing a bit of black knicker when the wind blew their skirts up it just seemed like a bit of a lark i thought nothing of it at the time then he shrugged and gave reed a pitying look and as if all that werent enough there was maggie a shabby dido refusing to look at him as she told the court of the way he had abused and abandoned her towards the end of the prosecution case even reeds barrister was beginning to look depressed he did his best in crossexamination but the damnedest thing was that they were all telling the truth or their versions of it yes mr hakim admitted other people had rented the same videos yes he might have even watched some of them himself but the fact remained that the man on trial was terence j reed and reed had recently rented a video called schools out the kind of thing ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you wouldnt want to find your husbands or sons watching reed could understand members of the victims community appearing against him and he could even comprehend maggies hurt pride but why hakim and bill what had he ever done to them had they never really liked him it went on and on a nightmare of distorted truth reed felt as if he had been set up in front of a funfair mirror and all the jurors could see was his warped and twisted reflection im innocent he kept telling himself as he gripped the rail but his knuckles turned whiter and whiter and his voice grew fainter and fainter hadnt bill joined in the remarks about schoolgirls wasnt it all in the spirit of fun yes of course but bill wasnt in the dock it was terence j reed who stood accused of killing an innocent fifteenyearold schoolgirl he had been in the right place at the right time and he had passed remarks on the budding breasts and milky thighs of the girls who had crossed the road in front of their office every day then the morning before the defence case was about to open reed himself was set to go into the dock and not at all sure by now what the truth was a strange thing happened bentley and rodmoor came softly into the courtroom tiptoed up to the judge and began to whisper then the judge appeared to ask them questions they nodded rodmoor looked in reeds direction after a few minutes of this the two men took seats and the judge made a motion for the dismissal of all charges against the accused pandemonium broke out in court reporters dashed for phones and the spectators gallery buzzed with speculation amidst it all terry reed got to his feet realized what had happened if not how and promptly collapsed nervous exhaustion the doctor said and not surprising after the ordeal reed had been through complete rest was the only cure when reed felt well enough a few days after the trial had ended in uproar his solicitor dropped by to tell him what had happened apparently another schoolgirl had been assaulted in the same area only this one had proved more than a match for her attacker she had fought tooth and nail to hang onto her life and in doing so had managed to pick up a half brick and crack the mans skull with it he hadnt been seriously injured but hed been unconscious long enough for the girl to get help when he was arrested the man had confessed to the murder of debbie harrison he had known details not revealed in the papers after a nightlong interrogation police officers had no doubt whatsoever that he was telling the truth which meant reed couldnt possibly be guilty hence motion for dismissal end of trial reed was a free man again he stayed at home for three weeks hardly venturing out of the house except for food and even then he always went further afield for it than hakims his neighbours watched him walk by their faces pinched with disapproval as if he were some kind of monster in their midst he almost expected them to get up a petition to force him out of his home during that time he heard not one word of apology from the undertaker and the bible salesman francis still had stuff to do things to organize and camilles answering machine seemed permanently switched on at night reed suffered claustrophobic nightmares of prison he couldnt sleep well and even the mild sleeping pills the doctor gave him didnt really help the bags grew heavier and darker under his eyes some days he wandered the city in a dream not knowing where he was going or when he got there how he had arrived the only thing that sustained him the only pure innocent untarnished thing in his entire life was when debbie harrison visited him in his dreams she was alive then just as she had been when he saw her for the first and only time and he felt no desire to rob her of her innocence only to partake of it himself she smelled of apples in autumn and everything they saw and did together became a source of pure wonder when she smiled his heart almost broke with joy at the end of the third week reed trimmed his beard got out his suit and went in to work in the office he was met with an embarrassed silence from bill and a redundancy cheque from frank who thrust it at him without a word of explanation reed shrugged pocketed the cheque and left every time he went into town strangers stared at him in the street and whispered about him in pubs mothers held more tightly onto their daughters hands when he passed them by in the shopping centres he seemed to have become quite a celebrity in his home town at first he couldnt think why then one day he plucked up the courage to visit the library and look up the newspapers that had been published during his trial what he found was total character annihilation nothing less when the headline about the capture of the real killer came out it could have made no difference at all the damage had already been done to reeds reputation and it was permanent he might have been found innocent of the girls murder but he had been found guilty too guilty of being a sick consumer of pornography of being obsessed with young girls unable to get it up without the aid of a struggle on the part of the female none of it was true of course but somehow that didnt matter it had been made so as it is written so let it be and to cap it all his photograph had appeared almost every day both with and without the beard there could be very few people in england who would fail to recognize him in the street reed stumbled outside into the hazy afternoon it was warming up towards spring but the air was moist and grey with rain so fine it was closer to mist the pubs were still open so he dropped by the nearest one and ordered a double scotch the other customers looked at him suspiciously as he sat hunched in his corner eyes bloodshot and puffy from lack of sleep gaze directed sharply inwards standing on the bridge in the misty rain an hour later reed couldnt remember making the actual decision to throw himself over the side but he knew that was what he had to do he couldnt even remember how he had ended up on this particular bridge or the route hed taken from the pub he had thought drinking his third double scotch that maybe he should go away and rebuild his life perhaps abroad but that didnt ring true as a solution life is what you have to live with what you are and now his life was what it had become or what it had been turned into it was what being in the wrong place at the wrong time had made it and that was what he had to live with the problem was he couldnt live with it therefore he had to die he couldnt actually see the river below everything was grey but he knew it was there the river eden it was called reed laughed harshly to himself it wasnt his fault that the river that runs through carlisle is called the eden he thought it was just one of lifes little ironies twentyfive to four on a wet wednesday afternoon nobody about now was as good a time as any just as he was about to climb onto the parapet a figure emerged from the mist it was the first girl on her way home from school her grey pleated skirt swished around her long slim legs and her socks hung over her ankles under her green blazer the misty rain had wet the top of her white blouse so much that it stuck to her chest reed gazed at her in awe her long blonde hair had darkened and curled in the rain sticking in strands over her cheek there were tears in his eyes he moved away from the parapet as she neared him she smiled shyly innocence reed stood before her in the mist and held his hands out crying like a baby hello he said murder in utopia i had just finished cauterizing the stump of ezekiel metcalfes left arm which i had had to amputate after it was shredded in one of the combing machines when young billy ratcliffe came running in to tell me that a man had fallen over the weir believing my medical skills might be required i left my assistant benjamin to take care of ezekiel and tried to keep up with young billy as he led me down victoria road at a breakneck pace i was not an old man at that time but i fear i had led a rather sedentary life and i was panting by the time we passed the allotment gardens in front of the mill a little more slowly now we crossed the railway lines and the canal before arriving at the castiron bridge that spanned the river aire several men had gathered on the bridge and they were looking down into the water some of them pointing at a dark shape that seemed to bob and twist in the current as soon as i got my first look at the scene i knew that none of my skills would be of any use to the poor soul whose coat had snagged on a tree root poking out from the river bank did anyone see him fall i asked they all shook their heads i picked a couple of stout lads and led them down through the bushes to the river bank with a little manoeuvring they were able to lie on their bellies and reach over the shallow edge to grab hold of an arm each slowly they raised the dripping body from the water when they had completed their task a gasp arose from the crowd on the bridge though his white face was badly marked with cuts and bruises there could be hardly a person present who didnt recognize richard ellerby one of sir titus salts chief wool buyers saltaire where the events of which i am about to speak occurred in the spring of was then a model village a mill workers utopia of some four or five thousand souls built by sir titus salt in the valley of the river aire between leeds and bradford the village laid out in a simple grid system still stands looking much the same as it did then across the railway lines a little to the southwest of the colossal sixstorey woollen mill to which it owes its existence as there was no crime in utopia no police force was required and we relied on constables from nearby townships in the unlikely event that any real unpleasantness or unrest should arise there was certainly no reason to suspect foul play in richard ellerbys death but legal procedures must be followed in all cases where the circumstances of death are not immediately apparent my name is dr william oulton and i was then employed by the saltaire hospital both as a physician and as a scientist conducting research into the link between raw wool and anthrax i also acted as coroner therefore i took it as my responsibility to enquire into the facts of richard ellerbys death in this case i also had a personal interest as the deceased was a close acquaintance of mine and i had dined with him and his charming wife caroline on a number of occasions richard and i both belonged to the saltaire institute sir tituss enlightened alternative to the evils of public houses and we often attended chambermusic concerts there together played a game of billiards or relaxed in the smoking room where we had on occasion discussed the possible health problems associated with importing wool i wouldnt say i knew richard well he was in many ways reserved and private in my company but i knew him to be an honest and industrious man who believed wholeheartedly in sir tituss vision my postmortem examination the following day indicated only that richard ellerby had enough water in his lungs to support a verdict of death by drowning let me repeat there was no reason whatsoever to suspect foul play people had fallen over the weir and died in this way before assault and murder were crimes that rarely crossed the minds of the denizens of utopia that the back of richards skull was fractured and that his face and body were covered with scratches and bruises could easily be explained by the tumble he took over the weir it was may and the thaw had created a spate of meltwater which thundered down from its sources high in the pennines with such force as easily to cause those injuries i witnessed on the body of course there could be another explanation and that perhaps was why i was loath to let matters stand if you have imagined from my tone that i was less fully convinced of saltaires standing as a latterday utopia than some of my contemporaries then you may compliment yourself on your sensitivity to the nuances of the english language as i look back on those days though i wonder if i am not allowing my present opinions to cloud the glass through which i peer at the past perhaps a little i do know that i certainly believed in sir tituss absolute commitment to the idea but i also think that even back then after only thirty years on this earth i had seen far too much of human nature to believe in utopias like saltaire besides i had another quality that would not permit me to let things rest if i were a cat believe me i would be dead by now nine lives notwithstanding it was another fine morning when i left benjamin in charge of the ward rounds and stepped out of the hospital on a matter that had been occupying my mind for the past two days the almshouses over the road made a pretty sight set back behind their broad swathe of grass a few pensioners sat on the benches smoking their pipes under trees bearing pink and white blossoms men of good moral character they benefited from sir tituss largesse to the extent of free accommodation and a pension of seven shillings and six pence per week but only as long as they continued to show their good moral character charity after all is not for everyone but only for those who merit it lest you think i was a complete cynic at such an early age i must admit that i found much to admire about saltaire unlike the cramped airless and filthy backtoback slums of bradford where i myself had seen ten or more people sharing a dark dank cellar that flooded every time it rained saltaire was designed as an open and airy environment the streets were all paved and well drained avoiding the filthy conditions that breed disease each house had its own outdoor lavatory which was cleared regularly again averting the possibility of sickness caused by the sharing of such facilities sir titus also insisted on special measures to reduce the output of smoke from the mill so that we didnt live under a pall of suffocating fumes and our pretty sandstone houses were not crusted over with a layer of grime still there is a price to pay for everything and in saltaire it was the sense of constantly living out another mans moral vision i turned left on titus street passing by the house with the spy tower on top this extra room was almost all windows like the top of a lighthouse and i had often spotted a shadowy figure up there rumour has it that sir titus employed a man with a telescope to survey the village to look for signs of trouble and report any infringements to him i thought i saw someone up there as i passed but it could have been a trick of sunlight on the glass several women had hung out their washing to dry across ada street as usual though everyone knew that sir titus frowned on this practice indeed he had generously provided public wash houses in an attempt to discourage it this was their little way of asserting their independence of cocking a snook at authority as befitted a wool buyer richard ellerby had lived with his wife and two children in one of the grander houses on albert road facing westwards away from the mill towards the open country according to local practice after bereavement the upstairs curtains were drawn i knocked on the door and waited caroline ellerby opened it herself wearing her widows black and bade me enter she was a handsome woman but today her skin was pale and her eyes redrimmed from weeping when i was seated in her spacious living room she asked me if i would care for a small sherry while sir titus would allow no public houses in saltaire convinced that they encouraged vice idleness and profligacy he held no objection to people serving alcohol in their own homes indeed he was known to keep a wellstocked wine cellar himself on this occasion i declined citing the earliness of the hour and the volume of work awaiting me back at the hospital caroline ellerby smoothed her voluminous black skirts and sat on the chesterfield after i had expressed my sorrow over her loss and she had inclined her head in acceptance i moved on to the business that had been occupying my thoughts i need to ask you a few questions about richards accident i explained to her only if that is you feel up to answering them of course she said folding her hands on her lap please continue when did you last see your husband the evening before before he was discovered he was away from the house all night she nodded but surely you must have noticed he was missing i realized i was perhaps on the verge of being offensive or even well beyond the verge but the matter puzzled me and when things puzzle me i worry away at them until they yield a solution i could no more help myself than a tiger can change its stripes i took a sleeping draught she said im afraid i wouldnt have woken up if youd set me down in the weaving shed given that the weaving shed contained twelve hundred power looms all thrumming and clattering at once i suspected caroline of hyperbole but she got her point across believe me she went on i have been tormenting myself ever since if i hadnt taken the sleeping draught if i had noticed he hadnt come home if i had tried to find him it wouldnt have helped caroline i said his death must have been very swift there was nothing you could have done theres no use torturing yourself youre very kind but even so when did you notice that richard hadnt come home not until george walker from the office came to tell me i paused before going on uncertain how to soften my line of enquiry caroline believe me i dont mean to pry unnecessarily or to cause you any distress but do you have any idea where richard went that night she seemed puzzled at my question went why he went to the travellers rest of course out on the otley road it was my turn to be surprised i thought i had known richard ellerby but i didnt know he was a frequenter of public houses the subject had simply never come up between us the travellers rest did he go there often not often no but he enjoyed the atmosphere of a good tavern on occasion according to richard the travellers rest was a respectable establishment i had no reason not to believe him of course not i knew of the place and had certainly heard nothing to blacken its character you seem puzzled dr oulton only because your husband never mentioned it to me caroline summoned up a brief smile richard comes from humble origins as im sure you know he has worked very hard both in bradford and here at saltaire to achieve the elevated position he has attained he is a great believer in mr samuel smiles and his doctrine of selfhelp despite his personal success and advancement though he is not a snob he has never lost touch with his origins richard enjoys the company of his fellow working men in the cheery atmosphere of a good tavern that is all i nodded there was nothing unusual in that i myself ventured to the shoulder of mutton up on the bingley road on occasion after all the village was not intended as a prison it was beginning to dawn on me though that richard probably assumed i was above such things as public houses because i was a member of the professional classes or that i disapproved of them on health grounds because i was a doctor i felt a pang of regret that we had never been able to get together over a pipe and a pint of ale now that he was dead we never would did he ever overindulge i went on i ask only because im searching for a reason for what happened if richard had perhaps had too much to drink that night and missed his footing caroline pursed her lips and frowned deep in thought for a moment ill not say hes never had a few too many she admitted but i can say that he was not in the habit of overindulging and there was nothing on his mind nothing that might tempt him to have more than his share that night there were many things on richards mind especially as regarded his work but nothing unusual nothing that would drive him to drink of that i can assure you she paused dr oulton is there anything else im afraid im very tired even with the sleeping draught the past couple of nights im sure you can understand ive had to send the children to mothers i just cant handle them at the moment i got to my feet of course youve been a great help already just one small thing she tilted her head yes did richard have any enemies enemies no not that i know of surely you cant be suggesting someone did this to him i dont know caroline i just dont know thats the problem please stay where you are ill see myself out as i walked back to the hospital i realized that was the problem i didnt know i also found myself wondering what on earth richard was doing by the weir if he was coming home from the travellers rest the canal towpath would certainly be an ideal route to the tavern and back but the river was north of the canal and richard ellerbys house was south on my way to the travellers rest that evening i considered the theory that richard might have attracted the attention of a villain or a group of villains who had subsequently followed him robbed him and tossed his body over the weir the only problem with my theory as far as i could see was that he still had several gold sovereigns in his pocket and no selfrespecting thieves would have overlooked a haul that big as it turned out the travellers rest was as respectable a tavern as richard had told his wife and as cheery a one as i could have hoped for after my gloomy thoughts it certainly didnt seem to be a haunt of cutpurses and ruffians on the contrary the gaslit public bar was full of warm laughter and conversation and i recognized several groups of mill workers many of whom i had treated for one minor ailment or another some of them looked up surprised to see me there and muttered sheepish hellos others were brash and greeted me more loudly taking my presence as an endorsement of their own indulgence jack liversedge was there sitting alone in a corner nursing his drink my heart went out to him poor jack had been severely depressed ever since he lost his wife to anthrax two months before and there seemed nothing anyone could do to console him he didnt even look up when i entered i made my way to the bar and engaged the landlords attention he was a plump man with a veined red nose rather like a radish which seemed to me to indicate that he was perhaps a whit too fond of his own product he nodded a crisp greeting and i asked for a pint of ale when i had been served noticing a slight lull in business i introduced myself and asked him if he remembered richard ellerbys last visit once i had described my late colleague he said that he did proper gentleman mr ellerby was sir i were right sorry to hear about what happened i was wondering if anything unusual happened that evening unusual did he drink too much no sir two or three ales thats his limit so he wasnt drunk when he left here unsteady in his gait no sir excuse me a moment he went to serve another customer then came back no sir i cant say as ive ever seen mr ellerby inebriated were there any rough elements in here that night he shook his head any rough elements i send packing up to the feathers on the leeds road thats a proper rough sort of place that is but this is a respectable establishment he leaned forward across the bar ill tell thee summat for nowt if mr salt wont have public houses in his village theres no better place for his workers to pass an hour or two than the travellers rest and thats gods honest truth im sure youre right i said but surely things must get a little out of hand on occasion he laughed nothing i cant handle and youre sure nothing strange happened the last night mr ellerby was here youd be better off asking him over there about that he nodded towards jack liversedge who seemed engaged in a muttered dispute with himself ive as much pity as the next man for a fellow whos lost his wife poor beggar but the way hes carrying on he shook his head what happened they got into a bit of a barney what about he shrugged i heard mr liversedge call mr ellerby no better than a murderer then he finished his drink and walked out how much longer before mr ellerby left five minutes mebbe not long i mulled this over as he excused himself to serve more customers jack liversedges wife florence a wool sorter had died of anthrax two months ago it is a terrible disease and one we were only slowly coming to understand through my own research i had been in correspondence with two important scientists working in the field m casimirjoseph davaine in france and herr robert koch in germany thus far we had been able to determine that the disease is caused by living microorganisms most likely hiding in the alpaca wool of the south american llamas and the mohair of the angora goats both of which sir titus imported to make his fine cloths but we were a long way from finding a prevention or a cure as i sipped my ale and looked at jack liversedge i began to wonder richard ellerby was a wool buyer had jack in his distraught and confused state considered him culpable of florences death certainly from what i had seen and heard of jacks erratic behaviour since her death it was possible and he was a big strong fellow i was just about to go over to him without having any clear plan in mind of what to say when he seemed to come to a pause in his argument with himself slammed his tankard down and left bumping into several people on his way out i decided to go after him i followed jack down the stone steps to the towpath and called out his name at which he turned and asked who i was i introduced myself ah he said tis thee doctor the towpath was unlit but the canal was straight and the light of a threequarter moon lay on the still water like a shroud it was enough to enable us to see our way i saw you in the travellers rest i said you seemed upset i thought we might share the walk home if thats all right as you will we walked in silence all the while growing closer to the mill which rose ahead in the silvery light a ghostly block of sandstone against the black starlit sky i didnt know how to broach the subject that was on my mind fearing that if i were right jack would put up a fight and if i were wrong he would be justly offended finally i decided to muddle along as best i could i hear richard ellerby was in the travellers the other night jack is that so yes i hear you argued with him mebbe i did what was it about jack did you get into a fight with him jack paused on the path to face me and for a moment i thought he was going to come at me i braced myself but nothing happened the mill loomed over his shoulder i could see a number of emotions cross his features in the moonlight from fear and sorrow to finally resignation he seemed somehow relieved that i had asked him about richard he were the wool buyer werent he he said with gritted anger in his voice he shouldve known i sighed oh jack nobody could have known he just buys the wool there are no tests theres no way of knowing its not right he bought the wool that killed her someone had to pay he turned his back to me and walked on i followed we got to the bottom of victoria road and i could hear the weir roaring to our right jack walked to the castiron bridge where he stood gazing into the rushing water i went and stood beside him and whose place is it to decide who pays jack i asked raising my voice over the waters roar whose job do you think it is to play god yours he looked at me with pity and contempt then shook his head and said you dont understand i looked down into the water its foam tipped with moonlight did you kill him i asked did you kill richard ellerby because you blamed him for florences death he said nothing for a moment then gave a brief jerky nod there he were he said standing there in his finest coat drinking and laughing while my florence were rotting in her grave how did it happen i told him he were no better than a murderer buying up wool that kills people i mean it werent the first time were it he said it werent his fault that nobody couldve known then when i told him he should take more care he said i didnt understand that it were just a hazard of the job like and that she shouldve known she were taking a risk before she took it on if richard really had spoken that way to jack then he had certainly been guilty of exhibiting a gross insensitivity i had not suspected to be part of his character even if that was the case we are all capable of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time especially if we are pushed as far as jack probably pushed richard what he had done had certainly not justified his murder how did it happen jack i asked him after a short pause he said i waited for him on the towpath all the way home we argued and in the end i lost my temper there were a long bit of wood from a packing crate or summat by the bushes he turned his back on me and started walking away i picked it up and clouted him and down he went but why the weir i realized what id done he gave a harsh laugh its funny you know especially now it doesnt matter but back then when id just done it when i knew id killed a man i panicked i thought if i threw his body over the weir then people would think hed fallen it werent far and he werent a heavy man he wasnt dead jack i said he had water in his lungs that meant he was alive when he went into the water its no matter said jack one way or another it was me who killed him the water roared in my ears jack turned towards me i flinched and stepped back again thrusting my arm out to keep him at a distance he shook his head slowly tears in his eyes and spoke so softly i had to strain to hear him nay doctor youve nowt to fear from me its me whos got summat to fear from you i shook my head i really didnt know what to do and my heart was still beating fast from the fear that he had been going to tip me over the railing well he said all i ask is that you leave it till morning one more night in the house me and florence shared will you do that for me at least doctor as i nodded numbly he turned and began to walk away early the following morning after a miserable night spent tossing and turning grappling with my conscience i was summoned from the hospital to the works office building attached to the west side of the mill i hurried down victoria road wondering what on earth it could be about and soon found myself ushered into a large wellappointed office with a thick turkish carpet dark wainscoting and a number of local landscapes hanging on the walls sitting behind the huge mahogany desk was sir titus himself still a grand imposing figure despite his years and his declining health dr oulton he said without looking up from his papers please sit down i wondered what had brought him the twelve miles or so from crows nest where he lived he rarely appeared at the mill in those days i understand he said in his deep commanding voice still not looking at me that you have been enquiring into the circumstances surrounding richard ellerbys death i nodded yes sir titus and what pray have you discovered i took a deep breath then told him everything as i spoke he stood up clasped his hands behind his back and paced the room head hanging so that his grey beard almost reached his waist though his cheeks and eyes looked sunken as if he was ill his presence dominated the room when i had finished he sat down again and treated me to a long silence before he said and what are we going to do about it the police will have to be notified as yet then you and i are the only ones who know the full truth and jack himself yes of course sir titus stroked his beard i could hear the muffled noise of the mill and feel the vibrations of the power looms shaking the office it was a warm day and despite the open window the room was stuffy i felt the sweat gather on my brow and upper lip i gazed out of the window and saw the weir where richard ellerby had met his death this is not good sir titus said finally not good at all sir he gestured with his arm to take in the whole of saltaire what i mean dr oulton is that this could be very bad for the village very bad do you have faith in the experiment the experiment sir the moral experiment that is saltaire i have never doubted your motive in wanting to do good sir sir titus managed a thin smile a very revealing answer another long silence followed he got up and started pacing again if a man visits a public house and becomes so intoxicated that he falls in a river and drowns then that is an exemplary tale for all of us wouldnt you say i would sir and if a man after visiting a public house is followed by a group of ruffians who attack him rob him and throw him in a river to drown then again we have an exemplary nay a cautionary tale do we not we do sir but richard ellerby wasnt robbed he waved his hand impatiently yes yes of course i know that im merely thinking out loud please forgive an old man his indulgence this place saltaire means the world to me dr oulton can you understand that the world i think i can sir its not just a matter of profits though ill not deny its profitable enough but i think i have created something unique i call it my experiment of course yet for others it is a home a way of life at least i hope it is it was my aim to make saltaire everything bradford was not it was designed to nurture selfimprovement decency orderly behaviour and good health among my workers i wanted to prove that making my own fortune was not incompatible with the material and spiritual wellbeing of the working classes i saw it as my duty my godgiven duty if the lord looks so favourably upon me then i take that as an obligation to look favourably upon my workers do you follow me yes sir and now this murder manslaughter call it what you will it disrupts the fabric of things it could destroy any trust that might have built up in the community no doubt you remember the troubles we had over anthrax some years ago i do sir in a man called sutcliffe rhodes had garnered much support from the village in his campaign against anthrax and sir titus had been seriously embarrassed by the whole matter but surely you cant expect me to ignore what i know sir i said to lie sir titus smiled grimly i could never ask a man to go against his beliefs doctor all i ask is that you follow the dictates of your own conscience but that you please bear in mind the consequences if this issue surfaces again especially in this way then were done for nobody will believe in the goodness of saltaire any more and i meant it to be a good place a place where there would never be any reason for murder to occur he shook his head in sadness and let the silence stretch again above the noise of the mill i suddenly heard men shouting someone hammered on the door and dashed into the office without ceremony i couldnt be certain but my first impression was that it was the same shadowy figure i had seen in the spy tower sir titus the interloper said after a quick bow my apologies for barging in like this but you must come theres a man on the mill roof sir titus and i frowned at one another then we followed him outside i walked slowly in deference to sir tituss age and it took us several minutes to get around to the allotment gardens from where we had a clear view the man stood atop the mill roof full six storeys up between its two decorative lanterns i could also make out another figure inside one of the lanterns perhaps talking to him but the man on the roof didnt appear to be listening he stood right at the edge and even as we watched he spread out his arms as if attempting to fly then he sprang off the roof and seemed to hover in the air for a moment before falling with a thud to the forecourt it was a curious sensation though i knew in my heart and mind that i was witnessing the death of a fellow human being there was a distant quality about the event the figure was dwarfed by the mill for a start and just in front of us a dog scratched at the dirt as if digging for its bone and it didnt cease during the mans entire fall to earth a mill hand came running up and told us that the man who had jumped was jack liversedge again it was an eerie feeling but i suppose in a way i already knew that an accident and a suicide muttered sir titus fixing me with his deepset eyes its bad enough but we can weather it wouldnt you say doctor there was hope in his voice my jaw tensed i was tempted to tell him to go to hell that his vision his experiment wasnt worth lying for but i saw in front of me a sick old man who had at least tried to do something for the people who made him rich whether it was enough or not was not for me to say saltaire wasnt perfect perfection is a state we will never find on this earth but it was better than most mill towns swallowing my bile i gave sir titus a curt nod and set off back up victoria road to the hospital in the days and weeks that followed i tried to continue with my work after all the people of saltaire still needed a hospital and a doctor but after jack liversedges pointless death my heart just didnt seem to be in it any more jacks dramatic suicide lowered the morale of the town for a short while there were long faces everywhere and some mutterings of dissent but eventually it was forgotten and the townspeople threw themselves back into their work weaving fine cloths of alpaca and mohair for those wealthy enough to be able to afford them still no matter how much i tried to convince myself to put the matter behind me and carry on i felt there was something missing from the community something more than a mere man had died the day jack killed himself one day after i had spent a wearying few hours tending to one of the wool sorters dying of anthrax i made my decision to leave a month later after sorting out my affairs and helping my replacement settle in i left saltaire for south africa where i eventually met the woman who was to become my wife we raised our three children and i practised my profession in cape town for thirty years after my retirement we decided to move back to england where we settled comfortably in a small cornish fishing village now my children are grown up married and gone away my wife is dead and i am an old man who spends his days wandering the cliffs above the sea watching the birds soar and dip and sometimes the sound of the waves reminds me of the roar of the saltaire weir more than forty years have now passed since that night by the weir when jack liversedge told me he had killed richard ellerby more than forty years have passed since sir titus and i stood by the allotments and saw jacks body fall and break on the forecourt of the mill forty years long enough to keep a secret besides the world has changed so much since then that what happened that day long ago in saltaire seems of little consequence now sir titus died three years after jacks fall and his dream died with him fashions changed and the ladies no longer wanted the bright radiant fabrics that sir titus had produced his son titus junior struggled with the business until he too died in and the mill was taken over by a consortium of bradford businessmen today saltaire is no longer a moral experiment or a mill workers utopia it is merely another business and today in july nobody believes in utopias any more not safe after dark he had only gone out to the convenience store for cigarettes but the park across the intersection looked inviting it seemed to offer a brief escape from the heat and dirt and noise of the city cars whooshed by radios blasting rock and funk and rap into the hot summer night street lights and coloured neons looked smeared and blurry in the humid heat a walk among the trees by the lake might cool him down a little he knew he shouldnt knew it was dangerous what was it the guidebooks always said about big city parks not safe after dark that was it no matter which park they talked about central park golden gate park they were always not safe after dark he wondered why parks were quiet peaceful places a few acres of unspoilt nature in the heart of the city people took their dogs for walks children played on swings and teetertotters parks provided retreats for meditation and the contemplation of nature surely not playgrounds for the corrupt and the delinquent there was more danger he thought among the dregs of humanity that haunted the vast urban sex and drug supermarkets like times square or the tenderloin there you got mugged beaten up raped even murdered for no good reason at all hoodlums and thugs werent into nature they were happier idling on street corners harassing passersby starting fights in strip clubs or rock bars and selling drugs in garbagestrewn alleys if they wanted to mug someone they had more chance downtown where the crowds were thick and some fool always took a short cut down a dark alley if they just wanted to scare and hurt people for the fun of it crowded places like shopping malls guaranteed them both the victims and the audience or so he found himself reasoning as he stood there by the traffic lights should he risk it over the road the dark tangled mass of branches tossed in the hot breeze like billowing black smoke against the starlit sky a yellowish full moon surrounded by a halo gilded the tree tops the traffic lights changed to green and after only a moments hesitation he began to cross why not what could possibly happen the entrance a long treelined avenue seemed rolled out like a tongue ready to lick him up and draw him into the parks dark mouth maybe he had a death wish though he didnt think so muted wroughtiron street lamps flanked the broad cinder path which led under a small imitation arc de triomphe gate overgrown with weeds and lichen beyond that the branches swayed slowly in the muggy gusts leaves making a wet hissing sound the dimly lit path he noticed was lined with statues he went over to see if he could make out any of the names writers shakespeare sir walter scott tennyson wordsworth what on earth were they doing there the avenue ended at a small boating pool in the water a childs yacht with a white sail turned in slow circles the sight brought a lump to his throat he didnt know why but somewhere perhaps buried deep in his memories was just such a feeling of loss or of drifting aimlessly in circles never arriving it made him feel suddenly inexplicably sad beyond the pond the park stretched rising and falling down to the lake here were no broad avenues only tarmac paths and dirt trails he took one of the main paths that wound deeper into the woods he could always take a side path later if he wanted so far he had seen no one and the traffic from the main road sounded more and more distant behind him it was much darker now away from the dim antique lights of the entrance only the jaundiced and hazeshrouded moon shone through the trees and slicked the path with oily gold but as he walked he found his eyes soon adjusted at least he could make out shapes if not details after he had been walking a few minutes he noticed a playground to his left there was nobody in it at this time of night but one of the swings was rocking back and forth gently in the wind creaking where its chains needed greasing he felt like sitting on one of the wooden seats and shooting himself high aiming his feet at the moon but it would only draw unwelcome attention just being here was supposed to be dangerous enough without asking for trouble somewhere back on the road he heard the whine of a police siren off to the right a path wound up the hillside between the trees he took it it was some kind of fitness trail every so often he could make out wooden chin bars where the joggers were encouraged to pause and do a few pullups occasionally he would hear a scuttling sound in the undergrowth at first it scared him but he figured it was only a harmless squirrel or a chipmunk running away the path straightened out at the top of the short hill and almost before he knew it he was in a clearing surrounded by trees he thought he heard a different sound now a low moan or a sigh he pulled back quickly behind a tree in the clearing stood a number of picnic benches and at one of them he could just make out a couple of human figures it took him a few seconds to focus clearly in the poor light but when he realized what was happening his throat constricted and his heart seemed to start thumping so loudly he was sure they could hear him there were two of them one halfsat on the table edge hands stretched behind supporting himself as he arched backwards the other knelt at his feet head bowed forward they seemed to freeze for a moment as if they had heard him then the one on the table said something he couldnt quite catch and the one on his knees continued slowly moving his head forward and back he felt sick and dizzy he clutched onto the tree tightly and tried to control the swimming feeling in his head he couldnt afford to faint not here not now with those two so close after a few deep breaths he turned as quietly as he could and hurried down a dirt track that forked off in another direction after he had covered a good distance as fast as he dare go he squatted in the ferns at the side of the trail head in hands and waited for his heart to still and his breathing to become regular an insect crawled up his bare arm he shuddered and brushed it off he was beginning to feel really scared now he had no idea where he was which direction he was travelling in like that yacht back in the pond a million miles away he could be going in circles again he fought back the panic and walked on now he cursed his stupidity why had he come here it hadnt been a good idea at all he would wander round and round then end up back where he started he would collapse with exhaustion and those two men from the picnic table would find him and maybe he did have a death wish after all he should have taken notice of the guidebooks he told himself to stop panicking and calm down before he had got much further he heard voices just off the path over to his left he paused someone was singing an old neil young song someone else said shut up then a girl giggled after that came more singing then a loud yell they were drunk that was it as if to confirm his suspicions he heard the sound of a bottle smashing on a road he decided he had better lie low and keep out of their way there was no telling what a gang of drunks might do to someone walking alone in the park so he waited behind a tree as their voices faded slowly into the distance he stayed where he was until he could hear them no longer then set off again when he crested the next hill he could see the lights of houses to his right and left the park had narrowed to a kind of deep ravine now and the path he was on ran parallel to its bottom about halfway up one side if he left the path and walked all the way up the side he would probably soon find himself in someones back garden he could see the moonlight gleaming on the surface of the narrow stream that flowed along the bottom across the other side he could make out the lights of a police car flashing along a road that skirted the ravines edge the hillside was thickly wooded and the spaces between trees filled with ferns and shrubbery at least now he thought he ought to be able to find his way back to civilization easily enough he heard a noise lower down the hillside and realized there was another path running parallel to his about fifty yards below closer to the water again he froze this sound was far too loud to be a squirrel or a bird it certainly wasnt the sound of a small animal running away but more like a large one coming towards him he crouched by the edge of the dirt path and peered down through the bushes he couldnt make much out at first but something was moving through the undergrowth a few moments later his heart beating fast again he saw the eyes not more than thirty yards away down the slope what was it a fox a wolf then he heard the womans voice jason jason where are you boy come on and she whistled so it was a dog but jason took no notice of her it seemed to have caught his scent and was making its way cautiously up the hillside to check him out he couldnt tell from that distance in the dark but he was worried that it might be a pit bull or a rottweiler surely no woman would go walking alone in the park at night without a vicious dog to guard her he felt beside him on the path and his hand grasped a large stone just small enough to hold the dog came closer come on jason he whispered come on boy the dog barked and made the last few yards in a dash he swung the rock hard at its head and the dog whimpered then let out a low wail and collapsed jason the woman called from below jason where are you she sounded worried now he could just about make her out in the faint light she looked youngish with long hair tied behind her neck in a ponytail and she was wearing shorts and a tshirt she called for the dog again then left the path and started climbing the hill through the shrubbery to the place shed heard it wail thirty yards twentyfive twenty he could see the moonlight glint on her bracelet fifteen he could hear her panting with effort ten she ran the back of her hand over her brow and pushed back a stray tress of hair jason five he glanced around and listened nothing so close to civilization yet so far there was nobody around but him and her four he held his breath three yards she slipped back but managed to grasp a root and keep her balance two he gripped the rock tight in his hand and felt it sticky and warm with the dogs blood she was almost there now just a few more steps one he gripped the rock tighter raising his arm suddenly he felt himself filled with strange joy and he knew he was grinning like an idiot so this was why he had come he didnt have a death wish after all what on earth had those fools who wrote the guidebooks meant of course it was safe after dark perfectly safe just my luck los angeles was the last place walter dimchuk would have chosen for the convention a confirmed torontonian walter had never been able to take california seriously it seemed to him that the people there merely played at life under the palm trees and came up with loonytune ideas take the cuisine if you could call it that it was either mexican which gave walter the runs or socalled californian watercress alfalfa sprouts and avocado with everything even a burger faggot food more like hed had a house salad just yesterday in which he hadnt recognized one single ingredient cilantro arugula fresh basil sundried tomatoes and goats cheese the waiter had told him with a dressing of tarragon balsamic vinegar cardamom oil and toasted pine nuts for christs sake just his luck couldnt a person get a simple grilled cheese sandwich and a glass of milk in this state smog killer freeways serialkiller bubblegum cards earthquakes rodney king riots more fruit loops per square mile than an asylum the list went on he hadnt been happy about leaving kate and maria alone in the house either they might not be as close a family as they had once been what could you expect after thirtyfive years of marriage and three children grown up to adults but they still got on all right mostly thanks to maria a late blessing when kate was fortyfive and now a gawky thirteenyearold the only good thing about the trip that walter had been able to come up with on the plane over air canada three hours late sweet jesus just walters fucking luck was a brief respite from a cool toronto october but he hadnt banked on the santa ana when toronto got hot you sweated here you dried to dust dehydrated in seconds he had once read a story about the hot desert wind the way it made meek wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands necks the writer was right it did make you edgy and crazy walter felt as if hed had a steel band around his forehead for two days it was getting tighter wally walter came out of his reverie he was sitting in the hotel lobby taking a smoke break between sessions nobody seemed to smoke these days in california it was hardly surprising you couldnt find many places where it was legal to do so damn government health warnings on everything now even the wine and he had seen the way the young hotshots with their white teeth turned up their noses when he lit up even if they were sitting in a goddamn bar christ who was this coming towards him hand outstretched teeth bared in a predatory smile should he remember awkwardly he got to his feet hi good to see you he said good to see you the stranger said its been years yeah walter scratched the side of his right eye and frowned now where the hell was it baltimore baltimore seventynine jimmy lavalli remember we closed down that bar together yeah of course how you doing jimmy and so it went on the empty greetings inane conversations tales of triple bypasses and all the time walter knew deep inside that they were all out to get him were all laughing at him oh old wally woodchuk wally dumptruck wally upchuck fucking dinosaur sales have been down for years no one had said it to his face but they didnt need to wally knew at fiftynine he was too old for the pool supplies business and it was obvious from the number of tanned young men around the convention that the company thought so too youd almost think the new breed were chosen because theyd look good sitting around a swimming pool like the way auto manufacturers used curvaceous women to sell cars wallys curves were in all the wrong places ungrateful bastards hed given his life to hudsons pools and supplies and this was how they paid him back he felt like that salesman in the play must have done the one that guy whod been married to marilyn monroe not the baseball player one of the others had written for dustin hoffman he had heard the talk around the office noticed the muted conversations and insincere greetings as he passed couples chatting in the corridor they were putting him out to pasture that was why they sent him to california he wouldnt be surprised if his office if you could call a screenedoff corner in an open plan an office was cleaned out when he got back and someone else was sitting there in his place some tanned young asshole with white teeth and a wolfish smile maybe called scott he got rid of jimmy with promises to look him up if he was ever in baltimore not if he could help it and looked at his watch five oclock shit time for another boring session then up to get changed for the convention banquet tofu burgers again most likely maybe grab a few minutes in between and call kate thank god that was over with walter thought as he waved goodnight to the stragglers in the pasadena ballroom and headed for the elevator what a fucking ordeal and typical california too no smoking not anywhere in the dining hall not tofu burgers but almost as bad cornish game hen or some such skinny little bird stuffed with grapes and olives and jalapeño peppers basted in lemon garlic and the ubiquitous cilantro of course and they had to put him at the table with that loudmouthed jerk carson from united just his luck still walter had kept his end up he had been nice to the right people managed a smile passed his company card around even if the recipients did absently slip it into their side pockets where theyd throw it out with the lint and the hotel matches a funny business these conventions he thought as he went into his room hours of manic gladhanding hurried conversations in lobbies and mens rooms talking business even with your dick in your hand then when you finally got to be alone at the end of the night all you felt was an incredible loneliness descend at least walter did so there you are in your strange hotel room alone miles from home after the party oh the guys were setting up allnight poker sessions planning trips to strip joints and bars but walter had had enough of all that and of his colleagues he wanted to be alone but he didnt want to feel alone it was the wind he thought that goddamn santa ana and the airconditioner had quit just his luck he lay down on the bed with his hands behind his head and tried to relax he couldnt he hadnt drunk much that was one thing he had under control these days that was why he couldnt for the life of him remember closing any bar with jimmy lavalli in baltimore if those tanned bastards knew what they looked like after theyd had a few too many anyway those days were past as he lay there restless in the heat feeling the band tighten around his head the heartburn start to kick in the resentment and fear churn inside him he became aware of one feeling he would never have expected god dammit walter dimchuk was horny not that it had never happened before of course but never with such a keen urgent edge not for a long time he remembered the outing hed had with al and larry yesterday afternoon given a couple of spare hours they had driven to santa monica walked on the pier the boardwalk towards venice and now as he lay trying to find sleep all walter could find were the disturbing images of those girls in their bikinis all that smooth firm tanned flesh he turned over this was ridiculous his lust felt so strong it was gripping his heart making him squirm the images churned in his mind spurring him on it was the damn heat he knew it maybe if he could get out for a while tell someone at the desk to fix his airconditioning while he took a little drive around town he sat up and slid his shoes back on yeah that was the thing to do maybe drive to the ocean and cool off a little that or a cold shower he looked at his watch still only eleven oclock ok car keys jacket such romanticsounding street names they had la cienega sepulveda la brea but they werent so fucking romantic when you were on them they were either freeways or roads running past shitty little spanishstyle stucco houses with graffiti all over the stucco and postagestamp gardens full of junk it was cool in the rental but walter still couldnt shake the horniness hed pass a row of stores set back from the road and see a gang of kids there girls in cutoff jeans and halter tops drinking coke from the bottle breasts jutting out it was getting worse as if the santa ana somehow slipped in through the airconditioning and messed with his brain he found himself on hollywood boulevard walter loved old movies the black and white kind and the real stars they had back then like cary grant garbo bogie gable jimmy stewart christ he must have seen its a wonderful life about twenty times and then they went and colourized the motherfucker but the boulevard with all those stars in the sidewalk had gone to porn theatres dirty bookstores with barred windows hookers pimps muggers losers he was stopped at a red light when he heard the tap on his window if it had been a man he would have burnt rubber driving away even through a stop light it wasnt nervously he rolled down the window wann good time mister wann have some fun he looked at her she must have been all of sixteen going on forty but she was pretty a latino with that honey skin and lustrous black hair from what he could see of the rest of her it looked pretty good too walter hesitated he had never been with a hooker before he knew it happened at conventions and somehow the guys thought it was all right playing away from home like that what the old lady doesnt know wont hurt her hey wally but walter had never done it now though with this girl hanging in his window practically spilling her tits onto his lap with the lights changing someone blowing a horn behind him and the desire sharp as knife cutting away inside him well he opened the door the hooker got in and walter drove off she was wearing a short black skirt way up around her thighs and a tight pink halter made of material so thin he could see her nipples poking through her bare midriff was flat with an outie belly button his mouth was dry where he croaked she directed him to a rundown hotel off sunset and he followed her up the stairs in a daze aware only of the smell of disinfectant and rotting meat in the dim lobby and of the scuffed stained linoleum on the stairs in the shaded light the room didnt look too bad what did it matter anyway she took his money first then walter watched as she wriggled out of the halter and her honey breasts with the dark hard nipples quivered as they fell free grinning at him the tip of her tongue between her small white teeth she unzipped her skirt and let it fall she was wearing only white panties now he could see the dark shadow of her pubic hair and some of the hairs curled around the edges of the silky material you no undress she asked wann me take your clothes off walter nodded deftly she took off his jacket shirt pants oh my you so big she said touching his erection so big and hard safe she said reaching for a condom from her bag always safe walter felt glad of that aids had crossed his mind more than once between hollywood boulevard and the hotel but if she always insisted on a condom she was bound to be clean he thought desire seared like the sharp hot desert wind inside him driving him recklessly and thoughtlessly on she put her hands on his chest and pushed him gently down on the bed then she straddled him felt for his penis between her legs and thrust down on it slowly walter groaned and reached for her breasts as she moved back and forth on him dimly he was aware of the bed springs creaking but it didnt matter nothing mattered but this moist warm tightness all around him sucking him in hooking onto his desire and channelling it concentrating it he couldnt have held back if hed tried it seemed like no time at all when everything burst and warmth flooded his veins the woman moaned he knew she was faking but he didnt care then it was all over walter thanked her and hurried out to his car and his shame at first he sat there breathing hard and cranked up the airconditioner his stomach clenched his loins felt dry and empty but the steel band was still there tightening around his skull lighting a cigarette he turned onto the boulevard and headed back to the hotel they still hadnt fixed the airconditioning he noticed and when he phoned down to complain the desk clerk said no one would be able to do it till the morning just his fucking luck he should have felt better after sating his desire he knew but when he lay down and relived what he had just done he was appalled it was only midnight no more than an hour ago he had been an innocent a virtuous man now he had been tainted how little time it took and now he was worried too condom or no condom he could still get aids that was a fact the wind had done this to him the wind and the palm trees and the hooker with the wonderful breasts and the sweet warm place inside her hed been suckered jesus christ he wept how could he face kate and maria again after hed been corrupted that hooker hadnt been much older than his daughter the goddamn hot wind had made him fuck his own daughter even if they didnt know he knew he couldnt face them his marriage was over his family broken all because of some twobit whore who had tempted him and given him a disease he ground his teeth the heat seemed to bore into his bones the way the damp cold did in england that time he went with kate so many years ago he was burning up maybe he was already showing symptoms of whatever disease that whore had given him but that was ridiculous maybe hed got flu or maybe it was the santa ana he turned over and tried to sleep but the steel band tightened and the guilt hammered away at him making sleep impossible his life was ruined all because of fucking california he couldnt think straight any more nothing but images shot through his mind disjointed images kate crying maria slipping her panties off and rubbing her hand between her legs the tanned assholes with the twothousanddollar smiles who were going to have his job he couldnt take it any more he had to do something christ theyd walked over old walter dimchuk for long enough pushed him around used him for a doormat laughed behind his back now theyd corrupted his soul goddammit enough was enough his luck was going to change hardly thinking he got dressed quickly and picked up his car keys at the last moment just before the door shut behind him he went back and picked up the ice pick from the dish by the television this time it was a caucasian girl blonde hair cleancut looks but the same style tight short skirt and halter top and she wanted to make a quick phone call before she got into his car and directed him to a different hotel it was a step up from the last one he noticed for wally was noticing things clearly now like the oldfashioned bell on the wooden desk the discreet damask armchairs in the lobby the woodpanelling look the hovering scent of sandalwood in fact walter felt strangely calm and in control now he knew what he was going to do the steel band had loosened he smiled to himself as she went through her undressing routine a bit more elaborate and drawn out than the last one with slow gestures and teasing glances he felt no desire now it was all gone he let her continue outside the hot wind huffed and puffed at the windows the halter revealed white droopy breasts the kind that fold over like envelope flaps her eyes were unfocused and dull as if she were on drugs she had a large bruise on the outside of her right thigh and a little scar just under her navel appendicitis he wondered but the appendix was further to the right wasnt it no matter she stood naked before him finally and he still felt no desire only disgust and hatred it wasnt the same one who had ruined him corrupted him but they were all the same underneath whores they all shared the same tainted rotten soul she would do he let her unbutton his shirt then he moved her gently away and asked her to lie face down on the bed wanna come in from behind hey honey she said and grinned lasciviously lying down and hugging the pillow no thats not it walters voice felt strange dry and stuck deep in his chest thats not it at all sok by me walter slipped the ice pick from his jacket pocket and felt its point cool in his dry hand he was just about to raise it above his head and plunge into the back of her neck when he heard a sound behind him everything happened so fast first the door opened and walter saw a huge man blocking the exit a giant with blond hair hanging over his massive shoulders a tanned face carved of rock and veins thick as cables snaking down his thick arms the man he also noticed was wearing a sleeveless white tshirt and baggy flowered pants held up by elastic shit walter thought glancing back at the girl for a second then at his jacket over the back of a chair theyre going to rip me off rob me thats what the phone call was about just my fucking luck but what walter didnt really register until it was much too late was that when he turned towards the doorway he had an ice pick still raised above his head and the other man had a gun walter never did get a chance to explain the giant raised his gun and without a word fired two shots right into walter dimchuks angry corrupt and unlucky heart anna said an inspector banks story im not happy with it laddie said dr glendenning shaking his head not happy at all so the super told me said banks whats the problem they sat at a dimpled coppertopped table in the queens arms glendenning over a glass of glenmorangie and banks over a pint of theakstons it was a bitterly cold evening in february banks was anxious to get home and take sandra out to dinner as he had promised but dr glendenning had asked for help and a home office pathologist was too important to brush off one of these glendenning offered banks a senior service banks grimaced no no thanks ill stick with tipped im trying to give up aye said glendenning lighting up me too so whats the problem she should never have died the doctor said but thats by the way these things happen who shouldnt have died oh sorry forgot you didnt know anna anna childers is was her name admitted to the hospital this morning any reason to suspect a crime noo not on the surface thats why i wanted an informal chat first rain lashed at the window the buzz of conversation rose and fell around them what happened banks asked her boyfriend brought her in at about ten oclock this morning he said shed been up half the night vomiting they thought it was gastric flu dr gibson treated the symptoms as best he could but glendenning shrugged cause of death respiratory failure if she hadnt suffered from asthma she might have had a chance dr gibson managed at least to get the convulsions under control but as for the cause of it all dont ask me ive no idea yet it could have been food poisoning or she could have taken something a suicide attempt you know how i hate guesswork he looked at his watch and finished his drink anyway im off to do the postmortem now should know a bit more after that what do you want me to do youre the copper laddie ill not tell you your job all ill say is the circumstances are suspicious enough to worry me maybe you could talk to the boyfriend banks took out his notebook whats his name and address glendenning told him and left banks sighed and went to the telephone sandra wouldnt like this at all banks pulled up outside anna childerss large semi in south eastvale near the big roundabout and turned off the tape of furtwängler conducting beethovens ninth it was the live bayreuth recording mono but magnificent the rain was still falling hard and banks fancied he could feel the sting of hail against his cheek as he dashed to the door raincoat collar turned up the man who answered his ring john billings looked awful normally banks guessed he was a cleancut athletic type at his best on a tennis court perhaps or a ski slope but grief and lack of sleep had turned his skin pale and his features puffy his shoulders slumped as banks followed him into the living room which looked like one of the package designs advertised in the sunday colour supplements banks sat down in a damaskupholstered armchair and shivered im sorry muttered billings turning on the gas fire i didnt its understandable banks said leaning forward and rubbing his hands theres nothing wrong is there billings asked i mean the police nothing for you to worry about banks said just some questions yes billings flopped onto the sofa and crossed his legs of course im sorry about what happened banks began i just want to get some idea of how it all seems a bit of a mystery to the doctors billings sniffed you can say that again when did anna start feeling ill about four in the morning she complained of a headache said she was feeling dizzy then she was up and down to the toilet the rest of the night i thought it was a virus or something i mean you dont go running off to the doctors over the least little thing do you but it got worse yes it just wouldnt stop he held his face in his hands banks heard the hissing of the fire and the pellets of hail against the curtained window billings took a deep breath im sorry at the end she was bringing up blood shivering and she had problems breathing then well you know what happened how long had you known her pardon banks repeated the question a couple of years in all i suppose but only as a business acquaintance at first annas a chartered accountant and i run a small consultancy firm she did some auditing work for us thats how you met her yes banks looked around at the entertainment centre the framed van gogh print who owns the house if billings was surprised at the question he didnt show it anna it was only a temporary arrangement my living here i had a flat i moved out we were going to get married buy a house together somewhere in the dale helmthorpe perhaps how long had you been going out together six months living together three getting on all right i told you we were going to get married you say youd known her two years but youve only been seeing each other six months what took you so long was there someone else billings nodded for you or her for anna owen was still living with her until about seven months ago owen doughton and they split up yes any bitterness billings shook his head no it was all very civilized they werent married anna said they just started going their different ways theyd been together about five years and they felt they werent really going anywhere together so they decided to separate what did the two of you do last night we went out for dinner at that chinese place on kendal road you dont think it could have been that i really cant say what did you eat the usual egg rolls chicken chow mein a szechuan prawn dish we shared everything are you sure yes we usually do anna doesnt really like spicy food but shell have a little just to keep me happy im a curry nut myself the hotter the better i thought at first maybe that was what made her sick you know if it wasnt the flu the chillies they use then you came straight home no we stopped for a drink at the red lion got home just after eleven and anna was feeling fine yes fine what did you do when you got home nothing much really pottered around a bit then we went to bed and thats it yes i must admit i felt a little unwell myself during the night i had a headache and an upset stomach but alkaseltzer soon put it right i just cant believe it i keep thinking shell walk in the door at any moment and say it was all a mistake did anna have a nightcap or anything banks asked after a pause a cup of horlicks something like that he shook his head she couldnt stand horlicks no neither of us had anything after the pub banks stood up the room was warm now and his blotched raincoat had started to dry out thanks very much he said offering his hand and again im sorry for intruding on your grief billings shrugged what do you think it was i dont know yet there is one more thing i have to ask please dont take offence billings stared at him go on was anna upset about anything depressed he shook his head vigorously no no quite the opposite she was happier than shed ever been she told me i know what youre getting at inspector the doctor suggested the same thing but you can forget it anna would never have tried to take her own life she just wasnt that kind of person she was too full of life and energy banks nodded if hed had a pound for every time hed heard that about a suicide he would be a rich man fair enough he said just for the record this owen where does he live im afraid i dont know he works at that big garden centre just off north market street over from the town hall i know it thanks very much mr billings banks pulled up his collar again and dashed for the car the hail had turned to rain again as he drove windscreen wipers slapping he pondered his talk with john billings the man seemed genuine in his grief and he had no apparent motive for harming anna childers but again all banks had to go on was what he had been told then there was owen doughton the ex livein lover things might not have been as civilized as anna childers had made out the marvellous fourth movement of the symphony began just as banks turned into his street he sat in the parked car with the rain streaming down the windows and listened until otto edelmann came in with o freunde nicht diese töne then turned off the tape and headed indoors if he stayed out any longer hed be there until the end of the symphony and sandra certainly wouldnt appreciate that banks found owen doughton hefting bags of fertilizer around in the garden centre early the next morning doughton was a short rather hangdoglooking man in his early thirties with shaggy dark hair and a droopy moustache the rain had stopped overnight but a brisk chill wind was fast bringing in more cloud so banks asked if they could talk inside doughton led him to a small cluttered office that smelled faintly of paraffin doughton sat on the desk and banks took the swivel chair im afraid ive got some bad news for you mr doughton banks started doughton studied his cracked dirty fingernails i read about anna in the paper this morning if thats what you mean he said its terrible a tragedy he brushed back a thick lock of hair from his right eye did you see much of her lately not a lot no not since we split up wed have lunch occasionally if neither of us was too busy so there were no hard feelings no anna said it was just time to move on that wed outgrown each other we both needed more space to grow was she right he shrugged seems so but i still cared for her i dont want you to think i didnt i just cant take this in he looked banks in the eye for the first time whats wrong anyway why are the police interested its just routine banks said i dont suppose youd know anything about her state of mind recently not really when did you see her last a couple of weeks ago she seemed fine really did you know her new boyfriend doughton returned to study his fingernails no she told me about him of course but we never met sounded like a nice bloke probably better for her than me i wished her every happiness surely you cant think she did this herself anna just wasnt the type she had too much to live for most likely food poisoning banks said closing his notebook but we have to cover the possibilities nice talking to you anyway i dont suppose ill be troubling you again no problem doughton said standing up banks nodded and left if we split up banks mused aloud to sandra over an early lunch in the new mcdonalds that day do you think youd be upset sandra narrowed her eyes clear blue under the dark brows and blonde hair are you trying to tell me something alan is there something i should know banks paused big mac halfway to his mouth and laughed no no nothing like that its purely hypothetical well thank goodness for that sandra took a bite of her mcchicken sandwich and pulled a face yuck have you really developed a taste for this stuff banks nodded its all right really full of nutrition and he took a big bite as if to prove it well she said you certainly know how to show a woman a good time ill say that for you and what on earth are you talking about splitting up its just something that puzzles me thats all ive been married to you half my life sandra said twenty years of course id be bloody upset if we split up you cant see us just going our separate ways growing apart needing more space alan whats got into you have you been reading those selfhelp books she looked around the place again taking in the plastic decor im getting worried about you well dont its simple really i know twenty years hardly compares with five but do you believe people can just disentangle their lives from one another and carry on with someone new as if nothing had happened maybe they couldve done in sandra answered and maybe some people still can but i think it cuts a lot deeper than that no matter what anyone says anna said it was fine banks muttered almost to himself but annas dead is this that investigation youre doing for dr glendenning the reason you stood me up last night i didnt stand you up i phoned to apologize but yes ive got a nagging feeling about it somethings not quite right what do you mean you think she was poisoned or something its possible but i cant prove it i cant even figure out how then maybe youre wrong huh banks chomped on his big mac again wouldnt be the first time would it he explained about his talks with john billings and owen doughton sandra thought for a moment sipping her coke through a straw and picking at her chips sandwich abandoned on her tray sounds like a determined woman this anna i suppose its possible she just made a seamless transition from one to the other but id bet theres a lot more to it than that id have a word with both of them again if i were you mmm said banks thought youd say that fancy a sweet the tests are going to take time glendenning said over the phone but from what i could see theres severe damage to the liver kidneys heart and lungs not to mention the central nervous system could it be food poisoning banks asked it certainly looks like some kind of poisoning a healthy person doesnt usually die just like that i suppose at a pinch it could be botulism glendenning said certainly some of the symptoms match ill get the board of trade to check out that chinese restaurant any other possibilities too damned many glendenning growled thats the problem theres enough nasty stuff around to make you that ill if youre unlucky enough to swallow it household cleaners pesticides industrial chemicals the list goes on thats why well have to wait for the test results and he hung up cantankerous old bugger banks thought with a smile how glendenning hated being pinned down the problem was though if someone owen john or some undiscovered enemy had poisoned anna how had he done it john billings could have doctored her food at the chinese restaurant or her drink in the pub or perhaps there was something she had eaten that he had simply failed to mention he certainly had the best opportunity but john billings seemed the most unlikely suspect he loved the woman they were going to get married or so he said anna childers was quite well off and upwardly mobile but it was unlikely that billings stood to gain or even needed to gain financially from her death it was worth looking into though she had only been thirty but she might have made a will in his favour and billingss consultancy could do with a bit of scrutiny money wouldnt be a motive with owen doughton though according to both the late anna and to owen himself they had parted without rancour each content to get on with life again it might be worth asking a few of their friends and acquaintances if they had reason to think any differently doughton had seemed gentle reserved a private person but who could tell what went on in his mind banks walked down the corridor to see if either detective constable susan gay or detective sergeant philip richmond was free for an hour or two two hours later dc susan gay sat in front of bankss desk smoothed her grey skirt over her lap and opened her notebook as usual banks thought she was well dressed tight blonde curls just enough makeup the silver hoop earrings black scoopnecked top and a mere whiff of miss dior cutting the stale cigarette smoke in his office theres not much im afraid susan started glancing up from her notes no will as far as i can discover but she did alter the beneficiary on her insurance policy a month ago in whose benefit john billings apparently she has no family banks raised his eyebrows who was the previous beneficiary owen doughton odd that isnt it banks speculated aloud a woman who changes her insurance policy with her boyfriends well she wouldnt want it to go to the government would she susan said and i dont suppose shed want to make her ex rich either true said banks its often easier to keep a policy going than let it lapse and apply all over again later and they were going to get married but why change it so soon how much is it for fifty thousand banks whistled owen doughtons poor as a church mouse susan went on but he doesnt stand to gain anything but did he know that i doubt anna childers would have told him what about billings susan gnawed the tip of her biro and hesitated pretty well off she said bit of an upandcomer in the consultancy world you can see why a woman like anna childers would want to attach herself to him why hes going places of course expensive places i see said banks and you think she was a golddigger susan flushed not necessarily she just knew what side her bread was buttered on thats all same as with a lot of new businesses though billings has a bit of a cashflow problem hmm any gossip on the split up not much i had a chat with a couple of locals in the red lion anna childers always seemed cheerful enough but she was a tough nut to crack they said strong protective shell what about doughton he doesnt seem to have many friends his boss says hes noticed no real changes but he says owen keeps to himself always did im sorry its not much help never mind banks said look ive got a couple of things to do can you find phil for me did you know that anna had an insurance policy banks asked owen doughton they stood in the cold yard while doughton stacked some bags of peat moss doughton stood up and rubbed the small of his back aye he said what of it did you know how much it was for he shook his head all right banks said did anna tell you shed changed the beneficiary named john billings instead of you doughton paused with his mouth open no he said no she didnt so you know now that you stand to gain nothing that it all goes to john doughtons face darkened then he looked away and banks swore he could hear a strangled laugh or cry i dont believe this doughton said facing him again i cant believe im hearing this you think i might have killed anna and for money this is insane look go away please i dont have to talk to you do i no said banks well bugger off then ive got work to do but remember one thing whats that i loved her i loved anna john billings looked even more wretched than he had the day before his eyes were bloodshot underlined by black smudges and he hadnt shaved banks could smell alcohol on his breath a suitcase stood in the hallway where are you going john banks asked i cant stay here can i i mean its not my house for a start and the memories where are you going he picked up the case i dont know just away from here thats all i dont think so gently banks took the case from him and set it down we havent got to the bottom of this yet what do you mean for christs sake man youd better come with me john where police station well have a chat there billings stared angrily at him then seemed to fold oh what the hell he muttered what does it matter and he picked his coat off the rack and followed banks he didnt see ds philip richmond watching from the window of the cafe over the road it was after seven oclock dark cold and windy outside banks decided to wait in the bedroom on the chair wedged in the corner between the wardrobe and the dressing table from there with the door open he could see the staircase and he would be able to hear any sounds in the house he had just managed to get the item on the local news show at six oclock only minutes after dr glendenning had phoned with more detailed information poison suspected in death of eastvale woman police baffled no suspects as yet of course the killer might not have seen it or might have already covered his tracks but if anna childers had been poisoned and glendenning now seemed certain she had then the answer had to be here given possible reaction times glendenning had said in his late afternoon phone call there was little chance she could have taken the poison into her system before eight oclock the previous evening at which time she had gone out to dine with john billings the house was dark and silent save for the ticking of a clock on the bedside table and the howling wind rattling the window eight oclock nine nothing happened except banks got cramp in his left calf he massaged it then stood up at regular intervals and stretched he thought of ds richmond down the street in the unmarked car between them theyd be sure to catch anyone who came finally close to ten oclock he heard it a scraping at the lock on the front door he drew himself deep into the chair melted into the darkness and held his breath the door opened and closed softly he could see a torch beam sweeping the wall by the staircase coming closer the intruder was coming straight up the stairs damn banks hadnt expected that he wanted whoever it was to lead him to the poison not walk right into him he sat rigid in the chair as the beam played over the threshold of the bedroom mercifully not falling on him in his dark corner the intruder didnt hesitate he walked around the bed within inches of bankss feet and over to the bedside table shining his torch he opened the top drawer and picked something up at that moment banks turned on the light the figure turned sharply then froze hello owen said banks what brings you here if it was anyone it had to be either you or him john banks said later back in his office while owen doughton was being charged downstairs only the two of you were intimate enough with anna to know her habits her routines and owen had lived with her until quite recently there was a chance he still had a key john billings shook his head i thought you were arresting me it was touch and go i wont deny it but at least i thought id give you a chance the benefit of the doubt and if your trap hadnt worked banks shrugged down to you i suppose the poison could have been anywhere in anything toothpaste for example i knew if it wasnt you and the killer heard the news hed try to destroy any remaining evidence he wouldnt have had a chance to do so yet because you were in the house but i was at the hospital nearly all yesterday too soon he had no idea anything had happened at that time this wasnt a carefully calculated plan but why banks shook his head that i cant say for certain hes a sick man an obsessed man its my guess it was his warped form of revenge it had been eating away at him for some time anna didnt treat him very well john she didnt really stop to take his feelings into account when she kicked him out and took up with you she just assumed he would understand like he always had because he loved her and had her welfare at heart he was deeply hurt but he wasnt the kind to make a fuss or let his feelings show he kept it all bottled up she could be a bit blinkered could anna john mumbled she was a very focused woman yes and im sure doughton felt humiliated when she dumped him and turned to you after all he didnt have much of a financial future unlike you but it wasnt that not with anna billings protested we just had so much in common goals tastes ambitions she and owen had nothing in common any more youre probably right banks said anyway when she told him a couple of weeks ago that she was going to get married to you it was the last straw he said she expected him to be happy for her but why did he keep on seeing her if it hurt him so much he was still in love with her it was better seeing her even under those circumstances than not at all then why kill her banks looked at billings love and hate john he said theyre not so far apart besides he doesnt believe he did kill her that wasnt really his intention at all i dont understand you said he did how did he do it banks paused and lit a cigarette this wasnt going to be easy rain blew against the window and a draught rattled the venetian blind how billings repeated banks looked at his calendar trying to put off the moment it showed a woodland scene snowdrops blooming near the strid at bolton abbey he cleared his throat owen came to the house while you were both out banks began he brought a syringe loaded with a strong pesticide he got from the garden centre remember he knew anna intimately did you and anna make love that night john billings reddened for christs sake im not asking whether the earth moved im just asking if you did believe me its relevant all right said billings after a pause yes we did as a matter of fact owen knew anna well enough to know that she was frightened of getting pregnant banks went on but she wouldnt take the pill because of the side effects he knew she insisted on condoms and he knew she liked to make love in the dark it was easy enough to insert the needle into a couple of packages and squirt in some pesticide not much but its very powerful stuff colourless and odourless so even an infinitesimal coating would have some effect the condoms were lubricated so theyd feel oily anyway and nobody would notice a tiny pinprick in the package you absorbed a little into your system too and thats why you felt ill you see its easily absorbed through skin or membranes but anna got the lions share dr glendenning would have found out eventually how the poison was administered from tissue samples but further tests would have taken time owen could easily have nipped back to the house and removed the evidence by then or we might have decided that you had better access to the method billings paled you mean it could just as easily have been me either killed or arrested for murder banks shrugged it could have turned out any way really there was no way of knowing accurately what would happen and certainly there was a chance that either you would die or the blame would fall on you as it turned out anna absorbed most of it and she had asthma in owens twisted mind he wanted your lovemaking to make you sick that was his statement if you like after suffering so long in silence pretending it was ok that anna had moved on but thats all it was a sick joke if you like we found three poisoned condoms certainly if one hadnt worked the way it did there could have been a build up of the pesticide causing chronic problems i did read about a case once banks went on where a man married rich women and murdered them for their money by putting arsenic on his condoms but they were made of goatskin back then besides he was french ive never come across a case quite as strange as this billings shook his head slowly can i go now he asked where to i dont know a hotel perhaps until banks nodded and stood up as they went down the stairs they came face to face with owen doughton handcuffed to a large constable billings stiffened doughton glared at him and spoke to banks hes the one who killed her he said with a toss of his head hes the one you should be arresting then he looked directly at billings youre going to have to live with that you know mr moneybags it was you who killed her hear that mr yuppie moneybags you killed her you killed anna banks couldnt tell whether he was laughing or crying as the constable led him down to the cells missing in action people go missing all the time in war of course but not usually nineyearold boys besides the war had hardly begun it was only september when mary critchley came hammering on my door at about three oclock interrupting my afternoon nap it was a wednesday and normally i would have been teaching the fifthformers shakespeare at silverhill grammar school a thankless task if ever there was one but the ministry had just got around to constructing airraid shelters there so the school was closed for the week we didnt even know if it was going to reopen because the plan was to evacuate all the children to safer areas in the countryside now i would be among the first to admit that a teachers highest aspiration is a school without pupils but in the meantime the government in its eternal wisdom put us redundant teachers to such complex intellectual tasks as preparing ration cards for the ministry of food after all they knew what was coming all this was just a small part of the chaos that seemed to reign at that time not the chaos of war the kind i remembered from the trenches at ypres in but the chaos of government bureaucracies trying to organize the country for war anyway i was fortunate enough to become a special constable which is a rather grandiose title for a sort of parttime dogsbody and that was why mary critchley came running to me that and what little reputation i had for solving peoples problems mr bashcombe mr bashcombe she cried its our johnny hes gone missing you musht help my name is actually bascombe frank bascombe but mary critchley has a slight speech impediment so i forgave her the mispronunciation still with half the citys children running wild in the streets and the other half standing on crowded station platforms clutching their mickey mouse gasmasks in little cardboard boxes ready to be herded into trains bound for such nearby country havens as graythorpe kilsden and acksham i thought perhaps she was overreacting a tad and i cant say i welcomed her arrival after only about twenty of my allotted forty winks hes probably out playing with his mates i told her not my johnny she said wiping the tears from her eyes not since you know i knew mr critchley ted to his friends had been a royal navy man since well before the war he had also been unfortunate enough to serve on the aircraft carrier courageous which had been sunk by a german uboat off the southwest coast of ireland just three days before over five hundred men had been lost including ted critchley of course no body had been found and probably never would be so he was only officially missing in action i also knew young johnny critchley and thought him to be a serious boy a bit too imaginative and innocent for his own good well many are at that age arent they before the world grabs them by the balls and shakes some reality into them johnny trusted everyone even strangers johnnys not been in much of a mood for playing with his mates sinsh we got the news about teds ship mary critchley went on i could understand that well enough young johnny was an only child and he always did worship his father but i still didnt see what i could do about it have you asked around what do you think ive been doing sinsh he didnt come home at twelve oclock like he was supposed to ive ashked everyone in the street last time he was seen he was down by the canal at about eleven oclock maurice richards saw him what can i do mr bashcombe firsht ted and now now my johnny she burst into tears after i had managed to calm her down i sighed and told her i would look for johnny myself there certainly wasnt much hope of my getting the other twenty winks now it was a glorious day so warm and sunny you would hardly believe there was a war on the late afternoon sunshine made even our narrow streets of cramped brick terraced houses look attractive as the shadows lengthened the light turned to molten gold first i scoured the local rec where the children played cricket and football and the dogs ran wild some soldiers were busy digging trenches for airraid shelters just the sight of those long dark grooves in the earth gave me the shivers behind the trenches barrage balloons pulled at their moorings on the breeze like playful porpoises orange and pink in the sun i asked the soldiers but they hadnt seen johnny nor had any of the other lads after the rec i headed for the derelict houses on gallipoli street the landlord had let them go to rack and ruin two years ago and they were quite uninhabitable not even fit for billeting soldiers they were also dangerous and should have been pulled down but i think the old skinflint was hoping a bomb would hit them so he could claim insurance or compensation from the government the doors and windows had been boarded up but children are resourceful and it wasnt difficult even for me to remove a couple of loose sheets of plywood and make my way inside i wished i had my torch but i had to make do with what little light slipped through the holes every time i moved my feet stirred up clouds of dust which did my poor lungs no good at all i thought johnny might have fallen or got trapped in one of the houses the staircases were rotten and more than one lad had fallen through on his way up the floors werent much better either and one of the fourthformers at silverhill had needed more than fifteen stitches a couple of weeks before when one of his legs went right through the rotten wood and the splinters gouged his flesh i searched as best i could in the poor light and i called out johnnys name but no answer came before i left i stood silently and listened for any traces of harsh breathing or whimpering nothing after three hours of searching the neighbourhood id had no luck at all blackout time was seven fortyfive pm so i still had about an hour and a half left but if johnny wasnt in any of the local childrens usual haunts i was at a loss as to where to look i talked to the other boys i met here and there but none of his friends had seen him since the family got the news of teds death little johnny critchley it seemed had vanished into thin air at half past six i called on maurice richards grateful for his offer of a cup of tea and the chance to rest my aching feet maurice and i went back a long time we had both survived the first war maurice with the loss of an arm and me with permanent facial scarring and a racking cough that comes and goes thanks to the mustard gas leaking through my mask at the third battle of ypres we never talked about the war but it was there we both knew an invisible bond tying us close together while at the same time excluding us from so much other normal human intercourse not many had seen the things we had and thank god for that maurice lit up a passing cloud onehanded then he poured the tea the seven oclock news came on the radio some rot about us vowing to keep fighting until wed vanquished the foe it was still very much a war of words at that time and the more rhetorical the language sounded the better the politicians thought they were doing there had been a couple of minor air skirmishes and the sinking of the courageous of course but all the action was taking place in poland which seemed as remote as the moon to most people some clever buggers had already started calling it the bore war did you hear tommy handley last night frank maurice asked i shook my head thered been a lot of hoopla about tommy handleys new radio programme its that man again or itma as people called it i was never a fan call me a snob but when evening falls im far happier curling up with a good book or an interesting talk on the radio than listening to tommy handley talk about laugh said maurice they had this one sketch about the ministry of aggravation and the office of twerps i nearly died i smiled not far from the truth i said there were now so many of these obscure ministries boards and departments involved in so many absurd pursuits all for the common good of course that i had been thinking of writing a dystopian satire i proposed to set it in the near future which would merely be a thinly disguised version of the present so far all i had was a great idea for the title i would reverse the last two numbers in the current year so instead of id call it well i thought it was a good idea look maurice i said its about young johnny critchley his mother tells me you were the last person to see him oh aye maurice said she were round asking about him not long ago still not turned up no cause for concern then im beginning to think so what was he doing when you saw him just walking down by the canal by old woodruffs scrapyard thats all yes was he alone maurice nodded did he say anything no you didnt say anything to him no cause to he seemed preoccupied just staring in the water like hands in his pockets ive heard what happened to his dad a lad has to do his grieving too true did you see anyone else anything suspicious no nothing just a minute though what oh its probably nothing but just after i saw johnny when i was crossing the bridge i bumped into colin gormond you know that chap whos a bit you know colin gormond i knew him all right and that wasnt good news it wasnt good news at all of all the policemen they could have sent they had to send detective bloody sergeant longbottom a big brutishlooking fellow with a pronounced limp and a cromagnon brow longbottom was thick as two short planks i doubt he could have found his own arse even if someone nailed a sign on it or detected his way out of an anderson shelter if it were in his own back yard but thats the calibre of men this wretched war has left us with at home along with good ones like me of course ds longbottom wore a shiny brown suit and a silverhill grammar school tie i wondered where hed got it from he probably stole it from a schoolboy he caught nicking sweets from the corner shop he kept tugging at his collar with his pink sausage fingers as we talked in mary critchleys living room his face was flushed with the heat and sweat gathered on his thick eyebrows and trickled down the sides of his neck so hes been missing since lunchtime has he ds longbottom repeated mary critchley nodded he went out at about half past ten just for a walk like said hed be back at twelve when it got to three well i went to see mr bashcombe here ds longbottom curled his lip at me and grunted mr bascombe special constable i suppose you realize that gives you no real police powers dont you as a matter of fact i said i thought it made me your superior after all youre not a special sergeant are you he looked at me as if he wanted to hit me perhaps he would have done if mary critchley hadnt been in the room enough of your lip just answer my questions yes sir you say you looked all over for this lad all his usual haunts and you found no trace of him if i had do you think wed have sent for you i warned you cut the lip and answer the questions this whats his name maurice richards was he the last person to see the lad johnnys his name and yes is the answer as far as we know i paused hed have to know eventually and if i didnt tell him maurice would the longer we delayed the worse it would be in the long run there was someone else in the area at the time a man called colin gormond mary critchley gave a sharp gasp ds longbottom frowned licked the tip of his pencil and scribbled something in his notebook ill have to have a word with him he said then he turned to her recognize the name do you mam i know colin i answered perhaps a bit too quickly ds longbottom stared at mary critchley whose lower lip started quivering then turned slowly back to me tell me about him i sighed colin gormond was an oddball some people said he was a bit slow but id never seen any real evidence of that he lived alone and he didnt have much to do with the locals that was enough evidence against him for some people and then there were the children for some reason colin preferred the company of the local lads to that of the rest of us adults to be quite honest i cant say i blame him but in a situation like this its bound to look suspicious especially if the investigating officer is someone with the sensitivity and understanding of a ds longbottom colin would take them trainspotting on the hill overlooking the main line for example or hed play cricket with them on the rec or hand out conkers when the season came he sometimes bought them sweets and ice creams even gave them books marbles and comics to my knowledge colin gormond had never once put a foot out of line never laid so much as a finger on any of the lads either in anger or in friendship there had however been one or two mutterings from some parents most notably from jack blackwell father of one of johnnys pals nick that it somehow wasnt right that it was unnatural for a man who must be in his late thirties or early forties to spend so much time playing with young children there must be something not quite right in his head he must be up to something jack blackwell hinted and as usual when someone starts a vicious rumour there is no shortage of willing believers such a reaction was only to be expected from someone of course but i knew it wouldnt go down well with ds longbottom i dont know why but i felt a strange need to protect colin colins a local i explained lived around here for years he plays with the lads a bit most of them like him he seems a harmless sort of fellow how old is he i shrugged hard to say about forty perhaps ds longbottom raised a thick eyebrow about forty and he plays with the kiddies you say sometimes like a schoolteacher or a youth club leader is he a schoolteacher no is he a youth club leader no look what i meant i know exactly what you meant mr bascombe now you just listen to what i mean what weve got here is an older man whos known to hang around with young children and hes been placed near the scene where a young child has gone missing now dont you think thats just a wee bit suspicious mary critchley let out a great wail and started crying again ds longbottom ignored her instead he concentrated all his venom on me the softie the liberal the defender of child molesters what do you have to say about that mr special constable bascombe only that colin was a friend to the children and that he had no reason to harm anyone friend ds longbottom sneered struggling to his feet we can only be thankful youre not regular police mr bascombe he said nodding to himself in acknowledgement of his own wisdom that we can so what are you going to do i asked ds longbottom looked at his watch and frowned either he was trying to work out what it meant when the little hand and the big hand were in the positions they were in or he was squinting because of poor eyesight ill have a word with this here colin gormond other than that theres not much more we can do tonight first thing tomorrow morning well drag the canal he got to the door turned pointed to the windows and said and dont forget to put up your blackout curtains mam or youll have the arp man to answer to mary critchley burst into floods of tears again even the soft dawn light could do nothing for the canal it oozed through the city like an open sewer oil slicks shimmering like rainbows in the sun brown water dotted with industrial scum and suds bits of driftwood and paper wrappings floating along with them on one side was ezekiel woodruffs scrapyard old woodruff was a bit of an eccentric he used to come around the streets with his horse and cart yelling any old iron but now the government had other uses for scrap metal supposedly to be used in aircraft manufacture poor old woodruff didnt have a way to make his living any more hed already sent old nell the carthorse to the knackers yard where she was probably doing her bit for the war effort by helping to make the glue to stick the aircraft together old mangles and bits of broken furniture stuck up from the ruins of the scrapyard like shattered artillery after a battle on the other side the bank rose steeply towards the backs of the houses on canal road and the people who lived there seemed to regard it as their personal tip flies and wasps buzzed around old hessian sacks and paper bags full of god knew what a couple of buckled bicycle tyres and a wheelless pram completed the picture i stood and watched as longbottom supervised the dragging a slow and laborious process that seemed to be sucking all manner of unwholesome objects to the surface except johnny critchleys body i felt tense at any moment i half expected the cry to come from one of the policemen in the boats that they had found him half expected to see the small pathetic bundle bob above the waters surface i didnt think colin gormond had done anything to johnny nor maurice though ds longbottom had seemed suspicious of him too but i did think that given how upset he was johnny might just have jumped in he never struck me as the suicidal type but i have no idea whether suicide enters the minds of nineyearolds all i knew was that he was upset about his father and he was last seen skulking by the canal so i stood around with ds longbottom and the rest as the day grew warmer and there was still no sign of johnny after about three hours the police gave up and went for bacon and eggs at bettys cafe over on chadwick road they didnt invite me and i was grateful to be spared both the unpleasant food and company i stood and stared into the greasy water a while longer unsure whether it was a good sign or not that johnny wasnt in the canal then i decided to go and have a chat with colin gormond what is it colin i asked him gently come on you can tell me but colin continued to stand with his back turned to me in the dark corner of his cramped living room hands to his face making eerie snuffling sounds shaking his head it was bright daylight outside but the blackout curtains were still drawn tightly and not a chink of light crept between their edges i had already tried the light switch but either colin had removed the bulb or he didnt have one come on colin this is silly you know me im mr bascombe i wont hurt you tell me what happened finally colin turned silent and came out of his corner with his funny shuffling way of walking someone said he had a club foot and someone else said hed had a lot of operations on his feet when he was a young lad but nobody knew for certain why he walked the way he did when he sat down and lit a cigarette the match light illuminated his large nose shiny forehead and watery blue eyes he used the same match to light a candle on the table beside him and then i saw them the black eye the bruise on his left cheek ds longbottom the bastard did you say anything to him i asked anxious that ds longbottom might have beaten a confession out of colin without even thinking that colin probably wouldnt still be at home if that were the case he shook his head mournfully nothing mr bascombe honest there was nothing i could tell him did you see johnny critchley yesterday colin aye where down by the canal what was he doing just standing there chucking stones in the water did you talk to him colin paused and turned away before answering no i had a brief coughing spell his cigarette smoke working on my gassed lungs when it cleared up i said colin theres something youre not telling me isnt there youd better tell me you know i wont hurt you and i just might be the only person who can help you he looked at me pale eyes imploring i only called out to him from the bridge like didnt i what happened next nothing i swear it did he answer no he just looked my way and shook his head i could tell then that he didnt want to play he seemed sad hed just heard his dads been killed colins already watery eyes brimmed with tears poor lad i nodded for all i knew colin might have been thinking about his dad too not many knew it but mr gormond senior had been killed in the same bloody war that left me with my bad lungs and scarred face what happened next colin colin shook his head and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand nothing he said it was such a lovely day i just went on walking i went to the park and watched the soldiers digging trenches then i went for my cigarettes and came home to listen to the wireless and after that i stayed in all evening thats right sometimes i go down to the white rose but but what colin well mr smedley you know the airraid precautions man i nodded i know him he said my blackout cloth wasnt good enough and hed fine me if i didnt get some proper stuff by yesterday i understand colin goodquality thick impenetrable blackout cloth had become both scarce and expensive which was no doubt why colin had been cheated in the first place anyway what with that and the cigarettes i reached into my pocket and slipped out a few bob for him colin looked away ashamed but i put it on the table and he didnt tell me to take it back i knew how it must hurt his pride to accept charity but i had no idea how much money he made or how he made it id never seen him beg but i had a feeling he survived on odd jobs and lived very much from hand to mouth i stood up all right colin i said thanks very much i paused at the door uncertain how to say what had just entered my mind finally i blundered ahead it might be better if you kept a low profile till they find him colin you know what some of the people around here are like what do you mean mr bascombe just be careful colin thats all i mean just be careful he nodded gormlessly and i left as i shut colins front door i noticed jack blackwell standing on his doorstep arms folded a small crowd of locals around him their shadows intersecting on the cobbled street they kept glancing towards colins house and when they saw me come out they all shuffled off except jack himself who gave me a grim stare before going inside and slamming his door i felt a shiver go up my spine as if a goose had stepped on my grave as my dear mother used to say bless her soul and when i got home i couldnt concentrate on my book one little bit by the following morning when johnny had been missing over thirtysix hours the mood in the street had started to turn ugly in my experience when you get right down to it theres no sorrier spectacle nothing much worse or more dangerous than the human mob mentality after all armies are nothing more than mobs really even when they are organized to a greater or lesser degree id been at ypres as you know and there wasnt a hell of a lot you could tell me about military organization so when i heard the muttered words on doorsteps saw the little knots of people here and there jack blackwell flitting from door to door like a political canvasser i had to do something and i could hardly count on any help from ds longbottom one thing i had learned both as a soldier and as a schoolteacher was that if you had a chance your best bet was to take out the ringleader that meant jack blackwell jack was the nasty type and he and i had had more than one runin over his son nicks bullying and poor performance in class in my opinion young nick was the sort of walking dead loss who should probably have been drowned at birth a waste of skin sinew tissue and bone and it wasnt hard to see where he got it from nicks older brother dave was already doing a long stretch in the scrubs for beating a night watchman senseless during a robbery and even the army couldnt find an excuse to spring him and enlist his service in killing germans mrs blackwell had been seen more than once walking with difficulty with bruises on her cheek the sooner jack blackwell got his callup papers the better things would be all around i intercepted jack between the deakins and the kellys houses and it was clear from his gruff what do you want that he didnt want to talk to me but i was adamant morning jack i greeted him lovely day for a walk isnt it whats it to you just being polite what are you up to jack whats going on none of your business up to your old tricks spreading poison i dont know what youre talking about he made to walk away but i grabbed his arm he glared at me but didnt do anything just as well at my age and with my lungs id hardly last ten seconds in a fight jack i said dont you think youd all be best off using your time to look for the poor lad look for him thats a laugh you know as well as i do where that young lad is where where is he jack you know no i dont tell me hes dead and buried thats what where jack i dont know the exact spot if hes not in the canal then hes buried somewhere not far away maybe he is but you dont know that not for certain and even if you believe that you dont know who put him there jack wrenched his arm out of my weakening grip and sneered ive got a damn sight better idea than you have frank bascombe with all your book learning then he turned and marched off somehow i got the feeling that i had just made things worse after my brief fracas with jack blackwell i was at a loose end i knew the police would still be looking for johnny asking questions searching areas of waste ground so there wasnt much i could do to help them feeling impotent i went down to the canal near woodruffs scrapyard old ezekiel woodruff himself was poking around in the ruins of his business so i decided to talk to him i kept my distance though for even on a hot day such as this woodruff was wearing his greatcoat and black wool gloves with the fingers cut off he wasnt known for his personal hygiene so i made sure i didnt stand downwind of him not that there was much of a wind but then it didnt take much morning ezekiel i said i understand young johnny critchley was down around here the day before yesterday so they say muttered ezekiel see him did you i werent here so you didnt see him police have already been asking questions and what did you tell them he pointed to the other side of the canal the back of the housing estate i were over there he said sometimes people chuck out summat of value even these days but you did see johnny he paused then said aye on this side of the canal woodruff nodded what time was this i dont have a watch but it werent long after that daft bloke had gone by do you mean colin gormond aye thats the one so johnny was still alone by the canal after colin had passed by ds longbottom had probably known this but he had beaten colin anyway one day id find a way to get even with him the breeze shifted a little and i got a whiff of stale sweat and worse what was johnny doing doing nowt special he were just walking walking where woodruff pointed that way towards the city centre alone aye and nobody approached him nope not while i were watching i didnt think there was anything further to be got from ezekiel woodruff so i bade him good morning i cant say the suspicion didnt enter my head that he might have had something to do with johnnys disappearance though id have been hard pushed to say exactly why or what odd though old woodruff might be there had never been any rumour or suspicion of his being overly interested in young boys and i didnt want to jump to conclusions the way jack blackwell had still i filed away my suspicions for later a fighter droned overhead i watched it dip and spin through the blue air and wished i could be up there id always regretted not being a pilot in the war a barge full of soldiers drifted by and i moved aside on the towpath to let the horse that was pulling it pass by for my troubles i got a full blast of sweaty horseflesh and a pile of steaming manure at my feet that had even ezekiel woodruff beat aimlessly i followed the direction ezekiel had told me johnny had walked in towards the city centre as i walked jack blackwells scornful words about my inability to find johnny echoed in my mind book learning that was exactly the kind of cheap insult you would expect from a moron like jack blackwell but it hurt nonetheless no sense telling him id been buried in the mud under the bodies of my comrades for two days no sense telling him about the young german soldier id surprised and bayoneted to death twisting the blade until it snapped and broke off inside him jack blackwell was too young to have seen action in the last war but if there was any justice in the world hed damn well see it in this one the canal ran by the back of the train station where i crossed the narrow bridge and walked through the crowds of evacuees out front to city square mary critchleys anguish reverberated in my mind too mr bashcombe mr bashcombe i heard her call then all of a sudden as i looked at the black facade of the post office and the statue of the black prince in the centre of city square it hit me i thought i knew what had happened to johnny critchley but first i had to go back to the street and ask just one important question it was late morning the station smelt of damp soot and warm oil crowds of children thronged around trying to find out where they were supposed to go they wore name tags and carried little cardboard boxes adults with clipboards for the most part temporarily unemployed schoolteachers and local volunteers directed them to the right queue and their names were ticked off as they boarded the carriages despite being neither an evacuated child nor a supervisor i managed to buy a ticket and ended up sharing a compartment with a rather severelooking woman in a brown uniform i didnt recognize and a male civilian with a brush moustache and a lot of brylcreem on his hair they seemed to be in charge of several young children also in the compartment who couldnt sit still i could hardly blame them they were going to the alien countryside to live with strangers far away from their parents for only god knew how long and the idea scared them half to death the buttoned cushions were warm and the air in the carriage still and close despite the open window when we finally set off the motion stirred up a breeze which helped a little on the wall opposite me was a poster of the scarborough seafront and i spent most of the journey remembering the carefree childhood holidays i had enjoyed there with my parents in the early years of the century another world another time the rest of the trip i glanced out of the window beyond the scumscabbed canal and saw the urban industrial landscape drift by back gardens where some people had put in anderson shelters halfcovered with earth to grow vegetables on the dark mass of the town hall clock tower behind the city centre buildings a factory yard where several men were loading heavy crates onto a lorry flushed and sweating in the heat then we were in the countryside where the smells of grass hay and manure displaced the reek of the city i saw small squat farms drystone walls sheep and cattle grazing soon train tracks and canal diverged we went through a long noisy tunnel and the children whimpered later i was surprised to see so many army convoys winding along the narrow roads and the one big aerodrome we passed seemed buzzing with activity all in all the journey took a little over two hours only about ten or eleven children were shepherded off at the small country station and i followed as they were met and taken to the village hall where the men and women who were to care for them waited it was more civilized than some of the evacuation systems id heard about which sounded more like the slave markets of old where farmers waited on the platforms to pick out the strong lads and local dignitaries whisked away the nicely dressed boys and girls i went up to the volunteer in charge an attractive young country woman in a simple blue frock with a white lace collar and a belt around her slim waist and asked her if she had any record of an evacuee called john or johnny critchley she checked her records then shook her head as i knew she would if i were right johnny wouldnt be here under his own name i explained my problem to the woman who told me her name was phyllis rigby she had a yellow ribbon in her long wavy hair and smelled of fresh apples i dont see how anything like that could have happened phyllis said weve been very meticulous but there again things have been a little chaotic she frowned in thought for a moment then she delegated her present duties to another volunteer come on she said ill help you go from house to house there werent that many evacuees you know far fewer than we expected i nodded id heard how a lot of parents werent bothering to evacuate their children they cant see anything happening yet i said just you wait after the first air raid youll have so many you wont have room for them all phyllis smiled the poor things it must be such an upheaval for them indeed i took deep welcome breaths of country air as phyllis and i set out from the village hall to visit the families listed on her clipboard there were perhaps a couple of hundred houses and less than fifty per cent had received evacuees even so we worked up quite a sweat calling at them all or i did rather as sweating didnt seem to be in phylliss nature we chatted as we went me telling her about my school teaching and she telling me about her husband thomas training as a fighter pilot in the raf after an hour or so with no luck we stopped in at her cottage for a refreshing cup of tea then we were off again at last late in the afternoon we struck gold mr and mrs douglas who were billeting johnny critchley seemed a very pleasant couple and they were sad to hear that they could not keep him with them for a while longer i explained everything to them and assured them that they would get someone else as soon as we had the whole business sorted out hes not here johnny said as we walked with phyllis to the station ive looked everywhere but i couldnt find him i shook my head sorry johnny you know your mums got a speech impediment that was why i had to go back and ask her exactly what she said to you before i came here she said she told you your father was missing in action which the way it came out sounded like missing in acksham didnt it thats why you came here wasnt it to look for your father young johnny nodded tears in his eyes im sorry he said i couldnt understand why she didnt come and look for him she must be really vexed with me i patted his shoulder i dont think so more like shell be glad to see you how did you manage to sneak in with the real evacuees by the way johnny wiped his eyes with his grubby sleeve at the station there were so many people standing around at first i didnt know then i saw a boy i knew from playing cricket on the rec oliver bradley i said the boy whose name johnny was registered under yes he goes to broad hill i nodded though i had never heard of oliver bradley i knew the school it was just across the valley from us go on i asked him where he was going and he said he was being sent to acksham it was perfect but how did you get him to change places with you he didnt want to not at first how did you persuade him johnny looked down at the road and scraped at some gravel with the scuffed tip of his shoe it cost me a complete set of great cricketers cigarette cards ones my dad gave me before he went away i smiled it would have to be something like that and i made him promise not to tell anyone just to go home and say there wasnt room for him and hed have to try again in a few days i just needed enough time to find dad you know i know we arrived at the station where johnny sat on the bench and phyllis and i chatted in the late afternoon sunlight our shadows lengthening across the tracks in addition to the birds singing in the trees and hedgerows i could hear grasshoppers chirruping a sound you rarely heard in the city i had often thought how much i would like to live in the country and perhaps when i retired from teaching a few years in the future i would be able to do so we didnt have long to wait for our train i thanked phyllis for all her help told her i wished her husband well and she waved to us as the old banger chugged out of the station it was past blackout when i finally walked into our street holding johnnys hand he was tired after his adventure and had spent most of the train journey with his head on my shoulder once or twice from the depths of a dream he had called his fathers name i could sense that something was wrong as soon as i turned the corner it was nothing specific just a sudden chill at the back of my neck because of the blackout i couldnt see anything clearly but i got a strong impression of a knot of shifting shadows just a little bit darker than the night itself milling around outside colin gormonds house i quickened my step and as i got nearer i heard a whisper pass through the crowd when they saw johnny then the shadows began to disperse slinking and sidling away disappearing like smoke into the air from somewhere mary critchley lurched forward with a cry and took young johnny in her arms i let him go i could hear her thanking me between sobs but i couldnt stop walking the first thing i noticed when i approached colins house was that the window was broken and half the blackout curtain had been ripped away next i saw that the door was slightly ajar i was worried that colin might be hurt but out of courtesy i knocked and called out his name nothing i pushed the door open and walked inside it was pitch dark i didnt have a torch with me and i knew that colins light didnt work but i remembered the matches and the candle on the table i lit it and held it up before me as i walked forward i didnt have far to look if i hadnt had the candle i might have bumped right into him first i saw his face about level with mine his frothspecked lips had turned blue and a trickle of dried blood ran from his left nostril the blackout cloth was knotted around his neck in a makeshift noose attached to a hook screwed into the lintel over the kitchen door as i stood back and examined the scene further i saw that his downturned toes were about three inches from the floor and there was no sign of an upset chair or stool harmless colin gormond friend to the local children dead i felt the anger well up in me along with the guilt it was my fault i shouldnt have gone dashing off to acksham like that in search of johnny or i should at least have taken colin with me i knew the danger he was in i had talked to jack blackwell before i left how could i have been so stupid so careless as to leave colin to his fate with only a warning he didnt understand maybe colin had managed to hang himself somehow without standing on a stool though i doubted it but whether or not jack blackwell or the rest had actually laid a finger on him they were all guilty of driving him to it in my book besides if jack or anyone else from the street had strung colin up there would be evidence fibres fingerprints footprints whatever and even ds bloody longbottom wouldnt be able to ignore that i stumbled outside and made my way towards the telephone box on the corner not a soul stirred now but as i went i heard one door jack blackwells door close softly this time as if he thought that too much noise might wake the dead and the dead might have a tale or two to tell memory lane another shitty gig in more ways than one i can smell the colostomy bags the minute we walk in the front doors i shudder as i always do when we enter a place like this one day and it might not be long i know i wont be coming out the recreation director is waiting to greet us crisp blue suit and morningside accent why do rds all have scottish accents even in vancouver a gold name tag just above the swell of her left breast tells me her name is emily actually if you look closely our emilys not that bad at all despite the illfitting glasses and lifeless hair youll be the musicians then nervously eyeing her wristwatch why does it sound like an insult well be the musicians i admit then i introduce the band memory lane there are five of us three of us expat brits kit stark a washedup hippie is our drummer kit took one too many hits of acid on the isle of wight ferry nearly thirty years ago when theyd fished him out of the solent and done artificial respiration he spent the next twenty years in and out of the nut house hallucinating plankton before washing up on the shores of nova scotia then theres benny leiberman our morose alcoholic bass player from des moines taffy lloyd plays trumpet and trombone and when hes not doing that hes our vocalist he looks like harry secombe but sounds more like one of the spice girls the hunchback of notre band geoff carroll plays piano guitar and vibes and does most of our arrangements hes so shortsighted that he has developed a permanent hunch from leaning over the keyboard to read the music last but not least theres me dex hill well my real name is william hill but wouldnt you change that for something a bit more jazzysounding apple of my music teachers eye future clarinet soloist for the london symphony orchestra failed the next john coltrane failed and husband to the beautiful sexy and cruel andrea also failed get the picture i suppose youd like to tune up then suggests emily tune up you dont tune up a clarinet or a saxophone or a trumpet for that matter perhaps benny wants to mess around with his bass strings though the way hes shaking he looks more as if he needs a drink i nod follow me ill show you the dressing room we follow emilys gently swaying hips down the corridor if we exude a general aroma of booze and smoke especially with those filthy french cigarettes benny smokes she affects not to notice what does she go home to my emily i wonder how does she get the aura of death and disease out of her system when she leaves here sex drugs maybe ill ask her once were settled in the broom closet they call a dressing room emilyless benny takes out a fifth of jim beam and inhales he doesnt offer it around he never does some people might think thats rude but were used to him and his strange lonely ways by now kit and i share a spliff just another little smell lost among the faeces and sour sweat taffy as is his wont puffs on a rothmans and does a few vocal exercises geoff studies the music as if its the first time hes ever set eyes on it he always does in a way i feel sorry for geoff because wherever we go the poor sod always gets stuck with an outoftune piano still he takes it in his stride very phlegmatic is geoff lots of sangfroid you have to have with a hunchback like his anyway after a few minutes of this and a chat about the order of songs emily returns and were ready to face the chanting crowds theyve been looking forward to this all week you know she says with a tight morningside smile a lot of them were in the war with the canadian armed forces or with the raf itll mean a lot to them hearing those old songs played again well there are about twenty people in the recreation room which is quite a crowd for this sort of gig i remember one rd apologizing i think it was in swift current or red deer that there would have been more people in the audience only two of them croaked during the night that seemed a bit excessive to me i mean one maybe you might expect but two there they sit a pathetic bunch of losers waiting to die it gives me the shivers just to look at them empty husks nothing left except bodily functions even those who have arses left probably need someone to wipe them most sit in wheelchairs reptilian talons plucking at the tartan blankets spread over their knees some have the head shakes some drool and twitch every now and then still i suppose ive seen worse audiences in toronto jazz clubs a quick count and were off tennessee waltz always a nice easy swinger to start with intro done taffy comes in with the vocals sounding more like tiny tim than sporty spice today one two three here we go hey up theres one bloke on the nod already i was dancing with my darling i was the best dancer thats why she chose me i was the best dancer she wasnt carls to start with wasnt anyones just another girl at a forces dance on a saturday night carl was the handsomest he always got the pick of the girls but not this time i was the best dancer just put his nose out of joint a little thats all i didnt steal her from anyone she melted in my arms her shape moulded against me we were missing halves of a whole and the purpose the music had been waiting for we completed it carried it away from its airy pointlessness to something more profound we gave the music meaning bullshit ofarrell you stole your best friends sweetheart pure and simple and all the rest all this about profundity and meaning is bullshit lust thats all it was lust and revenge for all those times when carl got the girl and look what happened a twoweek honeymoon then you took her thousands of miles away from her family and friends spent the next fifty years in and out of the bottle and drove the poor bitch to an early grave no no it wasnt like that im tired so tired of arguing with myself on the nod just as were going into cheek to cheek christ how stimulating we must be what fucking exciting memories we must invoke still hes twitching a bit in his wheelchair so i suppose he must still be alive his mouth seems to be moving maybe hes trying to sing along sometimes they do but no this one looks more as if hes having a conversation with himself only halfmouthing the words hardly daring to give them full breath a little string of drool hangs from his chin shit i hate this job solo time man remember what geoff told you stick real close to the melody line dex youre not coltrane playing my favourite things you know thanks a lot geoff and fuck you heaven im in heaven dancing cheek to cheek a hot night in late july a little dance hall in a small town near the base maybe used to be the church hall or the womens institute a few rickety tables a makeshift bar selling warm beer and weak scotch weak beer and warm scotch whatever dim air thick with smoke hanging in the lights blue straight from the cigarette grey when it comes out of the lungs everyone smoked then all of us it was the least of our worries cheek to cheek was the first song we danced to the first time the magic hit but why does my memory smell of burning rubber and leather instead of her perfume why do flames and smoke blossom when i close my eyes and lean into her im holding her close enough that she could almost be a part of me and im smelling hot metal and engine oil bombenbrandschrumpfleichen my god carl where did that come from not now not yet that was later back to the dance holding her some of her face powder rubbed off when my lips brushed her cheek it tasted like chalk carl was pissed i could tell but i was flying that night funny i was flying the night before too and it was my turn for once theyd only been out together a couple of times it wasnt serious besides how was i to know that mary and i would fall in love it was just another dance for crying out loud wed been to hundreds of them and carl always got the bestlooking women but i was the best dancer and carl had no chance this time when she and i were dancing cheek to cheek me tasting chalk or was it stardust smelling rubber burn and hearing those crackling noises arcing in my brain from ear to ear christ just look at them will you half of them are asleep about a third are deaf and threequarters have no faculties left at all what does that make is anyone out there listening at all and that hunchbacked bastard geoff gives me the evil eye for wandering too far on the stardust solo as if anyone notices poor bastards piano is so out of tune it sounds like a warped lp funny all of a sudden im thinking of that bitch andrea was stardust playing when we met on our first date im damned if i remember stairway to heaven more likely or maybe bitches brew all i remember is ripping her panties off and fucking her hard up against the apartment door the minute we got back from the gig play it dex all the things you are bird trane lead the way and to hell with geoffs evil eye carl wouldnt talk to me all the next day and the next hed really wanted mary the way a boy wants candy and he was jealous as hell i didnt tell him anything didnt tell him about the softness of her body as we made love in the warm field that july night the taste of the beet juice on her lips the smooth warm skin nipples hard as berries on my tongue between her legs like warm wet silk and how she cried out my name when she came not his mine and clung to me afterwards for dear life as we lay against the drystone wall and watched squadron after squadron of lancasters pass over the halfmoon blotting out its light like the plague of locusts armadas from hell held me tighter as the roar of the bombers filled the sky bombenbrandschrumpfleichen no that wasnt till later we didnt know then the same way we didnt know smoking was killing us we didnt know but does that really make it any different in the end another evil look from geoff well to hell with him let the miserable bastard fire me ive had it with this anyway in the middle of a kiss taffy always does a good job on this one you just dont expect that alto voice to come out of someone so fat look at that guy the way his heads swaying if its the shakes at least hes in time with the music maybe some of them are capable of getting a little simple pleasure out of us after all christ if andrea could see me now shed laugh until she pissed herself and tell me id found my true destiny here we go man blowing up a storm firestorm they had to invent new names for the way people died bombenbrandschrumpfleichen incendiarybombshrunken bodies then there were the ones who melted asphyxiated baked or just plain roasted and the human torches running down streets on fire arms flailing these were the important factories and docks we were told we destroyed the firestorm sucked in all the surrounding air made winds rage fast as cyclones suffocated all the people hiding in shelters cellars and bunkers fifteen hundred degrees fahrenheit at the core spontaneous combustion bombenbrandschrumpfleichen and the night after that i stole my best friends girl because i was the best dancer that was the night we clung to one another watching the bombers set out again six raids day and night night and day killed injured burned maimed her skin warm and smooth wet silk between her thighs bombers blanking out the stars and the moon making bombenbrandschrumpfleichen and the night after that carl bought it blue flame that should slow them down a bit before our fiery finale and a nice searing blues solo for me most of them are asleep now anyway theres even one old dear snoring in the far corner by the vase of flowers and theres emily hands clasped on her lap thin smile on her face is she enjoying us as a matter of fact i wouldnt mind fucking emily stick it to her hard right up that tight morningside arse of hers and take that smile off her face bet shes a screamer that old guys having a real struggle with himself now ought to be in a fucking nuthouse not a rest home drooling and muttering arguing with himself it wasnt fair wed finished we were heading home successful looking forward to a hot cup of tea and a long sleep no fighters in sight but then it never is fair is it wed dropped our load made more bombenbrandschrumpfleichen got out of the flack unscathed and all of a sudden there it was a lone messerschmitt whether he was lost or just scavenging looking for stragglers i dont know but he buzzed at us like an angry wasp and let rip he could outmanoeuvre us easily and his machinegun fire ripped through the plane as if our fuselage were made of paper i could smell the fires breaking out behind us me and clarky my copilot we started spewing smoke and losing altitude one of our gunners hit the schmitt and it exploded at ten oclock we were bucking and swinging to starboard like an old short stirling god knows how we made it but we did clarky and me we came limping in the minute we got beyond the old white cliffs and crashlanded in a field the tail section broke off and flames leapt up all around us within minutes we were surrounded by a crowd of gaping yokels right out of a thomas hardy novel whether they wore smocks and carried pitchforks i cant be certain but thats how i see them when i look now and when i went back to see how carl was doing thats when i found him he was dead along with the others in back all black and burned up uniform and skin fused welded into one his knees crooked and his arms tightened up and fists clenched like a boxer aimed at me for one of those stupid moments before realitys cold blade pierced the back of my brain i thought he was getting ready to fight me we hadnt spoken for three days because of mary and i knew he was still pissed but he was dead burned and shrivelled bombenbrandschrumpfleichen just like the people of hamburg carl you poor sad cocky twoleftfooted bastard you were the handsomest the most charming you were the lady killer but come waltz tango or jitterbug goddammit i was the best dancer i was the best dancer i was the best dancer i was the best dancer one two three and blow that bugle taffy lets wake the buggers up bugle call rag and jesus christ will you look at him the old bastards on his feet taffy flashes me a big grin and we get in the groove i can feel geoffs eyes boring into the back of my head fuck him things are jumping now taffy and i are trading licks like we havent done in years trumpet and sax dizzy and bird miles and trane look at the guy go hes out of his chair and jumping up and down yelling at the top of his lungs baggy pants slipping down his hips i was the best dancer i was the best dancer sure you were buddy all of a sudden he seems to reach some sort of inner peak or crescendo as my sax and taffys trumpet join in some of the weirdest harmonies weve ever found hes on tiptoe stretching his arms as high as he can reaching for the ceiling or for heaven then his whole body starts shaking taffy trails off to take a break and i blow harder urging the old guy higher but hes out of synch with us now whatever hes into eyes closed head tilted towards the ceiling its nothing to do with our music his pants are down around his ankles his shrivelled scrotum and shrunken penis there for all to see i stop the solo and turn to catch geoffs dagger gaze i grin at him and shrug he leads us back to the opening riff in a few spare tightassed chords the old man stiffens then drops to the floor spent one by one we let the music dribble away from us then theres the strangest sensation the room seems to draw in on him as if all its energy focuses on that single inert figure everything feels tight like a corked bottle about to blow the room fills with pressure and its hard against my eardrums that deaf and fuzzy feeling before your ears pop on an airplane everything silent and in slow motion then it pops the air hisses out and hes just someone lying on the floor jesus whispers the man beside him when i go i want to go just like that then the smooth practised staff breeze in like a team of office cleaners or scene changers between the acts of a play and start to tidy up the mess in a silence as heavy as prayer someone in white checks the old mans pulse and takes out a stethoscope the other inmates dazed mumbling and drooling are all wheeled back to their rooms and its getting to look like nothing ever happened before theyre done emily starts leading us back to the dressing room i think it would probably be best all around if you left now dont you think she says then we can get everyone calmed down they take it hard some of them when one of them passes on you know see their own future i suppose poor things dont worry youll be paid your normal rate of course it wasnt your fault after all was it i nod dumbly walking beside her shes right of course it wasnt our fault no reason why we shouldnt get paid but even so see their own future i suppose somehow that echoes gets to me so much that i forget to ask for her phone number and i remember it afterwards in the van but this time benny passes around the jim beam and kit rolls another spliff and soon its just another memory of just another shitty gig after all just another slice of turd on the nursinghome circuit carrion isnt it strange the way two strangers might strike up a casual acquaintance due simply to a quirk of fate and isnt it even stranger how that innocent meeting might so completely alter the life of one of them that was exactly what happened when edward grainger and i met in a pub one wet september lunchtime only weeks before his tragic loss i work in a bank in the city its a dull job enlivened only by the occasional surge of adrenalin when the pound takes yet another plunge on the foreign exchange markets and most lunchtimes i like to get out of the office and take refuge in the masons arms as a rule i will drink half a pint of guinness with a slice of quiche or a cheese roll say and perhaps once in a while treat myself to a steak and kidney pie as i eat i work at the times crossword which i never seem able to finish before my glass is empty and after my meal i enjoy a cigarette i know the vile things are bad for me but i cant quite seem to give them up besides how bad can one cigarette a day be and only five days a week at that given its location in the city the masons arms is generally busy noisy and smoky by half past twelve on a weekday and that suits me just fine lost in the crowd buffeted by conversation and laughter that require no response on my part i can concentrate on my crossword or allow my mind to drift in directions that the constant application of little grey cells to columns of figures precludes that particular lunchtime i found myself leaving the office a few minutes later than usual due to an important telephone conversation with an overseas client the short walk also took longer because i had to struggle against the wind and rain with my rather flimsy umbrella when i got to the arms as i had taken to calling it i found my usual little corner table already taken by a stranger in a pinstripe suit i could hardly tell him to sod off so i carried my drink over and sat opposite him as he read his times i studied his features closely i would guess his age at about fortyfive mostly because of the wrinkles around his eyes and the grey hair around his temples and ears but having said that i would have to admit that the overall effect of his face was one of youthfulness he had bright blue eyes and a healthy ruddy complexion and he showed no sign of that dark shadowy stubble that makes so many men look downright repulsive not to mention sinister after i had finished my ham roll i lit my cigarette and wrestled with eight down letting the ebb and flow of conversation drift over me until a voice seemed to single itself out from the crowd and speak directly to me startled i noticed the man opposite looking at me in a way that suggested he had just spoken pardon i said i was miles away crippen he said eight down quiet prince upset for this murderer its an anagram of prince and p for silent yes i do see that thank you very much if my tone was a little frosty it served the bugger right i hate it when people solve my crossword clues for me the same way i hate anyone reading over my shoulder takes all the fun out of it his face dropped when he saw the look i gave him im sorry he said very rude of me didnt think its all right i put the crossword aside and flicked a column of ash at the floor look you wouldnt happen to know anything about septic tanks would you he asked im afraid not as far as conversational gambits went this fellow wasnt exactly heading for the top of the class in my book oh pity you see were having one installed in a couple of weeks my wife harriet and i im just not sure what kind of mess to expect well i suppose theyll have to dig the garden up i told him but i cant honestly say ive ever seen one so i dont know how big they are he smiled well thats the point isnt it youre not supposed to see them were moving to the country you know to hampshire why are you moving i asked and though i surprised myself by asking such a personal question of a complete stranger it felt natural enough he sipped his gin and tonic before replying its for harriet mostly he said wants the country air not that id knock it mind you and its a beautiful cottage or it will be after the renovations seventeenth century ill keep the flat in town of course go down to the country at weekends yes im sure itll work out i hope so i told him then i excused myself and headed back to the bank it being almost onethirty and mr beamish the branch manager being a real stickler for punctuality as time went on our conversations became a regular feature of my lunchtime visits to the arms though i would be hard pushed now to think of everything we discussed politics of course on which we disagreed books on which we agreed far more than we would have imagined and marriage about which we couldnt quite make up our minds sometimes we would just work on the crossword together in silence he also talked about weekends at the country house of autumn walks in the woods the occasional hovercraft trip to the isle of wight quiet nights with a good bottle of claret a hefty volume of trollope and a log fire crackling in the hearth though i had never fancied country living myself i must admit that edwards accounts made me quite envious so much so that when evelyn brought up the subject at home after watching a documentary on the cotswolds i thought it might become a real possibility for us too in a year or twos time edward and i never met at any other times or places ours was a purely casual arrangement but i like to think that a sort of friendship developed sometimes he didnt turn up at all he worked in international finance he told me and now and then he had to sacrifice his lunch hour for emergency meetings or telephone calls from strange time zones occasionally he had to go abroad for a few days but when he did come we usually contrived to sit together and chat over our drinks and rolls for half an hour or so during that time i didnt find out very much more about his private life and if i were to come to any conclusions they would be due entirely to my reading between the lines i didnt ask edward about his wifes occupation for example but somehow i got the impression that she spent most of her time at home cooking cakedecorating cleaning sewing knitting and such what people used to call a housewife in the old days i suppose now she could call herself an estate manager down in hampshire as far as their relationship went it sounded perfectly normal to me though i had never met harriet im sure you can imagine how shocked i was on that bright windy thursday in early october when edward came in a quarter of an hour later than usual looking drawn and haggard and told me that his wife had disappeared naturally i tried to comfort him as best i could over the following weeks at least as far as our brief and irregular meetings allowed but there was little i could do for the most part i could only look on sadly as edward lost weight and his former ruddy complexion turned wan soon he came to remind me of the wretched youth in keatss poem alone and palely loitering weeks passed and still there was no sign of harriet theories as to her disappearance varied as they do in cases like this one tabloid speculated that she had been abducted by a serial killer then chopped up and buried somewhere a local doctor suggested that she could have suffered some form of amnesia if so he went on she might easily have wandered off and ended up living on the streets of london with the thousands of other lost and lonely souls one neighbour edward told me speculated that harriet could have been actually planning her escape for some time and had simply taken off for america ireland or france to start a new life under a new name with a new man of course astonishingly edward also told me that even he had come under police suspicion at one time albeit not for long christmas came and went it was about as cheerful as a wet weekend in july the way it usually is for families whose children have all grown up and left home edward seemed to have gained a little colour when i saw him after the holidays or perhaps the arctic winds we had that january had rubbed his skin raw anyway it was around then that he started dropping in at the arms for lunch less and less frequently by the beginning of february i hadnt seen him for three weeks and i was slipping easily back into my old routine of doing the crossword over lunch i missed his company of course and i was certainly curious about harriet but we are creatures of habit are we not and old habits are deeply ingrained it was near the end of march when i saw him next but it wasnt in the arms no i had come into the west end to shop one saturday afternoon mostly to get out of the way while evelyn was busy planting the herbaceous borders i hate gardening and if im around i usually get roped in anyway i was browsing downstairs in the fiction section of waterstones on charing cross road when i saw edward across the table of new releases it took me a moment to recognize him because he was wearing casual clothes and seemed to have done something to remove the grey from his hair he was also fingering the new will self paperback which one would hardly expect of a trollope man on second glance though i realized it was definitely edward and that the pretty young blonde with the prominent breasts didnt just happen to be standing beside him she was with him surely this couldnt be the elusive harriet then a strange thing happened edward caught my eye as i walked over and i saw a very odd look pass over his features for a moment i could have sworn he wanted to turn tail and avoid me but i got to him before he could retreat edward i said its good to see you then i looked at the blonde i could see her roots i see harriet has turned up then i said with a smile edward cleared his throat and the blonde merely frowned well er he said not exactly i mean no she hasnt this is joyce he put his arm around the blondes shoulders and looked down at her with obvious pride and passion i said hello to joyce as edward haltingly explained our relationship such as it was then he made excuses and they hurried up the stairs as if the place were on fire that was the last time i ever clapped eyes on edward grainger about a year after the incident in waterstones something so profound so shocking and so unexpected happened to me that my life was never to be the same again i fell in love like most people my age i had long thought myself immune to powerful passions long settled into a sedate and comfortable existence with little in the way of strong emotion to upset its even keel if i have unsatisfied or unrequited hopes and wishes then i am in good company for who hasnt if i regret some of the sacrifices i have made for the comforts i have gained who doesnt and if i sometimes feel that my life lacks adventure lacks spice then again who doesnt in all that i felt i was perfectly normal life it had come to seem to me was a slow betrayal of the dreams of ones youth and a gradual decline from the desires of ones adolescence little did i know what a fragile illusion all that was until i met katrina imagine if you can my utter amazement when the bells started to ring the earth moved and a sudden spring came into my step every time i saw her absurd i told myself shell never pay the least attention to an old fuddyduddy like you but she did oh indeed she did love truly must be blind if such a gorgeous creature as katrina could give herself to me katrina came to work for the branch in summer and by autumn we were meeting clandestinely whenever we could she lived alone in a tiny bedsit in kennington which was convenient if a bit cramped but what is a little discomfort to a pair of lovers we were consumed with a passion that could no more be stopped than an avalanche or a tidal wave it picked us up tossed us about like rag dolls and threw us back on the ground dazed dazzled and breathless i couldnt get enough of her sad eyes her soft red lips her small breasts with the nipples hard as acorns when we made love her skin like warm brown silk needless to say this affair made life very difficult both at work and at home but i think i managed to cope well enough under the circumstances i know i succeeded in hiding it from evelyn for i surely would have felt the repercussions had i not we went on meeting furtively for almost a year during which time our passion did not abate in the least katrina never once asked me to abandon my marriage and live with her but i wanted to oh god how i wanted to only the thought of all the trouble all the upheaval that such a move would cause prevented me for evelyn wouldnt take it lying down so like many others embroiled in affairs i simply let it run on perhaps hoping vaguely that some deus ex machina would come along and solve my problems for me then one day after an excruciatingly painful christmas spent away from katrina evelyn reminded me of a conversation we had had some time ago about getting a country cottage and pointed out the ideal place in an estate agents brochure a rundown isolated cottage in oxfordshire going for a song furiously i began to think of how such a move might prevent me from seeing katrina as often as i needed to we would have to sell the dulwich house of course but the oxfordshire cottage was indeed going for such an unbelievably low price that i might be able to afford a small flat in town at a pinch however evelyn might suggest i could commute the thought of that was unbearable though katrina and i wouldnt be separated totally anything other than a quick session after work before the train home would be impossible and neither of us wanted to live like that a quickie in the back of a car is so sordid and we were passionately romantically in love on the other hand i could hardly crush evelyns dreams of a place in the country without thinking up a damn good explanation as to why we should simply stay put and i couldnt the price was right and we might not have another chance for years even with the renovations that would need to be done we worked out we could still easily afford it and so we took the plunge and bought the cottage to say i was a soul in torment might sound like an exaggeration but believe me it doesnt even come close to describing how wretched i really felt as i signed on the dotted line we had sent sam halsey a jackofalltrades in the renovation business over to oxfordshire on a number of occasions to assess what needed doing and how it could be done to our liking and to our budget one of his complaints was that due to its isolation and to the odd whims of its previous owners the toilet arrangements were far from adequate after much deliberation one afternoon at the house in dulwich sam said of course you could have a septic tank put in a what i said a septic tank perfectly respectable lots of country folk have them of course youll need some carrion im sorry sam i dont follow you carrion to get the whole process going now some of the younger chaps in the business will tell you a bit of compost will do the job just fine but dont believe them dont you believe them my old boss told me sams voice faded into the background as suddenly it hit me i thought of my old lunchtime companion edward grainger and that guilty look that flitted across his features the time i saw him in waterstones with joyce the blonde i remembered the tragedy of his wifes disappearance and how after that i saw less and less of him and i remembered how the disappearance occurred around the time they were having a septic tank installed at their cottage in hampshire carrion indeed and then i thought of my katrina my beautiful beautiful katrina who took my breath away with her sad eyes and her skin like warm brown silk and lastly i thought of evelyn life just isnt fair is it some people dont simply fade away quietly into the obscurity from whence they came when you want rid of them do they no they have to cause trouble create scenes make unreasonable demands and generally do their damnedest to ruin your hopes of a decent and happy future without them they just wont go away well as i have already explained evelyn is one of those people im certain of it on the other hand people disappear all the time dont they and people change harriet changed into joyce didnt she sometimes you just have to give a little kickstart to get the process going like the carrion in the septic tank and then nature takes care of the rest penny for them what oh im sorry sam miles away thats all right i was just saying as how youll need some carrion for the septic tank my old boss swore by it he did at that moment evelyn passed by the open french windows in his shabby beige cardigan secateurs in hand wisps of grey hair blew in the march wind like spiders webs and his glasses had slipped down his nose yes people disappear all the time dont they and if it can happen to wives i thought then it can bloody well happen to husbands too yes sam i said slowly yes i suppose we will dont worry ill take care of it april in paris the girl sitting outside the cafe reminds me of april she has the same long hennaed hair which she winds around her index finger in the same abstracted way she is waiting for someone clearly a lover perhaps and as she waits she smokes holding her cigarette in the same way taking the same short hurried puffs that april used to do with her free hand she alternates between taking sips of milky pastis and tapping her cigarette packet on the table she is smoking marlboro as everyone in paris seems to do these days back then it was all gitanes gauloises and disque bleus still it wasnt smoking that killed april it was love it is late september and though the weather is mild it is still too cold outside for an old man like me with blood as thin and as lacking in nutrients as workhouse gruel instead i sit inside the little cafe on the boulevard st germain over a pichet of red wine just watching the people come and go the young people i have spent most of my life surrounded by the young and though i grow inexorably older every year they always seem to stay young immortal youth like tithonus i am a whitehaired shadow roaming like a dream but unlike tennysons luckless narrator who gained eternal life but not eternal youth i am not immortal six months perhaps less the doctors say something is growing inside me my cells are mutating as yet i feel little pain though my appetite has diminished and i often suffer from extreme weariness dying i find lends an edge to living gives a clarity and a special golden hue to the quotidian scenes parading before me a swarthy man with a briefcase glancing at his watch speeding up late for an important appointment a woman chastising her little girl at the corner wagging her finger the girl crying and stamping her foot a distracted priest stumbling briefly as he walks up the steps to the church across the boulevard dying accentuates the beauty of the young sets their energy in relief enhances the smooth glow of their unwrinkled skin but dying does not make me bitter i am resigned to my fate i have come to the end of my threescore and ten i have seen enough if you wish to travel my doctors told me do it now while youre still strong enough so here i am revisiting the scene of my one and only great amour april she always pronounced it apreel when i think of her i still hear thelonious monk playing april in paris hesitantly at first feeling his way into the song reluctant to define the theme then worrying away at it and once finding it altering it so much that the music becomes his own only to be abandoned finally of course april didnt give a tinkers for thelonious monk she listened to him dutifully as they all did for they were the heirs of kerouac ginsberg and burroughs to whom monk bird trane miles and mingus were gods sacred and cool but aprils generation had its own gods the doors cream jimi hendrix bob dylan gods of words and images as well as of music and it was they who provided the soundtrack to which i lived during my year as a visiting lecturer in american literature at the sorbonne in this cafe hasnt changed much a lick of paint perhaps if that it probably hasnt changed much since hemingway and fitzgerald used to hang out around here even the waiters are probably the same it was here i first met april of course why else would i come here one fine evening towards the end of march that year when i was still young enough to bear the slight chill of a clear spring evening that april was beautiful almost goes without saying i remember her high cheekbones her smooth olive complexion dark watchful eyes and rich moist lips downturned at the edges often making her look sulky or petulant when she was far from it i remember also how she used to move with grace and confidence when she remembered but how the gaucheness of late adolescence turned her movements into a country girls gait when she was at her most unselfconscious she was tall slim and longlegged and her breasts were small round and high the breasts of a cranach nude we met as i say one late march evening in at this cafe the café de la lune where i was then sitting with the usual group henri nadine brad brigitte alain and paul this was only days after daniel cohnbendit and seven other students had occupied the deans office at nanterre to protest against the recent arrest of six members of the national vietnam committee an event that was to have cataclysmic effects on us all not long afterwards much of the time in those days we spoke of revolution but that evening we were discussing i remember quite clearly f scott fitzgeralds tender is the night when in she walked wearing a woolly jumper and closefitting bellbottomed jeans with flowers embroidered around the bells she was carrying a bulky leather shoulder bag looking radiant and slightly lost glancing around for someone she knew it turned out that she knew brad an american backpacker who had attached himself to our group people like brad had a sort of fringe outlaw attraction for the students they seemed with their freedom to roam and their contempt for rules and authority to embody the very principles that the students themselves with their heavy workloads exams and future careers could only imagine or live vicariously there were always one or two brads around some dealt in drugs to make a living brad though he spoke a good revolution lived on a generous allowance wired regularly by his wealthy boston parents via western union april went up to brad and kissed him on both cheeks a formal french gesture he seemed to accept with thinly veiled amusement in his turn brad introduced her to the rest of us that done we resumed our discussion over another bottle of wine the tang of gauloises and café noir infusing the chill night air and april surprised me by demonstrating that she had not only read tender is the night but that she had thought about it too even though she was a student of history not of literature dont you think those poor young girls are terribly used she said i mean nicole is dicks patient he should be healing her not sleeping with her and the way rosemary is manipulated by her mother id go so far as to say that the mother seems to be pimping for her those films she made and here april gave her characteristic shrug no more than a little shiver rippling across her shoulders they were no doubt made to appeal to older men she didnt look at me as she said this but my cheeks burned nonetheless have you read day of the locust henri one of the other students chimed in if you want to know about how hollywood warps people thats your place to start theres a mother in there who makes rosemarys look like a saint huxley asked nadine not our brightest no said april that was after many a summer day of the locust was nathanael west i think yes here she looked directly at me the professor for the first time turned on me the full blaze of her beauty she knew she was right of course but she still deferred to me out of politeness thats right i said smiling feeling my heart lurch and my soul tingle inside its chains of flesh nathanael west wrote day of the locust and from that moment on i was smitten i told myself not to be a fool that april was far too young for me and that a beautiful woman like her couldnt possibly be interested in a portly fortyyearold lecturer even if he did wear faded denim jeans had a goatee and grew those wisps of hair that remained a little longer than some of his colleagues thought acceptable but after that first meeting i found myself thinking about april a lot in fact i couldnt get her out of my mind it wasnt mere lust though lord knows it was that too but i loved the sound of her voice loved the way she twisted strands of hair around her finger as she spoke the way she smoked her cigarette loved the passion of her arguments the sparkle of her laughter the subtle jasmine of her perfume love that night she had left the cafe after about an hour arm in arm with brad young handsome rich footloose and fancyfree brad and i had lain awake tormented by images of their passionate love making i had never felt like that before never felt so consumed by desire for someone and so racked by pain at the thought of someone else having her it was as if an alien organism had invaded my body my very soul and wrought such changes there that i could hardly cope with more mundane matters such as teaching and writing eating and sleeping the second time i met her it was raining i was walking along the quai across from notre dame staring distractedly at the rain pitting the rivers steely surface thinking of her when she suddenly ducked under my umbrella and took my arm i must have gasped out loud professor dodgson she said not a question she knew who i was sorry i startled you but that wasnt why i gasped i wanted to tell her it was the sudden apparition of this beautiful creature i had been dreaming about for days i looked at her the driving rain had soaked her hair and face like dick in tender is the night i wanted to drink the rain that ran from her cheeks how did you recognize me under this i asked her she gave that little shrug that was no more than a ripple and smiled up at me easy youre carrying the same old briefcase you had last week its got your initials on it how sharp of you i said you should become a detective oh i could never become a fascist pig she said this with a completely straight face people said things like that back then just a joke i said where are you going nowhere special coffee she looked at me again chewing on her lower lip for a moment as she weighed up my invitation all right she said finally i know a place and her gentle pressure on my arm caused me to change direction and enter the narrow alleys that spread like veins throughout the latin quarter your french is very good she said as we walked where did you learn school mostly then university i seem to have a facility for it we used to come here when i was a child too before the war brittany my father fought in the first war you see and he developed this love for france i think the fighting gave him a sort of stake in things do you too have this stake in france i dont know she found the cafe she was looking for on the rue st séverin and we ducked inside can you feel whats happening she asked me once we were warm and dry sitting at the zinc counter with hot strong coffees before us she lit a gauloise and touched my arm isnt it exciting i couldnt believe what i was hearing she thought something was happening between us i could hardly disguise my joy but i was also so tonguetied that i couldnt think of anything wise or witty to say i probably sat there my mouth opening and closing like a guppys before saying yes yes it is exciting therell be a revolution before springs over you mark my words well be rid of de gaulle and ready to start building a new france ah yes the revolution i should have known it was the topic on everyones mind at the time except mine that is i tried not to show my disappointment not that i wasnt interested you couldnt be in paris in the spring of and not be interested in the revolution one way or another but i had been distracted from politics by my thoughts of april besides as radical as i might have appeared to some people i was still a foreign national and i had to do my best to keep a low political profile difficult though it was one false step and id not only be out of a job but out of the country and far away from april for ever and i had answered her question honestly i didnt know whether i had a stake in france or not what does brad think i asked brad she seemed surprised by my question brad is an anarchist and you she twisted her hair around her finger im not sure i know i want change i think im an anarchist too though im not sure id want to be completely without any sort of government at all but we want the same things peace a new more equal society he is an american but they have had many demonstrations there too you know vietnam ah yes i remember some of them we passed a while talking about my experiences in california which seemed to fascinate april though i must admit i was far more interested in tracing the contours of her face and drinking in the beauty of her eyes and skin than i was in discussing the war in vietnam in the end she looked at her watch and said she had to go to a lecture but would probably see me later at the cafe i said i hoped so and watched her walk away you will have gathered that i loved april to distraction but did she love me i think not she liked me well enough i amused her entertained her and she was perhaps even flattered by my attentions but ultimately brash youth wins out over suave age it was brad she loved brad whose status in my mind quickly changed from that of a mildly entertaining reasonably intelligent hangeron to the bane of my existence he always seemed to be around and i could never get april to myself whether this was deliberate whether he was aware of my interest and made jealous by it i do not know all i know is that i had very few chances to be alone with her when we were together usually at a cafe or walking in the street we talked talked of what was happening in france of the future of the university of literature of the anarchists maoists trotskyists and communists talked about all these but not alas of love perhaps this was my fault i never pushed myself on her never tried to make advances never tried to touch her even though my cells ached to reach out and mingle with hers and even though the most casual physical contact a touch on the arm for example set me aflame with desire after our first few meetings she would greet me with kisses on each cheek the way she greeted all her friends and my cheeks would burn for hours afterwards one day she left a silk scarf at the cafe and i took it home and held it to my face like a lovesick schoolboy inhaling aprils subtle jasmine perfume as i tried to sleep that night but i did not dare make a pass i feared her rejection and her laughter far more than anything else while we do not have the capacity to choose our feelings in the first place we certainly have the ability to choose not to act on them and that was what i was trying to do admittedly more for my own sake than for hers when i did see april alone again it was late in the morning of may and i was still in bed i had been up late the night before trying to concentrate on a faulkner paper i had to present at a conference in brussels that weekend and as i had no actual classes on fridays i had slept in the soft but insistent tapping at my door woke me from a dream about my father in the trenches why is it we never seem to dream at night about those we dream about all day and i rubbed the sleep out of my eyes i must explain that at the time like the poor french workers i wasnt paid very much and consequently as i didnt need very much either i lived in a small pension in a cobbled alley off the boulevard st michel between the university and the luxembourg gardens as i could easily walk from the pension to my office at the sorbonne as i usually ate at the university or at a cheap local bistro and as i spent most of my social hours in the various bars and cafes of the latin quarter i didnt really need much more than a place to lay my head at night i stretched threw on my dressing gown and opened the door im sure you can imagine my shock on finding april standing there alone she had been to the room only once previously along with brad and a couple of others for a nightcap of cognac after a nina simone concert but she clearly remembered where i lived oh im sorry richard she had started calling me by my first name at my insistence though of course she pronounced it in the french manner and it sounded absolutely delightful to me every time she spoke it i didnt know come in i said standing back she paused a moment in the doorway smiled shyly then entered i lay back on the bed mostly because there was hardly enough room for two of us to sit together shall i make coffee she asked theres only instant she made a typical april moue at the idea of instant coffee as any true french person would but i directed her to the tiny kitchenette behind the curtain and she busied herself with the kettle calling out over her shoulder as she filled it and turned on the gas theres trouble at the university she said thats what i came to tell you its happening at last everythings boiling over i remembered that there was supposed to be a meeting about the nanterre eight who were about to face disciplinary charges the following monday and i assumed that was what she meant whats happening i asked still not quite awake april came back into the bedroom and sat demurely on the edge of my only chair trying not to look at me lying on the bed the revolution she said theres already a big crowd there students and lecturers together theyre talking about calling the police closing down the university this woke me up a little more theyre what its true april went on somebody told me that the university authorities said theyd call in the police if the crowds didnt disperse but theyre not dispersing theyre getting bigger she lit a gauloise and looked around for an ashtray i passed her one id stolen from the café de la lune she smiled when she saw it and took those short little puffs at her cigarette hardly giving herself time to inhale and enjoy the tobacco before exhaling and puffing again brads already there she added then hed better be careful i said getting out of bed hes neither a student nor a french citizen but dont you see this is everybodys struggle try telling that to the police you can be so cynical sometimes im sorry april i said not wanting to offend her im just concerned for him thats all of course i was lying nothing would have pleased me better than to see brad beaten to a pulp by the police or better still deported but i could hardly tell april that the kettle boiled and she gave me a smile of forgiveness and went to make the coffee she only made one cup for me i noticed and as i sipped it she talked on about what had happened that morning and how she could feel change in the air her animation and passion excited me and i had to arrange my position carefully to avoid showing any obvious evidence of my arousal even in the silences she seemed inclined to linger and in the end i had to ask her to leave while i got dressed as there was nowhere for her to retain her modesty and the thought of her standing so close to me facing the wall as i took off my dressing gown was too excruciating for me to bear she pouted and left saying shed wait for me outside when i rejoined her we walked to the sorbonne together and i saw that she was right about the crowds there was defiance in the air we found brad standing with a group of anarchists and april went over to take his arm i spoke with him briefly for a while alarmed at some of the things he told me i found some colleagues from the literature department and they said the police had been sent for by four oclock in the afternoon the university was surrounded by the compagnies républicaines de sécurité the crs riot police and a number of students and lecturers had been arrested before long even more students arrived and started fighting with the crs to free those who had been arrested nobody was backing down this time the revolution had begun i took the train to brussels on saturday morning and didnt come back until late on tuesday and though i had heard news of events in paris i was stunned at what awaited me on my return the city was a war zone the university was closed and nobody knew when or in what form it would reopen even the familiar smell of the city its coffee cheese and something slightly overripe aroma had changed and it now smelled of fire burnt plastic and rubber i could taste ashes in my mouth i wandered the latin quarter in a dream remnants of the previous days tear gas stinging my eyes barricades improvised from tornup paving stones all over the place everywhere i went i saw the crs looking like invaders from space in their gleaming black helmets with chinstraps and visors thick black uniforms jackboots and heavy truncheons they turned up out of nowhere in coaches with windows covered in wire mesh clambered out and blocked off whole streets apparently at random everywhere they could people gathered and talked politics the mood was swinging you could taste it in the air along with the gas and ashes this wasnt just another student demonstration another communist or anarchist protest this was civil war even the bourgeoisie were appalled at the violence of the police attacks there were reports of pregnant women being beaten of young men being tortured their genitals shredded this was the aftermath of what later came to be known as bloody monday when the nanterre eight had appeared at the sorbonne triumphantly singing the internationale and sparked off riots i had missed april terribly while i was in brussels and now i was worried that she might have been hurt or arrested i immediately tried to seek her out but it wasnt easy she wasnt at her student residence nor at brads hotel i tried the café de la lune and various other watering holes in the area but to no avail eventually i ran into someone i knew who was able to tell me that he thought she was helping one of the student groups produce posters but he didnt know where i gave up and went back to my room unable to sleep expecting her gentle rap on the door at any moment it never came i saw her again on thursday putting up posters on the rue st jacques i was worried about you i told her she smiled and touched my arm for a moment i let myself believe that my concern actually mattered to her i could understand her dedication to what was happening after all she was young and it was her country i knew that all normal social activities were on hold that the politics of revolution had little time or space for the personal for such bourgeois indulgences as love but still i selfishly wanted her wanted to be with her my chance came at the weekend when the shit really hit the fan all week negotiations had been going back and forth between the government and the students the university stayed closed and the students threatened to liberate it de gaulle huffed and puffed the latin quarter remained an occupied zone on friday the workers threw in their lot with the students and called for a general strike the following monday the whole country was on its knees in a way it hadnt been since the german occupation thus far i had been avoiding the demonstrations not out of cowardice or lack of commitment but because i was a british subject not a french one by the weekend that no longer mattered it had become a world struggle us against them we were fighting for a new world order i was in i had a stake besides the university was closed so i didnt even have a job to protect any more and perhaps somewhere deep down i hoped that heroic deeds on the barricades might win the heart of a fair lady so confusing was everything so long running and spread out the battle that i cant remember now whether it was friday or saturday odd that the most important night of my life and i cant remember what night it was no matter it all started with a march towards the panthéon red and black flags everywhere the internationale bolstering our courage i had found april and brad earlier along with henri alain and brigitte in the university quadrangle looking at the improvised bookstalls and we went to the march together april had her arm linked through mine on one side and alain on the other it was about halfpast nine when things started to happen im not sure what came first the sharp explosions of the gas grenades or the flash of a molotov cocktail but all of a sudden pandemonium broke out and there was no longer an organized march only a number of battle fronts in the melee april and i split off losing brad and the rest and we found ourselves among those defending the front on the boulevard st michel unfortunate drivers caught in the chaos pressed down hard on their accelerators honked their horns and drove through red lights to get away knocking pedestrians aside as they went the explosions were all around us now and a blazing crs van silhouetted figures throwing petrol bombs and pulling up paving stones for the barricades the restaurants and cafes were all closing hurriedly waiters ushering clients out into the street and putting up the shutters the crs advanced on us firing gas grenades continuously one landed at my feet and i kicked it back at them i saw one student fall to them about ten burly police kicking him as he lay and beating him mercilessly with their truncheons there was nothing we could do clouds of gas drifted from the canisters obscuring our view we could see distant flames hear the explosions and the cries see vague shadows bending to pick up stones to throw at the darkness the crs charged some of us had come armed with molotov cocktails and stones but neither april nor i had any weapons any means to defend ourselves so we ran we got separated from the others just the two of us now and we were both scared this was the worst the fighting had been so far the demonstrators werent just taking what the crs dished out they were fighting back and that made the police even more vicious they would show no quarter neither with a woman nor a foreign national we could hardly see for the tears streaming from our eyes as we tried to get away from the advancing crs who seemed to have every side street blocked off come on i said taking aprils hand in mine this way we jumped the fence and edged through the pitchdark luxembourg gardens looking for an unguarded exit when we found one we dashed out and across to the street opposite a group of crs saw us and turned fortunately the street was too narrow and the buildings were too high for the gas guns the police fired high in the air and most of the canisters fell harmlessly onto the roofs above us nobody gave chase hand in hand we made our way through the dark back streets to my pension which though close to the fighting seemed so far unscathed we ran up to my tiny room and locked the door behind us our eyes were streaming and both of us felt a little dizzy and sick from the tear gas but we also felt elated from the nights battle we could still hear the distant explosions and see flashes and flames like guy fawkes night back in england adrenalin buzzed in our veins just as i cant say exactly what night it was i cant say exactly who made the first move all i remember is that suddenly the room seemed too small for the two of us our bodies were pressed together and i was tasting those moist pink lips for the first time savouring her small furtive tongue in my mouth my legs were like jelly you know when i came here the other morning and you were in bed april said as she unbuttoned my shirt yes i said tugging at her jeans she slipped my shirt off my shoulders i wanted to get into bed with you i unhooked her bra why didnt you i didnt think you wanted me we managed to get mostly undressed before falling onto the bed i kissed her breasts and ran my hands down her naked thighs i thought i would explode with ecstasy when she touched me then she was under me and i buried myself in her heard her sharp gasp of pleasure at last april was mine i lived on the memory of aprils body naked beside me the two of us joined in love while the country went insane i didnt see her for three days and even then we were part of a group we couldnt talk intimately that was what things were like then there was little place for the individual everything was chaos normal life was on hold perhaps never to be resumed again the university was closed the campus hardly recognizable the pillars in the square were plastered with posters of marx lenin trotsky and che guevara there was a general strike everything ground to a halt the metro buses coal production railways everywhere i walked i saw burnedout vans and cars gutted news kiosks piles of paving stones groups of truncheonswinging crs people eating in the cafes had tears streaming down their faces from the remnants of tear gas in the morningafter air and every morning was a morning after i spotted brad alone in a side street one night not long after dark and as i had been wanting to talk to him about april i thought i might never get a better opportunity he was on his way to a meeting he said but could spare a few minutes we took the steps down to the seine by the side of the pont st michel where we were less likely to get hassled by the crs it was dark and quiet by the river though we could hear the crack of gas guns and explosions of molotovs not so far away have you talked to april recently i asked him yes he said why i was wondering if you know shed told you told me what well i swallowed about us he stopped for a moment then looked at me and laughed oh yes he said yes she did as a matter of fact i was puzzled by his attitude well i said is that all you have to say what do you want me to say arent you angry why should i be angry it didnt mean anything i felt an icy fear grip me what do you mean it didnt mean anything you know it was just a quickie a bit of a laugh she said she got excited by the street fighting and you happened to be the nearest man its not the first time you know i dont expect april to be faithful or any of that bourgeois crap shes her own woman what did you say i said it didnt mean anything you dont think she could be serious about someone like you do you come off it richard with your tatty jeans and your little goatee beard you think youre a real hip intellectual but youre nothing but a joke thats all you were to her a quickie a laugh a joke she came straight to me afterwards for a real the blow came from deep inside me and my fist caught him on the side of his jaw i heard a sharp crack distinct from the sound of a distant gas gun and he keeled over into the seine we were under a bridge and it was very dark i stopped listened and looked around but i could see no one hear only the sounds of battle in the distance quickly my blood turning to ice i climbed the nearest stairs and reentered the fray i had never imagined that love could turn to hatred so quickly though i had fantasized about getting rid of brad many times i had never really intended to harm him and certainly not in the way or for the reason that i did i had never thought of myself as someone capable of killing another human being they pulled his body out of the seine two days later and the anarchists claimed that he had been singled out and murdered by the crs most of the students were inclined to believe this and another bloody riot ensued as for me id had it had it with april had it with the revolution and had it with paris if i could have i would have left for london immediately but the crosschannel ferries werent operating and skyways had no vacancies for some days what few tourists remained trapped in paris were queuing for buses to brussels amsterdam or geneva anywhere as long as they got out of france mostly i felt numb in the aftermath of killing brad though this was perhaps more to do with what he had told me about april than about the act itself which had been an accident and for which i didnt blame myself april how could she deceive me so how could she be so cold so cruel so callous i meant nothing to her just the nearest man to scratch her itch a quickie a joke i saw her only once more near the luxembourg gardens the same gardens we jumped into that marvellous night a million years ago and as she made to come towards me i took off into a side street i didnt want to talk to her again didnt even want to see her and it wasnt only april i stayed away from all of them henri alain brigitte nadine the lot of them to me they had all become inextricably linked with aprils humiliation of me and i couldnt bear to be with them one day henri managed to get me aside and told me that april had committed suicide he seemed angry rather than sad i stared at him in disbelief when he started to say something more i cut him off and fled i dont think anyone knew that i had killed brad but clearly april lamented his loss so much that she no longer felt her life was worth living he wasnt worth it i wanted to say remembering the things he had told me under the bridge that night if anyone was the killer it was brad not me he had killed my love for april and now he had killed april i refused to allow myself to feel anything for her the people at skyways said i might have some luck if i came out to the airport and waited for a vacancy on standby which i did before i left i glanced around my room one last time and saw nothing i wanted to take with me not even aprils silk scarf which i had kept so in the clothes i was wearing with the francs that was all the bank of france allowed to me withdraw i left the country and never went back until now i think it must be the memory of tear gas that makes my eyes water so i wipe them with the back of my hand and the waiter comes to ask me if i am all right i tell him i am and order another pichet i have nowhere else to go except the grave i might as well stay here and drink myself to death what is the point of another miserable six months on earth anyway the girl who reminds me of april crushes out her cigarette and twists a strand of hair her lover is late i dream of consoling her but what have i to offer professor dodgson richard is that you i look up slowly at the couple standing over me the man is greyhaired distinguished looking and there is something about him his wife or companion is rather stout with grey eyes and short salt and pepper hair both are well dressed healthy looking the epitome of the parisian bourgeoisie yes i say im afraid you have me at a disadvantage henri boulanger he says i was once your student my wife brigitte was also a student henri brigitte i stand to shake his hand is it really you he smiles yes i wasnt sure about you at first you havent changed all that much in the face the eyes but you perhaps you have lost weight im ill henri dying in fact but please sit down be my guests lets share some wine waiter henri looks at brigitte who nods and they sit she seems a little embarrassed uncomfortable though i cant for the life of me imagine why perhaps it is because i told them i am dying no doubt many people would feel uncomfortable sitting in a cafe drinking wine with death funnily enough i tell them i was just thinking about you what are you doing here henri beams now im the professor he says with great pride i teach literature at the sorbonne good for you henri i always believed youd go far its a pity you couldnt have stayed around they were difficult times henri interesting as the chinese say still it was a sad business about that girl what was her name april i say and i feel an echo of my old love as i say her name apreel april yes that was around the time you went away my time here was over i tell him i had no job the country was in a state of civil war it wasnt my future henri frowns yes i know nobody blames you for getting out its not that blames me for what henri he glances at brigitte who looks deep into her glass of wine you remember he says the suicide i told you about it i remember she killed herself over an american boy the crs beat to death brad but that wasnt i mean he stares at me wideeyed you mean you dont know dont know what i tried to tell you at the time but you turned away tell me what brigitte looks up slowly from her wine and speaks why did you desert her why did you turn your back on her what do you mean you rejected her you broke her heart the silly girl was in love with you and you spurned her thats why she killed herself thats ridiculous she killed herself because of the american brigitte shakes her head no believe me it was you she told me she could talk only about you in the days before but brad brad was jealous dont you understand she was never more than a casual girlfriend to him he wanted more but she fell for you i shake my head slowly i cant believe this cant allow myself to believe this the world starts to become indistinct all shadows and echoes i cant breathe my skin tingles with pins and needles i feel a touch on my shoulder are you all right richard are you all right it is henri i hear him call for a brandy and someone places a cool glass in my hand i sip it burns and seems to dispel the mist a little brigitte rests her hand on my arm and leans forward you mean you really didnt know i shake my head henri tried to tell you brad i whisper brad told me she just used me that she thought i was a joke i believed him henri and brigitte look at one another then back at me concern and pity in their eyes a little more than that in henris too suspicion maybe everybody wasnt convinced that the crs had killed brad after all he was jealous brigitte repeats he lied suddenly i start to laugh which horrifies them but i cant help myself people turn and look at us henri and brigitte are embarrassed when the laughter subsides i am left feeling hollow i sip more brandy henri has placed his cigarettes on the table gauloises i notice may i i ask reaching for the packet even though i havent smoked in twenty years he nods i light a gauloise cough a little what does it matter if i get lung cancer now im already as good as dead after a few puffs the cigarette even starts to taste good brings back as tastes and smells do so well even more memories of the cafes and nights of i begin to wonder whatever happened to that silk scarf i left in the drawer at my pension i wish i could smell her jasmine scent again outside the girls lover arrives he is young and handsome and he waves his arms as he apologizes for being late she is sulky at first but she brightens and kisses him he runs his hand down her smooth olive cheek and i can smell tear gas again the good partner an inspector banks story the louring sky was black as a tax inspectors heart when detective chief inspector alan banks pulled up outside oakley crescent at eight oclock one midnovember evening an icy wind whipped up the leaves and set them skittering around his feet as he walked up the path to the glasspanelled door detective constable susan gay was waiting for him inside and peter darby the police photographer was busy with his new video recorder between the glass coffee table and the brick fireplace lay the womans body blood matting the hair around her left temple banks put on his latex gloves then bent and picked up the object beside her the bronze plaque read eastvale golf club tournament winner david fosse there was blood on the base of the trophy the man banks assumed to be david fosse sat on the sofa staring into space a pile of photographs lay on the table banks picked them up and flipped through them each was dated across the bottom the first few showed group scenes redeyed people eating drinking and dancing at a banquet of some kind but the last ones told a different story two showed a handsome young man in a navy blue suit white shirt and garish tie smiling lecherously at the photographer from behind a glass of whisky then the scene shifted to a hotel room where the man had loosened his tie none of the other diners were to be seen in the last picture he had also taken off his jacket the date had changed to banks turned to the man on the sofa are you david fosse he asked there was a pause while the man seemed to return from a great distance yes he said finally can you identify the victim its my wife kim what happened i i was out taking the dog for a walk when i got back i found he gestured towards the floor when did you go out quarter to seven as usual i got back about half past and found her like this was your wife in when you left yes was she expecting any visitors he shook his head banks held out the photos have you seen these fosse turned away and grunted who took them what do they mean fosse stared at the axminster mr fosse i dont know this date november last saturday is that significant my wife was at a business convention in london last weekend i assume theyre the pictures she took what kind of convention shes involved in servicing home offices and small businesses servicing he sneered now theres an apt term banks singled out the man in the gaudy tie do you know who this is no fosses face darkened and both his hands curled into fists no but if i ever get hold of him mr fosse did you argue with your wife about the man in these photographs fosses mouth dropped they werent here when i left how do you explain their presence now i dont know she must have got them out while i was taking jasper for a walk banks looked around the room and saw a camera on the sideboard a canon it looked like an expensive autofocus model he picked it up carefully and put it in a plastic bag is this yours he asked fosse fosse looked at the camera its my wifes i bought it for her birthday why what are you doing with it it may be evidence said banks pointing at the exposure indicator seven pictures have been taken on a new film i have to ask you again mr fosse did you argue with your wife about the man in these photos and ill tell you again how could i they werent there when i went out and she was dead when i got back the dog barked from the kitchen the front door opened and dr glendenning walked in a tall imposing figure with white hair and a nicotinestained moustache glendenning glanced sourly at banks and susan and complained about being dragged out on such a night banks apologized though glendenning was a home office pathologist and a lowly police surgeon could pronounce death banks knew that glendenning would never have forgiven them had they not called him as the sceneofcrime team arrived banks turned to david fosse and said i think wed better carry on with this down at headquarters fosse shrugged and stood up to get his coat as they left banks heard glendenning mutter a golf trophy a bloody golf trophy sacrilege do you think he did it sir susan gay asked banks banks swirled the inch of theakstons xb at the bottom of his glass and watched the patterns it made i dont know he certainly had means motive and opportunity but something about it makes me uneasy it was almost closing time and banks and susan sat in the warm glow of the queens arms having a late dinner of microwaved steak and kidney pud courtesy of cyril the landlord who was used to their unsociable hours outside rain lashed against the red and amber window panes banks pushed his plate away and lit a cigarette he was tired the fosse call had come in just as he was about to go home after a long day of paperwork and boring meetings they had learned little more during a twohour interrogation at the station kim fosse had left for london on friday and returned on monday with her business partner norma cheverel the convention had been held at the ludbridge hotel in kensington david fosse maintained his innocence but sexual jealousy made a strong motive and now he was languishing in the cells under eastvale divisional headquarters languish was perhaps too strong a word as the cells were as comfortable as many bed and breakfasts and the food and service much better the only problem was that you couldnt open the door and go for a walk in the yorkshire dales when you felt like it they learned from the housetohouse that fosse did walk the dog several people had seen him and not even dr glendenning could pinpoint time of death to within the fortyfive minutes he was out of the house fosse could have murdered his wife before he left or when he got home he could also have nipped back around the rear where a path ran by the river got into the house unseen the back way then resumed his walk time ladies and gentlemen please called cyril ringing his bell behind the bar and that includes coppers banks smiled and finished his beer theres not a lot more we can do tonight anyway he said i think ill go home and get some sleep ill do the same susan reached for her overcoat first thing in the morning said banks well have a word with norma cheverel see if she can throw any light on what happened in london last weekend norma cheverel was an attractive woman in her early thirties with a tousled mane of red hair a high freckled forehead and the greenest eyes banks had ever seen contact lenses he decided uncharitably perhaps to diminish the sense of sexual energy he felt emanate from her she sat behind her desk in the large carpeted office swivelling occasionally in her executive chair after her assistant had brought coffee norma pulled out a long cigarette and lit up one of the pleasures of being the boss she said the buggers cant make you stop smoking youve heard about kim fosse i take it banks asked on the local news last night poor kim she shook her head were puzzled about a few things maybe you can help us ill try did you notice her taking many photographs at the convention norma cheverel frowned i cant say as i did really but there were quite a few people taking photographs there especially at the banquet you know how people get silly at conventions i never could understand this mania for capturing the moment can you chief inspector banks whose wife sandra was a photographer could understand it only too well though he would have quibbled with capturing the moment a good photographer a real photographer sandra had often said did much more than that she transformed the moment but he let the aesthetics lie norma cheverel was right about the photo mania though banks had also noticed that since the advent of cheap idiotproof cameras every tom dick and harry had started taking photos indoors he had been halfblinded a number of times by a group of tourists capturing the moment in some pub or restaurant it was almost as bad as the mobilephone craze though not quite did kim fosse share this mania he asked she had a fancy new camera she took it with her thats all i can say really look i dont bear with me ms cheverel norma please banks who reserved the familiarity of firstname terms to exercise power over suspects not to interview witnesses went on do you know if she had affairs this time norma cheverel let the silence stretch banks could hear the fan cooling the microchip in her computer she stubbed out her long cigarette careful to make sure it wasnt still smouldering sipped some coffee swivelled a little and said yes yes she did though i wouldnt really describe them as affairs how would you describe them just little flings really nothing that really meant anything to her who with she didnt usually mention names did she have a fling in london last weekend yes she told me about it on the way home look chief inspector kim wasnt a bad person she just needed something david couldnt give her banks took a photograph of the man in the navy blue suit from his briefcase and slid it across the desk know him its michael bannister hes with an officefurnishings company in preston and did kim fosse have a fling with him that weekend norma swivelled and bit her lip she didnt tell me it was him surprised she shrugged hes married not that that means much these days ive heard hes very much in love with his wife but shes not very strong heart condition or something she sniffled then sneezed and reached for a tissue what did kim tell you about last weekend norma cheverel smiled an odd twisted little smile from the corner of her lips oh chief inspector do you really want all the details girl talk about sex is so much dirtier than mens you know though he felt himself reddening a little banks said so ive been told did she ever express concern about her husband finding out oh yes she told me under no circumstances to tell david as if i would hes very jealous and he has a temper was he ever violent towards her just once it was the last time we went to a convention as a matter of fact apparently he tried to phone her in her room after midnight some emergency to do with the dog and she wasnt there when she got home he lost his temper called her a whore and hit her how long had they been married norma sniffled again and blew her nose four years how long have you and kim fosse been in business together six years we started when she was still kim church shed just got her mba how did the partnership work very well im on the financial side and kim dealt with sales and marketing are you married i dont see that its any of your business chief inspector but no im not i guess mr right just hasnt turned up yet she said coldly then looked at her gold wristwatch are there any more questions banks stood up no thats all for now thank you very much for your time she stood up and walked around the desk to show him to the door her handshake on leaving was a little brisker and cooler than it had been when he arrived so kim fosse was discreet but she took photographs said susan when they met up in bankss office later that morning kinky could be or just careless theyre pretty harmless really the seven photographs from the film they had found inside the camera showed the same man in the hotel room on the same date michael bannister susan read from her notes sales director for office comforts ltd based in preston lancashire lives in blackpool with his wife lucy no children his wife suffers from a congenital heart condition needs constant pills and medicines lots of attention his workmates tell me hes devoted to her a momentary lapse then banks suggested he walked over to his broken venetian blind and looked out on the rainswept market square only two cars were parked there today the gold hands on the blue face of the church clock stood at eleven thirtynine it happens sir maybe more often than we think i know reckon wed better go easy approaching him no sense endangering the wifes health is there youre right see if you can arrange to see him at his office banks looked out of the window and shivered i dont much fancy a trip to the seaside in this miserable weather anyway the drive across the pennines was a nightmare all the way along the a they seemed to be stuck behind one lorry or another churning up gallons of filthy spray around clitheroe visibility was so poor that traffic slowed to a crawl the hulking whaleshapes of the hills that flanked the road were reduced to faint grey outlines in the rainhaze banks played his miles davis birth of the cool tape which susan seemed to enjoy at least she didnt complain the office building on ribbleton lane just east of the city centre was threestorey redbrick the receptionist directed them to bannisters office on the second floor in the anteroom a woman sat clicking away at a computer keyboard curlyhaired plump in her forties she came over and welcomed them hello im carla jacobs im mr bannisters secretary hes in with someone at the moment but he wont be a minute he knows youre coming banks and susan looked at the framed photographs of company products and awards on the walls as they waited all the time banks sensed carla jacobs staring at the back of his head after a couple of minutes he turned around just in time to see her avert her gaze is anything wrong he asked she blushed no well not really i mean dont think im being nosy but is mr bannister in some kind of trouble why do you ask its just that im a good friend of lucys thats mr bannisters wife and i dont know if you know but we know about her health problems yes good good well have you any reason to think mr bannister might be in trouble she raised her eyebrows oh no but its not every day we get the police visiting at that moment the inner door opened and a small ferretfaced man in an illfitting suit flashed a smile at carla as he scurried out in the doorway stood the man in the photographs michael bannister he beckoned banks and susan in it was a large office with bannisters work desk files and bookcases taking up one half and a large oval table for meetings in the other they sat at the table so well polished banks could see his reflection in it and susan took out her notebook i understand you attended a business convention in london last weekend banks started yes yes i did did you meet a woman there called kim fosse bannister averted his eyes yes banks showed him a photograph of the victim as she had been in life is this her yes did you spend the night with her i dont see what thats got did you look for christs sake my wife its not your wife were asking what if i did did she take these photographs of you banks fanned the photos in front of him yes he said so you slept with kim fosse and she took some photographs it was just a lark i mean wed had a bit to drink i i understand sir said banks you dont have to justify yourself to me bannister licked his lips whats this all about will it go any further i cant say said banks gesturing for susan to stand up it depends well keep you informed good lord man said bannister please think of my wife he looked miserably after them and banks caught the look of concern on carla jacobss face that was a bit of a wasted journey wasnt it sir susan said on the way back to eastvale do you think so said banks smiling im not at all sure myself i think our mr bannister was lying about something and id like to know what carla jacobs had on her mind sandra was out after banks hung up his raincoat he went straight into the living room of his south eastvale semi and poured himself a stiff laphroaig he felt as if the days rain had permeated right to his bone marrow he made himself a cheese and onion sandwich checked out all the television channels found nothing worth watching and put some bessie smith on the cd player but womans trouble blues took a background role as the malt whisky warmed his bones and he thought about the fosse case why did he feel so ill at ease because david fosse sounded believable because he had felt norma cheverels sexual power and resented it because michael bannister had lied about something and was carla jacobs in love with her boss or was she just protecting lucy bannister banks fanned out the photographs on the coffee table before he could answer any of the questions sandra returned from the photography course she was teaching at the local college when she had finished telling banks how few people knew the difference between an aperture and a hole in the ground which banks argued was a poor metaphor because an aperture was a kind of a hole she glanced at the photos on the coffee table what are these evidence she asked stopping herself before she touched them go ahead said banks weve got all we need from them sandra picked up a couple of the group shots six people in evening dress each holding a champagne flute out towards the photographer all with the red eyes characteristic of cheap automatic flash ugh said sandra what dreadful photos snob said banks she doesnt have as good a camera as you doesnt matter said sandra a child of five could do a better job with a brownie than these what kind of camera was it anyway a canon said banks adding the model number the identification tag on the evidence bag was etched in his memory sandra put the photos down and frowned a what banks told her again it cant be why not sandra leaned forward slipped her long blonde tresses behind her ears and spread out the photos well theyve all got redeye she said the camera you mentioned protects against redeye it was bankss turn to look puzzled do you know what redeye is sandra asked i dont know an aperture from a hole in the ground she nudged him in the ribs be serious alan look when youre in a dark room your pupils dilate the iris opens to let in more light so you can see properly just like an aperture on a camera right you know what its like when you first walk into a dark place and your eyes slowly adjust banks nodded go on well when youre subjected to a sudden direct flash of light the iris doesnt have time to close redeye is actually caused by the flash illuminating the blood vessels in the eye why doesnt it happen with all flash photographs then surely the whole point of flash is that you use it in the dark mostly yes but redeye only happens when the flash is pointed directly at your iris it doesnt happen when the flash is held from above the camera the angles different see what i mean yes but you dont usually see people with handheld flashes using cameras like that thats right thats because theres another way of getting rid of redeye the more expensive models like the one you just mentioned to me set off a series of quick flashes first before the exposure and that gives the iris a chance to close simple really so youre saying that these photographs couldnt have been taken with that camera thats right interesting said banks very interesting sandra grinned have i solved your case not exactly no but youve certainly confirmed some of the doubts ive been having banks reached for the telephone after what youve just told me i think i can at least make sure that david fosse sleeps in his own bed tonight norma cheverel wasnt pleased to see banks and susan late the next morning she welcomed them with all the patience and courtesy of a busy executive tidying files on her desk as banks talked twice mentioning a luncheon appointment that was fast approaching for a while banks ignored her rudeness then he said will you stop your fidgeting and pay attention ms cheverel she gave him a challenging look there was no call me norma this time and the sexual voltage was turned very low but she sat as still as she could and rested her hands on the desk yes sir she said you know you remind me of an old schoolteacher do you own a camera ms cheverel yes what model she shrugged i dont know just one of those cheap things everybody uses these days does it have an automatic flash yes they all do dont they what about redeye whats that a latenight flight banks explained she started playing with the files again id appreciate it if youd let us examine your camera ms cheverel why on earth because the photographs we found on the coffee table at the scene couldnt possibly have been taken by kim fosses camera thats why banks explained what sandra had told him and what the result of tests earlier that morning had confirmed norma cheverel spread her hands so someone else took them i still dont see what thats got to do with me banks glanced over to susan who said ms cheverel is it true that you lost almost fifty thousand pounds on a land speculation deal earlier this year norma cheverel looked daggers at her and said to banks through clenched teeth my business deals are no oh but they are said banks in fact susan and i have been doing quite a bit of digging this morning it seems youve made a number of bad investments these past couple of years havent you wheres the money come from the money was mine all mine banks shook his head i think it came from the partnership he leaned forward know what else i think what do i care i think your cocaine habit is costing you a fortune too isnt it how dare you i noticed how jittery you were how you couldnt keep still and then theres the sniffling funny how your cold seems better this morning how much say ten twenty thousand a year up your nose i want my solicitor i think you were cheating the partnership ms cheverel i think you knew youd gone so far it was only a matter of time before kim fosse found out about it you dealt with the accounting you told us and she was on the marketing side what could have been better it would take her a while to discover something was wrong but you couldnt keep it from your partner for ever could you so you came up with a plot to get rid of her and blame it on her husband we only have your word for it that kim fosse was promiscuous we only have your word that her husband was jealous enough to be violent ask anyone said norma cheverel theyll tell you everyone saw her black eye after the last convention we know about that david fosse told us this morning it was something he regretted very much but the only person kim confided in was you which gave you every opportunity to build a mountain of lies and suspicion on a small foundation of truth this is absurd norma swivelled and reached for the phone im calling my solicitor go ahead said banks but you havent been charged with anything yet she held the phone halfway between her mouth and its cradle and smiled thats right she said you can make all the accusations you want but you cant prove anything that business about the camera doesnt mean a thing and you know that as well as i do it proves that kim fosse didnt take those photographs therefore someone must have planted them to make it look as if she had been foolish as well as indiscreet she put the phone down you cant prove it was me i defy you banks stood up he was loath to admit it but she was right short of finding someone who had seen her or her car in the vicinity of the fosse house around the time of the murder there was no proof and norma cheverel wasnt the kind to confess the bluff was over but at least banks and susan knew as they walked out of the office that norma cheverel had killed kim fosse the rest was just a matter of time the break took two days to come and it came from an unexpected source the first thing banks did after his interview with norma cheverel was organize a second housetohouse of fosses neighbourhood this time to find out if anyone had seen norma cheverel or her car that evening someone remembered seeing a grey foreign car of some kind which was about the closest they got to a sighting of normas silver bmw next he got a list of all conventioneers and set a team to phone and find out if anyone remembered norma cheverel taking photos on the evening of the banquet theyd got through seventyone with no luck so far when bankss phone rang this is carla jacobs inspector banks i dont know if you remember me im mr bannisters secretary i remember you said banks what is it well i was going to ask you the same thing you see ive been talking to lucy and shes so worried that michael is in trouble its damaging her health mr bannister is in no trouble as far as i know said banks he just committed an unfortunate indiscretion thats all no blame but thats just it said carla jacobs you see she said hes been acting strangely hes depressed he shuts himself away he doesnt talk to her even when hes with her she says hes withdrawn its getting her down i thought if you could talk to her just set her at ease banks sighed playing nursemaid all right he said ill call her oh will you thank you thank you ever so much she lowered her voice mr bannister is in his office now shell be by the phone at home lucy bannister answered on the first ring yes banks introduced himself im so worried about michael she said in that gushing manner of someone whos been waiting all week to pour it all out hes never like this never has he done something awful are you going to arrest him please you can tell me the truth no said banks no he hasnt and no were not hes simply been helping us with our enquiries that could mean anything enquiries into what banks debated for a moment whether to tell her it would do no harm he thought he was at a business convention in london last weekend were interested in the movements of someone else who was there thats all are you sure thats all yes and its nothing serious not for your husband no thank you you dont know what this means to me he could hear the relief in her voice because of my heart condition you see michael is a bit overprotective i dont deny im weak but sometimes i think he just takes too much upon himself she paused and gave a small laugh i dont know why im telling you all this it must be because im so relieved hes a normal man he has needs like any other man i know he goes with other women and i never mention it because i know it would upset him and embarrass him he thinks he keeps it from me to protect me from distress and its just easier to let him think that i can appreciate that banks said only half listening why hadnt he realized before now he knew what michael bannister had lied about and why look mrs bannister he cut in you might be able to help us do you think you could talk to your husband let him know you know i dont know i dont want to upset him banks felt a wave of annoyance the bannisters were so damn busy protecting one anothers feelings that there was no room for the truth he could almost hear her chewing her lip over the line he tried to keep the irritation out of his voice it could be very important he said and im sure it wont do any harm if thats what hes feeling guilty about you can help him get over it cant you i suppose so hesitant but warming to the idea im sure youd be helping him helping your relationship banks cringed to hear himself talk first a nursemaid now a bloody marriage guidance counsellor perhaps then youll do it youll talk to him yes determined now yes i will mr banks and will you do me one more favour if i can will you give him these telephone numbers and tell him that if he thinks of anything else he can call me without fear of any charges being made against him he gave her his work and home phone numbers yees she clearly didnt know what he meant but that didnt matter its very important that you tell him therell be no action taken against him and that he should talk to me personally is that clear yes i dont know what all this is about but ill do as you say and thank you thank you banks headed for a pub lunch in the queens arms it was too early to celebrate anything yet but he kept his fingers crossed as he walked in the thin november sunshine across market street norma cheverels luxury flat was every bit as elegant and expensively furnished as banks had expected some of the paintings on her walls were originals and her furniture was all handcrafted by the look of it she even had an oak table from robert thompsons workshop in kilburn banks recognized the trademark a mouse carved on one of the legs when banks and susan turned up at seventhirty that evening norma had just finished stacking her dinner dishes in the machine she had changed from her work outfit and wore black leggings showing off her shapely legs and a green woollen sweater that barely covered her hips she sat down and crossed her legs cigarette poised over the ashtray beside her well she said do i need my solicitor yet i think you do said banks but id like you to answer a few questions first im not saying a word without my solicitor present very well said banks thats your right let me do the talking then she sniffed and flicked a halfinch of ash into the ashtray beside her her crossed leg was swinging up and down as if some demented doctor were tapping the reflex i might as well tell you first of all that weve got michael bannisters testimony banks began i dont know what youre talking about i think you do it was you who took those photographs at the banquet and in the hotel room afterwards it was you who spent the night with michael bannister not kim fosse thats ridiculous no its not you told him later that if anyone asked hed better say it was kim fosse he slept with or youd tell his wife what hed done you knew lucy had a weak heart and that he thought such a shock might kill her norma had turned a shade paler banks scratched the small scar beside his right eye often when it itched it was telling him he was on the right track as it turns out he went on lucy bannister was well aware that her husband occasionally slept with other women it was just something they didnt talk about he thought he was protecting her feelings she thought she was protecting his i suggested they talk about it bastard norma cheverel hissed banks didnt know whether she meant him or michael bannister you seduced michael bannister and you planted incriminating photographs on kim fosses livingroom table after youd killed her in the hope that we would think her husband had done it in a jealous rage a rage that you also helped set us up to believe weve checked the processing services too im sure you chose fotomat because its busy quick and impersonal but the man behind the counter remembers you picking up a film on wednesday not kim fosse beauty has its drawbacks norma norma got up tossed back her hair and went to pour herself a drink she didnt offer banks or susan anything youve got a nerve she said and a hell of an imagination you should work for television you knew that david fosse walked the dog every evening come rain or shine between six fortyfive and seventhirty it was easy for you to drive over to the house park your car a little distance away get the unsuspecting kim to let you in and then still wearing gloves hit her with the trophy and plant the photos after that all you had to do was convince us of her infidelity and her husbands violent jealousy there was even a scrap of truth in it except you didnt bargain for lucy bannister did you this is ridiculous norma said what about the film that was in the camera you cant prove any of this i dont believe i mentioned that there was a film in the camera said banks im sure it seemed like a brilliant idea at the time but that film couldnt possibly have been taken by kims camera either or michael bannister wouldnt have had red eyes this is just circumstantial possibly but it all adds up believe me norma weve got a case and weve got a good chance of making it stick the first film wasnt enough was it we might have suspected it was planted but with a second film in the camera one showing the same scene the same person then there was less chance wed look closely at the photographic evidence how did it happen i imagine kim had perhaps had a bit too much to drink that night and you put her to bed when you did you also took her room key at some point during the night when youd finished with michael bannister you rewound your second film manually in the dark until there was only a small strip sticking out of the cassette then you went to kim fosses room and you put it in her camera taking out whatever film she had taken herself and dumping it oh i see im that clever am i i suppose you found my fingerprints on this film the prints were smudged as you no doubt knew they would be and you wiped the photographs and camera when youd loaded the film you advanced it in the dark with the flash turned off and the lens cap on that way the double exposure wouldnt affect the already exposed film at all because no light was getting to it when youd wound it on so that the next exposure was set at number eight you returned it to kim fosses room im glad you think im so brilliant inspector but i i dont think youre brilliant at all banks said youre as stupid as anyone else who thinks she can get away with the perfect crime in a flash norma cheverel picked up the ashtray and threw it at banks he dodged sideways and it whizzed past his ear and smashed into the front of the cocktail cabinet banks stood up time to call that solicitor norma but norma cheverel wasnt listening she was banging her fists on her knees and chanting bastard bastard over and over again some land in florida the morning they found santa claus floating face down in the pool i had a hangover of gargantuan proportions by midday i was starting to feel more human by late afternoon on my third michelob at chloes i was almost glad to be alive again almost i was also coming to believe that santas death hadnt been quite the accident it appeared happy hour at chloes a dim horseshoeshaped bar adjoining a restaurant lasts from eleven am to seven pm and by late afternoon the desperation usually starts to show through the cracks the men tell the same joke for the third or fourth time the women laugh just a little too loudly the afternoon after santas death i found myself sitting opposite his small coterie they were an odd group the three of them who formed the central core there was a greyhaired man about sixty who always looked ill to me despite his brickred complexion a size fourteen woman in her mid forties who wore size ten clothes and a pretty blonde no older than about twentyfive maybe im being sexist or ageist or whatever but i could only wonder why she was hanging around with such a bunch of losers christ didnt she know that if she played her cards right she could have me ok so im no oil painting but despite a bit of a beer gut im reasonably wellpreserved for a man of my age and drinking habits ive still got a fine head of hair even if it is grey and i may be a bit grizzled and roughedged but ive been told im not without a certain cuddly quality anyway in my humble opinion santa in reality bud schiller a retired real estate agent from kingston ontario was a total asshole most people only needed to spend a couple of minutes in his company before heading for the hills but not these three oh no they laughed at all his jokes they hung on his every word of course schiller bought most of the drinks but i thought his company was a hell of a price to pay for the occasional free beer so who do you think did it then jack al french had slipped onto the empty stool beside me al was a cross between a loner and a social butterfly he seemed to know everyone but like a butterfly he never lit in any one place for long he said he was a writer from rochester but ive never seen any of his books in the shops if you ask him to be more specific he just gets evasive al tipped back his bottle and his adams apple bobbed as he swallowed he was a skinny little guy with a long nose slicked back hair and a perpetual five oclock shadow today he was wearing a hawaiian shirt and bermuda shorts it was an accident i said bullshit and you know it al put his bottle down and whispered in my ear he sounded as if hed had a few already when a jerk like bud schiller dies there has to be something more behind it than mere accident come on buddy youre supposed to be the private eye true but im on vacation a real gumshoe never rests until he discovers the truth and sees that justice is done i rolled my eyes where dyou read that al an old black mask magazine al looked hurt i didnt read it anywhere i wrote it you write private eye stories we were talking about bud schillers murder see what i mean evasive and persistent i ordered another round of michelob and offered al a cigar cuban he asked uhhuh al shrugged and took the cigar what they gonna do huh arrest me for smoking i laughed seriously al the cop i talked to said it was an accident she asked me if id seen or heard anything unusual then she left had you no i wasnt going to tell al but id spent the evening sitting out in the lanai smoking a cigar reading robertson davies and working my way through a bottle of makers mark i could hear the singalong in the distance and i remember thinking there was something absurd about a bunch of adults singing jingle bells and white christmas under the palms especially with an asshole like bud schiller dressed as santa leading them along about ninethirty when the singalong ended the print in my book was too blurred to read any more and by ten oclock or thereabouts like most people in the whispering palms condominium estate i was sawing logs hed been drinking i went on mary pasquale the girl in the office she told me he was three sheets to the wind he must have been carrying his piano away after the party when he tripped near the edge of the pool and pitched in head first al just raised his eyebrows he had a point even as i repeated the official line something nagged at the back of my mind as an excop turned pi ive seen enough weird crime scenes in my time like the guy they found dead on the subway tracks and couldnt find his head but in this case i had to ask myself two questions first wouldnt schiller have dropped the piano as he flung his arms out to protect himself from the fall and second perhaps more to the point why on gods earth was santas electric piano still plugged in ive noticed you talking to schillers cronies i said to al quietly so they wouldnt overhear do you know any of them well enough to think one of them killed him al shook his head not really just casting the nets you know ed brennan the redfaced one hes into the ponies we went to the dog track at naples once but hes a sore loser too desperate and i played golf with schiller a couple of times a few years back he cheats did you know that i didnt rate cheating at golf as high on my list of motives for murder but you never knew what about the girl al raised his eyebrows ahhah cherchez la femme is it her names karen lee kindergarten teacher i think i wish my kindergarten teacher had looked like that youdve been too young to appreciate it besides if youve got any thoughts in that direction jack forget them i warn you shes strictly an ice queen i looked at karen lee she was running her finger around the rim of a tall frosted glass abstractedly rather than in any deliberately erotic way but it still looked sexy as hell she sure didnt look like an ice queen to me how long has schiller been coming here i asked longer than me and ive been a regular for what nine ten years now how did they all hook up with each other i dont know except theyre all from canada every year schiller would manage to gather a few luckless characters around him but like me they didnt usually come back for more ed was the first one who did about four years ago the blonde was next year after i think then mama cass showed up just last year whats her real name ginny fraser three time loser from smiths falls far as i can gather single mother welfare how can she afford to come here dont ask me what does ed do retired used to be a school caretaker in waterloo kindergarten teacher welfare case retired caretaker not exactly highpaying jobs and all canadian still that didnt mean much half of canada rents condos in florida in the winter and canadas a big country i looked at them again trying to read their faces for signs of guilt nothing karen was still running her finger around her glass rim ed was attempting to tell a joke the kind he said loudly that he just knew old bud would have appreciated only ginny was laughing chins wobbling tears in her eyes i finished my beer said goodbye to al and left when i got back to the condo that evening with a bottle of chilean wine and a pound of jumbo shrimp for the barbecue i tried to put als suggestion of murder out of my mind but it wouldnt go away the problem was what if anything was i going to do about it back home im a licensed private investigator but down here im not even a citizen still that evening out on the lanai after the wine and the shrimps i decided to keep my bourbon intake down a good nights sleep and no hangover would be the best bet for whatever tomorrow might bring the grass pricked my feet as i walked towards the pool the next morning for my prebreakfast swim already the temperature was in the low seventies and the sky was robins egg blue i stood for a moment on the bridge and looked down into the murky water for the huge turtles and catfish evenings just before dark id got in the habit of feeding them chunks of bread but there was nobody around this morning a couple of hundred yards away over the swathe of dry grass the squat brown condo units were strung out in a circle around the central island connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge over the narrow moat the pool the office and the tennis courts were all on the island and that was whispering palms someone had bought some land in florida and got very rich an old man fuzz of white body hair against leathery skin was lying out on a lounge chair catching the early rays the scent of coconut sun screen mingled with the whiff of chlorine the pool was still marked off by yellow police tape i noticed that the office door was ajar and when i popped my head inside i saw mary sitting at her desk staring into space i like mary shes about twentyfive an athletic sort of girl with a swimmers upper body and a runners thighs she has a shiny black pony tail and one of those open friendly faces the kind you trust on sight oh mr erwin you startled me you werent wanting to use the pool were you i was but i see its still offlimits a frown wrinkled marys smooth tanned brow well i mean its not on account of the cops or anything she said its just well i didnt think the residents would like it you know swimming in a dead mans water she turned her nose up so ive called maintenance and theyre gonna clean it out and refill it all fresh should be ready by this afternoon sorry no youre right its a good idea i said most people probably would be put off by swimming in the same water where an electrocuted santa claus had floated around all night alone in the dark but it didnt bother me much i had seen death close up more times than i cared to remember besides people swam in the ocean all the time and thousands have died there over the centuries mary i asked do you happen to know who the last people to see mr schiller alive were his friends mr brennan miss lee and miss fraser they said he was fine when they left of course the ubiquitous trio mary shook her head never could understand what miss lee saw in that group pretty girl like her so i was vindicated for thinking exactly the same thing yesterday and if a young woman like mary could think it too it couldnt be either ageist or sexist could it mind if i ask you something mary said with a frown go ahead mr schiller was a canadian citizen right as far as i know well i was worried you know like his relatives might come down and make some sort of lawsuit what do you think aha the great american paranoia raises its ugly head lawsuits im no legal expert i said you hear about things like that all the time dont you i mean they could sue for millions i could be liable it would ruin me she laughed even if they sued for hundreds it would bankrupt me i could lose my job i need this job mr erwin i need the money to go back to school i smiled as reassuringly as i could and told her i didnt think that would happen we didnt even know if schiller had any next of kin for a start and she couldnt be responsible for his behaviour when he was drunk but the cops said he must have tripped over that crack in the tiles what crack come on ill show you we went outside the old guy in the lounge chair was still working on his skin cancer near the side of the pool mary pointed out the crack it didnt look like much to me i put my foot in front of it and slid forward slowly my big toe slipped right over the crack and the rest of my foot followed i could hardly even feel the rough edge of the tile its hardly enough to trip over i said to mary he was wearing flipflops santa claus was wearing flipflops she nodded i suppose that might make a difference even so its still a long way from the water maybe six feet schiller was a little guy only around fivefour wasnt he yeah i thought about that too but he must have been walking fast or running then he tripped and skidded in those tiles can get pretty slippery especially if theyre wet but wouldnt the piano just rip out of the socket mary shrugged it was one of those ultralight things she said and it had a long cord still i couldnt help but wonder why the hell santa claus should be running towards the swimming pool in the dark with a live electric piano in his arms no matter how tight he was or how light the piano a heron landed by the side of the moat just for a moment i felt a slight shiver run up my spine to the hairs at the back of my neck it was a sign i recognized i was being watched and not by the heron or the sunbather mary turned and walked back to the office sandals clipclopping against the tiles i followed her admiring the way her thigh muscles rippled with each step i felt strangely detached though i could admire the sculpted athletic beauty of her body but i didnt feel attracted to her sexually but then it had been a long time since i had been attracted to anyone sexually except maybe karen lee mary sat down at her desk again look i said leaning forward and resting my hands on the warm wood i know this might sound strange to you but id like you to do me a favour without telling anyone or asking too many questions do you think you could do that mary nodded slowly tentatively depends she said on what it is when i got back to the condo it was time for breakfast but without the swim my appetite wasnt up to much i put on a pot of coffee drank a glass of orange juice and ate a bowl of highfibre bran the healthy life usually i took my second cup out to the lanai and worked on one of the cryptics from the sunday times book of crosswords that was one thing always annoyed me about american newspapers you couldnt find a cryptic in any of them id seen this morning though i took the two sheets of paper that mary had printed out for me ok so schiller was alone at the pool after the singalong or so ed karen and ginny said anyone could have gone there in the dark killed him and tried to make it look like an accident and at least three people knew he was there ed karen and ginny were they telling the truth there was some risk there always is with murder but it was minimal most of the residents are elderly and theyre usually in bed by ten this isnt like some of the places where you get kids drinking all night and skinnydipping there are no kids at whispering palms first i looked over the list of condo owners i had persuaded mary to print for me schillers unit was owned on paper by gardiner holdings registered in grand cayman island if that didnt set alarm bells ringing in an old gumshoes mind what would but i couldnt for the life of me figure out what it meant ginny frasers unit was a timeshare though ginny herself wasnt listed as owning any time ed brennans unit was registered to a dr joseph brady in waterloo canada and karen lees to a travel agency called escapeitall based in sarasota one way or another these four had all ended up at whispering palms fort myers florida and i was damned if i could see any reason other than pure chance so which one of them did it and why or was it someone else i pushed my glasses back up the bridge of my nose and reached for the telephone being a private investigator from toronto has some advantages in florida when id finished on the phone i felt the need to go out for a drive not far maybe over the skyway to sanibel and captiva lunch at the mucky duck seafood and harp lager after all i was on vacation whatever al said about gumshoes and the search for truth and justice but when i walked out to the car i saw karen lee bent over the front tyre of her red honda rental just a few parking spots down white cotton shorts stretched taut over her ass i stood and admired the view for a while then walked towards her and asked if she could use any help why not she could only tell me to get lost that she was perfectly capable of fixing the tyre herself or she could accept my offer graciously she did the latter turning on her haunches and shielding her eyes from the sun she smiled and said why thanks yes id appreciate that she had dimples at each corner of her mouth cute then she stood up and brushed the dust off her hands she was wearing a pink tank top and a little sweat had darkened the cotton between her breasts flat she said a facetious reply formed in my mind but before i could voice it she went on the tyre i should have done something about it last night i thought something was wrong maybe a slow leak but i couldnt be bothered then when i came out just now i saw it was flat no problem i said and in no time we took off the flat and put on the spare thanks a lot said karen smiling its not that im helpless or anything i mean i know how to change a tyre but forget it i told her my pleasure what i was going to say was it was nice to have a bit of company and she smiled again giving me the full benefit of her dimples and baby blues the front of her tank top was even damper now and i could see beads of moisture on the tops of her breasts between the tiny hairs she had her hair tied back and fixed with barrettes but a few strands had come loose and stuck to her flushed face some ice queen hot isnt it she said waving her hand in front of her face look why dont you come in and clean up its the least i can do i could have gone to my own place just a few buildings down but im no fool i followed her up the steps to her secondstorey unit inside it was pretty much the same layout as mine openplan kitchen and living room two bedrooms one with its own bathroom guest bathroom and the lanai out front sorry about the mess karen said picking up a few magazines scattered on the sofa i wasnt expecting company please go ahead use the bathroom the bathroom was full of the mysterious paraphernalia of feminine beauty potions eyebrow pencils little sponges cotton wool qtips i washed the sweat and grime off my hands and face and flushed the toilet using the noise to cover up the sound as i went through the drawers and cupboards there was nothing out of the ordinary soap deodorant shampoo talcum tampons advil maalox the only interesting item was a bottle of prozac these days it seems half the worlds on prozac when i got back to the living room karen had just finished tidying things into neat piles she smiled cold drink a coke would be great ill just go freshen up she looked down at her body and spread her arms then seemed embarrassed by the gesture in fact now we were inside her manner had grown much more nervous and i didnt know how to put her at ease too many movies about the nice guy next door turning out to be a psycho i suppose ill help myself i said you go wash up ok ill er its in the fridge i wont be long are you sure youll be ok ill be fine dont worry when she went into her bathroom the lock clicked behind her as soon as i heard the shower start up i began a quick search not knowing what the hell i was looking for if schiller had been murdered karen had to be a suspect much as i hoped she hadnt done it she had been one of the three to know where he was after the singalong and how drunk he was all i found out was that karen was halfway through the concrete blonde that she more than likely slept alone that she favoured casual clothes but had a couple of expensive dresses that she didnt seem to watch videos very much and that her musical tastes extended from mozart to alanis morissette when she came out she was wearing red shorts and a white shirt her hair was still damp from the shower and it hung in long hanks framing her pale oval face there she said hoisting herself onto a stool at the kitchen counter thats better what a start to the day i poured her a coke i guess you must still be pretty upset about your friend dying i said bud yes how did you of course ive seen you in chloes havent i always alone no wife girlfriend a definite hint of flirtation there i thought my wife died three years ago auto accident oh im so sorry that must be terrible i shrugged theres good days and bad were you very close to mr schiller she looked away not really i dont mean to pry or anything i said but were you i mean what drew you to him i dont know we werent an item if thats what youre getting at she blushed id just been through a painful divorce i was depressed i suppose i came down here to escape i dont know i guess maybe i succeeded bud and the others they were my escape it was all fun no demands bud was a laugh he never took anything seriously you were one of the last people to see him alive werent you karen nodded yes with ed and ginny what happened wed all had a bit too much to drink when everyone else left after the carols we started joking around by the pool i fell in i wanted to go home and change out of my wet clothes so the three of us came to my place bud said he had a couple of things to do then he was going to turn in did he say what he had to do no just a couple of things do you think he could have been meeting someone i suppose so i she looked me in the eye why just curious how did he seem he was very drunk she frowned then went on you know ive thought time and time again that we should have done something that i should have said something like what oh made him come with us something like that somehow i feel responsible dont be silly theres no way you could have known even so i cant help feeling guilty she held her hands up look i dont know how we got into this but its a beautiful day out there and i dont want to get even more depressed interview over youre right i said getting up id better be going myself she walked me to the door thanks for the help it was nice talking to you you too before she could close the door on me i turned dont think this too presumptuous of me i began but how would you like to come out for dinner or a drink tonight tonight her face dropped oh i cant im busy i started to turn away its ok i understand believe me my mistake especially after what you said about the divorce and all im sorry but she rested her warm hand on my arm its nothing like that she said i dont want you to think im making an excuse im not i really do have something on tonight the three of us are having a sort of wake i couldnt miss it maybe this wasnt the brush off then heart thumping fear of rejection bringing me out in a sweat i persevered how about tomorrow night then she smiled id love to really i would great do you like seafood sure how about the big fin fine look ill meet you at the bar there at seven ive got some running around to do first and im not sure if ill have time to get back here ok fine big fin bar seven i walked off grinning like an idiot the phone started ringing the way they do the minute i stuck my key in the door that afternoon i put the groceries id bought at publix on the kitchen counter and picked up the extension jack its mike my partner you were quick well partly its a slow week and and partly theres not a hell of a lot to report go ahead anyway nothing on any of the people on the list squeaky clean every one of them what about schiller thats the only interesting part as far as i can make out nobody knows him i checked out the kingston address you gave me its owned by a couple called renard they confirmed that a man called bud schiller rents it from them and the cheques come in regularly where from that they wouldnt tell me anyway i got the name of the guy next door to the schiller place and he said the house is empty most of the time now what the hell did that mean anything else that doctor in waterloo joseph brady he checks out hes edward brennans family doctor has been for years and he rented the condo to ed for the first time a few years back apparently the poor guy needed to recuperate from some illness nothing specific you know doctors but i got the impression this ed character had suffered various health problems on and off over mental or physical cant say but bradys a family doctor jack not a shrink ok go on so it was a kind of convalescent holiday he liked it and kept coming back how about escapeitall perfectly legit they own a few condos down the gulf coast and rent them through local agencies quite a lot of the toronto travel agents do business with them and the ones i talked to said they never had any problems and the timeshare also legit there is one thing though virginia fraser one of the names you gave me right ginny fraser i talked to the woman she rented from and it turns out that the dates fraser got werent available originally so so she paid over the odds ahha on welfare too is that all just about gardiner holdings that company in the caymans looks like its the front of a front of a front i couldnt get even get a whiff of the real movers and shakers behind it ok i said thanks a lot mike you did good work then i hung up and mulled over what id learned gee i dunno mr erwin i really shouldnt be doing this mary said when she found the right key itll have to be cleaned out anyway i said yeah i know its just still you are a licensed private investigator right right and maybe we can check on next of kin make sure no ones gonna come down and file a lawsuit against you i hated pressuring her that way but i had to get inside schillers condo if i was to get any further i was now more or less convinced that someone either one of his three pals or someone he had arranged to meet had gone to the pool and murdered him it would help if i could find out whether he had anything to hide still biting her lip mary turned the key in the lock schiller certainly travelled light a quick search of the master bedroom revealed only warmclimate clothes and a tattered tom clancy paperback on the bedside table no papers in the drawers no photographs nothing the cops must have taken his passport the bathroom held only what a single mans bathroom would and the guest bedroom was empty except for the bed stripped down to its mattress kitchen and fridge contained the usual milk bread condiments a couple of tv dinners cutlery booze by the looks of it schiller ate out a lot in the living room the stereo tv and vcr took up one corner a cabinet under the vcr held a stock of tapes one of the movies was from a local rental store and it was overdue by two days the tape was still in the machine ill take this back tomorrow i said to mary casually slipping the tape back in the box mary just nodded and glanced nervously at the door i think thats about all i said if you want to go now mary was out the front door like a shot you didnt find anything about next of kin nothing no news is good news dont worry she flashed an anxious smile ill try not to and i hurried back to call the courier company it was late but with luck they could get a package to mike overnight jack uhhuh mike hang on just a minute i sat up quickly it felt like i had to drag myself a long way back from god knew where i rubbed my eyes and checked my watch threethirty in the afternoon i must have dozed off after lunch i opened the fridge and popped the tab on a can of michelob then picked up the phone again yeah go ahead mike sorry about that no problem i took the video down to ident first thing this morning it was a bit of a mess must have been a popular movie down there but harry found a match you might be interested in schillers got a record not schiller the only prints we could find on file belong to a sherman smith that rings a bell it should do he went on remember that land scam twenty years ago smith defrauded hundreds of people out of their life savings what was it some land in florida turned out to be swamp something like that smith disappeared with the money and was never seen or heard of again in all there mustve been over two or three million bucks i whistled what happened the mounties followed the paper trail for a while then they lost it smith never surfaced again except as schiller i thought he probably split his time between florida and the cayman islands travelling on a phony canadian passport but not staying in canada for long too risky do we recognize any of the victims names i asked mike i could almost hear him grinning over the phone i thought youd never ask as a matter of fact we do a mr edward brennan karen was sitting at a stool at the bar sipping something colourful and cluttered through a candystriped straw she was wearing a green silk offtheshoulder number one i had seen in her closet with her legs crossed i caught an eyeful of slim tanned thigh as i walked towards her she smiled and said hello her shiny blonde hair fell over her shoulder on one side and she had tucked the other side behind her ear fixing it there with a pink flower that matched her lipstick nice touch i must admit id been relieved to find out it was ed who had the connection with smith not karen it didnt mean he was the killer of course but it sure gave him one hell of a motive i still had a lot of questions for karen though and i wasnt sure how or if i could mix business and pleasure i ordered a bourbon on the rocks and we walked through to the table it was a tackylooking kind of restaurant with nets hanging from the ceilings and old barrels converted into chairs but the food was always superb karen examined the menu then she said id like to start with some oysters how about you fine by me oysters for an ice queen maybe al french had an agenda of his own so we ordered a dozen oysters and a bottle of californian champagne followed by swordfish steak for me and coquilles saintjacques for karen she avoided my eyes as the waiter lit candles on the table we chatted about this and that karen seemed nervous on edge attention all over the place so much so that she seemed skittish but just when i thought id lost her shed look me in the eye and come back with the kind of remark that showed she was there all the time maybe even a step or two ahead did you know bud ed or ginny back home i asked when the subject came around to last nights wake she shook her head one rule about a world you escape to is that neither it nor any of its inhabitants can exist in the world you regularly live in she fingered the napkin ring on the table as she spoke shadows flitting in the depths of her eyes i can understand that i said thinking it sounded like something out of a computergame manual the oysters arrived and we helped ourselves i suppose its an escape for me too is it in what way i used to come down here with my wife karen frowned then its not an escape youre after she said its catharsis maybe youre right if so it hasnt happened yet she put her hand lightly on mine give it time jack give it time we finished the oysters and the main courses arrived i tried to find a way to steer the conversation back to bud schiller as usual i couldnt find a subtle way so halfway through my swordfish during a temporary lull i said remember when you told me the three of you went to your room and bud stayed out by the pool she nodded and you thought he might be meeting someone thats right did any of the others leave your room at any time not until later she blushed ed must have passed out there i found him on the couch in the morning did ed ever mention knowing bud from before karen looked down at her plate and speared a scallop no then she looked back at me and her eyes widened what are you suggesting that ed murdered bud you cant be serious i dont know karen im just curious thats all but why why are you interested are you a cop im a private investigator i told her but im not licensed to operate down here i shrugged it just seemed suspicious to me thats all i paused for a moment then i jumped right in and told her about schillers true identity and the land scam in which one edward brennan lost his lifes savings when i finished karen was pale she excused herself to visit the washroom when she came back she looked a lot better she didnt wear much makeup but she had given herself a fresh coat of the basics and looked good as new im sorry for overreacting she said honestly id never really considered that buds death could have been deliberate i suppose i was too busy blaming myself but ed i cant be sure i said but it doesnt look good are you certain he never left your condo he went over to his own unit to pick up some scotch id run out but he wasnt gone for more than ten minutes ten minutes was enough what are you going to do tell the authorities i suppose she nodded slowly that would be the right thing to do of course but poor ed i dont like the thought of him spending the rest of his life in jail cant you just you know let it go however much of an asshole bud schiller was he didnt deserve to die like that youre right she whispered id like to go home as i followed karens honda back to whispering palms i was beginning to think that id blown my chances of a pleasant end to the evening but she invited me up for a nightcap once we were inside she busied herself preparing the drinks flitting nervously between fridge and cocktail cabinet chattering brightly away ever since we got back id sensed a certain tension between us and i thought it was sexual when she walked past me to open the sliding glass door to the lanai i put my hand out and touched her shoulder she turned gave me a swift peck on the cheek and said she had to go to the bathroom i gazed out at the dark island beyond the lanai the christmas lights on the bridge drink in hand waiting for her what did the peck on the cheek mean was it promise or consolation youre an old fool jack erwin i told myself you should stick to your bourbon and blues then i heard a door open behind me thinking it was karen coming back i turned around ed brennan stood there a baseball bat in his hands before i had time to react the front door opened and ginny fraser walked in carrying a long kitchen knife karen came out of the bathroom she wasnt carrying any weapon and she looked as if she had been crying oh jack she said shaking her head im so sorry what are you going to do i asked trying to sound more confident than i felt hit me on the head with the baseball bat then stab me and pretend it was an accident just to protect ed here come on karen hes not worth it you dont understand karen said you think you know everything but you dont you dont know anything my breath caught in my throat what the hell are you talking about then a strange thing happened i saw karen flash a quick sad glance at ed and he just seemed to deflate right before my eyes his baseball bat dropped to the floor hes right karen he said we cant do this were not killers i looked at ginny fraser she dropped the kitchen knife and flopped onto the sofa after i got my breath back i turned to karen and said right now weve got that charade out of the way will someone tell me whats going on here im sorry ed said for the third time i dont know what came over us we were desperate i still cant imagine what made us think we could kill an innocent man when karen phoned from the restaurant and told us you knew we just panicked im sorry i deceived you karen said i admit i was trying to find out if you knew anything after i saw you and the woman from the office looking at the pool yesterday i thought you might be trouble so i arranged the puncture well that makes two of us acting from impure motives i thought so youre all sorry i said whoopadedoodah now would someone tell me why i shouldnt call the police right now we cant stop you ed said we wont stop you in a way it would be a relief i poured three fingers of karens bourbon into my glass and settled down on the sofa beside ginny karen and ed sat opposite in matching easy chairs just tell me what its all about i said who really did kill schiller we all did ed answered i looked at karen and ginny who both nodded jesus christ i thought its murder on the orient express all over again ginny and i pushed him into the pool ed went on he thought we were playing games karen plugged in the piano and we all lowered it in after him after that all we had to do was lie to the police and tell them he was still alive when we left him what i really dont understand i went on is why i know smith cheated ed out of his lifes savings but what did he ever do to you karen my father she said flatly vernon connant youll find his name on your list lees my married name smith swindled him out of every penny we had when the news broke he killed my mother then himself with a shotgun i was five at the time just before he put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger he looked at me he was going to kill me too but at the last moment he couldnt do it ill never forget that look ive spent my whole life trying one shrink to another pills the lot you cant tell me that sherman smith didnt deserve to die i took a long sip of bourbon and let the fire fill my mouth before swallowing what about you ginny you werent on the list either my husband harvey pellier i went back to my maiden name what happened ginny gave a harsh laugh nothing quite so dramatic as karens story harvey lost everything and it broke his spirit he left us just walked out and never came back we hadnt been really well off but wed been happy when harvey left the family just fell apart i couldnt hold it together the kids did badly at school started hanging with a bad crowd you know the sort of thing they drifted into drugs street life will died of an overdose janes still somewhere out on the streets i havent heard from her in years after a few moments of silence ed ran his hands through his hair and said he wouldnt mind a drink karen got him a scotch on the rocks then he began i bumped into smith about four years ago pure chance coincidence i just couldnt believe it i suppose when you think about it you never know whos going to be renting from who anyway i saw him after over fifteen years and do you know what i shook my head he didnt recognize me i mean you ought to recognize people whose lives you ruined dont you think because of him i had a nervous breakdown i got hooked on the booze lost job after job you name it he thumped his chest with his fist then when i began to relive what hed done to me i realized the anger was still there only now i had the advantage but i couldnt kill him not alone he glanced at karen and ginny when it first happened i mean twenty years ago lots of us had meetings with lawyers and i became close to karens father and ginnys husband but smith had never seen karen or ginny so i got in touch with them told them the situation and we planned what to do we befriended him one by one pretended we didnt know each other then we killed him ed fell silent and the others looked at me it was hard to imagine the havoc sherman smith had wreaked on these lives hard not to sympathize with the three of them but who was i to judge its up to you now jack karen said seeming to sense my dilemma you know the whole story now were guilty of premeditated murder she glanced at ed if you want my honest opinion i dont think its helped any of us i dont think its going to make our lives any easier to bear probably the opposite but its done and youre the only one who knows about it we cant kill you but were not going to give ourselves up willingly either its your decision so whether i liked it or not it was up to me i finished my bourbon then i nodded and went back to my condo almost exactly one year to the day later i found myself in chloes for happy hour there were one or two faces i recognized around the bar but most of the people were strangers i still didnt know why i kept coming back year after year especially this year maybe karen had been right and i was looking for catharsis or for karen i looked across the bar at where i had first really noticed her last year running her finger around the rim of a glass now a chainsmoking brunette with a hard face sat there instead hi shamus al french slipped onto the empty stool beside me beer i offered my turn al ordered two beers did you ever get to the bottom of that mysterious death he asked which one was that you know last year that asshole bud schiller oh him i shook my head i dont think there was anything mysterious about it at all i think he was drunk he tripped and he fell into the pool yeah and he pulled the piano in after him just for good measure come on jack i shrugged you know al sometimes the strangest of accidents do happen did i ever tell you about the guy they found dead on the subway tracks and couldnt find his head the wrong hands is everything in order the old man asked his scrawny fingers clutching the comforter like talons seems to be said mitch drawing up the will had been a simple enough task mr garibaldi and his wife had the dubious distinction of outliving both their children and there wasnt much to leave would you like to sign it now he asked holding out his mont blanc the old man clutched the pen the way a child holds a crayon and scribbled his illegible signature on the documents there thats done said mitch he placed the papers in his briefcase mr garibaldi nodded the movement brought on a spasm and such a coughing fit that mitch thought the old man was going to die right there and then but he recovered will you do me a favour he croaked when hed got his breath back mitch frowned if i can with one bent shrivelled finger mr garibaldi pointed to the floor under the window pull the carpet back he said mitch stood up and looked please said mr garibaldi the carpet mitch walked over to the window and rolled back the carpet underneath was nothing but floorboards one of the boards is loose said the old man the one directly in line with the wall socket lift it up mitch felt and sure enough part of the floorboard was loose he lifted it easily with his fingernails underneath wedged between the joists lay a package wrapped in old newspaper thats it said the old man take it out mitch did it was heavier than he had expected now put the board back and replace the carpet after he had done as he was asked mitch carried the package over to the bed open it said mr garibaldi go on it wont bite you slowly mitch unwrapped the newspaper it was from december he noticed and the headline reported a blizzard dumping twentyeight inches of snow on new york city the day before inside he found a layer of oilcloth when he had folded back that too a gun gleamed up at him it was old he could tell that but it looked in superb condition he hefted it into his hand felt its weight and balance pointed it towards the wall as if to shoot be careful said the old man its loaded mitch looked at the gun again then put it back on the oilcloth his fingers were smudged with oil or grease so he took a tissue from the bedside table and wiped them off as best he could what the hell are you doing with a loaded gun he asked mr garibaldi sighed its a luger he said first world war probably old anyway a friend gave it to me many years ago a german friend ive kept it ever since partly as a memento of him and partly for protection you know what this citys been getting like these past few years ive maintained it cleaned it kept it loaded now im gonna die i want to hand it in i dont want it to fall into the wrong hands mitch set the luger down on the bed why tell me he asked because its unregistered and id like you to hand it over for me he shook his head and coughed again i havent got long left i dont want no cops coming round here and giving me a hard time they wont give you a hard time more like give you a medal for handing over an unregistered firearm mitch thought maybe not but mr garibaldi grabbed mitchs wrist with his talon the fingers felt cold and dry like a reptiles skin mitch tried to pull back a little but the old man held on pulled him closer and croaked sophie doesnt know it would make her real angry to know we had a gun in the house the last fifty years and i kept it from her i dont want to end my days with my wife mad at me please mr mitchell its a small favour i ask mitch scratched the side of his eye true enough he thought it was a small favour and it might prove a profitable one too old firearms were worth something to collectors and mitch knew a cop who had connections all he had to say was that he had been entrusted this gun by a client who had brought it to his office that he had put it in the safe and called the police immediately what could be wrong with that ok he said rewrapping the gun and slipping it in his briefcase along with the will ill do as you ask dont worry you rest now everything will be ok mr garibaldi smiled and seemed to sink into a deep sleep mitch stood on the porch of the garibaldi house and pulled on his sheepskinlined gloves glad to be out of the cloying atmosphere of the sickroom even if it was minus ninety or something outside he was already wearing his heaviest overcoat over a suit and a wool scarf but still he was freezing it was one of those clear winter nights when the ice cracks underfoot and the breeze off the lake seems to numb you right to the bone reflected street lamps splintered in the broken mirror of the sidewalk the colour of mr garibaldis jaundiced eyes mitch pulled his coat tighter around his scarf and set off cracking the icedover puddles as he went here and there the remains of last weeks snow had frozen into ruts and he almost slipped and fell a couple of times on the uneven surface as he walked he thought of old garibaldi with no more than a few weeks or days left to live the old man must have been in pain sometimes but he never complained and he surely must be afraid of death maybe dying put things in perspective mitch thought maybe the mind facing the eternal icy darkness of death had ways of dealing with its impending extinction of discarding the dross the petty and the useless or perhaps not maybe the old man just lay there day after day running baseball statistics through his mind or wishing hed slept with his neighbours wife when he had the chance as mitch walked up the short hill he cursed the fact that you could never get a decent parking spot in these residential streets hed had to park in the lot behind the drug store the next street over and the quickest way there was through a dirt alley just about wide enough for a garbage truck to pass through it happened as he cut through the alley and it happened so fast that afterwards he couldnt be quite sure whether he felt the sharp blow to the back of his head before his feet slipped out from under him or after when mitch opened his eyes again the first thing he saw was the night sky it looked like a black satin bedsheet with some rich womans diamonds spilled all over it there was no moon he felt frozen to the marrow he didnt know how long he had been lying there in the alley long enough to die of exposure it felt like but when he checked his watch he saw he had only been out a little over five minutes not surprising no one had found him yet not here on a night like this he lay on the frozen mud and took stock despite the cold everything hurt his elbow which he had cracked trying to break his fall his tailbone his right shoulder and most of all his head and the pain was sharp and spiky not at all numb like the rest of him he reached around and touched the sore spot on the back of his head his fingers came away sticky with blood he took a deep breath and tried to get to his feet but he could only manage to slip and skitter around like a newborn deer making himself even more dizzy there was no purchase nothing to grip snaillike he slid himself along the ice towards the rickety fence there by reaching out and grabbing the wooden rails carefully he was able to drag himself to his feet picking up only a few splinters for his troubles at first he wished he had stayed where he was his head started to spin and he thought it was going to split open with pain for a moment he was sure he was going to fall again he held on to the fence for dear life and vomited the world swimming around his head after that he felt a little better maybe he wasnt going to die the only light shone from a street lamp at the end of the alley not really enough to search by so mitch used the plastic penlight attached to his keyring to look for his briefcase but it wasnt there stepping carefully on the ribbed ice still in pain and unsure of his balance mitch extended the area of his search in case the briefcase had skidded off somewhere on the ice when he fell it was nowhere to be found almost as an afterthought as the horrible truth was beginning to dawn on him he felt for his wallet gone so hed been mugged the blow had come before the fall and theyd taken his briefcase then mitch remembered the gun the next morning was a nightmare mitch had managed to get himself home from the alley without crashing the car and after a long hot bath a tumbler of scotch and four extrastrength tylenol he began to feel a little better he seemed to remember his mother once saying you shouldnt go to sleep after a bump on the head he didnt know why but it didnt stop him that night in the morning he awoke aching all over when he had showered taken more tylenol and forced himself to eat some bran flakes he poured a second cup of strong black coffee and sat down to think things out none of his thoughts brought any comfort he hadnt gone to the cops how could he given what he had been carrying whichever way you looked at it he had been in possession of an illegal unregistered firearm when he was mugged even if the cops had been lenient there was the law society to reckon with and like most lawyers mitch feared the law society far more than he feared the police maybe he could have sort of skipped over the gun in his account of the mugging after all he was pretty sure that it couldnt be traced either to him or to garibaldi but what if the cops found the briefcase and the gun was still inside it how could he explain that would that be worse than if the briefcase turned up and the gun was gone if the muggers took it the chances were someone might get shot with it either way it was a bad scenario for mitch and it was all his fault well maybe fault was too strong a word he couldnt help getting mugged but he still felt somehow responsible all he could do was hope that whoever took the gun would get rid of it throw it in the lake before anyone came to any harm some hope later that morning mitch remembered garibaldis will that had gone too along with the briefcase and the gun and it would have to be replaced theres only one true will copies have no legal standing and if you lose it you could have a hell of a mess on your hands luckily he had garibaldis will on his computer all he had to do was print it out again and hope to hell the old guy hadnt died during the night he hadnt puzzled but accepting mitchs excuse of a minor error hed come across when proofreading the document garibaldi signed again with a shaking hand is the gun safe he asked afterwards youve got it locked away in your safe yes mitch lied yes dont worry the guns perfectly safe every day mitch scanned the paper from cover to cover for news of a shooting or a gun found abandoned somewhere he even took to buying the sun which he normally wouldnt even use as toilet paper up at the cottage because it covered more lurid local crime than the globe or the star anything to do with firearms was certain to make it into the sun but it wasnt until three weeks and three days after the mugging and two weeks after mr garibaldis death peacefully at home that the item appeared and it was big enough news to make the globe and mail mr charles mcvie was shot dead in his home last night during the course of an apparent burglary a police spokesperson says mr mcvie was shot twice once in the chest and once in the groin while interrupting a burglar at his beaches mansion shortly after midnight last night he died of his wounds three hours later at east general hospital detective greg hollins who has been assigned the case declined to comment on whether the police are following any significant leads at the moment but he did inform our reporter that preliminary tests indicate the bullet was most likely fired from an old mm semiautomatic weapon such as a luger unusual and fairly rare these days as yet police have not been able to locate the gun mr mcvie made his fortune in the construction business his wife laura who was staying overnight with friends in windsor when the shooting occurred had no comment when she was reached early this morning the newspaper shook in mitchs hands it had happened somebody had died because of him but while he felt guilt he also felt fear was there really no way the police could tie the gun to him or mr garibaldi thank god the old man was dead or he might hear about the shooting and his conscience might oblige him to come forward luckily his widow sophie knew nothing with luck the luger was in the deepest part of the lake for sure by now whether anyone else had touched it or not mitch knew damn well that he had and that his greasy fingerprints werent only all over the grip and the barrel but on the wrapping paper too the muggers had probably been wearing gloves when they robbed him it was a cold night and maybe theyd had the sense to keep them on when they saw what was in the briefcase calm down he told himself even if the cops did find his fingerprints on the gun they had no way of knowing whose prints they were mitch had never been fingerprinted in his life and the cops would have no reason to subject him to it now and they couldnt connect charles mcvie to either mr garibaldi or to mitch except for one thing mitch had drawn up mcvies will two years ago after his marriage to laura his second wife mitch had known that laura mcvie was younger than her husband but even that knowledge hadnt prepared him for the woman who opened the door to him three days after charles mcvies funeral black became her really became her the way it set off her creamy complexion long blonde hair kim basinger lips and eyes the colour of a bluejays wing yes she said frowning slightly mitch had put on his very best most expensive suit and he knew he looked sharp he didnt want her to think he was some ambulancechaser come after her husbands money as executor laura mcvie was under no obligation to use the same lawyer who had prepared her husbands will to handle his estate laura might have a lawyer of her own in mind but mitch did have the will so there was every chance that if he presented himself well she would choose him to handle the estate too and there was much more money in estates especially those as big as mcvies than there was in wills at least mitch thought he wasnt so hypocritical as to deny that he had mixed motives for visiting the widow didnt everyone have mixed motives he felt partly responsible for mcvies death of course and a part of him genuinely wanted to offer the widow help after mitch had introduced himself laura looked him over plump lower lip fetchingly nipped between two sharp white teeth then she flashed him a smile and said please come in mr mitchell i was wondering what to do about all that stuff i really could use some help her voice was husky and lowpitched with just a subtle hint of that submissive tone that can drive certain men wild mitch followed her into the highceilinged hallway watching the way her hips swayed under the mourning dress he was in all right he almost executed a little jig on the parquet floor the house was an enormous heap of stone overlooking the ravine it had always reminded mitch of an english vicarage or what he assumed an english vicarage looked like from watching pbs inside though it was bright and spacious and filled with modern furniture not an antimacassar in sight the paintings that hung on the white walls were all contemporary abstracts and geometric designs no doubt originals and worth a small fortune in themselves the stereo equipment was stateoftheart as were the large screen tv vcr and dvd player laura mcvie sat on a white sofa and crossed her legs the dress she wore was rather short for mourning mitch thought though he wasnt likely to complain about the four or five inches of smooth thigh it revealed especially as the lower part was sheathed in black silk stockings and the upper was bare and white she took a cigarette from a carved wooden box on the coffee table and lit it with a lighter that looked like a baseball mitch declined the offer to join her i hope you dont mind she said lowering her eyes its my only vice of course not mitch cleared his throat i just wanted to come and tell you how sorry i was to hear about the the tragic accident your husband was it wasnt an accident mr mitchell she said calmly my husband was murdered i believe we should face the truth clearly and not hide behind euphemisms dont you well if you put it like that she nodded you were saying about my husband well i didnt know him well but i have done some legal work for him specifically his will and i am aware of his circumstances my husband was very rich mr mitchell exactly i thought well there are some unscrupulous people out there mrs mcvie please call me laura laura there are some unscrupulous people out there and i thought if there was anything i could do to help perhaps give advice take the burden off your hands what burden would that be mr mitchell mitch sat forward and clasped his hands on his knees when someone dies mrs laura there are always problems legal wrangling and the like your husbands affairs seem to be in good order judging from his will but that was made two years ago id hate to see someone come and take advantage of you thank you laura said youre so sweet and why shouldnt you handle the estate someone has to do it i cant mitch had the strangest feeling that something was going awry here laura mcvie didnt seem at all the person to be taken advantage of yet she seemed to be swallowing his line of patter that could only be he decided because it suited her too and why not it would take a load off her mind that wasnt the main reason i came though mitch pressed on feeling an irrational desire to explain himself i genuinely wanted to see if i could help in any way why she asked blue eyes open wide why should you mr mitchell ive come to learn that people do things for selfish motives selfinterest rules always i dont believe in altruism nor did my husband at least we were agreed on that she turned aside flicked some ash at the ashtray and missed in contrast to everything else in the place the tin ashtray looked as if it had been stolen from a lowlife bar so you want to help me she said for a fee of course mitch felt embarrassed and uncomfortable the part of him that had desperately wanted to make amends for his part in charles mcvies death was being thwarted by the frankness and openness of the widow yes he could use the money of course he could but that really wasnt his only reason for being there and he wanted her to know that how could he explain that he really wasnt such a bad guy there are expenses involved in settling an estate mitch went on disbursements of course there are but im not here to cheat you she smiled at him indulgently of course not which definitely came across as as if you could but if youll allow me to she shifted her legs showing more thigh mr mitchell she said im getting the feeling that you really do have another reason for coming to see me if its not that youre after my husbands money then what are you after mitch swallowed i i feel you see i come on mr mitchell you can tell me youll feel better the voice that had seemed so submissive when mitch first heard it now became hypnotic so warm so trustworthy so easy to answer and he had to tell someone i feel partly responsible for your husbands death he said looking into her eyes oh im not the burglar im not the killer but i think i inadvertently supplied the gun laura mcvie looked puzzled now he had begun mitch saw no point in stopping if he could only tell this woman the full story he thought then she would understand perhaps she would even be sympathetic towards him forgive him so he told her when he had finished laura stood up abruptly and walked over to the picturewindow with its view of a back garden as big as central park mitch sat where he was and looked at her from behind her legs were close together and her arms were crossed she seemed to be turned in on herself he couldnt tell whether she was crying or not but her shoulders seemed to be moving well he asked after a while what do you think she let the silence stretch a moment then dropped her arms and turned around slowly her eyes did look moist with tears what do i think she said i dont know i dont know what to think i think that maybe if youd reported the gun stolen the police would have searched for it and my husband wouldnt have been murdered but i would have been charged disbarred mr mitchell surely thats a small price to pay for someones life im sorry i think youd better go i cant think straight right now but i please mr mitchell leave she turned back to the window again and folded her arms shaking mitch got up off the sofa and headed for the door he felt defeated as if he had left something important unfinished but there was nothing he could do about it only slink off with his tail between his legs feeling worse than when he had come why hadnt he just told her he was after handling mcvies estate money pure and simple selfinterest like that she would have understood two days later and still no developments reported in the mcvie investigation laura phoned mr mitchell yes im sorry about my behaviour the other day i was upset as you can imagine i can understand that mitch said i dont blame you i dont even know why i told you im glad you did ive had time to think about it since then and im beginning to realize how terrible you must feel i want you to understand that i dont blame you its not the gun that commits the crime after all is it its the person who pulls the trigger im sure if the burglar hadnt got that one hed have got one somewhere else look this is very awkward over the telephone do you think you could come to the house when how about this evening for dinner fine said mitch im really glad you can find it in your heart to forgive me eight oclock eight it is when he put down the phone mitch jumped to his feet punched the air shouted yes dinner was catered by a local italian restaurant laura mcvie not being in her own words much of a cook two waiters delivered the food served it discreetly and took away the dirty dishes mostly mitch and laura made small talk in the candlelight over the pasta and wine and it wasnt until the waiters had left and they were alone relaxing on the sofa each cradling a snifter of courvoisier xo cognac with mellow jazz playing in the background that the conversation became more intimate laura was still funereally clad but tonight her dress made of semitransparent layers of black chiffon more than enough for decency fell well below knee height there was still no disguising the curves and the rustling sounds as she crossed her legs made mitch more than a little hot under the collar laura puckered her lips to light a cigarette when she had blown the smoke out she asked are you married mitch shook his head ever been nope just didnt meet the right girl is that it something like that youre not gay are you he laughed what on earth made you think that she rested her free hand on his and smiled dont worry nothing made me think it nothing in particular just checking thats all no mitch said im not gay more cognac sure mitch was already feeling a little tipsy but he didnt want to spoil the mood she fetched the bottle and poured them each a generous measure i didnt really love charles you know she said when she had settled down and smoothed her dress again i mean i respected him i even liked him i just didnt love him why did you marry him laura shrugged i dont know really he asked me he was rich and seemed to live an exciting life travel parties i got to meet all kinds of celebrities wed only been married two years you know and wed only known one another a few weeks before we got married we hadnt even you know anyway im sorry hes dead in a way what do you mean laura leaned forward and stubbed out her cigarette then she brushed back a long blonde tress and took another sip of cognac before answering well she said now that hes dead its all mine isnt it id be a hypocrite and a fool if i said that didnt appeal to me all this wealth and no strings attached no responsibilities what responsibilities were there before the left corner of her lips twitched in a smile oh you know the usual wifely kind charles was never well lets say he wasnt a very passionate lover he wanted me more as a showpiece than anything else a trophy something to hang on his arm that looked good dont get me wrong i didnt mind it was a small price to pay and then we were forever having to entertain the most boring people business acquaintances you know the sort of thing well now that charles is gone i wont have to do that any more will i ill be able to do what i want exactly what i want almost without mitch knowing it laura had edged nearer towards him as she was speaking and now she was so close he could smell the warm acrid smoke and the cognac on her breath he found it curiously intoxicating soon she was close enough to kiss she took hold of his hand and rested it on her breast its been a week since the funeral she said dont you think its time i took off my widows weeds when mitch left laura mcvies house the following morning he was beginning to think he might be on to a good thing why stop at being estate executor he asked himself he already knew that under the terms of the will laura got everything mcvie had no children or other living relatives and everything was somewhere in the region of five million dollars even if he didnt love her and how could you tell if you loved someone after just one night he certainly felt passionately drawn to her they got on well together thought alike and she was a wonderful lover mitch was no slouch either he could certainly make up for her late husband in that department he mustnt rush it though take things easy see what develops maybe they could go away together for a while somewhere warm and then well five million dollars such were his thoughts as he turned the corner just before the heavy hand settled on his shoulder and a deep voice whispered in his ear detective greg hollins mr mitchell homicide i think its about time you and i had a long talk relieved to be let off with little more than a warning in exchange for cooperating with the police mitch turned up at lauras the next evening as arranged this time they skipped the dinner and drinks preliminaries and headed straight for her bedroom afterwards she lay with her head resting on his shoulder smoking a cigarette my god she said i missed this when i was married to charles didnt you have any lovers mitch asked of course i didnt oh come on i wont be jealous i promise tell me she jerked away stubbed out the cigarette on the bedside ashtray and said youre just like the police do you know that youve got a filthy mind hey said mitch its me mitch ok still they think i did it you know did what killed charles i thought you had an alibi i do idiot they think the burglary was just a cover they think i hired someone to kill him did you see what i mean just like the cops with your filthy suspicious mind what makes you think they suspect you the way they talked the way they questioned me i think theyre watching me youre just being paranoid laura youre upset they always suspect someone in the family at first its routine most killings are family affairs youll see pretty soon theyll drop it do you really think so sure i do just you wait and see and moments later they were making love again laura seemed a little distracted when she let him in the next night at first he thought she had something on the stove but then he remembered she didnt cook she was on the telephone as it turned out and she hung up the receiver just as he walked into the living room who was that he asked not reporters i hope no she said arms crossed facing him an unreadable expression on her face who then laura just stood there theyve found the gun she said finally theyve what where in your garage under an old tarpaulin i dont understand what are you talking about when she looked at her watch about now how laura shrugged anonymous tip youd better sit down mitch mitch collapsed on the sofa drink a large one laura brought him a large tumbler of scotch and sat in the armchair opposite him whats all this about he asked after the whisky had warmed his insides i dont understand what youre saying how could they find the gun in my garage i told you what happened to it i know you did said laura and im telling you where it ended up youre really not very bright are you mitch how do you think it got there someone must have put it there right one of the muggers but what does it matter what matters is that it will probably have your fingerprints on it or the wrapping will all those greasy smudges and even if it doesnt how are you going to explain its presence in your garage but why would the cops think i killed charles we had a relationship we were lovers like i told you im certain theyve been watching me and they cant fail to have noticed that youve stayed overnight on more than one occasion but thats absurd i hadnt even met you before your husbands death hadnt you she raised her eyebrows dont you remember honey all those times we met in secret made love cramped in the back of your car because we didnt even dare be seen signing in under false names in the haveanap motel or wherever we had to keep our relationship very very secret dont you remember youd tell them that the way theyll see it is that the relationship was more important to you than to me you became obsessed by jealousy because i was married to someone else you couldnt stand it any more and you thought by killing my husband you could get both me and my money after all you did prepare his will didnt you you knew all about his finances mitch shook his head i would like to thank you though laura went on without you we had a good plan a very good one but with you weve got a perfect one what do you mean i mean you were right when you suggested i had a lover i do oh not you not the one im handing over to the police the one who became so obsessed with me that it unhinged him and he murdered my husband no ive been very careful with jake i met him on the yucatan peninsula when charles and i were on holiday there six months ago and charles went down with montezumas revenge i know it sounds like a romantic cliché but it was love at first sight we hatched the plan very quickly and we knew we had to keep our relationship a total secret nobody must suspect a thing so we never met after that vacation there were no letters or postcards the only contact we had was through public telephones and what happens now after a decent interval after youve been tried and convicted of my husbands murder jake and i will meet and eventually get married well sell up here of course and live abroad live in luxury oh please dont look so crestfallen mitch believe me i am sorry i didnt know you were going to walk into my life with that irresistible little confession now did i i figured id just ride it out the cops suspicions and all i mean they might suspect me but they couldnt prove anything i was in windsor staying with friends theyve checked and now theyve got you into the bargain she shrugged why would they bother with little old me i just couldnt look a gift horse in the mouth youll make a wonderful fall guy but because i like you mitch im at least giving you a little advance warning arent i the police will be looking for you but youve still got time to make a break leave town what if i go to them tell them everything youve told me theyll think youre crazy which you are obsession does that to people makes them crazy mitch licked his lips look id have to leave everything behind i dont even have any cash on me laura you dont think you could she shook her head sorry honey no can do nothing personal mitch slumped back in the chair at least tell me one more thing the gun i still dont understand how it came to be the one that killed your husband she laughed showing the sharp white teeth pure coincidence it was beautiful jake happens to be a burglar by profession and a very good one he has worked all over the states and canada and hes never been caught we thought that if i told him about the security system at the house he could get around it cleverly and of course he couldnt bring his own gun here from mexico not by air so he had to get one he said thats not too difficult when you move in the circles he does the kind of bars where you can buy guns and other stolen goods are much the same anywhere in much the same sort of neighbourhoods and hes done jobs up here before as luck would have it he bought an old luger off two inexperienced muggers for a hundred bucks i just couldnt believe it when you came around with your story there couldnt be two old lugers kicking around the neighbourhood at the same time could there i had to turn away from you and hold my sides i was laughing so much it made my eyes water what unbelievable luck im so glad you think so said mitch anyway when i told jake he agreed it was too good an opportunity to miss so he came back up here dug the gun up from where he had buried it safe in its wrapping and planted it in your garage he hadnt handled it without gloves on and he thought the two young punks he bought it from had been too scared to touch it so the odds were after you told me your story that your fingerprints would still be on it as i said even if they arent its still perfect only tape hiss followed and detective greg hollins switched off the machine that it he asked mitch nodded i left i thought id got enough you did a good job jesus you got more than enough i was hoping shed let something slip but i didnt expect a full confession and her accomplices name in the bargain thanks i didnt have a lot of choice did i the last two times mitch had been to see laura he had been wearing a tiny but powerful voiceactivated tape recorder sewn into the lining of his suit jacket it had lain on the chair beside the bed when they made love and he had tried to get her to admit she had a boyfriend as hollins had suspected he had also been wearing it the night she told him the police were about to find the luger in his garage the recorder was part of the deal why he got off with only a warning for not reporting the theft of an unregistered firearm whatll happen to her now he asked hollins with any luck both she and her boyfriend will do life said hollins but what do you care after the way she treated you shes a user she chewed you up and spat you out mitch sighed yeah i know he said but it could have been worse couldnt it how i couldve ended up married to her hollins stared at him for a moment then he burst out laughing im glad youve got a sense of humour mitchell youll need it whats coming your way next mitch shifted uneasily in his chair hey just a minute we made a deal you assured me thered be no charges over the gun hollins nodded thats right we did make a deal and i never go back on my word mitch shook his head then i dont understand what are you talking about well theres this lady from the law society waiting outside mitchell and shed really like to talk to you the two ladies of rose cottage in our village they were always known as the two ladies of rose cottage miss eunice with the white hair and miss teresa with the grey nobody really knew where they came from or exactly how old they were but the consensus held that they had met in india america or south africa and decided to return to the homeland to live out their days together and in they were generally believed to be in or approaching their nineties imagine our surprise then one fine day in september when the police car pulled up outside rose cottage and when in a matter of hours rumours began to spread throughout the village rumours of human bones dug up in a distant garden rumours of mutilation and dismemberment rumours of murder lyndgarth is the name of our village it is situated in one of the most remote yorkshire dales about twenty miles from eastvale the nearest large town the village is no more than a group of limestone houses with slate roofs clustered around a bumpy slanted green that always reminded me of a handkerchief flapping in the breeze we have the usual amenities grocers shop butchers newsagents post office school a church a chapel three public houses and proximity to some of the most beautiful countryside in the world i was fifteen in and miss eunice and miss teresa had been living in the village for twenty years yet still they remained strangers to us it is often said that you have to winter out at least two years before being accepted into village life and in the case of a remote place like lyndgarth in those days it was more like ten as far as the locals were concerned then the two ladies had served their apprenticeship and were more than fit to be accepted as fully paid up members of the community yet there was about them a certain detached quality that kept them ever at arms length they did all their shopping in the village and were always polite to people they met in the street they regularly attended church services at st oswalds and helped with charity events and they never set foot in any of the public houses but still there was that sense of distance of not quite being or not wanting to be a part of things the summer of had been unusually beautiful despite the political tensions or am i indulging in nostalgia for childhood our dale can be one of the most grim and desolate landscapes on the face of the earth even in august but i remember the summers of my youth as days of dazzling sunshine and blue skies in every day was a new symphony of colour golden buttercups pink clover mauve cranesbill ever changing and recombining in fresh palettes while the tense negotiations went on in europe while ribbentrop and molotov signed the nazisoviet pact and while there was talk of conscription and rationing at home very little changed in lyndgarth summer in the dale was always a season for odd jobs peatcutting wallmending sheepclipping and for entertainments such as the dialect plays the circus fairs and brass bands even after war was declared on september we still found ourselves rather guiltily having fun scratching our heads shifting from foot to foot and wondering when something really warlike was going to happen of course we had our gas masks in their cardboard boxes which we had to carry everywhere street lighting was banned and motor cars were not allowed to use their headlights this latter rule was the cause of numerous accidents in the dale usually involving wandering sheep on the unfenced roads some evacuees also arrived from the cities uncouth urchins for the most part often verminous and illequipped for country life they seemed like an alien race to us most of them didnt seem to have any warm clothing or wellington boots as if they had never seen mud in the city looking back i realize they were far from home separated from their parents and they must have been scared to death i am ashamed to admit though that at the time i didnt go out of my way to give them a warm welcome this is partly because i was always lost in my own world i was a bookish child and had recently discovered the stories of thomas hardy who seemed to understand and sympathize with a lonely village lad and his dreams of becoming a writer i also remember how much he thrilled and scared me with some of the stories after the withered arm i wouldnt let anyone touch me for a week and i didnt dare go to sleep after barbara of the house of grebe for fear that there was a horribly disfigured statue in the wardrobe that the door would slowly creak open and i think i was reading far from the madding crowd that hot july day and as was my wont i read as i walked across the village green not looking where i was going it was miss teresa i bumped into and i remember thinking that she seemed remarkably resilient for such an old lady do mind where youre going young man she admonished me though when she heard my effusive apologies she softened her tone somewhat she asked me what i was reading and when i showed her the book she closed her eyes for a moment and a strange expression crossed her wrinkled features ah mr hardy she said after a short silence i knew him once you know in his youth i grew up in dorset i could hardly hold back my enthusiasm someone who actually knew hardy i told her that he was my favourite writer of all time even better than shakespeare and that when i grew up i wanted to be a writer just like him miss teresa smiled indulgently do calm down she said then she paused i suppose she continued with a glance towards miss eunice that if you are really interested in mr hardy perhaps you might like to come to tea some day when i assured her i would be delighted we made an arrangement that i was to call at rose cottage the following tuesday at four oclock after securing my mothers permission of course that tuesday visit was the first of many inside rose cottage belied its name it seemed dark and gloomy unlike ours which was always full of sunlight and bright flowers the furnishings were antique even a little shabby i recollect no family photographs of the kind that embellished most mantelpieces but there was a huge giltframed painting of a young girl working alone in a field hanging on one wall if the place sometimes smelled a little musty and neglected the aroma of miss teresas freshbaked scones more often than not made up for it mr hardy was full of contradictions miss teresa told me on one occasion he was a dreamer of course and never happier than when wandering the countryside alone with his thoughts but he was also a fine musician he played the fiddle on many social occasions such as dances and weddings and he was often far more gregarious and cheerful than many of his critics would have imagined he was also a scholar head forever buried in a book always studying latin or greek i was no dullard either you know and i like to think i held my own in our conversations though i had little latin and less greek she chuckled then turned serious again anyway one never felt one really knew him one was always looking at a mask do you understand me young man i nodded i think so miss teresa yes well she said staring into space as she sometimes did while speaking of hardy at least that was my impression though he was a good ten years older than me i like to believe i got glimpses of the man behind the mask but because the other villagers thought him a bit odd and because he was difficult to know he also attracted a lot of idle gossip i remember there was talk about him and that sparks girl from puddletown what was her first name eunice tryphena thats right she curled her lip and seemed to spit out the name tryphena sparks a singularly dull girl i always thought we were about the same age you know she and i anyway there was talk of a child utter rubbish of course she gazed out of the window at the green where a group of children were playing a makeshift game of cricket her eyes seemed to film over manys the time i used to walk through the woodland past the house and i would see him sitting there at his upstairs window seat writing or gazing out on the garden sometimes he would wave and come down to talk suddenly she stopped then her eyes glittered and she went on he used to go and watch hangings in dorchester did you know that i had to confess that i didnt my acquaintance with hardy being recent and restricted only to his published works of fiction but it never occurred to me to doubt miss teresas word of course executions were public back then again she paused and i thought i saw or rather sensed a little shiver run through her then she said that was enough for today that it was time for scones and tea i think she enjoyed shocking me like that at the end of her little narratives as if we needed to be brought back to reality with a jolt i remember on another occasion she looked me in the eye and said of course the doctor tossed him aside as dead at birth you know if it hadnt been for the nurse he would never have survived that must do something to a man dont you think we talked of many other aspects of hardy and his work and for the most part miss eunice remained silent nodding from time to time occasionally when miss teresas memory seemed to fail her on some point such as a name or what novel hardy might have been writing in a certain year she would supply the information i remember one visit particularly vividly miss teresa stood up rather more quickly than i thought her able to and left the room for a few moments i sat politely sipping my tea aware of miss eunices silence and the ticking of the grandfather clock out in the hall when miss teresa returned she was carrying an old book or rather two books which she handed to me it was a twovolume edition of far from the madding crowd and though i didnt know it at the time it was the first edition from and was probably worth a small fortune but what fascinated me even more than helen patersons illustrations was the brief inscription on the flyleaf to tess with affection tom i knew that tess was the diminutive of teresa because i had an aunt teresa in harrogate and it never occurred to me to question that the tess in the inscription was the person sitting opposite me or that the tom was none other than thomas hardy himself he called you tess i remember saying perhaps he had you in mind when he wrote tess of the durbervilles miss teresas face drained of colour so quickly i feared for her life and it seemed that a palpable chill entered the room dont be absurd boy she whispered tess durbeyfield was hanged for murder we had been officially at war for about a week i think when the police called there were three men one in uniform and two in plain clothes they spent almost two hours in rose cottage then came out alone got in their car and drove away we never saw them again the day after the visit though i happened to overhear our local constable talking with the vicar in st oswalds churchyard by a great stroke of fortune several yews stood between us and i was able to remain unseen while i took in every word murdered thats what they say said pc walker bashed his ead in with a poker then chopped im up in little pieces and buried em in tgarden near dorchester it were village called igher bockhampton people who lived there were digging an airraid shelter when they found tbones eck of a shock for tbairns could they possibly mean miss teresa that sweet old lady who made such delightful scones and had known the young thomas hardy could she really have bashed someone on the head chopped him up into little pieces and buried them in the garden i shivered at the thought despite the heat but nothing more was heard of the murder charge the police never returned people found new things to talk about and after a couple of weeks miss eunice and miss teresa reappeared in village life much as they had been before the only difference was that my mother would no longer allow me to visit rose cottage i put up token resistance but by then my mind was full of spitfires secret codes and aircraft carriers anyway events seemed to move quickly in the days after the police visit though i cannot be certain of the actual time period involved four things however conspired to put the murder out of my mind for some time miss teresa died i think in the november of that same year miss eunice retreated into an even deeper silence than before the war escalated and i was called up to military service the next time i gave any thought to the two ladies of rose cottage was in egypt of all places in september i was on night watch with the eighth army not far from alamein desert nights have an eerie beauty i have never found anywhere else since after the heat of the day the cold surprises one for a start as does the sense of endless space but even more surprising is the desertscape of wrecked tanks jeeps and lorries in the cold moonlight metal wrenched and twisted into impossible patterns like some petrified forest or exposed coral reef to spoil our sleep and shatter our nerves rommels afrika korps had got into the routine of setting up huge amplified speakers and blaring out lili marlene over and over all night long it was on a night such as this while i was trying to stay warm and awake and trying to shut my ears to the music that i struck up a conversation with a soldier called sidney ferris from one of the dorset regiments when sid told me he had grown up in piddlehinton i suddenly thought of the two ladies of rose cottage did you ever hear any stories of a murder around there i asked offering sid a cigarette a place called higher bockhampton lots of murder stories going around when i was a lad he said lighting up careful to hide the flame with his cupped hand better than the wireless this would be a wife murdering her husband he nodded plenty of that and all and husbands murdering their wives makes you wonder whether its worth getting married doesnt it higher bockhampton you say yes teresa morgan i believe the womans name was he frowned name dont ring no bell he said but i do recall a tale about some woman who was supposed to have killed her husband cut him up in pieces and buried them in the garden a couple of young lads found some bones when they was digging an airraid shelter a few years back animal bones if you ask me but did the villagers believe the tale he shrugged dont know about anyone else but i cant say as i did so many stories like that going around they cant all be true or damn near all of us would be murderers or corpses stands to reason doesnt it and he took a long drag on his cigarette holding it in his cupped hand like most soldiers so the enemy wouldnt see the pinpoint of light did anyone say what became of the woman i asked she went away some years later there was talk of someone else seen running away from the farmhouse too the night they said the murder must have taken place could it have been him the husband sid shook his head too slight a figure her husband was a big man apparently anyway that led to more talk of an illicit lover theres always a lover isnt there have you noticed you know what kind of minds these country gossips have did anyone say who the other person might have been nobody knew just rumours of a vague shape seen running away these are old wives tales were talking about but perhaps theres some tru but at that point i was relieved of my watch and the next weeks turned out to be so chaotic that i never even saw sid again i heard later that he was killed at the battle of alamein just over a month after our conversation i didnt come across the mystery of rose cottage again until the early s at that time i was living in eastvale in a small flat overlooking the cobbled market square the town was much smaller and quieter than it is today though little about the square has changed from the ancient market cross the queens arms on the corner the norman church and the tudorfronted police station i had recently published my first novel and was still basking in that exquisite sensation that comes only once in a writers career the day he holds the first printed and bound copy of his very first work of course there was no money in writing so i worked parttime in a bookshop on north market street and on one of my mornings off a market day as i remember i was absorbed in polishing the third chapter of what was to be my second novel when i heard a faint tap at my door this was enough to startle me as i rarely had any visitors puzzled and curious i left my typewriter and went to open the door there stood a wizened old lady hunchshouldered whitehaired carrying a stick with a brass lions head handle and a small package wrapped in brown paper tied with string she must have noticed my confused expression because with a faint smile she said dont you recognize me mr riley dear dear have i aged that much then i knew her knew the voice miss eunice i cried throwing my door open please forgive me i was lost in my own world do come in and you must call me christopher once we were settled with a pot of tea mashing beside us though alas none of miss teresas scones i noticed the dark circles under miss eunices eyes the yellow around the pupils the parchmentlike quality of her skin and i knew she was seriously ill how did you find me i asked it didnt take a sherlock holmes everyone knows where the famous writer lives in a small town like eastvale hardly famous i demurred but thank you anyway i never knew you took the trouble to follow my fortunes teresa would have wished it she was very fond of you you know apart from ourselves and the police you were the only person in lyndgarth who ever entered rose cottage did you know that you might remember that we kept ourselves very much to ourselves yes i remember that i told her i came to give you this she handed me the package and i untied it carefully inside was the smith elder amp co first edition of far from the madding crowd complete with hardys inscription to tess but you shouldnt i said this must be very valuable its a fir she waved aside my objections please take it it is what teresa would have wished and i wish it too now listen she went on that isnt the only reason i came i have something very important to tell you to do with why the police came to visit all those years ago the thought of going to my grave without telling someone troubles me deeply but why me and why now i told you teresa was especially fond of you and youre a writer she added mysteriously youll understand should you wish to make use of the story please do so neither teresa nor i have any living relatives to offend all i ask is that you wait a suitable number of years after my death before publishing any account and that death is expected to occur at some point over the next few months does that answer your second question i nodded yes im sorry you neednt be as you may well be aware i have long since exceeded my three score and ten though i can hardly say the extra years have been a blessing but that is gods will do you agree to my terms of course i take it this is about the alleged murder miss eunice raised her eyebrows so youve heard the rumours she said well there was a murder all right teresa morgan murdered her husband jacob and buried his body in the garden she held out her teacup and i poured i noticed her hand was shaking slightly mine was too the shouts of the market vendors came in through my open windows when did she do this was all i could manage miss eunice closed her eyes and pursed her cracked lips i dont remember the exact year she said but it really doesnt matter you could look it up if you wanted it was the year the queen was proclaimed empress of india i happened to know that was in i have always had a good memory for historical dates if my calculations were correct miss teresa would have been about twentyseven at the time will you tell me what happened i asked thats why im here miss eunice said rather sharply teresas husband was a brute a bully and a drunkard she wouldnt have married him had she had any choice in the matter but her parents approved the match he had his own small farm you see and they were only tenants teresa was a very intelligent girl but that counted for nothing in those days in fact it was a positive disadvantage as was her wilfulness anyway he used to beat her to within an inch of her life where the bruises wouldnt show of course one day shed had enough of it so she killed him what did she do she hit him with the poker from the fireplace and after darkness had fallen she buried him deep in the garden she was afraid that if the matter went to court the authorities wouldnt believe her and she would be hanged she had no evidence you see and jacob was a popular man among the other fellows of the village as is so often the case with drunken brutes and teresa was terrified of being publicly hanged but did no one suspect her miss eunice shook her head jacob was constantly talking about leaving his wife and heading for the new world he used to berate her for not bearing him any children specifically sons and threatened that one day she would wake up and he would be gone gone to another country to find a woman who could give him the children he wanted he repeated these threats in the ale house so often that no one in the entire county of dorset could fail to know about them so when he disappeared everyone assumed he had followed through on his threats to leave her exactly oh there were rumours that his wife had murdered him of course there always are when such mysteries occur yes i thought remembering my conversation with sid ferris one cold desert night ten years ago rumours and fancies the stuff of fiction and something about a third person seen fleeing from the scene well that could wait teresa stayed on at the farm for another ten years miss eunice went on then she sold up and went to america it was a brave move but teresa no more lacked for courage than she did for beauty she was in her late thirties then and even after a hard life she could still turn heads in new york she landed on her feet and eventually married a financier sam cotter a good man she also took a companion you i asked miss eunice nodded yes some years later sam died of a stroke we stayed on in new york for a while but we grew increasingly homesick we came back finally in just after the great war for obvious reasons teresa didnt want to live anywhere near dorset so we settled in yorkshire a remarkable tale i said but thats not all miss eunice went on pausing only to sip some tea there was a child i thought you said she took one hand off her stick and held it up palm out christopher please let me tell the story in my own way then it will be yours to do with as you wish you have no idea how difficult this is for me she paused and stared down at the brass lions head for so long i feared she had fallen asleep or died outside in the market square a butcher was loudly trying to sell a leg of mutton just as i was about to go over to miss eunice she stirred there was a child she repeated when teresa was fifteen she gave birth to a child it was a difficult birth she was never able to bear any other children what happened to this child teresa had a sister called alice living in dorchester alice was five years older and already married with two children just before the pregnancy started to show both teresa and alice went to stay with relatives in cornwall for a few months after it had been falsely announced that alice was with child again you would be surprised how often such things happened when they came back alice had a fine baby girl who was the father teresa would never say the one thing she did make clear was that no one had forced unwanted attentions on her that the child was the result of a love match an infatuation it certainly wasnt jacob morgan did she ever see the child again oh certainly what could be more natural than visiting ones sister and seeing ones niece grow up when the girl was a little older she began to pay visits to the farm too miss eunice stopped here and frowned so hard i thought her brow would crack like dry paper that was when the problems began she said quietly what problems miss eunice put her stick aside and held out her teacup i refilled it her hands steady now she held the cup against her scrawny chest as if its heat were the only thing keeping her alive this is the most difficult part she said in a faint voice the part i didnt know whether i could ever tell anyone if you dont wish she waved my objection aside its all right christopher i didnt know how much i could tell you before i came here but i know now ive come this far i cant go back now just give me a few moments to collect myself outside the market was in full swing and during the ensuing silence i could hear the clamour of voices selling and buying arguing over prices did i ever tell you that teresa was an extremely beautiful young girl miss eunice asked after a while i believe you mentioned it yes she nodded well she was and so was her daughter when she began coming by herself to the house she was about twelve or thirteen years of age jacob didnt fail to notice her how well she was filling out as he used to say one day teresa had gone into the village for firewood and the child arrived in her absence jacob just home from the ale house was there alone to greet her need i say more mr riley i shook my head i dont mean to excuse him in any way but im assuming he didnt know the girl was his stepdaughter that is correct he never knew nor did she know teresa was her mother not until much later what happened next teresa came in before her husband could have his way with the struggling halfnaked child everything else was as i said she picked up the poker and hit him on the head not once but six times then they cleaned up and waited until after dark and buried him deep in the garden she sent her daughter back to her sisters and carried on as if her husband had simply left her just as he had threatened to do so the daughter was the mysterious third person seen leaving the farm in sid ferriss account what became of the poor child i asked miss eunice paused again and seemed to struggle for breath she turned terribly pale i got up and moved towards her but she stretched out her hand no no im all right christopher please sit a motor car honked outside and one of the street vendors yelled a curse miss eunice patted her chest thats better im fine now really i am just a minor spasm but i do feel ashamed im afraid i havent been entirely truthful with you its so difficult you see i was i am that child for a moment my mouth just seemed to flap open and shut and i couldnt speak finally i managed to stammer you you are miss teresas daughter but you cant be thats not possible i didnt mean to shock you she went on softly but really you only have yourself to blame when people see two old ladies together all they see is two old ladies when you first began calling on us at rose cottage fifteen years ago teresa was ninety and i was seventysix i doubt a fifteenyearold boy could tell the difference nor could most people and teresa was always remarkably robust and well preserved when i had regained my composure i asked her to continue there is very little left to say i helped my mother kill jacob morgan and bury him and we didnt cut him up into little pieces that part is pure fiction invented by scurrilous gossipmongers my foster parents died within a short time of one another around the turn of the century and teresa wired me the money to come and live with her in new york i had never married so i had no ties to break i think that experience with jacob morgan brief and inconclusive as it was must have given me a lifelong aversion to marital relations anyway it was in new york that teresa told me she was really my mother she couldnt tell sam of course so i remained there as her companion and we always lived more as friends than as mother and daughter she smiled when we came back to england we chose to live as two spinsters the kind of relationship nobody really questions in a village because it would be in bad taste to do so how did the police find you after so long we never hid our identities nor did we hide our whereabouts we bought rose cottage through a local solicitor before we returned from america so it was listed as our address on the all the official papers we filled in she shrugged the police soon recognized that teresa was far too frail to question let alone put on trial so they let the matter drop and to be quite honest they didnt really have enough evidence you know you didnt know it and teresa would never have told you but she already knew she was dying before the police came just as i know i am dying now and did she really die without telling you who your father was miss eunice nodded i wasnt lying about that but i always had my suspicions her eyes sparkled for a moment the way a fizzy drink does when you pour it you know teresa was always unreasonably jealous of that tryphena sparks and mr hardy did have an eye for the young girls forty years have passed since miss eunices death and i have lived in many towns and villages in many countries of the world though i have often thought of the tale she told me i have never been moved to commit it to paper until today two weeks ago i moved back to lyndgarth and as i was unpacking i came across that first edition of far from the madding crowd the year hardy married emma gifford as i puzzled again over the inscription words suddenly began to form themselves effortlessly in front of my eyes and all i had to do was copy them down now that i have finished i suddenly feel very tired it is a hot day and the heat haze has muted the greens greys and browns of the steep hillsides looking out of my window i can see the tourists lounging on the village green the young men are stripped to the waist some bearing tattoos of butterflies and angels across their shoulder blades the girls sit with them in shorts and tshirts laughing eating sandwiches drinking from pop or beer bottles one young girl notices me watching and waves cheekily probably thinking im an old pervert and as i wave back i think of another writer a far far greater writer than i could ever be sitting at his window seat writing he looks out of the window and sees the beautiful young girl passing through the woods at the bottom of the garden he waves she waves back and she lingers picking wild flowers as he puts aside his novel and walks out into the warm summer air to meet her lawn sale when frank walked through to the kitchen glass crunched under his feet and he sent knives forks and spoons skittering across the linoleum he turned on the light someone had broken in while he had been at the legion they had cut the wire screen and smashed the glass in the kitchen door they must have emptied the drawers looking for silverware because the cutlery was all over the place someone had also been in the front room whoever it was had knocked or pushed over the tailors dummy and the little table beside his armchair where he kept his reading glasses book and coffee mug suddenly afraid in case they were still in the house frank climbed on a stool to reach the high cupboard above the sink there at the back where nobody would look beyond joans unused baking dishes cake tins and cookie cutters shaped like hearts and lions lay his old service revolver wrapped in an oily cloth he had smuggled it back from the war and kept it all these years kept it loaded too with the gun in his hand he felt safer as he checked the rest of the house slowly with all the lights on he climbed the stairs they had broken the padlock on joans room heart thumping he turned on the light when he saw the mess he slumped against the wall they had emptied out all her dresser drawers scattering underwear and trinkets all over the shiny pink coverlet on the bed and it looked as if someone had swept off the lotions and perfumes from the dressing table right onto the floor one of the caps must have come loose because he could smell joans sharp musky perfume the lacquered jewellery case the one he had bought her in new york with the ballet dancer that spun to the dance of the sugarplum fairy when you opened it lay silent and empty on the bed frank sat down gun hanging between his legs theyd taken all joans jewellery why the stuff obviously wasnt valuable just trinkets really none of it could possibly be worth anything to them they had even taken her wedding ring frank remembered the day he bought it all those years ago the fairground across the street from the small jewellers the air filled with the smells of candyfloss and fried onions and the sounds of children laughing and squealing with delight a little girl in a white frock with pink smocking had smiled at him as she passed by one arm hugging a huge teddy bear and the other hand holding her mothers how light his heart had been inside the ring was inscribed frank and joan july no greater love the bastards it could mean nothing to them listlessly he checked his own room drawers pulled out socks and underwear scattered on the bedclothes nothing worth stealing except the spare change he kept on his bedside table sure enough it was gone the he had piled neatly into columns of quarters dimes nickels and pennies last night they didnt seem to have got far in the spare room where he kept his war mementos maybe they got disturbed scared by a sound before they could open the lock on the cabinet anyway everything was intact his medals the antique silver cigarette lighter that had never let him down the bayonet the nazi armband the tattered edition of mein kampf the german dagger with the motherofpearl swastika inlaid in its handle frank went downstairs and considered what to do he knew he should put the gun back in its hiding place and call the police but that would mean intrusion questions he valued his privacy and he knew that the neighbours thought he was a bit of an oddball what would the police think of him a man who kept the torso of a tailors dummy in his livingroom along with yards of motheaten material and tissuepaper patterns what if they found his gun no he couldnt call the police he couldnt have them trampling all over his house they never caught burglars anyway everyone knew that weary and still a little frightened frank nailed a piece of plywood over the broken glass then carried his gun upstairs with him to bed the following morning was one of those light airy days of early june the kind that brings the whole city to the beaches the sky was robinsegg blue the sun shone like a pale yolk and a light breeze blew off the lake to keep the temperature comfortable in the gardens apple and cherry blossom clung to the trees and the tulips were still in full bloom it was a day for sprinklers swimsuits barbecues bicycle rides volleyball and lawn sales normally frank would have gone down to the boardwalk about the only exercise he got these days today however a change had come over him a shadow had crept into his life and chilled him to the bone despite the fine weather he felt a deep lassitude and malaise so much so that he delayed getting out of bed maybe it was the dream made him feel that way though perhaps it wasnt right to call it a dream when it was so close to something that had really happened it recurred every few months and he had come to accept it now much as one accepts the chronic pain of an old wound as a kind of cross to bear separated from his unit once in rural france during the second world war he had dragged himself out of a muddy stream cigarettes tied up safely in armyissue condoms to keep them dry and entered a forest a few yards in he had come face to face with a young german soldier who looked as if he had also probably lost his comrades they stared openmouthed at each other for the split second before frank operating purely on survival instinct aimed his revolver first and fired the boy simply looked surprised and disappointed at the red patch that spread over his chest then his face emptied of all expression for ever lightheaded and numb frank moved on looking for his unit it wasnt the first german he had killed but it was the first he had looked in the eye the incident haunted him all the way back to his unit but a few hours later he had convinced himself that he had done the right thing and put it behind him after the war the memory surfaced from time to time in dreams details changed of course each time the soldier had a different face for example once frank even reached forward and put his finger into the bullet hole the soft warm flesh felt like halfset jelly he was sure he had never touched it in real life another time the boy spoke to him he spoke in english and frank couldnt remember what he said though he was sure it was a poem and the words i knew you in this dark stuck in his mind but frank knew nothing of poetry this time the bullet had gone straight through leaving a clean circle the size of a ring and frank had seen a winter landscape all flat white and grey through the hole he still had the gun he had used that day it was the same one he had got down from the high cupboard last night when he thought the burglars might still be in the house it was the one he felt for now under the pillow beside him had he got up that day he couldnt remember he sat propped against pillows on his bed that night watching television as usual he felt agitated and whatever the figures on the screen were doing or saying didnt register for some reason he couldnt get the wedding ring out of his mind the senselessness of its theft and the unimaginable value it had for him he hadnt realized it fully until the ring was gone then he thought he heard some noise outside he turned the sound off with the remote and listened sure enough he could hear voices beyond his back garden was a narrow alleyway then came the backs of the stores and lowrise apartment buildings on queen street sometimes in this warm weather when everyone had their windows open you could hear arguments television programmes and loud music these were real voices frank could tell television voices sounded different there were two of them a womans and a mans hers getting louder no daryl it wont do he heard the woman shout havent i told you before its wrong to steal havent i brought you up to respect other peoples property havent i frank couldnt hear the muffled answer no matter how much he strained he dragged himself up from the bed and went to the window so if marvin johnson stuck his finger in a fire youd do that as well would you christ give me a break how stupid can you get another inaudible reply right so how do you think they feel eh the people whose house you broke into come on what did you do with it frank couldnt hear the reply though he held his breath dont lie to me what do you think this is its a gold chain isnt it and what about these dont tell me youve suddenly started wearing earrings i found these hidden in your room you stole them didnt you franks heart knocked against his ribs joan had a gold chain and earrings and they were among the items that had been stolen but what about the ring the ring shut up the woman yelled i dont want to hear it i want you to put together everything you stole and take it back or so help me ill call the police i dont care if you are my son do you understand me there came another inaudible reply followed by a sharp smack then the sound of a door slamming after that frank heard a sound he didnt recognize at first a cat in the garden maybe then he realized it was the woman crying about five of the apartments in the building had lights on at the back and frank hadnt been able to tell from which one the argument came now though he could see the silhouette of the woman with her head bowed and her hands held to her face he thought he knew who she was he had seen both her and her son on the street frank sat in the coffee shop across from the apartment building early the next morning and watched people come and go the building was one of those old places with a heavy wood and glass door so warped by heat and time that it wouldnt shut properly he knew who he was looking for all right it was that peroxide blonde the one who looked like a hooker at about eightthirty her son the thief came out he had a spotty face especially around the nose and mouth and he obviously had a skinhead haircut or a completely shaved head under the baseball hat he wore the wrong way around he also wore a shiny silver jacket with a stylized black eagle on the back under some red writing below his baggy trousers crotch right down to the knees the laces of his sneakers trailed loose at the corner he hooked up with a couple of similarly dressed kids and they shuffled off shoving each other spitting and generally glaring down at the sidewalk as they went at about ten oclock frank had to move to the next coffee shop a bit more up market as he kept getting nasty looks from the owner he ordered a cappuccino and a doughnut and sat by the window watching at about a quarter to eleven she came out the boys mother she struggled with a shop cart of laundry through the front door and set off down the street old though he was frank could still appreciate a good figure when he saw one she wore a white tubetop tight over her heavy breasts revealing a flat tummy and even tighter white shorts cut sharp and high over long tanned thighs but she wore too much makeup and he could see the dark roots in her hair common as muck joan would have said in the lancashire accent that had never left her no matter how long shed been here a real tart a piece of white trash no wonder her kid was a burglar a ring thief a robber of memories defiler of all things decent and wholesome frank watched her totter down the street on her ridiculous high heels and go into the laundromat it took about half an hour for the wash cycle and about as long again to get things dry that gave frank an hour he paid his bill crossed the street and entered the apartment building he hadnt really formed a plan even during the hours he had spent watching the building that morning he knew from last night that the apartment was on the third floor at the back right in the centre which made it easy to find the corridor smelled of soiled diapers and pinesol when he stood outside the door he listened for a while all he could hear was a baby crying on the next floor up and the bass boom of a stereo deep in the basement frank had never broken the law in his life and he was intelligent enough to recognize the irony of what he was about to do but he was going to do it anyway because the absence of the ring was beginning to make his life hell nothing else really mattered for three days he had waited for the boy to return joans jewellery as his mother had told him to do three days of nailbiting memories dreaming about the german soldier he had killed again reliving joans long illness and death watching again as if it were yesterday the woman he had loved and lived with for nearly fifty years waste away in agony in front of his eyes so thin did she become that one day the ring simply slipped off her finger onto the shiny pink quilt and now that he was on the brink of remembering the final horror her death the ring had assumed the potency of a talisman he must have it back to keep his sanity to keep the last memories at bay he had watched people on television open doors with credit cards so he took out his seniors discount card and tried to push it between the door and the lock it wouldnt fit he could get it part of the way in then something blocked it he waggled it back and forth but still nothing happened he cursed this didnt happen on television what was he going to do now it looked as if he was destined to fail he rested his head against the wood and tried to think what the hell do you think youre doing his heart jumped and he turned as quickly as he could i said what do you think youre doing it was her the slut standing there with her hands on her hips it was disgusting that bare midriff he could see her belly button he looked away no please he found his voice dont i wont harm you she laughed you harm me she said thats a laugh now go on get out of here before i really do call the police old man frank had to admit she certainly didnt look scared no you dont understand he said there was nothing for it now but to trust her the robbery i overheard you see it was my house your son broke into she stared at him for a moment her expression slowly softening turning sad she was quite pretty really he thought she had a nice mouth though her eyes looked a bit hard youd better come in hadnt you she said pushing past him and opening the door i came back for more quarters just as well i did isnt it or who knows what might have happened she had a husky voice probably from smoking too much the room was sparsely furnished mostly from the salvation army or goodwill by the looks of it but it was clean and the only unpleasant smell frank noticed was stale tobacco the woman pulled a packet of rothmans from her bag sat down on the wing of an armchair and lit up she blew out a plume of smoke crossed her legs and looked at frank sit down itll hold your weight she said nodding towards the threadbare armchair opposite her he sat now what do you want is it money i just want whats mine frank said your son stole my wifes jewellery its very important to me especially the wedding ring id like it back she frowned wedding ring there wasnt no wedding ring what i told you there wasnt no wedding ring sighing she got up and went into another room she came back with a handful of jewellery thats all i found frank looked through it the only pieces he recognized were the gold chain and the pair of cheap earrings the rest he supposed must have been stolen from another house i dont understand he said what happened to the ring how should i know she stubbed her halfsmoked cigarette out viciously maybe he sold it already or threw it away look i gotta go before someone steals the laundry thats all i need he grabbed her arm no wait can i talk to him maybe hell tell me i have to find that ring im sorry i he let her go and before he knew it he was crying she rubbed her arm oh come on she said theres no need for that shit listen daryls a bit noncommunicative these days its his age just a phase hes going through you know what teenagers are like basically hes a good kid its just well with his father gone look ill talk to him again ok i promise but i dont want you coming round here bothering us no more you understand i know hes done wrong and hell pay for it just leave it to me huh take the chain and the earrings for now for christs sake take it all i only want the ring frank said he can keep the rest i told you ill talk to him ill ask him about it ok here frank looked up to see her thrusting a handful of tissues towards him at arms length her eyes had softened a little but still remained wary he took the tissues and rubbed his face im sorry he said its been such an ordeal my wife died three years ago cancer i keep a few of her things for memories you understand and the rings very important i know its sentimental of me but we were happy all those years i dont know how ive survived without her yeah tell me about it she said aint life a bitch look im sorry mister really i am but please dont go to the police ok thats trouble i could do without right now i promise ill do what i can all right give me your number ill call you frank watched the broken cigarette still smouldering in the ashtray he couldnt think of anything else to say he nodded gave the woman his telephone number and shuffled out of the apartment only when he found himself holding the revolver in his hand at home in the early evening did he realize he didnt even know the womans name a day passed nothing another day nothing long gaps between the memories when nothing seemed to be happening at all most of the time frank sat at his bedroom window lights out watching the apartment he cleaned his gun there were no more rows mostly the place was dark and empty at night at first he thought theyd moved but on the second night he saw the light come on at about midnight and glimpsed the boy cross by the window then it went dark again until about two when he saw the woman she must work in a bar or something he thought it figured the next thing he knew it was morning and he couldnt remember why he had been sitting by the window all night the sun was up the birds were singing and his joints were so stiff he could hardly stand up still he heard nothing from the mother he had been a fool to trust her after three days he decided to confront her again rather he found himself walking into her building for that was the way things seemed to be happening more and more these days he could never remember the point at which he decided to do something he just found himself doing it halfway up the stairs to her apartment he suddenly had no idea where he was or why he was there he stopped heart heavy and chest tight with panic then the memory flooded back in the image of the ring burnished gold bright as fire in his minds eye slightly tilted so he could read the inscription clearly no greater love he walked on he hammered on the door so hard that people came out of other apartments to see what was going on but nobody answered my ring he shouted at the door i want my ring get out before i call the police one of the neighbours said frank turned and glared the frightened woman backed into her apartment and slammed the door he felt the sweat bead on his wrinkled forehead and ran his hand over his sparse grey hair slowly he walked away finally his telephone rang he snatched up the receiver yes hello he said its me it was the womans voice husky and low he heard her blow out smoke before she went on i heard you come over here again you shouldnt of done that look ive talked to daryl and im sorry he said he threw the ring away because it had writing on it and he didnt think hed be able to sell it i know how important it was to you but where did he throw it he says he doesnt remember look mister give us a break here please things are tough enough as it is hes not a real criminal otherwise hed of known he could sell it to someone whod melt it down wouldnt he he wont do anything like that again honest that wont bring my ring back will it im sorry if i could bring it back i would what can i do ill save up ill give you some money he heard her inhale the smoke again and blow it out then he thought he heard her sniffle look maybe we can even come to some arrangement if you know what i mean you must be lonely arent you i saw the way you were looking at me when i found you outside my door just give daryl a chance dont go to the police please im beg frank slammed the phone down if only he could think clearly things had gone too far this whore and her evil offspring had conspired to ruin what little peace he had left in his life his memories of joan what did they know about his marriage about the happy years the shock of joans illness and the agony of her death the agony he suffered with her how could a woman like that know how much the ring meant to him she probably hadnt even tried to find it the next thing he knew he was walking along the boardwalk when he took stock of his surroundings and saw the ruffled blue of the lake and the tilted white sails of boats heard the seagulls screech and the children play he felt as if he were in one of those jumpframe videos he had seen on television once with no idea how he got from one frame to the next and with seconds minutes hours missing in between it was dark that much he knew dark and the boy was at home she was at work he knew because he had followed her to the bar where she worked watched her put on her apron and start serving drinks he didnt know where he had been or what he had done or dreamed all day but now it was dark the boy was at home and the gun lay heavy and warm in his pocket the boy daryl simply opened the door and let him in such arrogance such cockiness frank could hardly believe it the music was deafening turn it off he said daryl shrugged and did so what do you want he asked my mother told me youve been pestering her we should call the law on you ill bet youre one of those dirty old men arent you are you trying to get in my mothers pants or are you a pervert is it young boys you like he struck a parody of a sexy pose out of the window frank could see the upstairs light he had left on in his house over the laneway daryl was smoking his free hand slapping against his baggies in time to some imaginary music he wouldnt keep still kept walking up and down the room frank just stood there by the door how old are you frank asked whats it to you pervert have you been taking drugs what if i have what are you going to do about it wheres my ring he curled his upper lip back and laughed bottom of the lake or maybe in the garbage i dont remember please said frank where is it its all i have left of her tough shit get a life old man you dont understand daryl stopped pacing and thrust his chin out towards frank the tendons in his neck stood out like cables yes i do you think im a fucking retard dont you just like the teachers do well fuck the lot of you it was your wifes ring its all youve got to remember her by read my lips i dont fucking care blinking back the tears frank stuck his hand in his pocket for the gun he actually felt his hand tighten around the handle and his finger slip into the trigger guard before he relaxed his grip and let go at the time he didnt know why he was doing it but the next thing he knew he was walking down the stairs and stay away from us he heard daryl shout after him out in the street with no memory of going out the door he found himself on the boardwalk again it was dark and there was nobody else around except a man walking his dog frank went and sat out on the rocks the lake stretched like black satin ahead of him smudged with thin white moonlight water slopped around the rock at his feet and splashed over his ankles he thought he could see lights over on the american side the next thing frank knew he was at home and something like a thunderbolt cracked inside his head filling it with light it was all so clear now it was time to let go he laughed so simple from his window he could see daryl light another cigarette hear the loud music what did his feelings matter to daryl or his mother they didnt and why should they nothing really mattered now but at least he knew what he had to do he had known the moment he got close enough to daryl to see the tattoo of a swastika on his cheek below his left eye even though it was dark frank managed to arrange the stuff on his lawn he was thinking clearly now his life had regained its sense of continuity no more jumpframe reality the memory he had tried so hard to deny had forced itself on him now the ring was gone the talisman that had protected him for so long it wasnt such a bad thing in a way he was free it was all over it was a warm night a raccoon snuffled around the neighbours garbage it stopped and looked at frank with its calm blackringed eyes he moved forward and stamped his foot on the sidewalk to make it go away it simply stared at him until it was ready to go then it waddled arrogantly along the street far in the distance a car engine revved other shapes detached themselves from the darkness and proved even more difficult to chase away than the raccoon but frank held his ground carefully he arranged the objects around him on the dark lawn by the time he had finished the sun was coming up promising a perfect day for a lawn sale now that everything was neatly laid out the memory was complete he could keep nothing at bay what a death joans had been she had spent ten years doing it in and out of hospital one useless operation after another night after sleepless night of agony despite the pills he remembered now the times she had begged him to finish her saying she would do it herself if she had the strength if she could move without making the knives twist and cut up her insides and every time he let her down he couldnt do it and he didnt really know why surely if he really loved her he told himself he would have killed her to stop her suffering but that argument didnt work he knew that he loved her but he still couldnt kill her once he stood over her for ten minutes holding a pillow in his hands and he felt her willing him to push it down over her face her tongue was swollen her gums had receded and her teeth were falling out every time he smoothed her head with his hand tufts of dry hair stuck to his palm but he had thrown the cushion aside and run out of the house why couldnt he do it because he couldnt imagine life without her no matter how much pain and anguish she suffered to stay with him no matter how little she now resembled the wife he had married perhaps selfishness certainly cowardice yes at last she had gone not with a quiet whisper like a candle flame snuffed out not gently but with convulsions and loud screams as if fish hooks had ripped a bloody path through her insides and he remembered her last look at him the bulging eyes the blood trickling from her nose and mouth how could he forget that look through all the final agony through the knowledge that the release of death was only seconds away the hard glint of accusation in her eyes was unmistakable frank wiped the tears from his stubbly cheeks and held the gun on his lap as the sun grew warmer and the city came to life around him soon he would find the courage to do to himself what he hadnt been able to do for the wife he loved what he had only been able to do to some nameless german soldier who haunted his dreams soon by the time the tourists got here all they would see was an old man asleep amid the detritus of his life the torso of a tailors dummy yards of motheaten fabrics and folded patterns made of tissue paper baking dishes cake tins cookie cutters shaped like hearts and lions a silver cigarette lighter a nazi armband a tattered copy of mein kampf medals a bayonet a german dagger with a motherofpearl swastika inlaid in its handle gone to the dawgs it was the penultimate week of the nfl football pool and charlie firth was ahead by ten points nothing could stop the smug bastard from winning again now nothing short of murder such was the uncharitable thought that crossed the mind of calvin bly as he sat with the usual crowd in the local bar watching the monday night game st louis at tampa bay outside in the east end of toronto the wind was howling piling up snow in the side streets and swirling it in surreal patterns across the main roads but inside it was warm and the occasional single malt between pints of guinness helped make it even warmer there were six of them at the table the usual crowd all in the pool calvin was second having come up with a complicated system of mathematical checks and balances that had earned him solid eights and nines all season plus the occasional eleven behind him by six points was marge the only girl in the group well woman really he supposed seeing as she was in her fifties the other three chris jeff and brad werent even in the running hows your mother calvin charlies loud voice boomed across the table calvin looked away from his conversation with marge and saw the sneer on charlies face the baiting grin the arrogant disdaining eyes shes fine thank you he said charlie looked at his watch only its getting late im surprised she lets you stay out this long he laughed and some of the others joined in but more because it was the thing to do than because they had any heart for it truth be told nobody really found charlies sense of humour funny vicious yes cutting and hurtful yes but funny no way perhaps it wasnt worth murdering someone for two thousand dollars calvin thought but it might be worth it just to clear the world of the loudmouthed fucker people would probably thank him for it three years in a row charlie firth had won that nfl pool and he hadnt let a soul forget it twice calvin had come in second and charlie wasnt about to let him forget that either the teasing would go on well into the baseball season yes if he got rid of charlie he would be doing the world a favour the buccs threw a touchdown pass to take the lead in the dying seconds of the game and calvin shook himself free of his dark thoughts of course he wouldnt murder charlie hed never harmed a soul in his life didnt have the guts for it it was nothing but a pleasant harmless fantasy got that one thought calvin when the game was over and charlie had picked the rams he was still nine points ahead of the field though pretty much impossible to catch and marge was still six behind as they went into the final week it had been a weekend of upsets the seahawks beat the raiders the chiefs beat the broncos and the lions beat the jets but calvin had come away with nine points say hi to your mom from me charlie called out as calvin bundled up and headed out to clear the snow off his car he didnt bother answering calvin hadnt been home five minutes was watching the news quietly on tv when the banging started mother had a walking stick which she didnt use to walk with as she rarely bothered to walk but to bang on the floor of her bedroom to summon her son calling out his name with a sigh calvin hauled himself out of the lazboy and climbed up the stairs he hated mothers sick room the unpleasant smells she never opened the window and didnt bathe very often the way she lay there looking frail hands like talons clutching the sheet tight around her neck as if he were going to rape her or something when the very idea of her nakedness disgusted him yes mother you were out late it was a long game anything could have happened to me i could have had a seizure what would i have done then mother youre not going to have a seizure the doctor told you yesterday your healths just fine doctor schmoctor what does that quack know her tone became wheedling flirtatious calvin baby i cant sleep im having one of my bad nights make mommy some hot milk and bring my pills little calvin pullleeeease calvin went back downstairs and poured some milk into a saucepan enough for two as he decided he might as well treat himself to some hot chocolate if he was heating up milk anyway while he listened to the hiss of the gas flame and watched the milks surface change as it heated he thought again how pleasant it would be if he had the guts to do something about charlie firth the man was insufferable for a start he was well off and always made a point of letting you know how much his possessions cost from the porsche to his leather italian loafers women of course just wouldnt leave him alone he had a big house on kingswood prime beach property all to himself as he had never married probably because no woman in her right mind could stand his company for more than a night and as well as winning the nfl pool he had been his companys realestate agent of the year more than once a success and calvin what had he got nothing unemployment benefits a savings account that was thinning out as quickly as his hair a pot belly that seemed to be getting bigger a hypochondriac mother who would probably live to torment him for ever a small gloomy draughty row house on the wrong side of victoria park nothing sweet fuck all bubbles started to surface on the milk time to turn down the heat mother hated it when he burnt the milk before he had even got the mugs out of the cupboard he heard the banging on the ceiling again as if the silly old cow thought banging with that stick of hers would make milk boil any faster he burned himself as he slopped the hot milk into the cup forgot about his hot chocolate and hurried upstairs in the light of the next day killing charlie didnt seem like such a good idea given calvins luck he was bound to get caught for a start and technically charlie would still be the winner if you didnt phone your picks in on time the administrator assigned you the underdogs and even with the dawgs as they were called charlie would still beat the field he would be too dead to collect his winnings of course and calvin supposed they would go to whoever came second the way the pool worked was every wednesday before five oclock you phoned in your picks based on that days point spread to the administrator who ran the whole thing from his desk at one of the major newspapers downtown you always got his answering machine with its curt message im away from my desk right now please leave your message after the beep there were over a hundred people in the pool at a hundred bucks each for the season and in addition to the grand prize of there were also smaller weekly prizes calvin had actually covered this years entry fee on one weekly win usually by friday evening a photocopy of everyones picks along with the weekly and accumulated scores was faxed to jeff who made copies and distributed them in the bar calvin liked to see which teams everyone else had chosen especially charlie but this week he would miss it on thursday he had to accompany mother down to fort myers where they would spend christmas with their only living relatives his aunt vicky and uncle frank who had retired there seven years ago and were generous enough to help out with the airfare the florida trip used to be the highlight of calvins year not because he liked the place three or four days was about all he could stand it was too hot and too full of old people or people who didnt speak english as if toronto wasnt bad enough that way no what florida used to mean to him was freedom glorious freedom mother used to stay down there for at least six weeks and as soon as she was settled calvin was allowed to go home alone god only knew how vicky and frank put up with the old bat calvin thought but they did now she was too worried about getting sick and not being able to afford us medical bills so they were both returning on the following wednesday that tuesday morning at breakfast calvin checked the sports section to see if the spreads had changed since monday he liked to do that factor it into his calculations sometimes you could guess a lot just by the ways the spreads were changing after that his day followed its usual dull routine he cleared the driveway of snow did household chores did some food shopping and took care of mother but on tuesday evening calvin had a date this was one thing nobody knew about him at least so he believed calvin had a secret girlfriend heidi probably no one would believe it if he told them that a pudgy balding boring fiftyoneyearold man like him could have an attractive blonde fortyyearold woman as a girlfriend sometimes he could hardly believe it himself they had met six months ago in hmv downtown both looking at the selection of show tunes a common interest in film musicals led them to venture to a local coffee shop together where they found they enjoyed one anothers company immensely a loner by nature apart from the easy and informal gregariousness of the bar calvin found it hard to talk to her at first but heidi had a way of drawing him out of his shell there was of course a big problem heidi was married slowly piece by piece it emerged over furtive meetings in the city centre first just for coffees then regular lunches at red lobster that heidi was not exactly happy with her marriage her children had both left home one for winnipeg poor sod and the other for southern california so it was only a matter of time she told calvin before the separation occurred until then they had to be very careful and keep their relationship a secret her husband worked shifts for a security company and this week he was working evenings calvin would go over to the west end where heidi lived not far from high park and they would talk and make love until midnight at which time he would dress and sneak out of the back door to where he had parked his car several blocks away that tuesday heidi did not seem to be in her usual good spirits whats wrong calvin asked after he had suspected her of counting cracks in the ceiling while they made love nothing she said come on i can tell theres something bothering you i told you its nothing leave it maybe i can help heidi turned propped herself on her elbow and looked at him i dont think i can go on she said after a pause calvin felt his chest tighten his heart race what do you mean this you and me i dont think i can go on but why its not that i dont like you calvin she stroked his cheek its just oh everything the lies the guilt joe and i had a really long talk the other night for gods sake heidi you didnt tell him no no of course not what sort of a fool do you think i am no we just well he realized hed been neglecting me and i realized i missed him more than i thought we decided you know to try to make a go of things make a go of things yes she smiled were going to start with a trip to mexico a sort of second honeymoon were going for new year bbut oh calvin dont be upset please dont be upset you had fun while it lasted didnt you yes but but i thought you thought what i mean just now even when you knew this you we he shook his head was that so unfair of me calvin just to have you one last time was that too selfish of me its not that then what it just seems so sudden so abrupt thats all calvin sat on the edge of the bed and reached for his clothes but you knew it had to end one day i sort of hoped that when you and joe split up we might you know oh calvin thats sweet thats too sweet i gather you didnt heidi lay back on the pillow i never thought really not beyond the next time ive hurt you havent i its all right ill mend im sorry calvin dont worry about it ill go now youll be careful make sure no one sees you ill be careful calvin bent over to give her a goodnight kiss as he always did she turned her head and offered him her cheek he kissed it lightly and found it surprisingly cool then he went downstairs and sneaked out of the back door he thought of making a lot of noise but calvin wasnt the type to draw too much attention to himself he was ok to drive he told himself as he headed out of the nearest bar to which he had gone as soon as hed left heidis hed only had two pints and a shot of whisky and he felt in control sad hurt but in control the city crews had been through the neighbourhood and the roads were pretty clear he headed down roncesvalles towards lakeshore and the gardiner noting how quiet the roads were hardly surprising as it was going on for half past one on a cold miserable tuesday evening it was all over with heidi he couldnt believe it couldnt believe the callous way she had treated him how could she he had even fantasized a real life for them restaurants theatres musicals weekends together now this almost home he stopped at a red light nobody around lights from tv sets in a couple of windows christmas trees lights as he neared the next set of traffic lights he saw someone come out of a bar alone and start to cross just as the lights were changing it was charlie there was no mistaking that expensive leather jacket the handtooled cowboy boots he was clearly a bit pissed not falling down drunk but definitely unsteady and unobservant calvin was driving slowly enough to stop but something he couldnt say what some demon some inner compulsion seemed to take control of him a quick glance to make sure there were no other cars visible ahead or behind nobody on the street in seeing distance and almost unbidden his foot pressed down on the gas pedal as if it was made of lead charlie knew something was wrong saw it coming at the last moment but was too late to do anything about it calvin saw the horrified expression on his face even fancied he saw recognition there too then the car hit him with a satisfying meaty smack and threw him away from the car calvin felt the shuddering bump and crunch as he ran over the body no stopping now he sped off and turned the first corner heading into the maze of residential streets that would eventually take him home heart in his mouth blood pulsing hard through his veins but alive alive at last calvin didnt sleep at all that night and spent the next day in terror of the knock upon his door the newspaper reported charlies death and asked anyone who might have seen anything to contact them calvin was almost certain that no one had seen him but there was still room for doubt and that doubt bred fear if the police came to check out his car they would see the damage charlies body had caused to the radiator and the headlight they could probably even match paint chips from the body to his car he had seen them do it on tv so terrified was he that he almost forgot to phone in his picks almost at fourthirty he picked up the phone with trembling hands and dialled the administrators number just as the answering machine cut in mothers stick banged on the floor above he automatically held the phone at arms length and put his hand over the mouthpiece even though there wasnt a real person on the other end and shouted up that he was busy and would be with her in a few moments when he got back to the phone he was just in time to hear the familiar beep he began giants broncos bills jets rams bears the journey to fort myers on thursday morning was a nightmare for calvin not because of the weather though the flight was delayed more than an hour and the wings had to be deiced not even because of mother despite the fact that she never stopped complaining for one moment until the plane took off when she immediately fell asleep no it was because he expected to be arrested at every stage of the journey at the checkin he noticed two airline officials huddled to one side talking and occasionally they seemed to be looking in his direction sweat beaded on his forehead but nothing happened next at us immigration just when he expected the firm hand on his shoulder the hushed please step this way mr bly the immigration officer wished him and mother happy holidays after barely a glance at their passports could getting away with murder really be that easy calvin wondered when he disembarked at fort myers and found no policemen waiting for him only frank and vicky in the crowd waving ready to drive him and mother back to the condo nothing had happened nobody had come for him he must have got away with it though the locals thought the weather cold and farmers were worried about the citrus crop calvin found it comfortable enough to sit out on the deck as he poured himself a jack daniels and looked out over the long strip of beach to the bluegreen sea charlies murder began to seem distant and unreal after a few hours and three or four bourbons he could almost believe it hadnt happened that it had merely been a bad dream and the following morning he imagined that when he got back to toronto and walked into the bar they would all be waiting there as usual including charlie flashing his winnings in the late afternoon florida sun how easy it was to believe that snowy tuesday night in toronto had never happened by christmas eve calvin was already two games up having picked the bills to beat a threepoint spread against the seahawks and the broncos to win plus seven over the ers on saturday hed lost the giantsjaguars game but even with his system he could never expect to win them all he was sipping a jack daniels on the rocks and watching miami against new england hoping the pats would beat the spread when during the halftime break came a brief interview with a convicted killer called leroy cody scheduled to be electrocuted early in the new year instead of pushing the mute button calvin turned the sound up a notch or two and leaned forward in his chair hed read about cody in usa today and found his curiosity piqued by the mans nonchalant laconic manner and his total lack of remorse the interview was a special from death row leroy in his cell in drab prison clothes hair cropped close to his skull no emotion in his eyes his face all sharp angles you shot a liquor store clerk for fifteen dollars is that right the interviewer asked i didnt know hed only got a lousy fifteen dollars when i shot him now did i leroy answered in his slow surprisingly highpitched drawl but you shot him and fifteen dollars is all you got yessir sure was a disappointment let me tell you and then you shot a pregnant woman and dragged her out of her car to make your escape i didnt know she was pregnant but you shot the woman and stole her car leroy spat on the floor of his cell hell i had to make a fast getaway i dont have no car of my own i had to take a goddamn cab to the store but i was damned if i was gonna hang around and try to flag one after i done robbed the place and you feel no remorse for any of this remorse regrets regrets nope no regrets im a killer thats what i am you regret nothing at all leroy smiled it looked like an eclipse of the sun moving slowly across his features only getting caught he said calvins attention wandered as the presenter started to comment and then they were back at the halftime show catching up on scores but even as he checked the numbers part of calvins mind stayed with leroy cody im a killer thats what i am he liked that it was honest direct had a ring to it calvin tried it out loud im a killer thats what i am it sounded good he let the fantasy wander trying on his new self and finding it a perfect fit im a killer thats what i am me and leroy yeah man and if he was a killer he could kill again why stop at charlie he could kill heidis husband could even kill that bitch heidi herself maybe make her beg a little first he could kill there was no upstairs in the condo but he heard the clickclick of mothers walking stick on the tile floor before he heard her voice leroy she said he was sure she called him leroy are you going to just sit here and watch this garbage all christmas why dont you come and play cribbage with the old folks for a while calvin sighed picked up the remote turned off the game and muttered coming mother there were no cops waiting at the airport when calvin and mother got back to toronto on wednesday it was over a week since charlies death and still nothing to fear after settling mother at home against her protests calvin decided to drop in at the bar as he had suspected the usual crowd was there minus charlie calvin said marge patting his arm when he sat down beside her welcome home youve heard the news calvin nodded sadly heard just before we left for florida its tragic isnt it i still cant believe it said marge he always seemed so alive calvin suggested yes alive thats it alive is there any progress he asked the table in general no jeff answered you know the cops theyve put it down as a hit and run asked for the publics cooperation and thats the last youll hear of it unless someone comes forward calvin said yes jeff agreed unless someone comes forward by the way he went on heres the final scores on the pool he handed calvin the sheets of paper kelly the waitress with the walk out of a forties noir movie finally came over with his drink calvin desperately wanted to see the final scores but he didnt want to appear too anxious after all charlie was dead so he sipped some beer talked a little about his christmas and then casually glanced down at the sheets the first thing that caught his eye was his weekends score that had to be wrong calvin had checked the game scores after the cribbage game and found he had nine he had also won the evening game the raiders over the panthers and the monday evening game when the titans had creamed the cowboys so how could he end up with five he had eleven he turned to the column of picks and noticed scrawled across the line where his should be the word dawgs charlie of course had got the same it meant they hadnt got their picks in on time but calvin had got his picks in he remembered phoning them it was late in the afternoon fourthirty to be precise but definitely before the five oclock deadline so what was going on calvin the voice came as if from a long way huh sorry what just that youve gone pale are you ok it was marge and her hand was on his arm im fine he said must be you know charlie delayed shock marge nodded i dont suppose it seemed real until you got back here did it she said something like that whats happening with the pool marge frowned well she said with charlie gone and you forgetting to phone in er i won you marge laughed nervously well dont look so surprised calvin ive been up there with the best of you all season i know its not that what then never mind congratulations marge calvin knew he couldnt complain whatever had gone wrong here however he had gone from eleven to five there was nothing he could do about it and getting upset about the result would only look suspicious thanks said marge i know it must be a disappointment you being so close and all she managed a weak smile i only beat you by one if that means anything at all it was my best week of the whole season twelve calvin laughed he couldnt help himself so what are you going to do with your winnings marge looked at the others then said i decided well we all decided really that id use the money for a wake you know to pay for a wake here for charlie he would have liked that yes said calvin still quaking with laughter inside while he tried to keep a straight face yes i think he would when calvin got home he poured himself a large whisky and tried to figure out what had gone wrong five the dawgs it was an insult a slap in the face he cast his mind back to that wednesday afternoon and remembered first that his hand had been shaking as he dialled he had after all just killed charlie the previous evening could he have misdialled the first three numbers were all the same and connected him to the newspaper the administrator worked for the last four were it would have been easy say to transpose the six and the nine or even to dial seven first rather than four given that he was upset at the time he tried both and got the same message im away from my desk right now please leave a message after the beep the only difference was that was a womans voice and was a mans so that was what had happened in his disturbed state of mind calvin had dialled the wrong number why had it happened like that why hadnt he listened to the message noticed the difference in voice and realized what he had done then he remembered just as he had got through mother had knocked on the bedroom floor for him he had held the phone at arms length and covered the mouthpiece as you do and yelled up that he was coming in a minute he hadnt heard the administrators message only vaguely recognized it was a mans voice on the answering machine heard the usual beep and left his picks with someone else at the paper someone who hadnt a clue what he was talking about calvin held his head in his hands the wrong number all for nothing he drank some more whisky well maybe not all for nothing he thought after a while hadnt he already decided that nice as it would have been he hadnt killed charlie only for the money wasnt a paltry sum to murder for more than but still he knew he had had more reason than the money winning the pool was a part of it of course but that wasnt to be so what was left what could he salvage from this disaster im a killer thats what i am the voice seemed to come into his head from nowhere and slowly as the whisky warmed his insides understanding dawned on calvin im a killer thats what i am the sound of a heavy stick hammering on the ceiling above broke into his thoughts he could hear her muffled yelling leroy leroy i need my hot milk leroy calvin put his glass down looked up at the ceiling and got to his feet coming mother he said softly in flanders fields i considered it the absolute epitome of irony that with bombs falling around us someone went and bludgeoned mad maggie to death to add insult to injury she lay undiscovered for several days before harry fletcher the milkman found her because milk was rationed to one or two pints a week depending on how much the children and expectant mothers needed he didnt leave it on her doorstep the way he used to do before the war even in a close community like ours a bottle of milk left unguarded on a doorstep wouldnt have lasted five minutes these days harry walked around with his float and people came out to buy it was convenient as we were some way from the nearest shops and we could always be sure we were getting fresh milk however mad maggie might have been it wasnt like her to miss her milk ration thinking she might have slept in or perhaps have fallen ill with no one to look after her harry knocked on her door and called her name when he heard no answer he told me he made a tentative try at the handle and found that the door was unlocked there she lay on her livingroom floor in a pool of dried blood dotted with flies poor harry lost his breakfast before he could dash outside for air why harry came straight to me when he found mad maggies body i cant say we were friends of a kind i suppose of much the same age and we occasionally passed a pleasurable evening together playing dominoes and drinking watery beer in the prince albert other than that we didnt have a lot in common i was a schoolteacher english and history and harry had left school at fourteen harry had missed the first war through a heart ailment whereas i had been gassed at ypres in i was a bachelor and harry was married with a stepson thomas who had just come back home on convalescent leave after being severely wounded during the dunkirk evacuation thomas also happened to be my godson which i suppose was the main thing harry and i had in common perhaps harry also came to me because i was a special constable i know it sounds impressive but it isnt really the services were so mixed up that youd have the police putting out fires the home guard doing police work and anyone with two arms carrying the stretchers a special constable was simply a parttime policeman without any real qualifications for the job except his willingness to take it on the rest of the time i taught what few pupils remained at silverhill grammar school as it turned out i was glad that harry did call on me because it gave me a stake in the matter the regular police were far more concerned with lighting offences and the black market than they were with their regular duties and one thing nobody had time to do in the war was investigate the murder of a mad mysterious cantankerous old woman nobody except me that is though my position didnt grant me any special powers i pride myself on being an intelligent and perceptive sort of fellow not to mention nosy and it wasnt the first time id done a spot of detective work on the side but first let me tell you a little about mad maggie i say old woman but maggie was probably only in her midforties about the same age as me when she was killed everyone just called her old it seemed to go with mad with a certain kind of woman its not so much a matter of years anyway but of demeanour and maggies demeanour was old take the clothes she wore for a start most women were trying to look like one of the popular film stars like vivien leigh or deanna durbin with her bolero dresses but even for a woman of her age maggie wore clothes that could best be described as oldfashioned even antique high buttoned boots long dresses with high collars groundsweeping cloaks and broadbrimmed hats with feathers needless to say the local kids at least those whose parents hadnt packed them off to the countryside already used to follow her down the street in gangs and chant mad maggie mad maggie shes so mad her brains all claggy children can be so cruel most of the time she ignored them or seemed oblivious to their taunts but once in a while she wheeled on them eyes blazing and started waving her arms around and yelling curses usually in french the children would squeal with exaggerated horror then turn tail and run away maggie never had any visitors none of us had ever been inside her house nobody in the community even knew what her real name was where she had come from or how she had got to be the way she was we simply accepted her there were rumours of course some gossipmongers had it that she was an heiress cut off by her family because she went mad others said she had never recovered from a tragic love affair still others said she was a rich eccentric and kept thousands of pounds stuffed in her mattress whoever and whatever mad maggie was she managed to take care of lifes minutiae somehow she paid her rent she bought newspapers and she handled her ration coupons just like the rest of us she also kept herself clean despite the restriction to only five inches of bath water perhaps her eccentricity was just an act then calculated to put people off befriending her for some reason perhaps she was shy or antisocial all in all she was known as mad maggie only because she never talked to anyone except herself because of the old clothes she wore because of her strange outbursts in french and because as everyone knew she never went to the shelters during airraids but would either stay indoors alone or walk the blackedout streets muttering and arguing with herself waving her arms at the skies as if inviting the bombs to come and get her when harry called that monday morning i was lying in bed grappling with one of my frequent bouts of insomnia waiting for the birds to sing me back to sleep i couldnt even tell if it was daylight or not because of the heavy blackout curtains i had been dreaming i remembered and had woken at about halfpast four gasping for air from my recurring nightmare about being sucked down into a quicksand i heard harry banging at my door and calling my name so i threw on some clothes and hurried downstairs i thought at first that it might be something to do with tommy but when i saw his pale face his wide eyes and the thin trickle of vomit at the corner of his mouth i worried that he was having the heart attack he had been expecting daily for over twenty years he turned and pointed down the street frank please he said youve got to come with me i could hear the fear in his voice so i followed him as quickly as i could to maggies house it was a fine october morning with a hint of autumns nip in the air he had left the door ajar slowly i pushed it open and went inside my first impression was more surprise at how clean and tidy the place was than shock at the bloody figure on the carpet in my defence lest i sound callous i had fought in the first war and by some miracle survived the mustard gas with only a few blisters and a nasty coughing fit every now and then but i had seen men blown apart i had been spattered with the brains of my friends i had crawled through trenches and not known whether the soft warm gelatinous stuff i was putting my hands in was mud or the entrails of my comrades more recently i had also helped dig more than one mangled or dismembered body from the ruins so a little blood a little death never bothered me much besides despite the pool of dried blood around her head mad maggie looked relatively peaceful more peaceful than i had ever seen her in life funny but it reminded me of that old dracula film i saw at the crown the one with bela lugosi the counts victims always became serene after they had wooden stakes plunged through their hearts mad maggie hadnt been a vampire and she didnt have a stake through her heart but a bloodstained posser lay by her side the concave copper head and wooden handle both covered in blood a quick glance in the kitchen showed only one puzzling item an unopened bottle of milk as far as i knew harrys last round had been the morning of the air raid last wednesday i doubted that maggie would have been able to get more than her rations besides the bottle top bore the unmistakable mark of the dairy where harry worked harry waited outside unwilling to come in and face the scene again once i had taken in what had happened i told him to fetch the police the real police this time they came and they went one was a plainclothes officer detective sergeant longbottom a dulllooking bruiser with a pronounced limp who looked most annoyed at being called from his bed he asked a few questions sniffed around a bit then got the ambulance men to take maggie away on a stretcher one of the questions sergeant longbottom asked was the victims name i told him that apart from mad maggie i had no idea with a grunt he rummaged around in the sideboard drawer and found her rent book i was surprised to discover that she was called rose faversham which i thought was actually quite a pretty name prettier than mad maggie anyway sergeant longbottom also asked if wed had any strangers in the area apart from an army unit billeted near the park where they were carrying out training exercises and the gypsy encampment in silverhill woods we hadnt ah gypsies he said and wrote something in his little black notebook is anything missing i told him i didnt know as i had no idea what might have been here in the first place that seemed to confuse him for all i knew i went on the rumour might have been right and she could have had a mattress stuffed with banknotes sergeant longbottom checked upstairs and came back scratching his head everything looks normal he said then he poked around a bit more noting the canteen of sterling silver cutlery and guessed that mad maggie had probably interrupted the thief who had killed her and fled the scene probably back to the gypsy encampment i was on the point of telling him that i thought the nazis were supposed to be persecuting gypsies not us but i held my tongue i knew it would do no good of course i told him how everyone in the neighbourhood knew mad maggie paid no attention to air raids how she even seemed to enjoy them the way some people love thunderstorms and how tom sellers the arp man had remonstrated with her on many occasions only to get a dismissive wave and the sight of her ramrodstiff back walking away down the street maggie had also been fined more than once for blackout infringements until she solved that one by keeping her heavy black curtains closed night and day i also told longbottom that in the blackout anyone could have come and gone easily without being seen i think that was what finally did it he hummed and hawed muttered gypsies again made noises about a continuing investigation then put his little black notebook away said he had pressing duties to attend to and left and there things would have remained had i not become curious no doubt mad maggie would have been fast forgotten and some poor innocent gypsy would have been strung up from the gallows but there was something about the serenity of mad maggies features in death that haunted me she looked almost saintlike as if she had sloughed off the skin of despair and madness that she had inhabited for so long and reverted to the loving compassionate christian woman she must have once been she had a real name now too rose faversham i was also provoked by detective sergeant longbottoms gruff manner and his obvious impatience with the whole matter no doubt he had more important duties to get back to such as the increased traffic in black market onion substitutes i would like to say that the police searched maggies house thoroughly locked it up fast and put a guard on the door but they did nothing of the kind they did lock the front door behind us of course but that was it i imagined that as soon as he found out old grasper the landlord would slither around rubbing his hands and trying to rent the place out quickly again for twice as much before the army requisitioned it as a billet one thing i had neglected to tell detective sergeant longbottom i realized as i watched his car disappear around a pile of rubble at the street corner was about fingers finnegan our local black marketeer and petty thief human nature is boundlessly selfish and greedy even in wartime and air raids provided the perfect cover for burglary and black market deals the only unofficial people on the streets during air raids were either mad like maggie or up to no good like fingers wed had a spate of burglaries when most decent lawabiding people were in st marys church crypt or at least in their damp and smelly backyard anderson shelters and fingers was my chief suspect he could be elusive when he wanted to be though and i hadnt seen him in a number of days not since last wednesdays air raid in fact after the police had gone harry and i adjourned to my house where despite the early hour i poured him a stiff brandy and offered him a woodbine i didnt smoke myself because of that little bit of gas that had leaked through my mask at ypres but i had soon discovered that it was wise to keep cigarettes around when they were becoming scarce like all the rationed items they became a kind of currency i also put the kettle on for i hadnt had my morning tea yet and im never at my best before my morning tea perhaps that may be one reason i have never married most of the women i have met chatter far too much in the morning what a turn up harry said after taking a swig and coughing mad maggie murdered whod imagine it her killer i should think i said gypsies i shook my head i doubt it oh theres no doubt theyre a shifty lot i wouldnt trust one of them as far as i could throw him but killers a defenceless woman like maggie i dont think so besides you saw her house it hadnt been touched but sergeant longbottom said she might have interrupted a burglar i sniffed sergeant longbottoms an idiot there was no evidence at all that her killer was attempting to burgle the place maybe she was one of them once a gypsy and they came to take her back i laughed i must say harry you certainly dont lack imagination ill grant you that but no i rather fancy this is a different sort of matter altogether harry frowned youre not off on one of your sherlock holmes kicks again are you frank leave it be let the professionals deal with it its what theyre paid for professionals hmph you saw for yourself how interested our detective sergeant longbottom was interested in crawling back in his bed more like it no harry i think thats the last weve seen of them if we want to find out who killed poor maggie well have to find out for ourselves why not just let it be frank harry pleaded were at war people are getting killed every minute of the day and night i gave him a hard look and he cringed a little because this is different harry while i cant say i approve of war as a solution to mans problems at least its socially sanctioned murder if the government in all its wisdom decides that were at war with germany and we should kill as many germans as we can then so be it but nobody sanctioned the killing of mad maggie when an individual kills someone like maggie he takes something he has no right to something he cant even give back or replace the way he could a diamond necklace its an affront to us all harry an insult to the community and its up to us to see that retribution is made ill admit i sounded a little pompous but harry could be extremely obtuse on occasion and his using the war as an excuse for so outrageous a deed as roses murder brought out the worst in me harry seemed suitably cowed by my tirade and when hed finished his brandy he shuffled off to finish his deliveries i never did ask him whether there was any milk left on his unattended float i had another hour in which to enjoy my morning tea before i had to leave for school but first i had to complete my ritual and drop by the newsagents for a paper while i was there i asked mrs hope behind the counter when she had last seen mad maggie last wednesday she told me walking down the street towards her house just before the warning siren went off muttering to herself that information along with the unopened milk and the general state of the body was enough to confirm for me that rose had probably been killed under cover of the air raid that morning i found i could neither concentrate on othello which i was supposed to be teaching the fifth form nor could i be bothered to read about the bombing raids evacuation procedures and government pronouncements that passed for news in these days of propaganda and censorship instead i thought about mad maggie or rose faversham as she had now become for me when i tried to visualize her as she was alive i realized that had i looked closely enough had i got beyond the grim expressions and the muttered curses i might have seen her for the handsome woman she was handsome i say not pretty or beautiful but i would hazard a guess that twenty years ago she would have turned a head or two then i remembered that it was about twenty years ago when she first arrived in the neighbourhood and she had been mad maggie right from the start so perhaps i was inventing a life for her a life she had never had but certainly when death brought repose to her features it possessed her of a beauty i had not noticed before when i set off for school i saw tommy markham harrys stepson going for his morning constitutional tommys real dad lawrence markham had been my best friend we had grown up together and had both fought in the third battle of ypres between august and november lawrence had been killed at passchendaele about nine miles away from my unit while i had only been mildly gassed tommy was in his mid twenties now he never knew his real dad but worshipped him in a way you can worship only a dead hero tommy joined up early and served with the green howards as part of the illfated british expeditionary force in france he had seemed rather twitchy and sullen since he got back from the hospital last week but i put that down to shattered nerves the doctors had told polly his mother something about nervous exhaustion and about being patient with him morning tommy i greeted him he hadnt noticed me at first his eyes had been glued to the pavement as he walked but when he looked up startled i noticed the almost pellucid paleness of his skin and the dark bruises under his eyes oh good morning mr bascombe he said how are you im fine but you dont look so good what is it my nerves he said moving away as he spoke the doc said id be all right after a bit of rest though im glad to hear it by the way did your fath sorry did harry tell you about mad maggie i knew tommy was sensitive about harry not being his real father he said she was dead thats all says someone clobbered her when did you last see her tommy i dont know since the raid that was the day after i got back no come to think of it i dont think i have seen her since then terrible business init yes it is anyway sorry must dash bye mr bascombe bye tommy i stood frowning and watched him scurry off almost crabwise down the street there was another air raid that night and i decided to look for fingers finnegan by then i had talked to enough people on the street to be certain that no one had seen rose since the evening of the last raid we lived down by the railway the canal and the power station so we were always copping it the luftwaffe could never aim accurately though because the power station sent up clouds of appalling smoke as soon as they heard there were enemy planes approaching if the bombs hit anything of strategic value it was more by good luck than good management the siren would go off wailing up and down the scale for two minutes and it soon became an eerie fugue as you heard the sirens from neighbouring boroughs join in one after another the noise frightened the dogs and cats and they struck up wailing and howling too at first you could hardly see a thing outside only hear the droning of the bombers high above and the swishing and whistling sound of the bombs as they fell in the distance then came the explosions the hailstone of incendiaries on roofs like a rain of fire the flames crackling blazing through the smoke even the sounds seemed muffled the distant explosions no more than dull flat thuds like a heavy book falling on the floor the crackle of antiaircraft fire like fat spitting on a griddle sometimes you could even hear someone scream or shout out a warning once i heard a terrible shrieking that still haunts my nightmares but the city had an eldritch beauty during an air raid in the distance through the smoke haze the skyline seemed lit by a dozen suns each a slightly different shade of red orange or yellow searchlights crisscrossed one another making intricate cats cradles in the air and ackack fire arced into the sky like strings of christmas lights soon the bells of the fire engines became part of the symphony of sound and colour the smoke from the power station got in my eyes and up my nose and with my lungs it brought on a coughing fit that seemed to shake my ribs free of their moorings i held a handkerchief to my face and that seemed to help a little it wasnt too difficult to get around despite the blackout and the smoke there were white stripes painted on the lampposts and along the kerbside and many people had put little dots of luminous paint on their doorbells so you could tell where you were if you knew the neighbourhood well enough i walked along lansdowne street to the junction with cardigan road nobody was abroad the bombs were distant but getting closer and the smell from a broken sewage pipe was terrible despite my handkerchief once i fancied i saw a figure steal out of one of the houses look this way and that then disappear into the smoky darkness i ran calling out after him but when i got there he had vanished it was probably fingers i told myself id have a devil of a time catching him now i had scared him off my best chance was to run him down in one of the backstreet cafes where he sold his stolen goods the next day so instead of pursuing my futile task and because it was getting more and more difficult to breathe i decided that my investigation might next benefit best from a good look around roses empty house it was easy enough to gain access via the kitchen window at the back which wasnt even latched and after an undignified and painful fall from the sink to the floor i managed to regain my equilibrium and set about my business it occurred to me that if i had such an easy time getting in then her killer would have had an easy time too rose had been killed with the posser which would most likely have been placed near the sink or tub in which she did her washing because of the blackout curtains i didnt have to worry about my torch giving me away nor did i have to cover it with tissue paper as i would outside so i had plenty of light to see by i stood for a few moments adjusting to the room i could hear fireengine bells not too far away i found little of interest downstairs apart from necessities such as cutlery pans plates and dishes rose seemed to own nothing there were no framed photographs on the mantelpiece no paintings on the drab walls there wasnt even a wireless a search of the sideboard revealed only the rent book that longbottom had already discovered a national identity card also in the name of rose faversham her ration book various coupons old bills and about twenty pounds in banknotes i did find two bottles of gin one almost empty in the lower half of the china cabinet there were no letters no address books nothing of a personal nature rose favershams nest was clean and tidy but it was also quite sterile wondering whether it was worth bothering i finally decided to go upstairs to finish my search the first of the two bedrooms was completely bare most people use a spare room to store things they no longer use but cant bear to throw out just yet there was nothing like this in roses spare bedroom just some rather austere wallpaper and bare floorboards i felt a tremor of apprehension on entering roses bedroom after all she had lived such a private selfcontained life that any encroachment on her most intimate domain seemed a violation nonetheless i went inside apart from the ruffled bedclothes which i assumed were the result of detective sergeant longbottoms cursory search the bedroom was every bit as neat clean and empty as the rest of the house the one humanizing detail was a library book on her bedside table samuel butlers the way of all flesh so rose faversham had been an educated woman butlers savage and ironic attack on victorian values was hardly common bedtime reading on our street i looked under the mattress and under the bed and found nothing the dressing table held those few items deemed essential for a womans appearance and hygiene and the chest of drawers revealed only stacks of carefully folded undergarments corsets and the like among which i had no desire to go probing the long dresses hung in the wardrobe beside the highbuttoned blouses about to give up and head home to bed i tried one last place the top of the wardrobe where i used to keep my secret diaries when i was a boy and there i found the shoebox even a brief glance inside told me it was the repository of whatever past and personal memories rose faversham might have wanted to hang on to instead of sitting on the bedspread to read by torchlight i went back downstairs and slipped out of the house like a thief in the night which i suppose i was with roses shoebox under my arm a bomb exploded about half a mile away as i sidled down the street i should have gone to one of the shelters i know but i was feeling devilmaycare that night and i certainly didnt want anyone to know i had broken into roses house and stolen her only private possessions back in my own humble abode i made sure my curtains were shut tight poured a large tumbler of brandy perhaps apart from nosiness and an inability to suffer fools gladly my only vice then turned on the standard lamp beside my armchair and settled down to examine my haul there was a certain excitement in having pilfered it as they say and for a moment i imagined i had an inkling of that illicit thrill fingers finnegan must get every time he burgles someones house of course this was different i hadnt broken into roses house for my own benefit to line my own pockets but to solve the mystery of her murder the first thing the shoebox yielded was a photograph of three smiling young women standing in front of an old van with a cross on its side i could tell by their uniforms that they were nurses from the first world war on the back in slightly smudged ink someone had written midge rose and margaret flanders july friends inseparable for ever i stared hard at the photograph and though my imagination may have been playing tricks on me i thought i recognized rose as the one in the middle she had perfect dimples at the edges of her smile and her eyes gazed pure and clear directly into the lens she bore little resemblance to the rose i had known as mad maggie or indeed to the body of rose faversham as i had seen it but i think it was her i put the photograph aside and pulled out the next item it was a book of poetry severn and somme by ivor gurney one of my favourite poets gurney was gassed at st julien near passchendaele and sent to a war hospital near edinburgh i heard he later became mentally disturbed and suicidal and he died just two or three years ago after nearly twenty years of suffering i have always regretted that we never met i opened the book on the title page someone had written to my darling rose on her st birthday march love nicholas so rose was even younger than i had thought i set the book aside for a moment and rubbed my eyes sometimes i fancied the residual effects of the gas made them water though my doctor assured me that it was a foolish notion as mustard gas wasnt a lachrymator i hadnt been in the war as late as march the injury that sent me to a hospital in manchester my blighty took place the year before blistered and blinded i had lain in bed there for months unwilling to get up the blindness passed but the scarring remained both inside and out in the small hours when i cant sleep i relive those early days of august in flanders the driving rain the mud the lice the rats the deafening explosions it was madness we were doomed from the start by incompetent leaders and as we struggled waist deep through mud with shells and bullets flying all around us we could only watch in hopeless acceptance as our own artillery sank in the mud and our tanks followed it down judging by the words on the back of the photograph rose had been there too rose one of the angels of mercy who tended the wounded and the dying in the trenches of flanders fields i opened the book nicholas or rose had underlined the first few lines of the first poem to the poet before battle now youth the hour of thy dread passion comes thy lovely things must all be laid away and thou as others must face the riven day unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums or bugles strident cry perhaps nicholas had been a poet and gurneys call for courage in the face of impending battle applied to him too and if nicholas had been a poet was rose one of the lovely things he had to set aside outside the allclear sounded and brought me back to earth i breathed a sigh of relief spared again still i had been so absorbed in roses treasures that i probably wouldnt have heard a bomb if one fell next door they say you never hear the one with your name on i set the book down beside the photograph and dug around deeper in the shoebox i found a medal of some sort i think for valour in wartime nursing and a number of official papers and certificates unfortunately there were no personal letters even so i managed to compile a list of names to seek out and one or two official addresses where i might pursue my enquiries into rose favershams past no time like the present i thought going over to my escritoire and taking out pen and paper i posted my letters early the following morning when i went to fetch my newspaper i had the day off from school as the pupils were collecting aluminium pots and pans for the spitfire fund so i thought i might slip into special constable mode and spend an hour or two scouring fingers finnegans usual haunts i started at frintons on the high street where i also treated myself to two rashers of bacon and an egg by midmorning i had made my way around most of the neighbouring cafes and it was lunchtime when i arrived at lyons in the city centre i didnt eat out very often and twice a day was almost unheard of even so i decided to spend one and threepence on roast beef and yorkshire pudding there was a lot of meat around then because the powers that be were slaughtering most of the farm animals to turn the land over to crops i almost felt that i was doing my national duty by helping eat some before it went rotten as i waited i noticed finnegan slip in through the door in his usual manner licking his lips head halfbowed eyes flicking nervously around the room trying to seek out anyone who might be after him or to whom he might have owed money i wasnt in uniform and i was pretending to be absorbed in my newspaper so his eyes slid over me when he decided it was safe he sat down three tables away from me my meal came and i tucked in with great enthusiasm managing to keep finnegan in my peripheral vision shortly another man came in darkhaired redfaced and sat with finnegan the two of them put their heads together all the time finnegans eyes flicking here and there looking for danger signs i pretended to pay no attention but was annoyed that i couldnt overhear a word something exchanged hands under the table and the other man left finnegan fencing his stolen goods again i waited lingering over my tea and rice pudding and when finnegan left i followed him i hadnt wanted to confront him in the restaurant and cause a scene so i waited until we came near a ginnel not far from my own street then i speeded up grabbed him by the shoulders and dragged him into it finnegan was not very strong in fact he was a scrawny sickly sort of fellow which is why he wasnt fit for service but he was slippery as an eel and it took all my energy to hang on to him until i got him where i wanted him with his back to the wall and my fists gripping his lapels i slammed him against the wall a couple of times to take any remaining wind out of his sails then when he went limp i was ready to start bloody hell constable bascombe he said when hed got his breath back i didnt recognize you at first you didnt have to do that you know if theres owt you want to know why dont you just ask me lets be civilians about it the word is civilized with you come off it fingers my names michael listen michael i want some answers and i want them now answers to what during last nights air raid i saw you coming out of a house on cardigan road i never dont lie to me i know it was you so what i mightve been at my cousins he lives on cardigan road you were carrying something he gave me a couple of kippers youre lying to me fingers but well let that pass for the moment im interested in the raid before that one when was that then last wednesday how dyou expect me to remember what i was doing that long ago because murder can be quite a memorable experience fingers he turned pale and slithered in my grip my palms were sweaty murder me youve got to be joking ive never killed nobody i didnt bother pointing out that that meant he must have killed somebody linguistic niceties such as that being as pointless with someone of finnegans intelligence as speaking loudly to a foreigner and hoping to be understood so i pressed on did you break into rose favershams house on aston place last wednesday during the raid rose faversham who the bloody hells she when shes at home never heard of her you might have known her as mad maggie mad maggie now why would a bloke like me want to break into her house thats assuming he did things like that in the first place hypnotically like hypnotically did he mean hypothetically i didnt even ask to rob her perhaps nah you reckon a woman who went around looking like she did would have anything worth stealing hypnotically again of course of course fingers this entire conversation is hypnotic i understand that mad maggie hardly draws attention to herself as a person worth robbing not unless youre into antiques and youre not wouldnt know a chippendale from a gainsborough know anybody who is nah what about the thousands of pounds they say she had hidden in her mattress and pigs can fly constable bascombe what about silverware theres a bob or two in a nice canteen of cutlery hypnotically of course the one thing that might have been of value to someone other than herself was roses silverware and that had been left alone even if fingers had been surprised by her and killed her he would hardly have left his sole prize behind when he ran off on the other hand with a murder charge hanging over it the silverware might have turned out to be more of a liability than an asset i looked at his face into his eyes trying to decide whether he was telling the truth you couldnt tell anything from finnegans face though it was like a ferret mask look he said licking his lips i might be able to help you help me yeah but you know not standing here like this i realized i was still holding him by the lapels and i had hoisted him so high he had to stand on his tiptoes i relaxed my grip what do you have in mind we could go to the prince albert have a nice quiet drink theyll still be open i thought for a moment the hard way hadnt got me very far maybe a little diplomacy was in order though it galled me to be going for a drink with a thieving illiterate like fingers finnegan there were larger things at stake i swallowed my pride and said why not nobody paid us a second glance which was all right by me i bought us both a pint and we took a quiet table by the empty fireplace fingers brought a packet of woodbines out of his pocket and lit up his smoke burned my lungs and caused me a minor coughing fit but he didnt seem concerned by it what makes you think you can help me i asked him when id recovered ill bet youre after mad maggies murderer arent you how do you know that word gets around the real police think it was gypsies you know theyve got one of them in the cells right now found some silver candlesticks in his possession how did they know whether rose had any silver candlesticks he curled his lip and looked at me as if i were stupid they dont but they dont know that she didnt do they all they needs a confession and hes a brute in the interrogation room is that shortarse bastard who longbottom its what we call him longbottom shortarse get it im falling off my chair with laughter have you got anything interesting to tell me or havent you i might have seen someone mightnt i seen someone who where he rattled his empty glass on the table thatd be telling wouldnt it i sighed pushed back the disgust i felt rising like vomit in my craw and bought him another pint he was smirking all over his ferret face when i got back ta very much constable bascombe youre a true gentleman you are the bugger was enjoying this fingers i said you dont know how much your praise means to me now to get back to what you were saying its michael i told you and none of your micks or mikes my names michael right michael you know im a patient man but im beginning to feel just a wee bit let down here im thinking that perhaps it might not be a bad idea for me to take you to detective sergeant longbottom and see if he cant persuade you to tell him what you know fingers jerked upright hang on a minute theres no need for anything drastic like that im just having my little bit of fun thats all you wouldnt deny a fellow his little bit of fun would you heaven forbid i muttered so now youve had your fun fin er michael perhaps we can get back to business right well theatrically speaking of course i might have been in aston place on the night youre talking about theatrically let it go frank last wednesday during the air raid right well i might have been just you know being a concerned citizen and all going round checking up all the women and kids was in the shelters like and the old people dont forget the old people especially the old people anyway like i said i just might have been passing down aston place during the air raid seeing that everyone was all right like and i might just have seen someone coming out of mad maggies house did you well it was dark and that bloody smoke from the power station doesnt make things any better like a real peasouper that is anyway i might just have seen this figure like a quick glimpse i understand any idea who it was not at first i hadnt but now ive an idea i just hadnt seen him for a long time where were you coming out of cant have been more than two or three houses away when i saw him he gave me a real fright so i pressed myself back in the doorway like so he couldnt see me but you got a look at him not a good one first thing i noticed though is he was wearing a uniform what kind of uniform i dont know do i soldiers i suppose anything else well he moved off sort of sideways like crabwise come again like a crab if you say so constable bascombe something about all this was beginning to make sense but i wasnt sure i liked the sense it made did you notice anything else i saw him go into a house across the street which one i asked half of me not wanting to know the answer the milkmans he said i didnt want to but i had to see this through tommy markham my own godson all afternoon i thought about it and i could see no way out of confronting harry and tommy no matter how much thinking i did i couldnt come up with an explanation and if tommy had murdered rose faversham i wanted to know why he had certainly been acting oddly since he came back from the army hospital but i had acted rather strangely myself after they released me from the hospital in manchester in i knew better than to judge a man by the way he reacts to war i consoled myself with the fact that tommy might not have killed rose that she was already dead when he went to see her but i knew in my heart that didnt make sense nobody just dropped in on mad maggie to see how she was doing and the idea of two people going to see her in one night was absurd no i knew that the person fingers had seen coming out of roses house had to be her killer and he swore that person was tommy markham fingers could have been lying but that didnt make sense either for a start he wasnt that clever he must also know that i would confront tommy and that one way or another id find out the truth no if fingers had killed mad maggie and wanted to escape blame all he had to do was deny that he had been anywhere near her house and let the gypsy take the fall i steeled myself with a quick brandy then i went around to harrys house just after eight oclock they were all listening to a variety programme on the home service and someone was torturing a nightingale sang in berkeley square as usual tommy was wearing his army uniform even though he was on extended leave he still looked ill pale and thin his mother polly a stout silent woman i had known ever since she was a little girl offered to make tea and disappeared into the kitchen what brings you out at this time of night then harry asked want some company down at the prince albert i shook my head actually its your tommy i came to see a shadow of fear crossed harrys face tommy well youd better ask him yourself then best of luck tommy hadnt moved yet but when i addressed him he slowly turned to face me there was a look of great disappointment in his eyes as if he knew he had had something valuable in his grasp only to have it taken from him at the last minute harry turned off the radio tommy i said speaking as gently as i could did you go to visit mad maggie last wednesday night the night of the air raid harry was staring at me disbelief written all over his face for gods sake frank he began but i waved him down did you tommy did you visit mad maggie slowly tommy nodded you dont have to say any more harry said getting to his feet he turned to me as if i were his betrayer ive considered you a good friend for many years frank but youre pushing me too far polly came back with the teapot and took in the scene at a glance whats up whats going on sit down polly i said im asking your tommy a few questions thats all polly sat harry remained standing fists clenched at his sides then tommys voice broke the deadlock its all right mum he said to polly i want to tell him i want to get it off my chest i dont know what youre talking about son she said tommy pointed at harry he does hes not as daft as he looks i looked at harry who sat down again and shook his head tommy turned back to me did i go visit mad maggie yes i did did i kill her yes i d id i got in through the back window it wasnt locked i picked up the posser and went through into the living room she was sitting in the dark didnt even have a wireless she must have heard me but she didnt move she looked at me just once before i hit her and i could swear she knew why i was doing it she understood and she knew it was right it was just as tommy spoke he became more animated and his eyes started to glow with life again as if his prize were once more within his grasp why did you do it tommy i asked what did she ever do to harm you he looked at harry she killed my dad she what i told you she killed my dad my real dad polly flopped back in her armchair tea forgotten and put her hand to her heart tommy what are you saying he knew he said looking at harry again or at least he suspected i told him about the field about the villagers the madwoman harry shook his head i didnt know he said you never told me it was her all i knew was that you were upset you were saying crazy things and acting strange especially when you came in from the raid that night i was worried thats all if i ever suspected you thats the only reason son i swear it when i found her body i thought if there was the remotest possibility thats why i went for frank i told him to lay off it to let the gyppos take the blame but he wouldnt harry pointed his finger at me red in the face if you want to blame anyone blame him calm down harry i told him youll give yourself a heart attack its not a matter of blame tommy said its about justice and justice has been served better tell me about it tommy i said the airraid siren went off wailing up and down the scale we all ignored it tommy paused and ran his hand through his closely cropped hair he looked at me you should understand mr bascombe you were there he was your best friend i frowned tell me tommy before dunkirk a group of us got cut off and we were in this village near ypres for a few days before the germans got too close we almost didnt make it to the coast in time for the evacuation the people were frightened about what the germans might do if they found out we were there but they were kind to us i became quite friendly with one old fellow who spoke very good english and i told him my father had been killed somewhere near here in the first war passchendaele i said id never seen his grave one day the old man took me out in his horse and cart and showed me some fields it was late may and the early poppies were just coming out among the rows of crosses it looked beautiful i knew my father was there somewhere tommy choked for a moment looked away and wiped his eyes then the old man told me a story he went on he said there was a woman living in the village who used to you you know with the british soldiers but she was in love with a german officer and she passed on any information she could pick up from the british directly to him one soldier let something slip about some new trench positions they were preparing for a surprise attack and before anyone knew what had hit them the trenches were shelled and the germans swarmed into them they killed every british soldier in their path it came to hand to hand combat in the end bayonets and the womans german lover was one of the last to die tommy paused glanced at his mother and went on he told me she never recovered she went mad and for a while after the armies had moved on she could be heard wailing for her dead german lover in the poppy fields at night then nothing more was heard of her the rumour was that she had gone to england where they had plenty of other madwomen to keep her company i thought of mad maggie right from the start of course and i remembered the way she used to burst into french every now and then i asked him if he had a photograph and he said he thought he had an old one we went back to his house and he rummaged through his attic and came down with an old album there she was the same sort of clothes that same look about her much younger and very beautiful but it was her it was mad maggie and she had killed my father he was in one of those trenches what happened next tommy i dont remember much of the next couple of months the germans got too close and we had to make a hasty departure thats when i was wounded i was lucky to make it to dunkirk if it hadnt been for my mates they carried me most of the way anyway for a while i didnt know where i was in and out of consciousness to be honest half the time i preferred to be out of it i had dreams nightmares visions and i saw myself coming back and avenging my fathers death his eyes shone with pride and righteousness as he spoke outside the bombs were starting to sound alarmingly close lets get down to the shelter harry suggested no said tommy holding up his hand hear me out now wait till im done he turned to me you should understand mr bascombe she killed my dad he was your best friend you should understand i only did what was right i shook my head theres no avenging deaths during wartime tommy its every man for himself some german bullet or bayonet had larrys name on it and that was that wrong place wrong time it could just as easily have been me tommy stared at me in disbelief besides i went on getting a little concerned at the explosions outside are you sure it was her tommy it seems an awful coincidence that she should end up living on our street dont you think im sure i saw the photograph ive still got it can i have a look tommy opened his top pocket and handed me a creased photograph there was no doubt about the superficial resemblance between the woman depicted there leaning against a farmers fence wearing high buttoned boots smiling and holding her hand to her forehead to keep the sun out of her eyes but it wasnt the same woman whose photograph i had found in rose favershams shoebox in fact it wasnt any of the three midge rose or margaret there were no dimples for a start and the eyes were different we all have our ways of identifying people and with me its always the eyes show me someone at six sixteen and sixty and ill know if its the same person or not by the eyes another bomb landed far too close for comfort and the whole house shook then a split second later came a tremendous explosion plaster fell off the ceiling the lights and radio went off i could hear the drone of the bombers slowly disappearing to the southeast on their way home again we were all shaken but i pulled myself to my feet first and suggested we go outside to see if anyone needed help i didnt really think hed make a run for it but i stuck close to tommy as we all went outside the smell was awful the bitter fiery smell of the explosive and a whiff of gas from a fractured pipe mixed with dust from broken masonry the sky was lit up like guy fawkes night it was a terrible sight that met our eyes and the four of us could only stand and stare a bomb had taken out about three houses on the other side of the street the middle one now nothing but a pile of burning rubble was mad maggies when the answers to my letters started trickling in a couple of weeks after tommys arrest i picked up some more leads one of which eventually led me to midge livesey now a mother of two boys both in the raf who was living only thirty miles away in the country i telephoned her and she seemed pleased to hear from someone who had known rose though she was saddened by the news of roses death and she suggested i be her guest for the weekend though it was late october the weather was fine when i got off the train at the tiny station it was a wonderful feeling to be out in the country again i had been away for so long i had almost forgotten what the autumn leaves looked like and how many different varieties of birdsong there are the sweet acrid scent of burning leaves from someones garden made a fine change from the stink of the air raids midge and her husband arthur welcomed me at the door of their cottage and told me they had already prepared the spare room after i had laid out my things on the bed i opened the window directly outside stood an apple tree and beyond that i could see the landscape undulating to the north where the large anvil shapes of peaks and fells were visible in the distance i took in a deep breath of fresh air as deep as i could manage with my poor lungs and for once it didnt make me cough perhaps it was time i left the city i thought but no there were police duties to attend to and i loved my teaching job after the war perhaps i would think about it again see if i could get a job in a village school when i showed midge the photograph of the three of them over dinner that evening a sad smile played across her features and she touched the surface with her fingers as if it could send out some sort of message to her yes she said that was rose and that was margaret poor margaret she died in childbirth ten years ago the war wasnt all bad for us we d id have some good times but i think the day that photograph was taken marked the beginning of the end it was the day before the third ypres battle started and we were field nurses we used to go onto the fields and into the trenches to clean up after the battles she shook her head and looked at arthur who tenderly put his hand on top of hers youve never well i suppose you have she looked at her husband arthur understands too he was wounded at arras i worry about my boys just remembering just thinking about it makes me fear for them terribly does that make sense yes i said she paused for a moment and poured us all tea any way rose was especially sensitive she went on she wrote poetry and wanted to go to university to study english literature when it was all over french too she spoke french very well and spent a lot of time talking to the poor wounded french soldiers often they were with the english you know and there was nobody could talk to them rose did she fell in love with a handsome young english lieutenant nicholas his name was she smiled but we were young we were always falling in love back then what happened to her i asked rose she broke under the strain shell shock i suppose youd call it you hear a lot about the poor boys the breakdowns the selfinflicted wounds but you never hear much about the women do you where are we in the history books we might not have been shooting at the germans and only in minimal danger of getting shot at ourselves though there were times but we were there we saw the slaughter first hand we were up to our elbows in blood and guts some people just couldnt take it the way some of the boys couldnt take combat ill say this though i think it was nicholass death that finally sent rose over the edge it was the following year the end of march near a little village on the somme called st quentin she found him you know on the field it was pure chance half his head had been blown away she was never the same she used to mutter to herself in french and go into long silences eventually she tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of morphine but a doctor found her in time she was invalided out in the end do you know what happened next i visited her as soon as the war was over shed just come out of the hospital and was living with her parents they were wealthy landowners very posh you might say and they hadnt a clue what to do with her she was an embarrassment to them in the end they set up a small fund for her so she would never have to go without and left her to her own devices after a moment or twos silence i showed midge the book of poetry again she fingered it like a blind person looking for meaning oh yes ivor gurney she was always reading this she turned the pages this was her favourite she read us a short poem called bach and the sentry in which the poet on sentry duty hears his favourite bach prelude in his imagination and wonders how he will feel later when he actually plays the piece again in peacetime then she shook her head poor mad rose nobody knew what to do with her do tell me what became of her i told her what i knew which wasnt much though for some reason i held back the part about tommy and his mistake i didnt want midge to know that my godson had mistaken her friend for a traitor it seemed enough to lay the blame at the feet of a gypsy thief and hope that midge wasnt one of those women who followed criminal trials closely in the newspapers nor did i tell her that roses house had been destroyed by a bomb almost a week after the murder and that she would almost certainly have been killed anyway midge didnt need that kind of cruel irony she had suffered enough she had enough bad memories to fuel her nightmares and enough to worry about in the shape of her two boys i simply told her that rose was a very private person certainly eccentric in her dress and her mannerisms and that none of us really knew her very well she was a part of the community though and we all mourned her loss so mad maggie was another of wars victims i thought as i breathed in the scent of the apple tree before getting into bed that night one of the uncelebrated ones she came to our community to live out her days in anonymous grief and whatever inner peace she could scrounge for herself her sole valuable possessions a book of poetry an old photograph and a nursing medal and so she would have remained a figure to be mocked by the children and ignored by the adults had it not been for another damn war another damaged soul and the same poppy field in flanders requiescat in pace rose though i am not a religious man requiescat in pace it should never have happened but they hanged tommy markham for the murder of rose faversham at wandsworth prison on may at eight oclock in the morning everyone said tommy should have got off for psychiatric reasons but his barrister had a permanent hangover and the judge had an irritable bowel in addition the expert psychiatrist hired to evaluate him didnt know shell shock from an oedipus complex the only thing we could console ourselves with was that tommy went to the gallows proud and at peace with himself for having avenged his fathers death i hadnt the heart to tell him that he was wrong about mad maggie that she wasnt the woman he thought she was the dukes wife i was absolutely speechless after everything that had happened there he stood bold as brass telling all the world we were going to be married married you would have been speechless too let me give you a little background my name is isabella and until that moment i had been all set to enter a convent i fear i have a wayward and impulsive nature that needs to be kept in check and the convent i had in mind the votarists of st clare was one of strict restraint imagine my feelings when head swimming from the twists and turns of recent events i heard i was to be married to the duke but theres more much more a short while ago the duke realized that he had become lax in his duties being of too mild and gentle a nature to enforce the laws of the land to their fullest of special concern to him because it ate away at the very institution of marriage itself was the law that forbade on pain of death a man to live with a woman to whom he was not married fearing that the people would revolt if he were suddenly to change course and start enforcing the law rigorously himself the duke thought it better to slip away for a while and leave his deputy angelo in charge thus angelo was invested with all the dukes powers and charged with cleaning up vienna mistake big mistake where do i come into all this you might be wondering well it so happens that my brother claudio had plighted his troth to his fiancée juliet and they were sleeping together the problem was that they had kept their marriage contract a secret in the hope that juliets family would in time come to favour their union and provide a dowry and this brought them within the scope of the law against fornication now angelo could have exercised mercy realizing that this was a very minor infringement indeed and that the two were in all but the outward ceremony itself legally married but angelo is a cold fish and a sadistic ruthless dictator he likes to hurt people and make them squirm it gives him pleasure believe me i know finding himself so suddenly and inexplicably condemned to death claudio asked me to intercede with angelo on his behalf and see if i could secure a pardon this i did with disastrous results angelo told me he was in love with me and he would only let claudio go if i slept with him now while i do realize that in many peoples eyes to give up ones virginity for ones brothers life might not seem too much to ask you must bear in mind that i was to join the votarists of st clare i was to be married to god this was my life my destiny and all of that my very soul itself would be sacrificed if i gave in to angelos base demands and dont think i didnt care about claudio dont think for a moment that the thought of complying didnt cross my mind but i wasnt going to give in to that kind of blackmail i didnt trust angelo anyway for all i knew he might take my virginity and have claudio executed as well which as it turned out was exactly what he had in mind the whole process was degrading me pleading passionately for my brothers life going down on my knees on the cold stone to beg angelo making it clear that only by yielding up my body to his will could i save claudio humiliating when i told him my decision claudio wasnt at all understanding of everyone he should have been the one to see how important my virginity was but no he even had the effrontery to suggest that i should reconsider and commit this vile sin to save his life claudio was afraid of death and all he could talk about was his fear of dying when i was facing a much greater enemy than death i told him he would find his comfort in the bosom of the lord he didnt seem to agree where was the wily duke during all this you may well ask as it turns out he was secretly directing events disguised as a friar and he was the one who came up with a cunning plan he may be of a tender and mild disposition but he has a devious mind and he likes to play games nor does he always stop to think who might get hurt by them angelo had once been betrothed to a woman called mariana but her dowry went down on the same ship as her brother frederick and angelo left her in tears pretending he had discovered some stain on her honour when it was in fact the loss of the dowry that turned him against her if you needed any more evidence of his worthlessness thats the kind of person he is now if i were to go back to angelo and pretend to agree to his demands the friar suggested we could arrange things so that mariana went to his chamber in my stead breaking no laws and saving both my virginity and claudios life it seemed a very good plan and it worked though the friar did have to do a little juggling with severed heads later on to convince angelo that claudio had indeed been beheaded then for reasons of his own the friar let me go on believing that claudio had been executed i did say he likes to play games didnt i until the final scenes had been played out he had mariana beg for angelos life and the poor woman importuned me to beg with her thus i found myself on my knees for a second time this time pleading for the life of a man i hated the man who i thought had killed my brother even though he thought he had enjoyed the treasures of my body so is it any wonder i was speechless when in walked claudio as alive as you or i and the duke announced that i was to be his duchess i could have said no i suppose but at the time i was too stunned to say anything and the next thing i knew we were married though it took me many months i got over the shock of it all and adapted myself as best i could to my new life i hadnt actually taken my vows so there was no legal problem with the marriage the duke took over vienna again and enforced the law himself tempered with mercy and charity and things were back on an even keel im not saying that fornication ceased that could never happen here we viennese are an odd lot our lives full of secret vices and lies and anyone with an interest in the human mind and perverse behaviour would have a field day studying us being the dukes wife had many advantages i soon found though i did have some trouble adjusting to his husbandly demands he wasnt a young man but he was certainly vigorous though he needed certain props to help him perform those functions he liked so much in particular he liked to dress as a friar and intone latin vespers when he took me from behind as was his wont that i could deal with but i drew the line when he asked me to dress as a nun that would have been far too much of a travesty for me to take given everything that had happened so time passed and on the whole i quite enjoyed the life of idleness and luxury i loved my horses enjoyed the theatre and the frequent grand balls and i came to rely on the kind attentions of my maids and the delicious concoctions of my cooks as i say the sacrifices were bearable once in a while i had a wistful thought for the life i might have led but i must confess that when i hosted a magnificent banquet or walked the grounds and gardens of our wonderful palace the thought of a bare cold tiny cloister lost much of its appeal mind you i still attended church regularly and prayed every night and we gave generously to the votarists of st clare you might be interested in knowing what happened to the others claudio and juliet were married after which they moved to the country by all accounts they are happy enough though we dont see them very often angelo and mariana were also married it was her wish the dukes dictate and in accord with the law but their story didnt end happily at all well how could it with an evil sadistic pervert like angelo for a husband mariana is very sweet but she is such a naif when it comes to men even back when i was headed for the convent i had more idea than she did so i wasnt at all surprised when she came to me in tears about six months after her marriage dry your eyes dear i said to her and lets walk in the garden it was a beautiful spring day with a warm gentle breeze wafting the scents of flowers through the mild air i cant go on she said whats wrong its angelo what about him he doesnt love me any more he never did love her i could have said but i held my tongue i doubted that was what she wanted to hear at the moment what makes you think that i asked she looked around then leaned in towards me and lowered her voice he has other women i could have laughed out loud just about every husband in vienna has other women i suspect even my own duke has one from time to time but if it spares me the friars costume and the latin vespers for a night who am i to complain but mariana i could see was really upset its just men mariana i told her theyre like that they cant help themselves its their nature every time they see an attractive woman they just have to conquer her but am i not attractive thats neither here nor there youre his wife thats all that counts yes i am his wife so why does he have to sleep with other women ill sleep with him any time he wants ill do anything he wants me to even if it hurts me even that disgusting thing with the mariana i told you its just their nature youll have to learn to live with it or your life will be a very unhappy one but i am unhappy already i cant live with it i want to die i took her arm dont be so histrionic mariana i said youll get used to it she broke away i wont never i want to die im going to kill myself i sighed over a man there must be better reasons look who is this woman hes been seeing mariana looked at me her eyes were so full of pain that my heart cried for her even though i thought she was being foolish its not just one woman how many i dont know two three i told you i dont know you must have some idea is it three four or five about three i think thats about right so hes sleeping with three other women three a week yes what he has them sent to him theres a man called pandarus a greek i think a despicable human being and angelo pays him to procure young women usually young virgins from the provinces who are new in town and havent settled into employment theyre so young they dont i mean they dont all know what to expect he forces them mariana nodded ive heard cries screams sometimes and he swears they will die terribly if they ever speak of what happened marianas story was starting to interest me i had heard of this pandarus though i had never met him and i knew that he affected a respectable enough surface and was able to move among varying levels of society procuring wasnt new to vienna even among the higher echelons nothing to do with sex is new to vienna but this pandarus intrigued me all the same how do you know all this i asked a dear friend told me she had a conversation with one with one of the girls and youre certain its true mariana nodded one night i lay in wait hiding in the bushes and watched we have always had separate quarters and angelo maintains the same chamber he used do you remember that night when i went to him in your stead i nodded it wasnt a memory i cared to dwell on not one of my finest moments they come in the darkest of night and he burns no candles everything is just as it was that night i see i said i had hated angelo long and deeply enough for what he had inflicted on me that even as we spoke the beginnings of a plan began to form itself effortlessly in my mind what can i do dear isabel pray tell me what can i do i took her hand do nothing i said at least not for the moment i know it pains you but bear with it im certain theres a solution and i promise that your suffering will come to an end ere long her eyes widened and lit up at that little sliver of hope really you promise oh isabel is it possible i can be happy again well see i said busy thinking well see i was finally satisfied enough with my changed appearance and the peasant clothes i had painstakingly made to venture out into the city streets in the guise of a country girl seeking employment through further cautious questioning of mariana i had already determined that pandarus tended to prey on his victims in the busy public square near the coach station often approaching them the very moment they arrived in the city he had i imagined a skilled eye and knew exactly who was vulnerable to his approach and who best to leave alone i affected to look lost and weak and on my second visit a man came up to me his clothes and his bearing signified a certain level of wealth and influence in society and his general manner was that of a gentleman are you new here he asked me i responded shyly keeping my head down yes sir where are you from i named a distant village i had once heard one of my husbands ministers mention and what may i ask brings you to vienna i seek employment sir you do do you and what skills do you possess i can cook sir and wash and mend clothes valuable skills indeed come walk with me i couldnt just go with him not that easily i had to play the shy country girl i cannot sir cannot why not i dont know sir it just seems so forward i dont know you forward walking alongside a perfect gentleman in a public place he smiled he really did have a warm smile the kind that leads you to trust a person come come dont be silly so i walked beside him he offered his arm but i didnt take it that didnt seem to upset him too much you know i think i might be able to help you he said stroking his moustache help me sir you mean you require my services he laughed me oh no not me a friend of mine and i will speak for you but you dont know me sir how can you speak for me you dont even know my name he stopped walking and put his fingers under my chin lifting my face he was taller than i so i had to look up though i tried to keep my eyes down under my fluttering lashes i felt myself blush i am an excellent judge of character he said i believe you to be an honest country maiden and i believe you are exactly what he has in mind he let me go and carried on walking this time i picked up my pace to keep up with him showing interest he does however have one peculiarity i must mention he went on what might that be sir he prefers to conduct his business at night that is strange indeed sir he shrugged it is a mere trifle if you say so sir as a country girl i could of course have no idea of the ways of city folk so should you be interested and he is a most kind considerate and bountiful master you must go to him through his garden at night and he will acquaint you with his needs you need have no fears he is an honourable man and i shall be close by again i had to remind myself that i was playing the role of a simple country girl if you think so sir tonight then i hesitated for just as long as necessary tonight i whispered finally meet me here he said then he melted into the crowds my plan was simple enough i intended to gain entry to angelos chamber under cover of darkness and well i hadnt really thought much past that except that i planned to confront him and expose him for what he was if necessary i would claim that i went to visit my friend mariana and that he attempted to ravage me but i doubted it would come to that one of the many advantages of being the dukes wife is that subjects tend to fear my husbands power and i had no doubt that angelo would give up his nightly escapades if faced with their possible political consequences a wifes railing is easy enough to ignore but the power of the duke is another matter entirely i could not help but feel restless all evening as i waited for the appointed hour after the usual antics with cassock and vespers i slipped a sleeping draught into the dukes nightcap and he went out like a snuffed candle when the servants were all in bed i donned my disguise and slipped out of the house the dark streets frightened me as i had not gone out alone at night before and i feared lest some drunken peasant or soldier should molest me in case of just such an incident i carried a dagger concealed about my person a present to the duke from a visiting diplomat but either the denizens of the night are better behaved than i had imagined or i was blessed by fortune for i made my way to the square without any hindrance whatsoever when i got there i was surprised at how many people were still out and about at such a late hour lounging by the fountain talking and laughing by the light of braziers and flaming torches i had no idea that such a world of shadows existed and i found that the discovery oddly excited me pandarus appeared at my side as if by magic wrapped in dark robes his head hooded as was mine are you ready he asked i nodded then come with me i followed him through the narrow alleys and across the broad cobbled courtyards to angelos quarters where we paused at a gate in the high wall surrounding the garden this gate is unlocked said pandarus cross the garden directly to the chamber before you where you will find the door also unlocked enter and all will be explained i managed to summon up one last show of nerves im not certain sir i mean i do not theres nothing to fear he said softly will you accompany me sir i cannot my friend prefers to conduct his business in private he stood there while i gathered together all my strength took a deep breath and opened the gate there were no lights showing beyond the garden so i had to walk carefully to make sure i didnt trip and fall finally i reached the door of angelos chamber and it opened when i pushed it gently hinges creaking a little by this time i could make out the varying degrees of shadows so i was aware of the large canopied bed and of the silhouette standing before me angelo come in my little pretty one he said make yourself comfortable has my friend pandarus told you what you must do i curtsied yes sir he told me you might have a position for me but that you only conduct interviews at night angelo laughed hes a fine dissembler my pandarus but in that he is not all wrong i do indeed have a position for you with this he moved towards me and i felt his lizardlike hand caress my cheek i should have drawn back i know and at that moment told him who i was and why i was there but something in me some innate curiosity compelled me to continue my deception angelo led me slowly to the bed and bade me sit then he sat beside me and began his caresses again this time venturing into more private territory than before i took hold of his hand and moved it away but he was persistent growing rougher before i knew it he had me on my back on the bed and his hand was groping under my skirts rough fingers probing me i struggled and tried to tell him who i was but he put his other hand over my mouth to silence me all the time he manhandled me thus he was calling out my name isabella oh my beautiful isabella do it for me isabella please do it for me at first this confused me for i was certain he hadnt recognized me then i realized with a shock that he didnt know who i was but that this must be what he said to all his nighttime visitors he called them all isabella and then i understood the whole thing the recreation of the exact same conditions as the night i was to visit him in exchange for claudios life the hour the insistence on absolute darkness though mariana had gone to him in my stead angelo either refused to believe this or thought that by duplicating the trappings he could enjoy the treasures of my body time after time in the darkness of his vile imagination as we struggled there on the bed disgust and outrage overcame any simple desire i harboured for justice and i knew then what i had been planning to do all along angelos behaviour just made it all that much easier i slipped out my dagger and plunged it into his back with as much force as i could muster he stiffened as if stung by a wasp and reared back hand behind him trying to staunch the flow of blood then i plunged the dagger into his chest and said this for mariana he croaked my name isabella my isabella yes its me i said but im not yours and i plunged the dagger in again this is for me i said and he rolled to the floor pleading for his life i knelt over him and plunged the dagger in one more time into his black heart and this is for not being able to tell us apart in the dark after that he lay still i didnt move for several minutes but knelt there over angelos body catching my breath until i was sure that no one had heard the house remained silent knowing that pandarus was probably still lurking by the garden gate i left by the front door and hurried home through the dark streets nobody accosted me i saw not a soul when i got home in the light of a candle in my chamber i saw that my clothing was bloodstained no matter i would burn it as soon as that was done and i was washed clean of angelos blood all would be well mariana might shed a tear or two for her miserable faithless husband but she would get over him in time and he would never hurt her or anyone else again and as for me as i believe i have already told you there are many advantages to be gained from being the dukes wife not the least of which is the unlikelihood of being suspected of murder going back an inspector banks novella banks pulled up outside his parents council house and parked his renault by the side of the road he wondered if it would be safe left out overnight the estate had had a bad reputation even when he grew up there in the sixties and it had only got worse over recent years not that there was any alternative he realized as he made sure it was locked and the security system was working his parents didnt own a garage he couldnt very well remove the cd player for the weekend but to be on the safe side he stuffed the cds themselves into his overnight bag he didnt think any young joyriders would want to steal thelonious monk cecilia bartoli or the grateful dead but you couldnt be too careful besides he had a portable disc player now and he liked to listen to music in bed as he drifted off to sleep bankss parents house stood near the western edge of the estate close to the arterial road across from an abandoned factory and a row of shops banks paused for a moment and took in the redbrick terrace houses rows of five each with a little garden low wall and privet hedge his family had moved here from the tiny grim backtoback when he was twelve when the houses were new it was a friday afternoon near the end of october and banks was home for the weekend of his parents golden wedding anniversary that sunday only his second overnight stay since he had left home at the age of eighteen to study business at london polytechnic when that didnt work out and when the sixties lost their allure in the early seventies he joined the police since then long hours hard work and his parents overt disapproval of his career choice had kept him away visiting home was always a bit of a trial but they were his mother and father banks reminded himself he owed them more than he could ever repay he had certainly neglected them over the years and he knew they loved him in their way they werent getting any younger either he took a deep breath opened the gate walked up the path and knocked on the scratched red door a little surprised by the loud music coming from the next house he saw his mother approach through the frostedglass pane she opened the door rubbed her hands together as if drying them and said alan lovely to see you come on in love come in banks dropped his overnight bag in the hall and followed his mother through to the living room it stretched from the front of the house to the back and the back area next to the kitchen was permanently laid out as a dining room the wallpaper was a wispy brown autumn leaves pattern the threepiece suite a matching brown velveteen and a sentimental autumn landscape hung over the electric fire his father was sitting in his usual armchair the one with the best straighton view of the television he didnt get up just grunted son nice of you to come hello dad how are you doing mustnt complain arthur banks had been suffering from mild angina for years ever since hed been made redundant from the sheetmetal factory and it seemed to get neither better nor worse as time went on he took pills for the pain and didnt even need an inhaler other than that and the damage booze and fags had wreaked on his liver and lungs over the years he had always been as fit as a fiddle hollowchested and skinny he still sported a head of thick dark hair with hardly a trace of grey he wore it slicked back with lashings of brylcreem bankss mother ida plump and nervy fussed a little more about how thin banks was looking then the kitchen door opened and a stranger walked into the room kettles on mrs b now who have we got here let me guess this is our son geoff we told you he was coming for the party like so this is the lad whos done so well for himself is it the porsche and the mews house in south kensington no thats roy the other one hes not coming till sunday afternoon hes got important business no this is our eldest alan im sure i told you about him the one in that picture the photograph she pointed to halfhidden by a pile of womens magazines on one of the cabinet shelves showed banks at the age of sixteen when he captained the school rugby team for a season there he stood in his purple and yellow strip holding the ball looking proud it was the only photograph of him they had ever put on display this is geoff salisbury said ida banks geoff lives up the street at number fiftyfive geoff moved forward hand stretched out like a weapon he was a small compact man with lively slightly watery eyes and cropped grey hair about bankss age his smile revealed what looked to banks like a set of perfect false teeth his handshake was firm and his hands callused and ingrained with oil or grease from manual labour pleased to meet you alan he said id love to stay and chat but i cant just now he turned to bankss mother have you got that shopping list mrs b ill be off to asda now only if youre sure its no trouble nothings too much trouble for you you know that besides i have to go there myself bankss mother picked up her handbag took out her purse and gave geoffrey a handwritten list and a twentypound note will that cover it easily mrs b easily ill be back in a tick coach and horses tonight arthur maybe well see how i feel said bankss father on closer examination he did look tired and drawn banks thought more than when he had last seen him in the summer his eyes had the look of milky marbles and his skin was the colour of porridge it could be the strain of preparing for the upcoming party arthur banks while gregarious enough in the pub had never liked a house full of relatives but most of the organization banks guessed would have fallen to his mother perhaps it was simple old age catching up fast geoff salisbury left and banks saw him go up to the red fiesta with the rusted chassis parked behind bankss renault geoff paused and looked bankss car over before getting into his own and driving off whos that banks asked his mother i told you geoff salisbury hes a neighbour he seems at home here i dont know what wed do without him said mrs banks hes just like a son to us anyway sit yourself down have a cuppa banks sat and his mother poured so roys not coming till sunday then he said no he rang us last night didnt he arthur she said it as if it were some momentous event arthur banks nodded hes got an important business meeting all day saturday she went on something to do with some yanks flying in and they have to be back in new york by evening i dont know anyway he says he should be here by sunday lunchtime good of him to bother banks muttered his mother cast him a longsuffering glance banks knew she had been used to the brothers bickering when they both lived at home and it was no surprise whose side she usually took what time are you planning on starting the party banks asked we told everyone to come about six oclock thatll give us time to clear up and get things ready after lunch by the way i dont suppose youve heard yet but mrs summerville passed away she announced it in the sort of soft and solemn tones generally reserved for those who had passed away im sorry to hear it said banks mrs summerville was the mother of the first girl he had ever slept with though he had always believed that neither the late mrs summerville nor his own mother knew that what did she die of it wasnt anything suspicious if thats what youre thinking perish the thought his mother studied him frowning yes well it was a blessing really shed been very poorly died in her sleep according to alice green still said banks uncertain what to say he sipped some tea as usual it was milky and sweet though he had stopped taking milk and sugar twenty years ago and how are the marshalls he asked the marshalls were the parents of bankss school friend graham who had disappeared at the age of fourteen and whose body had been discovered the previous summer banks had come down to help the locals work on the case and the solution hadnt pleased anyone it was during that time he had met detective inspector michelle hart whom he had been seeing on and off ever since pity she wasnt around this weekend he thought same as ever i suppose said mrs banks we dont see much of them do we arthur arthur banks shook his head its as if theyve shut themselves away since you were last down bankss mother cast him an accusing glance as if their becoming recluses were his fault and maybe it was in a way the truth is rarely as liberating as people would have us believe it often binds more than it frees im sorry to hear that he said you know his mother went on while youre here you ought to go and see mrs green she keeps asking about you and she was very put out you didnt drop by and see her in the summer she still thinks very fondly of you though i cant see why the noise you lot used to make at her house banks smiled he remembered mrs green fondly too she was the mother of an old school friend tony green whom banks hadnt seen since he left home tony hadnt been one of the real incrowd but he had been in the rugby team with banks and banks had always liked mrs green most of the kids did she didnt stop them from smoking in her house and she didnt mind them playing the sort of music the beatles and the rolling stones mostly that most adults hated once or twice she had given banks and tony half a crown apiece and sent them off to the pictures out of her way she had also been very pretty with the kind of bosom young boys dream about and she certainly had a mouth on her mrs green had a reputation for speaking her mind nobody ruffled her feathers and got away with it tony had gone off to canada banks remembered and mr green had died of emphysema about nine months ago his mother had told him over the telephone and he had sent a sympathy card yes he would pay mrs green a visit so banks sipped tea with his mother and father catching up on the local gossip the usual stuff another school friend had emigrated to australia an old neighbour who had moved into a home a year ago had died and the venables lad from number sixtysix had been sent to borstal for mugging a pensioner banks didnt bother telling his mother that it wasnt called borstal any more but detention centre or youth custody centre they werent much interested in what hed been doing outside of the divorce from sandra they were more interested in brian and tracy and they expressed regret that neither could come to the party on sunday brians band was playing an important series of gigs in germany and tracy had flu not entirely convinced this wasnt some excuse banks had dropped by and offered to drive her from her university residence in leeds but when he saw her he took pity and said hed look in again on his way back fortunately she had friends there who would feed her chicken noodle soup and lemsip in the meantime have you seen whos moved in next door mrs banks asked no said banks but i heard them not that side the other a paki family thats who i must say though she went on they seem really nice very quiet they are even the kids arent they arthur and polite always say good morning and ask how youre doing talk just like us they do makes a change from that lot on the other side who are they banks asked she shook her head i dont even know their name they moved in about two weeks ago theyre not very friendly neighbours dont know how many of them live there either shiftylooking lot comings and goings all hours of the day and night noise and the place is a pigsty it sounded like a drug house banks made a mental note to keep his eyes open if he noticed anything suspicious hed get on to the local police bankss father picked up the remote control and turned the television on at halfpast five as banks remembered he did every weekday is that the time said ida banks id better get the tea on pork chops peas and chips all right fine said banks his stomach sinking as if there was a choice and a nice bit of steamed pudding and custard for sweet ill help banks followed her into the kitchen true to his word geoff salisbury came back from asda with a bag of groceries he dumped it on the kitchen table and handed ida banks two pound coins in change then they went through to the living room banks peeling potatoes at the time started to unload the groceries as he did so he came across the printed receipt stuck by condensation to the side of a bottle of chilled apple juice the print was a little blurred but even so he could see that the total came to which left a discrepancy of between that and the geoff had handed his mother holding the receipt banks went into the living room i think youve got the change wrong he said holding out the receipt for geoff to see bankss mother frowned alan must you then she turned to geoff im so sorry our alans in the police and he cant seem to let us forget it she said with a dismissive sniff one of the boys in blue eh cid actually said banks ah all that sherlock holmes stuff something like that lets see then geoff took a pair of bifocals from his shirt pocket and squinted at the list bloody hell youre right he admitted blushing he showed the receipt to ida banks its a fair cop see there mrs b it looks like an eight to me but its really a six thats what comes of being too vain to wear my glasses in the supermarket ida banks laughed and slapped him on the arm playfully oh get away with you geoff anyone could make a mistake like that geoff counted out the rest of the change into her hand he glanced sideways at banks still slightly red with embarrassment i can see ill have to watch myself now theres a copper around he joked yes said banks not laughing i think you better had there was no need for that alan bankss mother said after geoff salisbury had left embarrassing us all i wasnt embarrassed banks said besides he tried to cheat you dont be silly its like he said he couldnt see the figures properly does he do this often do what go shopping for you yes we cant get around like we used to you know what with your dads angina and my legs and feet legs and feet my varicose veins and bunions getting old is no treat alan i can tell you that much youll find out yourself one day anyway hes been good to us has geoff and now youve gone and upset him i dont think hes upset at all only here five minutes and theres trouble already mum i really dont think i upset him maybe hell just be more careful in future and maybe well have to find someone else wholl do our shopping for us and give the place a good dust and a vacuum every now and then fat chance of that im sure hell be fine well i just hope youll apologize next time you see him apologize yes you as good as called the man a thief fine said banks raising his hands in surrender ill apologize his mother gave another disapproving little sniff id better see to those pork chops then she strode off into the kitchen and shut the door behind her the coach and horses about a hundred yards away on the main road was one of those pubs that had hardly changed at all in the past forty years or so true theyd got in a jukebox and a few video machines and the brewery had forked out for a minor facelift sometime in the eighties hoping to pull in a younger freerspending crowd but it didnt take the people who drank at the coach and horses had for the most part been drinking there most of their lives and their fathers had supped there before them though there were few young people to be seen it still managed to be a warm and lively pub banks noticed as he walked in with his father just after eight oclock that night the steamed pudding and custard still weighing heavy in his stomach his father had managed the walk without too much puffing and wheezing which he put down to having stopped smoking two years ago banks who had only stopped that summer still felt frequent and powerful urges arthur arthur come on lad come on over it was geoff salisbury he was sitting at a table with an elderly couple banks didnt recognize and two other men in their sixties he remembered from his previous visit they cleared a little space when banks and his father walked over to join them my shout said geoff name your poison no said banks still standing im the visitor let me buy the first round that got no argument so banks wandered off to the bar he hardly had to fight his way through the crowds of impatient drinkers the bartender the same one banks remembered when he had last been in the coach that summer nodded a curt greeting and proceeded to pull the pints when banks carried the tray back to the table his father was already talking football with one of his old pals harry finnegan harry looked up and said hello to banks asked him how he was doing fine said banks youre looking well yourself fair to middling sorry to hear about you and that young lass of yours splitting up sandra no secrets here he wondered if they also knew about sean and the imminent baby well said banks these things happen more to his generation than theirs he realized theirs tended to stick at marriage even when all the love had gone out of it he didnt know if that was better or worse than changing wives every decade probably best not to get married at all he suspected but his mother and father still loved one another or so he believed fifty years together meant they probably didnt have much new to say to one another any more and the passion might have disappeared from their relationship years ago but they were comfortable together besides passion is transitory and infinitely transferable anyway banks believed what his parents had was stronger deeper more permanent it was what he would never get to experience with sandra growing old together he was used to the loss by now but every now and then he still felt a pang of regret for what might have been and a lump came to his throat harry introduced banks to the couple at the table dick and mavis conroy the other man jock mcfall said hello and shook hands i hear youre a leeds united supporter these days alan said harry a twinkle in his eye banks nodded for my sins not that i get the chance to go to elland road very often match of the day is usually the closest i get elland road his father said youd not be able to bloody afford it on what a copper earns son they all laughed banks laughed with them too true as the conversations went on in that vein people started to pair off dick and mavis talking to jock mcfall about the latest supermarket price wars harry and arthur banks discussing peterborough uniteds miserable performance that season banks edged his chair closer to geoff salisburys sorry about that business with the change said geoff my eyesights not what it used to be honest mistake banks nodded honest mistake no offence he said though he still wasnt convinced it was the closest he was willing to get to an apology so it would just have to do there was certainly no point in antagonizing geoff and upsetting his mother even more after all he was only down for the weekend these people had to live close to one another day in day out and if banks couldnt be around to help his parents with their shopping and housecleaning then it was a good thing geoff salisbury was how long have you lived on the estate geoff banks asked about a year where did you live before oh here and there bit of a wanderer really what made you settle down geoff laughed and shrugged my age i suppose i dont know wandering lost its appeal well theres something to be said for knowing youve always got a roof over your head there is that geoff took a stick of chewing gum from his pocket when he had unwrapped it and put it in his mouth he folded the silver paper time and time again until it was just a tiny square which he set down in the ashtray he noticed banks watching him and laughed habit he said stopped smoking five years ago and got addicted to this bloody stuff wish id stuck with cigarettes sometimes youre probably better off as you are banks said what line of work are you in odd jobs mostly what fixing things carpentry cars mostly tinkering with engines i used to be a mechanic not any more got made redundant from the last garage i worked at and i just couldnt seem to get taken on anywhere else my age i suppose again they can get young kids still wet behind the ears and pay them bugger all to do the same job i suppose so banks said so you work for yourself now i dont need much just enough to keep the wolf from the door and you help out mum and dad grand folk arthur and ida geoff said been like a mother and father to me they have if there was any irony intended in the remark geoff didnt seem aware of it how long have you known them banks asked since not long after youd left this summer they told me about that business with the missing lad terrible anyway they always said hello right from the start you know like when they saw me in the street invited me in for a cup of tea that sort of thing and with them not being well you know what i mean not as able to get around as well as they used to do i started doing them little favours just washing cleaning shopping and the like helping them out with their finances i like to help people finances paying bills on time that sort of thing they do get a bit forgetful sometimes just between you and me and taking the rent down to the council office its an awful bother for them im sure they appreciate it geoff i think they do he nodded another banks looked at his empty glass yes he said go on then one more he looked over at his father all right dad arthur banks nodded and went back to his conversation with harry finnegan the pub had filled up in the last half hour or so and banks thought he recognized some of the faces one or two people looked at him as if they knew him then decided perhaps they didnt or didnt want to banks watched geoff salisbury at the bar he seemed to know everyone he was shaking more hands and patting more backs than a politician on election day popular fellow geoff came back with the drinks and excused himself to talk to someone else banks chatted with dick and mavis for a while they wanted to know if hed helped catch the yorkshire ripper then after his second drink his father said he was tired and would like to go home you can stay if you like he said to banks no ill walk back with you im feeling a bit tired myself suit yourself they said their goodbyes and walked out into the cool autumn night it was mild for the time of year banks thought light jacket weather rather than overcoats but the leaves were changing colour winter was in the air and the weather forecast said they had a shower or two in store neither banks nor his father had anything to say on the way home but then arthur banks needed all his breath for walking bankss bedroom he had been amazed to discover that summer was almost exactly as it had been when he first left home only the wallpaper curtains and bedding had been changed the bed itself was also the same one he had had since he was about twelve as he squeezed himself between the tightly tucked sheets on his narrow bed he remembered how he used to hold the old transistor radio to his ear under the sheets listening to radio luxembourg amidst the whistles and crackles first jimmy saville playing the latest topten hit from member number elvis presley then a few years later came the pirate stations with even more static and interference john peel playing the mothers of invention jefferson airplane and country joe and the fish names from another world music so startling and raw it transcended even the poor radio reception bankss eyes were too tired and scratchy from the smoky pub to read his graham greene so he put on the cecilia bartoli cd of gluck arias and listened as he drifted towards sleep as he lay there he couldnt help but think about geoff salisbury something about the man put banks on his guard it wasnt just the wrong change that could have been an honest mistake but the manner in which he seemed to have insinuated himself into the lives of bankss parents the ease with which he breezed in and out of the house banks wouldnt be surprised if geoff had a key he switched off the cd and turned on his side trying to shake off the uneasy feeling telling himself he was being too mistrusting and that he probably only felt this way because he felt guilty he wasnt taking care of his ageing parents himself he knew he ought to be glad that someone was doing the job he only wished that someone wasnt geoff salisbury banks awoke with a start the following morning and experienced a moment of absolute panic when he had no idea who or where he was it was as if he had woken from a coma after many years all memory gone and the world around him totally changed or as if he had been abducted and had woken up in an alien spaceship but it only lasted a second or two thank god and after that he managed to orient himself and his heartbeat slowed to normal he was in his old bedroom of course the room he had slept in between the ages of twelve and eighteen it was at the back of the house and looked over back yards an alleyway and a stretch of waste ground to the north where he and his friends used to play when banks looked out of his window he noticed that the builders had moved in since his last visit and laid the foundations for yet more houses as if peterborough needed to grow any more since the midsixties when the developers decided to make it a catchment area for londons overcrowded suburbs it had done nothing but grow swamping outlying villages with housing estates and business parks the planners and promoters said it blended old and new in unique and interesting ways even so banks thought king paeda who had founded the city would turn in his grave on a saturday morning the building site was deserted concrete mixers sat idle and quiet and the thick sheets of polythene covering pallets of bricks or boards flapped in the wind it was another grand autumn morning sunshine bright blue sky and a cool wind to make everything look and feel fresh banks checked his watch it was after nine oclock and he was surprised he had slept so long and so deeply he couldnt remember having any dreams at all he listened for sounds of life from downstairs and thought he could hear talking on the radio and dishes rattling in the sink they were up desperate for tea or coffee banks dressed quickly and made his way downstairs in the living room his father looked up from his paper and grunted morning son morning dad banks replied glancing out of the window to make sure his car was still there it was his fathers newspaper rustled back into position and the local radio station according to the dj was about to play a request for memories are made of this by val doonican for mrs patricia gaitskell of wisteria drive stamford jesus thought banks he could have been caught in a time warp while he slept back to the bside of perhaps that was why he had felt so disorientated the minute he awoke he walked through to the kitchen where his mother washing the breakfast dishes gave him a cursory glance and said well youve decided to get up at last have you it was exactly what she used to say when he was a teenager and liked to lie in bed most of the morning the only thing that saved him from seriously doubting his sanity was the little television on the kitchen table showing a breakfast programme that hadnt been there all those years ago nor had breakfast television banks made some comment about having had a long drive and put on the kettle want a cup of tea he asked his mother no thanks we had ours ages ago well you could have another she gave him a withering look and he busied himself looking for the tea bags telling himself that his parents really werent being especially nasty to him they had their routine it just took a little getting used to theyre where theyve always been his mother told him that didnt help much as he couldnt remember where theyd always been a terracotta jar in the cupboard with tea engraved on the front looked promising but it turned out to be empty beside it however banks found a jar of instant coffee might as well he thought as long as you convince yourself its a different drink not really coffee at all then it doesnt taste too bad the kettle boiled and banks made himself a cup of instant coffee specks of undissolved powder floated on the surface no matter how much he stirred it dont you want any breakfast his mother asked drying her hands on her pinafore we got some sugar puffs in for you specially you always used to like sugar puffs when i was about twelve thought banks ill give them a miss this morning he said maybe tomorrow he wandered into the living room again his mother not far behind val doonican had given way to the searchers singing some day were gonna love again an improvement banks thought funny how the searchers were exactly the kind of pop rubbish his parents dismissed thirtyfive years ago but now they were as acceptable as val doonican banks needed a newspaper to complete his morning ritual his father was still buried deep in the daily mail which being a labour man he only read so he could find things to complain about the mail wasnt bankss kind of paper anyway no real meat on its bones especially at the weekend he needed something with a bit more writing and fewer pictures like the independent or the guardian im off to the newsagents for a paper he announced anything i can get for you youll be lucky if theyve got any left at this time his mother said his father just grunted banks took their responses as a no and set off in the house next door the upstairs windows were all open and music thudded out it definitely wasnt val doonican or the searchers more like nine inch nails or metallica banks studied the house there were no curtains on the windows and the front door was wide open as he was looking a scruffy couple walked out onto the overgrown path they looked like fred and rosemary west on acid the mans eyes in particular reminded banks of the opening of vertigo morning said banks lovely day isnt it they looked at him as if he were from mars or as if they were on it so he shrugged and walked down to the newsagents across the main road the short strip of shops there set back from the road by a stretch of tarmac had gone through dozens of changes over the years when he first moved to the estate banks remembered there had been a fish and chip shop a ladies hairdresser a butchers a greengrocers and a launderette now there was a videorental shop a takeaway pizza and tandoori place called caesars taj mahal a minimart and a unisex hair salon the only constants were the fish and chip shop which now sold takeaway chinese food too banks noticed and walkers the newsagents banks waited to cross the busy road on the other side lower down from the shops stood the remains of the old ballbearing factory the gates were chained and padlocked shut and it was surrounded by high wiremesh fencing with barbed wire on top the windows beyond covered by rusty grilles despite these security precautions most of them were broken anyway and the front of the blackened brick building was covered in colourful graffiti banks remembered when the place was in production lorries coming and going factory whistle blowing and crowds of workers waiting at the bus stop a lot of them were young women or girls scarcely out of school and he had a crush on one of them called mandy by her friends she used to stand at the bus stop smoking a faraway look in her eyes scarf done up like a turban on her head she had pale smooth skin and lips like julie christie whom banks had gone to see in darling with a couple of school friends because she did a nude scene in it they had only been fourteen or fifteen at the time but the bored woman in the ticket office at the local fleapit hardly even looked at them before issuing their one and threepennies the nude scene was terrific but he didnt understand much of the rest of the film it didnt make the same sense as billy liar did for him when he saw it only a few months later escaping a boring environment was something he could easily relate to one day mandy started wearing an engagement ring and a few weeks later she no longer stood at the bus stop with the others and he never saw her again he spent ages in his room moping and even a few years later when he bought beggars banquet and listened to factory girl he thought of her banks went into the newsagents mrs walker moved much more slowly now and the joints on her left hand were swollen arthritis by the look of it there was still a small pile of independents under the magazine rack so banks picked one up and took it to the counter youre the banks lad back again arent you she said thats me said banks i thought so my body might be falling to pieces but my minds still all right havent seen you since that business in the summer how are you doing fine thanks i see youre still soldiering on ill be here till i drop im surprised you can manage all by yourself oh ive got help some local lads help with the papers and theres geoff helps with going to wholesalers stocktaking and whatnot geoff geoff salisbury nice lad well i say lad but hes probably your age or older always there when you need him is geoff and with a smile on his face too theres not too many folk you can say that about these days true enough banks agreed so the ubiquitous geoff salisbury had his feet under mrs walkers table too still he did say he did odd jobs and banks assumed mrs walker paid him for his help he had to make a living somehow it didnt seem that one could go far around the estate though without finding some traces of its patron saint geoff bloody salisbury the bell jangled and someone else walked into the shop banks halfexpected it to be salisbury himself but when he turned he was gobsmacked by who he saw it was kay summerville and looking hardly a day older than when he had last seen her thirty years ago that was an exaggeration of course her eyes had gathered a few crows feet and the long blonde hair that still cascaded over her shoulders now showed evidence of dark roots but she still had her figure and her looks a hoarse kay was about all he could manage she seemed equally stunned alan are you two going to stand there gawping at one another all afternoon or are you going to step aside young man and let the lady get what shes come for said mrs walker of course banks moved aside kay smiled she was wearing a thin white tshirt under a blue denim jacket and hiphugging blue jeans the hips looked as if they were worth hugging she caught him looking at her and gave him a shy smile packet of polo mints please mrs walker and she turned to the magazine rack and picked out a copy of marie claire and ill take this too banks stood by the door and loitered pretending to be looking at a display of anniversary cards when kay had finished she walked towards him walk back with you he said she did a little curtsy why thank you kind sir banks laughed he had been sixteen when he had first met kay and just about to go into the lower sixth kay had been fifteen about to enter her o level year her family had just moved up from north london and banks had seen her walking along the street in her blue jeans and orange jacket or in her school uniform white blouse maroon jacket grey skirt probably just a couple of inches too short for the principals liking pouty lips pale skin head in the air and her long blonde hair trailing halfway down her back she had seemed unobtainable ethereal like mandy from the factory and if truth be told like most of the women or girls banks lusted after but one day they met in the newsagents just like today both wanting the latest issue of new musical express there was only one copy left so banks being the gentleman let kay take it they walked back to the estate together chatting about pop music both were cream fans upset about the band splitting up that summer both loved canned heats on the road again and hated mary hopkinss those were the days kay said she would lend her nme to banks when she had finished with it he asked her when that would be and she said probably saturday emboldened he went on and asked if shed like to go to the pictures with him on saturday night he could have dropped in his tracks when she said yes they went to see here we go round the mulberry bush on a double bill with ill never forget whatshisname and that was it the start of bankss first serious relationship i heard about your mother banks said holding the door for her im sorry kay pushed a stray tress of hair from her forehead thank you shed been ill for a long time she was riddled with cancer and her heart wasnt strong i know its a cliché but in this case it really was a blessing is that why youre up here yes ive got to deal with the house before the council relets it the rents paid up till the end of the month so i thought id take a few days and get it all sorted you its mum and dads golden wedding tomorrow thats marvellous it is pretty remarkable isnt it fifty years what kind of work do you do investment banking oh kay laughed yes thats usually the reaction quite a conversation stopper im sorry its just i dont she smiled at him its ok most people dont even the ones who do it what about you i seem to remember mum saying you had something to do with the police true detective chief inspector cid major crimes well well well i am impressed just like morse it was bankss turn to laugh except im not on telly im real and im still alive like your job its usually a conversation stopper you must be the first person who hasnt jumped a mile when i told them what i do for a living no skeletons in your closet she wiggled her eyebrows thats for me to know and you to find out they reached bankss parents house and stopped on the pavement both a little awkward embarrassed it was one of those moments banks felt like the one thirty years ago when he had asked her out for the first time look he said seeing as were both up here this weekend would you like to go out tonight maybe find a country pub have a bite to eat or a drink do a bit of catching up i mean bring your husband by all means you know kay smiled at his discomfort sorry theres only me she said and yes id love to pick me up at half past seven good great i mean banks grinned ok then see you this evening banks watched kay walk away and he could have sworn she had a bit of a spring in her step he definitely had one in his which couldnt be dampened even by the sight of geoff salisbury talking to his mother in the hall when he opened the front door morning alan geoff said have a good time last night fine said banks that the summerville girl you were talking to yes said banks were old friends geoff frowned i was sorry to hear about her poor mother anyway must dash just a passing visit he turned back to ida banks right then mrs b dont you fret ill pick up everything we need for tomorrow and ill pop around in the morning and do a bit of tidying and vacuuming for you hows that its all right said banks i can do that dont be silly his mother chided him you dont know one end of a vacuum cleaner from the other which might have been true at one time but certainly wasnt any more thatll be just dandy geoff she said handing him a plastic card which he put quickly in his pocket i know we can always rely on you it was too late to argue with a smile and a wave geoff salisbury was halfway down the path whistling colonel bogey as he went i mean it said banks anything needs doing just ask me his mother patted his arm i know son she said you mean well but geoffs well were used to having him around he knows where everything is does he indeed thought banks by the way he asked what was that you just gave him what you know the card oh yes thats the abbeylink card hell need some cash wont he if hes going to get the food and drink in for tomorrow banks almost choked you mean he knows your pin number well of course he does silly a fat lot of use the card would be to him without it shaking her head she edged past banks towards the living room and whats this about you and kay summerville she asked turning didnt you two used to go out together that was a long time ago actually were going to have dinner together tonight his mothers face dropped but i was going to make us toadinthehole your favourite true banks had once expressed an enthusiasm for toadinthehole when he was about fourteen im sorry he said but its the only chance well get to catch up well his mother said that familiar hurt harddoneby tone in her voice i suppose if thats really what you want to do i must say she always seemed like a nice lass her mother and me werent close at all just to say hello to in passing like but you tell her shes welcome to drop by tomorrow for the party id like to offer her my condolences ill ask her said banks then he hurried upstairs with his bedroom window open banks could hear the polythene from the building site flapping in the breeze and the cars whooshing by on the main road he could also hear a dull bass rumbling from next door along with the occasional shout and bang their back garden he noticed was full of rubbish like a tip broken furniture rocks a dismantled bicycle maybe there was even a body or two buried there his knees cracked as he squatted to read the spines of the books in the old glassfronted bookcase there they were a crosssection of his early years reading starting with the large illustrated black beauty which his mother had read to him when he was small old beano dandy and rupert annuals and noddy books the originals where noddy and big ears slept together hung out with golliwog and gay meant cheerful he must have kept enid blyton in luxury almost singlehanded he thought as he had moved on to the famous five and the secret seven then came his high school reading billy bunter jennings and william followed by war stories such as biggles the wooden horse the guns of navarone and camp on blood island next to these were several editions of the pan book of horror stories from a phase he went through in his teens along with some h p lovecraft and m r james there wasnt much crime fiction but he did still have a few dogeared old saint paperbacks the father brown stories and a complete sherlock holmes the james bond books were all there too of course and a few sexton blakes there were also history books the kind with lots of illustrations some oxford and penguin anthologies of poetry and those childrens illustrated encyclopaedias that came out with a letter a week none of which hed got beyond c or d in addition on the bottom shelf there were books about his many hobbies including photography coins birds stamps and astronomy and several observer books of cars aircraft geology trees music and pond life hed seen these old editions in secondhand book shops and some of them were worth a bit now maybe he should take them back up to yorkshire with him he thought would that upset his parents were his books and his room some sort of virtual umbilical cord that was all that tied him to them now it was a depressing thought one book stood out sitting between enid blytons the river of adventure and the mountain of adventure was a used orangespined penguin edition of lady chatterleys lover a reprint with richard hoggarts introduction curious banks picked it out he didnt remember buying it and was surprised when he opened it up and saw written on the flyleaf kay summerville london june th banks remembered that day well smiling he put it aside he would give it back to her tonight the more he thought about his date with kay the more he looked forward to it not only was she an extremely attractive woman she was also intelligent and she shared some of his past with him he didnt imagine the date would lead to anything of a sexual nature he certainly wasnt out to seduce her but you never knew he wondered how he would feel about that michelle hart was on holiday in tuscany besides they had made no commitments and michelle always seemed to be holding back on the verge of ending the tenuous relationship they did have banks didnt know why but he sensed she had deep and painful secrets she didnt want to share it seemed that all the women he had met since parting with sandra including annie cabbot back up in yorkshire shied away from intimacy banks stood up and looked down at the books well there they all were for what they were worth like those strata of different coloured rock or the layers of antiquities at an archaeological dig his mother called up alan are you coming down lunch is on the table its potted meat sandwiches banks sighed coming he shouted i just have to wash my hands ill be right there true he had once loved potted meat the same way he had liked sugar puffs and toadinthehole when he was a teenager but he hadnt touched the stuff in years the people next door were out in force banks noticed on his way to see mrs green after lunch there was an unmarked delivery van outside their house and two strapping young lads were carrying what looked like a fiftyinch television set up the path it hardly looked as if it would fit through the door fred and rosemary stood on the lawn rubbing their hands together in glee practically salivating at the sight and their various children aged between about five and fifteen milled about beside them banks hadnt seen so many shaved heads since the nit nurse had visited his school he tried wishing them good morning again but everyone was far too intent on the imminent television even to notice him he would have bet a pound to a penny it was stolen the wind had picked up even more banks noticed bringing a few fastflying clouds and a chill with it and there was a smell of rain in the air banks zipped his leather jacket all the way up and walked the short distance to the close where mrs green lived she answered bankss knock and expressed delight at seeing him again she had certainly aged thickened at the waist drooped at the bosom but she had lost none of her sprightliness and she fussed around making tea and bringing out a plate of scones her living room was sparsely decorated plain cream wallpaper no prints or paintings and a few framed family photographs stood on the mantelpiece hows tony doing banks asked ive always regretted we didnt manage to stay in touch these things happen said mrs green people drift apart over the years its only natural it doesnt mean they dont share good memories though i suppose not anyway tonys doing fine he lives in vancouver now you know hes a tax lawyer this is him about two years ago she picked up one of the photographs and handed it to banks it showed the smile he remembered the mischief in the eyes surrounded by a bald head on a pudgy body in brightly coloured shorts and a red tshirt tony stood with a relaxed smiling woman banks took to be his wife and two bored and or coollooking teenage children they were on a beach and there were cloudtopped mountains in the background ill let him know you were asking about him mrs green said please do banks replaced the photo on the mantelpiece ive been to toronto but never vancouver you should go if you get a chance bill and i visited him there five years ago its a lovely city im sure tony and carol would be happy to have you stop with them theyve got a big house maybe i will said banks we dont see you down here very often do we well said banks feeling guilty he hadnt made time for mrs green on his previous visit i keep pretty busy up north you know how it is he sipped some tea your parents are really very proud of you you know banks almost choked on his tea where had that come from mrs green considered him through her tortoiseshell glasses you might not think so she said and they might not admit it but they are especially since that business last summer what makes you say that oh dont think i dont know about your differences they never did approve of what you chose to do with your life did they your dad thought youd joined the enemy and your mother thought youd let her down that was clear enough to anyone who knew them was it oh yes and i knew where they were coming from of course what do you mean she smiled oh dont be so obtuse alan you always did have that infuriating habit of pretending not to see the obvious you wouldnt have got far in your chosen career if you couldnt even add together the basics you had all the opportunities they had none they had to settle for their lot in life and the thatcher years were pretty tough around here how do you think your dad felt when he saw coppers laying into workers on the news miners whatever they were they were still working men like himself how do you think he felt when he saw the police in riot gear waving their overtime pay in the faces of men whod lost everything do you think he actually enjoyed working at that factory every day of his life id say it was a cause for celebration when they made him redundant but for him it was a blow to his pride and your mother cleaning up other folks messes they made a lot of sacrifices for you so you could do better than they had and what did you do you joined the police force you must have known how people around here felt about the police id say they expect us to make sure their cars are safe and keep the muggings and gang fights to a minimum you always were a cheeky young beggar alan banks perhaps now they do but not back then i know what you mean said banks but what im telling you is they know youve done well for yourself now every time you got a promotion they told me and you should have heard the pride in their voices our alans a detective sergeant now theyd say or theyve made alan detective chief inspector now i got sick of hearing about you it just took them a long time to work it out and they dont find it easy to express it also helped that you came down on the right side last time you were here of course they always did dote on that useless brother of yours roy yes im sorry but you know ive always spoken my mind and i cant say i ever took to him sly he seemed to me twofaced always up to something behind your back you were no angel mind but you werent sly banks smiled as he buttered his scone thinking about the time he had orchestrated going to bed with kay while his parents were visiting his granny and the time he and tony green had drunk some of mr greens whisky and topped the bottle up with water whether he spotted it or not they never knew sly all kids are sly banks thought they have to be in their constant struggle with the inexplicable and unreasonable rules and regulations imposed on them by adults but banks knew how to take a compliment when he was offered one even at the expense of his brother thanks he said roy could be a bit of a handful to say the least anyway i dont see much of your mum and dad any more except when i bump into ida on the street mrs green went on thats how i knew about the golden wedding she invited me its sad though people seem to isolate themselves when they get old they dont get out as much and i dont go to the coach and horses how are they same as ever said banks mums complaining about varicose veins and her bunions but she doesnt seem to do too badly dads still got his angina but it doesnt seem any worse theres a neighbour helps out bloke called geoff salisbury know him banks couldnt swear to it but he thought mrs greens expression darkened for a moment her lips certainly tightened i know him she said banks leaned forward in his armchair you dont sound so thrilled about it cant say as i am oh hes a charmer all right is geoff salisbury bit too much of one for my liking how did you meet him he seems to have some sort of radar for all the old folks in trouble on the estate he turns up everywhere at one time or another usually when you need help what do you mean more tea please banks held out his cup you know you can smoke if you like she smiled if i let you do it when you were fifteen i can hardly stop you now youre what would it be a lot older banks put his hand to his left temple cant you tell by the grey mrs green laughed and touched her own head you call that grey it was true she had an entire head of fluffy grey hair anyway banks said remembering what mr green had died of thanks but ive stopped i wont say thats not good news if only wed all known all along what it was doing to us you were saying about geoff salisbury i was wasnt i she sat back in her chair tea and saucer resting on her lap oh you know me i tend to go off halfcocked on things id still be interested to hear your thoughts said banks to be honest i havent really taken to him myself and he seems to be spending an awful lot of time around mum and dad she waved a hand its nothing really he started coming around when bill was sick it was near the end and bill was in a wheelchair breathing from that horrible oxygen tank what did he want want nothing he never asked for a thing only to help give him his due hes a hard and willing worker and he was certainly useful at the time he fixed a few things around the house ran errands so what was the problem youll think i was imagining things not necessarily well it wasnt any one thing really just little things the wrong change or one of bills tools would go missing nothing you could really put your finger on banks remembered the short change geoff salisbury had handed his mother yesterday evening anything else ooh just listen to us said mrs green refilling her teacup im being questioned by a policeman banks smiled im sorry i didnt mean it to seem like that comes with the territory i suppose she laughed its all right alan i was only teasing but its hard to talk about it was only a feeling what feeling she clasped the collar of her frock that he was hovering like the angel of death or something listen to me now what a fool i sound you dont think geoff salisbury had anything to do with your husbands death do you of course not no its nothing like that it was a faulty valve they said on the oxygen tank she gave a harsh laugh someone told me if wed been living in america id have got millions of dollars in compensation thats probably true yes well if wed been living in america we probably wouldnt have been able to afford the medical treatment in the first place and bill would have died a lot sooner also true said banks can you explain a bit more clearly about this feeling you had im not sure i felt as if he were you know waiting waiting in the wings until bill died for what i dont know so he could take over more maybe manipulate me more banks smiled at her he obviously didnt know who he was dealing with she didnt smile back youd be surprised how easy it is to take advantage when people are vulnerable she looked at him or maybe you wouldnt you probably see a lot of it in your job anyway i felt as if he was hovering waiting for bill to die so that he could be more in control but what could possibly have been in it for him i dont know like i said i was probably imagining things anyway i dont suppose you won the lottery recently never bought a ticket and you dont have a million pounds hidden in the mattress or anything she laughed wish i had no theres nothing really bills insurance policy oldage pension im not complaining mind you its enough to get by on what happened after bill died i gave geoff salisbury his marching orders i was nice about it i thanked him for his help but said i was perfectly capable of managing by myself and id prefer it if he didnt come around any more it wasnt that i couldnt still have used the sort of help he had to offer but i just didnt feel comfortable having him around maybe i was being oversensitive as well as ungrateful i dont know said banks as i said i havent taken to him myself and im not sure why youll be feeling guilty because hes looking after your parents while youre not there to do it perhaps partly yes but theres more i dont trust him i dont know what hes up to but i dont trust him maybe its coppers instinct well i can tell you one thing for a start youll get no thanks around these parts for going after geoff salisbury popular is he to hear some talk youd think the sun shone out of his well you know what banks smiled i think i can guess how did he take your rejection mrs green shrugged well enough i suppose at least he didnt bother me after that oh i see him around now and then and he always smiles and says hello as if nothing ever happened its just that what oh probably me being silly again but it feels just skin deep as if underneath it all if you were just to strip off the surface that well youd find something else entirely under there something very nasty indeed banks decided to pay a quick visit to the city centre that afternoon he needed to pick up a couple of things from the shops for tomorrow such as a nice anniversary card and some candles he asked his parents if they needed anything but they said no implying banks thought that geoff salisbury was taking care of everything so off he went rather than search the side streets for a vacant parking space he parked in the short stay behind the town hall and walked through to bridge street of course the city centre had changed quite a lot since his schooldays most cities had changed a lot in the past thirty years but peterborough more so than many others gone were the small record shop in the back alley where he used to buy a new single nearly every week and lps whenever he could afford them usually only christmas and birthdays and the musty used book shop where he used to browse for hours among the dogeared paperbacks the one where the sourfaced woman behind the counter used to watch him like a hawk the entire time he was in there the openair market had closed some of the pubs he used to drink in when he was sixteen and seventeen had disappeared and new ones had sprung up an old cinema after several years as a bingo hall was now a nightclub department stores had disappeared moved or been given facelifts cathedral square was now a pedestrian precinct only yards from the queensgate centre stood the ancient cathedral itself throughout bankss childhood the majestic structure had simply been there it didnt dominate the city the way york minster did and like most of the other local kids he had paid it scant attention unless school projects and organized visits demanded otherwise after all what kid was interested in a boring old cathedral where boring old farts had gone to pray and where even more boring ones were buried but now he found himself admiring the west front with its three soaring gothic arches flanked by twinpinnacled towers the stone creamcoloured in the autumn sunshine in the queensgate centre banks bought an expensive golden anniversary card and some gold candles then he browsed around for a while and picked up a cd he thought kay would enjoy listening to on their way to dinner it was one oldie he didnt have and he had been aware of the gap in his collection for some time he looked at his watch four oclock he thought he just had time for a quick walk by the river before driving back to his parents house as he walked down bridge street past the magistrates court and the police station he realized that he hadnt been able to put geoff salisbury out of his thoughts completely something about the man was still nagging away at him mrs green had been partly right of course he felt guilty that geoff was doing all the things for his ageing parents that a good and dutiful son ought to be doing but also as the astute mrs green had realized there was more to it than that if nothing worse he certainly got the impression that geoff salisbury was a petty thief he glanced towards the old customs house with its light on top to guide the ships navigating the river nene then he made his way down to the footpath that ran along the nene way there he found a bench and away from the crowds took out his mobile and phoned the detectives room back at eastvale di annie cabbot and dc winsome jackman were on weekends at western area hq and it was annie who answered dci banks what a pleasant surprise cant leave us alone for a minute can you sir i take it youre not alone in the office thats right sir just winsome and i as per the duty roster everything all right fine business as usual couple of fights after closing time last night and a sexual assault on the east side estate weve got a man in for questioning is that all honestly were on top of it relax enjoy yourself im trying annie im trying actually i wasnt calling to check up on you im sure everythings under control i need you to do a little detective work for me detective work yes i want you to check on a name for me see if you come up with anything i dont believe it even at your parents golden wedding anniversary youre still on the job you know the rules annie we cant ignore wrongdoing whether were on or off duty oh what a load of bollocks ok go ahead banks gave her geoff salisburys name and address along with the number of his fiesta which he had memorized for good measure whats it about annie asked i dont know yet said banks probably nothing just a suspicious character in the neighbourhood i want to know if hes got form first of all then anything else you can dig up on him will do where can i get in touch with you call my mobile number ill leave it switched on banks didnt want the call arriving at his parents house if theres no answer dont worry leave a message and ill get back to you ok will do feeling vaguely guilty though he had done nothing to feel in the least bit guilty about banks put the phone in his pocket and walked back towards his car bath water was always at a premium even now they had a house with a real bathroom and banks had to be careful not to use all the hot water after a short soak and a shave he was ready not expecting to be going out on a date he hadnt brought a great selection of clothes with him so he had to settle for some casual grey cotton trousers and a blue buttondown oxford shirt he first checked the pockets of his sports jacket for car keys and wallet then slipped in the copy of lady chatterleys lover he had found in his bookcase before he went downstairs annie hadnt rung back yet and given that it was past seven on a saturday evening banks guessed she probably wouldnt until tomorrow he certainly didnt want his mobile ringing in the restaurant so he turned it off for the evening there was no real urgency about the matter anyway he just wanted to know if geoff salisbury had form here his mother said youd better take a key youll probably be late back i shouldnt think so said banks take one anyway i dont want you hammering on the door waking us up at some ungodly hour in the morning banks pocketed the key were only going out for dinner and be quiet when you do come in his mother went on you know your fathers a light sleeper the only thing banks knew was that his mother had always complained of being a light sleeper but he said nothing except goodnight and that he wouldnt be late kay came to the door in a long dark loose skirt white blouse tucked in the waistband soft suede jacket on top banks complimented her on her appearance feeling for all the world like that awkward teenager taking her to the abc to see here we go round the mulberry bush the film had only exacerbated his teenage angst about living in a provincial town and a new town at that but the music mostly by traffic and the spencer davis group was as good as it got and whats more a young and lovely judy geeson starred in it the main attraction of the evening of course had been kay summerville there on the back row with the other wouldbe lovers banks had somehow found the bottle to put his arm around kay and she hadnt seemed to mind after a while though his arm had started to ache like hell then he had felt it going numb but he was damned if he was going to remove it after all the courage it had taken to put it there in the first place some of his school friends had told him that they had unbuttoned their girlfriends blouses and felt their breasts in that very cinema but banks hadnt the nerve to try that not on their first time out together on their way home they had held hands and necked for a while in the bus shelter and that was as far as things had gone that night banks remembered it all vividly as kay arranged herself next to him in the car the warm slightly hazy evening smearing the city lights noise from a nearby pub the fruity chemical taste of her lipstick the softness of her neck just below her ear the way it made him tingle and turn hard as he touched her the warmth of her small breasts crushed against him any ideas kay asked ideas what ideas about where to go im almost as much a stranger to these parts as you are oh that i thought id just drive out fotheringhay way its not too far and we ought to be able to find somewhere decent to eat kay laughed itll probably be called the mary queen of scots or something she certainly did get around that woman didnt have much choice did she what a miserable existence never wanted to be royalty kay shook her head not me im happy being a commoner banks slipped the blind faith cd he had bought that afternoon into the stereo and stevie winwoods had to cry today came out as crisp and heartrending as the day it was cut thats not kay began then she put her head back my god i havent heard that in decades you still listen to this sort of stuff a lot of old sixties and early seventies stuff yes said banks i reckon those eight or nine years or so between love me do and the time everyone died produced about the best rock well ever hear thats a very sweeping statement what about punk too much noise and not enough talent the clash were all right though roxy music bowie rem the pretenders there are exceptions to every rule kay laughed and what else these days im a hiphop fan myself what about you kay nudged him in the ribs seriously mostly jazz and classical but i still listen to a fair bit of rock and folk sheryl crow lucinda williams beth orton im afraid i dont listen to much at all these days said kay dont have the time i have the radio on sometimes while im in the bath but i hardly notice whats being played i suppose if i had to pick something id choose a string quartet or some sort of chamber music schubert perhaps nothing wrong with old franz what about this place by the time the band had got to cant find my way home one of bankss favourites he had wandered off the main road and they were passing through a small village of grey stone thatched cottages clustered around a broad green lights shone behind curtains and here and there a television set flickered the pub was not called the mary queen of scots but a far more lowly fox and hounds banks parked the car out front and turned off the music banks and kay ducked as they walked under the low beam of the door already the place was busy emanating that rosy glow of a village pub popular with the city crowd they went up to the bar where banks ordered a pint of bitter and kay a vodka and tonic then a young girl who looked no more than about sixteen seated them in the dining area and pointed out that the evenings menu was written on the blackboard by the window just one glance told banks theyd come to the right sort of place a wide selection of real ale and good food beyond basic pub fare but nothing too ambitious the noise level was perfect only the buzz of conversation from other tables the thud of darts in the board at the opposite end sometimes accompanied by a mild oath or a cheer and the sounds of the cash register cheers said banks when theyd sat down and had a good look at the blackboard to to to times gone by said kay to times gone by they clinked glasses and each took a sip banks felt the need for a cigarette partly from nerves and partly from habit he was in a pub after all but he rode out the craving and soon forgot about it do you remember that concert he asked kays eyes sparkled of course i do well not so much the music i mean if you asked me i couldnt tell you what they played or who else was on but the occasion yes how could i forget my mother wouldnt let me out of the door for a week afterwards except to go to school banks laughed mine too on june earlier on the day kay had bought lady chatterleys lover at a secondhand book shop on charing cross road banks and kay had taken the train to london for the free blind faith concert in hyde park through a combination of circumstances partly to do with going off to smoke dope in a flat in chelsea with some people they met they had missed their train back and ended up getting home very early the following morning needless to say parental recriminations had been severe so said kay tell me about the last thirty years i suppose youre married children two children one girl at university and one boy in a rock band and dont say it serves me right kay laughed heaven forbid maybe hell make enough money to keep you in your old age thats what im banking on what about your wife the waitress came over notepad in hand have you decided yet banks glanced at kay who nodded and ordered the sole and salad banks went for venison medallions in port and mushroom sauce more drinks banks looked at his halffull glass and shook his head kay asked for a glass of white wine with her meal you were saying kay went on when the waitress had gone away about your wife banks paused im divorced how long two years shes already remarried kay whistled thats pretty fast usually youd expect some sort of well i dont know period of mourning thats not the term i was looking for but i suppose itll do it took me by surprise too i cant say im in any hurry to get married again is there someone banks thought of michelle and annie and experienced another pang of guilt as he said no one serious its too soon for that uhhuh you me what are you still married not for the past five years im sorry you neednt be he ran away with his secretary that must have been tough at the time yes id say it was a bit of a blow to the old selfesteem she was much younger than me of course but im over it now someone new no one special kay smiled and gave a slight blush as she picked up her glass and sipped it was the same smile and blush banks remembered from all those years ago when he had first asked her out what had happened to them he asked himself why had they split up but he knew the answer it had been his fault their meals arrived and kays glass of wine soon followed banks stuck with his one pint as he had to drive how are you coping about your mother he asked after they had both eaten a couple of mouthfuls not bad i think ive got most of it done except the cleaning she smiled never was my strong suit not even in my own home ill probably do it tomorrow anyway a local dealers coming to take away the furniture on monday morning didnt offer much for it but what the hell the rest is already packed and ready to go to my house she shook her head it was difficult going through someones life like that your own mothers memories do you know i found letters to her from a young man this was before she and dad met of course but they were love letters quite spicy too one or two of them it is hard to imagine your parents having lives of their own isnt it kay nodded there was lots of other stuff too old photos me when i was a kid at the seaside letters from me too when i was at university full of energy and ambition tears glistened in her eyes and now kay wiped away the tears oh i suppose im still ambitious enough i work practically all the hours god sends i know i neglected mum especially after dad died banks remembered hearing that kays father had been killed ten years ago in a car accident an accident her mother survived it had been the talk of the estate for weeks so his mother had told him kay laughed and made a dismissive gesture i dont know maybe theres something freudian about it i always was daddys little girl but my career really started to take off around then too life was exciting at last lots of travel parties financial success i hardly ever made time to come home and help mum even when she was ill for crying out loud i was in zurich when she died i barely managed to get back in time for the funeral some daughter some mother too even my kids say they never see me kids three girls all married im a grandmother alan can you believe it a bloody grandmother its hard to believe looking at you she blushed and smiled again why thank you ill tell you though it takes a lot of hard work and a lot of investment in potions and salves these days remember when we were kids we thought we were immortal that wed be young for ever true enough banks agreed im still waiting for the wisdom thats supposed to come with age me too they paused to eat in comfortable silence banks watched kay break off flakes of moist sole with the edge of her fork his venison was good tender and tasty he decided he could risk one more drink and asked the waitress to bring him a glass of red wine how are your parents kay asked fine oh that reminds me mum asked me to invite you to drop by tomorrow if you want kay nodded slowly yes all right that would be nice about six ok fine just for half an hour or so kay frowned you know there is one thing that puzzles me a bit about mum she said oh its nothing really but i was going through her finances yesterday and i noticed shed withdrawn a hundred pounds from the cash machine the day she died but i cant find it theres only about six or seven pounds in her purse and she wasnt the type to hide her money under the mattress the little scar beside bankss right eye began to itch maybe she had bills to pay or she owed it to someone neither a lender nor a borrower be that was mums motto and all her bills had been paid no its a mystery what do you have to say o great detective i still think theres probably a logical explanation probably the other thing that puzzles me though is how did she get it what do you mean well she was bedridden for the last few days there was a nurse on call twentyfour hours a day of course and dr grenville dropped by quite often but i just dont see how she could even have got to the cash machine the itch got stronger banks scratched the side of his eye have you ever heard of a fellow called geoff salisbury he asked her kay frowned the name sounds vaguely familiar i think he introduced himself to me at the funeral a neighbour why oh nothing said banks nothing important dessert would you like some music on kay asked they were back at her parents house and banks had accepted her invitation to come in for a nightcap a halfbottle of medicinal brandy that kay had found while tidying out the kitchen cupboards they drank it out of cracked teacups that she had been about to put in the dustbin sure said banks kay walked over to the old stereo system lets see she said flipping through a box of lps i packed these last night but i didnt really pay much attention theres probably not a lot of choice dad only liked the stuff he used to listen to in the war and mum wasnt much interested in music at all as you can see they dont own a cd player i think the last lp they bought was in banks went over and joined her looking at the oldfashioned covers at least he could read what was written on the backs of them unlike the tiny print on cds thats after he said pointing to beatles for sale that must be one of mine kay said i didnt even notice it banks flipped open the cover written inside in tiny blue ballpoint over the photograph were some words they were hard to make out but he thought they said kay summerville loves alan banks banks passed it to kay who blushed and put it away i lent it to susan fish she said the sneaky devil i didnt know shed done that she pulled out another lp ah this will do fine the needle crackled as it hit the groove a sound that gave banks an unexpected frisson of delight and nostalgia and then billie holiday started singing solitude couldnt do much better he said dance kay asked i dont know said banks remember the vicar wouldnt allow dancing at the youth club because he said it led to sex kay laughed yes i remember then she was in his arms billie was singing about solitude and they were doing what passed for dancing a wise man that vicar said banks about an hour later as he lay back on the sofa billie holiday long finished a naked kay half on top of him her head resting on his chest fingertips trailing languorously over his skin it had been good no doubt much better than their youthful fumblings which he could scarcely remember now though there had been something a little melancholy and desperate about it as if both had been straining to capture something that eluded them what happened to us kay asked all those years ago we were just kids what did we know i suppose so but have you ever wondered what would have happened you know if we hadnt of course i have and i dont know its hard for me to imagine a life without sandra and the kids i know that i mean even though it ended badly me and keith had some good times and the kids are marvellous its just a game imagining you know sometimes ive been places or experienced things and thought id have liked you there to share it you have yes havent you ever felt the same i cant say i have said banks who had she nudged him in the ribs bastard theres something i never told you before banks said stroking her silky blonde hair and touching the soft skin on her neck just below her ear and you want to tell me now yes are you sure thats a good idea the timing seems right why no particular reason kay shifted position ok go ahead you know that first time when my parents were out and you came over to the house the day wed decided we were finally going to do it how could i forget i was about to lose my virginity i was scared silly me too on both counts nervous as hell banks remembered that as the months went on he and kay had graduated from kissing in the bus shelter to touching above the waist first with clothing intact then under her jumper with only the thin bra between his hands and her bare swollen flesh after a few weeks of that and much trouble fumbling with the clasp that held the thing on he got beyond the bra to the unimaginably firm and tender mounds beneath they had been going out nearly a year before the subject of moving to below the waist came up and both were understandably a bit nervous about it this might have been the swinging sixties when kids were making love openly at woodstock but banks and kay were young unsophisticated provincial kids and the antics of drugtaking pop stars and freeloving hippies seemed as fantastic as hollywood films but they had done it well banks went on i had to go and get some you know durex rubber johnnies yes i suppose you did do you know i never really thought about that well i couldnt very well go to the local chemists or the barbers could i they knew me there someone would have been bound to tell my parents kay propped herself on one elbow and leaned over him her nipple hard against his chest he could smell white wine and cheap brandy on her breath see sparks of light dancing in her dark blue eyes so what did you do where did you go she asked i walked miles and miles to the other side of town and found a barbers where i was certain no one would recognize me kay giggled oh how sweet im not finished yet go on do you know how the old barbers shops had a sort of hallway with a counter between the outer and inner door nice and private where you could buy shampoo and razor blades and stuff and rubber johnnies and rubber johnnies i remember my dad used to take me to the barbers with him sometimes when i was a little girl right banks went on well as i said id walked halfway to cambridge and there i was bold as brass outside a barbers on a street where not a soul could possibly know who i was kay smiled what happened she moved her head and her hair tickled his chest well wouldnt you know it but this particular establishment didnt have a discreet sales area oh no i opened the front door and i found myself standing right by the barbers chair he was giving a bloke a shave i remember and the place was full of grown men i mean every chair in the waiting area was taken and i swear that the minute i walked in there they all looked up from their newspapers and every eye was on me my god what did you do what could i do id gone too far to turn back i stood my ground and i said in as deep a voice as i could manage packet of three please kay put her hand to her mouth to hold back the laughter oh no she said youre joking no word of a lie what did he say the barber not a word he stopped midshave straightblade razor in his hand and he went to his cabinet and got them for me but you should have heard the other buggers laugh and cheer youd think peterborough united had won a game i went red as a beet kay burst into a fit of laughter and couldnt stop banks started laughing with her holding her against his chest and after a while laughter turned to lust it was after two oclock when banks slipped the key into the door of his parents house and turned the lock as quietly as he could he shut the door slowly behind him without making much noise and made sure the chain and bolt were on the stairs creaked a little as he tiptoed up to bed he couldnt very well go and brush his teeth as he would have to put the bathroom light on and the tap would make a noise he thought he could just about manage to undress and crawl into bed in the dark the bed would creak too but that couldnt be helped fortunately hed had the foresight to use the toilet before leaving kays the minute he got to the landing he heard his mother muttering something to his father who muttered something back he couldnt catch the words but knew they were about him how late he was he felt himself blushing christ it really didnt matter how quiet he had tried to be shed been lying awake until he came home just like she used to do when he was a teenager despite his late night banks woke early on sunday morning to the sound of rain blowing in sharp gusts against his bedroom window the rest of the house was quiet and he didnt think his parents were awake yet his first thought on finding consciousness was to wonder what the hell he and kay had thought they were up to last night but the more he remembered the less he regretted blame it on billie holiday if you will on dancing the old estate and the romance of the past but whatever it was it was something special and he refused to feel guilty he only hoped kay felt the same way in the damp grey of dawn two memories assailed him almost simultaneously as he got out of bed and went over to the wardrobe for his overnight bag that he had forgotten to give kay her old copy of lady chatterleys lover and that he was certain he had seen a tiny neatly folded square of silver paper in the bathroom waste bin perhaps mrs summerville had taken to chewing gum in her final days though he doubted it or maybe kay did though he had seen no evidence of it last night and he remembered that she had bought mints at the newsagents not gum which left him with the strongest suspicion that geoff salisbury had been there sometime over the past few weeks leaving banks little doubt as to where the hundred pounds had gone what to do about him that was the question banks stretched as he pulled out his bag and decided to start the day dressed simply in jeans and a poloneck sweater he would change for the party later today was his parents big day and roy was due to come up from london banks resolved to be nice to roy for his parents sake as banks put his bag back in the wardrobe he noticed some cardboard boxes on the far side on his previous visit he had found some old records and diaries which were still there but now it looked as if there was more curious he opened the other door and lifted a box out the flaps were shut but not sealed and written across the top in his mothers inimitable scrawl was his name alan more childhood stuff then on top he found yet more old school reports from the grammar school this time most of them urging him to try harder and assuring him he could do better if he only put his shoulder to the wheel etc the reports were handwritten in black ink and banks occasionally had difficulty reading the comments he remembered some of the teachers names mr newman mr phelps mr hawtry but most of them were a blur along with the reports was a class photograph dated may there they all were three rows of teenage boys in their school uniforms banks remembered several of the faces steve hill paul major dave grenfell his best friends then tony green john mcleod the school bully and ian marston who so bankss mother had told him committed suicide seven or eight years ago after his courier business failed the rest of them he hardly remembered except for the odd feature here and there such as a long freckled face a big nose or prominent ears but he couldnt put a name to them he had met up with dave grenfell and paul major on his previous visit and he had found out then that steve hill had died of lung cancer but what had become of everyone else he had no idea others would be dead some would be dying some would be successful some would be failures some would be criminals many would be divorced there was one angrylooking kid glaring into the camera with a cocky expression on his face black hair just a little bit too long tie slightly askew top button undone against school regulations himself even more of a mystery than all the rest next came a few school exercise books full of sums and compositions one of them contained some poems banks had written when he went through that stage of adolescence in which poetry was an acceptable means of expression as long as you kept it to yourself it was with excruciating embarrassment that he looked over them again now with the autumn rain starting to spatter against his bedroom window there were lines about the awkwardness of being an adolescent love poems to julie christie and judy geeson poems about how phony the world was none of them rhymed of course nor were any overly concerned with metrics the lines simply ended where he had decided to end them for no other reason than that it looked like poetry on the page there were no capital letters either still banks reflected from what he had seen that wasnt a hell of a lot different from the sort of thing most published poets did today awful lines and images jumped out at him such as i feel like a corpsein the coffin of your mind what on earth had prompted him to write that about what he couldnt even remember whose mind was supposed to be the coffin and then there was a poem marked for kay in which these immortal lines appeared i skimmed across your life like a pebble on the waters surface i sank quickly the tide went out what had he been thinking of there was another image about her being nakedon a sheepskinby the crackling fire but as far as banks could remember they had never lain on a sheepskin rug and electric fires which everyone on the estate had didnt crackle poetic licence he remembered that first time up in this same room while his parents were out the event was awkward and far less momentous for both of them than his imagination had convinced him it would be but it went well enough in the end and they decided they liked it and would certainly try again they got better and better over the next few months stealing an hour or two here and there while parents were absent once they almost got caught when kays mother came home sooner than expected from a dental appointment they just managed to get their clothes on and tidy up the bed in time to tell her theyd been listening to records though judging by the expression on mrs summervilles face when she saw her daughters dishevelled hair banks didnt think she was convinced kay told him later that that very evening she had got a lecture about the dangers of teenage pregnancy and what men think of women who havent saved themselves for marriage though no overt mention was made of banks or that afternoons events and nobody tried to stop them seeing one another smiling at the memory banks slipped the exercise book of poetry into his overnight bag determined to remember to feed it to the fire when he got back to his gratly cottage as he moved it a newspaper cutting slipped out from between some of the unfilled pages it was a report in the local paper on the disappearance of graham marshall a school friend of bankss and the reason for his visit home in the summer alongside the article was a photograph of graham with his fair hair melancholy expression and pale face like some fin de siècle poet banks moved on to the bottom of the box where he found more old fortyfives ones he had forgotten he had procol harums a whiter shade of pale juliet by the four pennies hippy hippy shake by the swinging blue jeans the lovin spoonfuls summer in the city devil in disguise by elvis presley and still im sad by the yardbirds banks put the box back on top of one marked roy and tiptoed downstairs into the kitchen for a cup of tea his heart almost stopped when he saw geoff salisbury sitting at the kitchen table eating buttered toast morning alan geoff said ive come to do some cleaning up already took your em and pee a cup of tea up bless em its a big day for them you know like a cuppa yourself banks felt like saying he would make his own tea but he remembered he hadnt been able to find the tea bags instead he got himself a mug thanks he grunted not much of a morning person geoff asked still i imagine after a late night like you had you must be feeling even more tired your poor old mum was lying awake worrying where youd got to salisbury winked having a good time with that summerville girl were you so bankss mother had already told geoff that her son had been out with kay summerville and had not returned home until the early hours of the morning he knew all this and it wasnt even nine oclock yet geoff salisbury was starting to get really annoying even though banks hadnt had a chance to call annie back about criminal records he decided that now would be as good a time as any to go on the offensive and make a couple of things clear to him im glad youre here actually banks said ive been wanting to have a quiet word with you oh what about your sticky fingers come again you know what im talking about dont come the innocent it doesnt work with me i understand that your job must make you cynical but why are you picking on me what have i done you know what youve done look if its that business about the change i thought id already made it clear to you it was a genuine mistake i thought wed put it behind us i might have done if it hadnt been for a few other interesting titbits ive heard since ive been down here its that summerville girl isnt it if shes been saying things shes lying she doesnt like me well said banks that at least shows good taste on her part it doesnt matter whos been saying what the point is that ive been hearing from a number of independent sources about things sort of disappearing when youre in the vicinity money for example salisbury turned red i resent that i should imagine you do but is it true of course it isnt i dont know whos i told you it doesnt matter who salisbury stood up well it does to me you might not believe it but there are people who have it in for me not everybody appreciates what i do for the decent folk around here you know what do you mean never you mind now if youve finished with your groundless accusations ive got work to do your parents golden wedding might not be important to you but it is to me arthur and ida mean a lot to me before banks could say another word salisbury had gone into the front room and started up the vacuum irritated both by salisburys reaction and his own fumbling accusation banks went across to the newsagents to see if he could pick up a sunday times banks went to the bricklayers inn by himself for a quiet pint on sunday lunchtime taking the newspaper with him and promising to be back by two oclock for lunch it felt like his first real break that weekend and he made the most of it even getting the crossword threequarters done which was good for him without annies help on his way home he took cover in the rainlashed bus shelter by the gates of the derelict factory to call annie in eastvale though the shelter hadnt been there all those years ago banks still couldnt help but think of mandy with her julie christie lips and the faraway look in her eyes he wondered what had happened to her whether she had ever found that distant thing she had seemed to be dreaming of probably not most people didnt though it seemed like another age she would only be in her early fifties after all and that no longer sounded very old to banks dc winsome jackman answered his ring is di cabbot not in banks asked im afraid not sir said winsome shes out on the east side estate interviewing neighbours about that sexual assault do you know when shell be back no sir sorry but youll just have to make do with me banks could hear teasing humour in her voice the way it tinged her lilting jamaican speech did she know that annie and he used to have a thing he wouldnt be surprised no matter how much you try to keep something like that a secret there are always people who seem able to pick up on it intuitively di cabbot did leave a message for you though sir winsome went on yes that man you were asking about geoffrey salisbury right any form yes sir one conviction six years ago served eighteen months what for fraud sir to put it in a nutshell he tried to swindle a little old lady out of her life savings but she was a lot smarter than he reckoned on did he indeed banks said what a surprise sir nothing where did this happen loughborough sir that wasnt very far away banks thought thanks a lot he said and thank di cabbot thats a great help theres more sir di cabbot said shes going to try to talk to the local police the ones who handled the case she said it looks like there might be more to it than meets the eye what did she mean by that dont know sir shall i ask her to ring you when shes been in touch with loughborough police if you would winsome and thanks again no problem sir enjoy the party roy didnt turn up in time for sunday lunch which was pretty much what banks had expected they ate without him ida banks fretting and worrying the whole time unable to enjoy her food arthur tried to calm her assuring her that nothing terrible had happened and that roy wasnt trapped in a burning car wreck somewhere on the m banks said nothing he knew his mother well enough to realize that anything he said regarding roy would only succeed in adding fuel to the fire instead he ate his roast beef and yorkshires like a good boy and a fine lunch it was too especially if you liked your meat and vegetables overcooked and counted his blessings in the first place his mother was far too distracted to go on at him for being late home last night and in the second place geoff bloody salisbury had buggered off home and wasnt eating with them though he had promised to come back early to help set up for the party the phone finally rang at about half past two just as they were starting their jam rolypoly and bankss mother leapt up and dashed into the hall to answer it when she came back she was much calmer and she informed banks and his father that poor roy had had a devil of a job getting away on time and the rain had caused some terrible delays there was also a pileup on the m so he was stuck in traffic there at the moment and would arrive as soon as he could there you are you see arthur said all that fretting for nothing i told you he was all right but you never know do you she said banks offered to do the dishes and his offer was to his surprise accepted his father had a nap with the open newspaper unread on his lap and his mother went for a short liedown to calm her nerves when banks had finished the dishes he sneaked a couple of fingers of his fathers johnnie walker to calm his nerves he had no sooner downed it than the explosion went off at least that was what it sounded like at first eventually bankss ears adjusted enough to discern that it was music coming from next door heavymetal gangsta rap music only if you used the term very loosely indeed bankss father stirred in his armchair at it again he grumbled never get a moments peace banks sat by him on the arm does this happen a lot he asked his father nodded too often for me oh ive tried having a word but hes an ignorant bugger if i were twenty or thirty years younger banks heard his mothers footsteps on the landing at it again i hear she called down its bad for her nerves arthur banks said have you talked to the council weve tried but they say apart from issuing a warning they cant do anything what about geoff salisbury geoffs got his strengths but hes not got a lot of bottle proper tough guy him next door right said banks standing up give me a few minutes where are you going alan his mother asked coming down the stairs as he got to the front door just off to have a quiet word with next door thats all dont you go causing any trouble do you hear you just be careful and remember we have to live here after youve gone you know banks patted his mothers arm dont worry mum he said i know what im doing ill make sure i dont cause you any trouble it was still raining outside banks knocked on the door but got no answer hardly surprising as he supposed nobody could hear him over the music the windows were all open and the angry heavymetal rap spilled out into the street someone bragging about raping a bitch and offing a pig banks tried the front door it was open he found himself in a small hallway where the stairs led up to the bedrooms the wallpaper was peeling and something that looked like a sleeping bag lay on the staircase banks nudged it with his foot it was empty he didnt like just walking in unannounced but it seemed the only option he called out a few times while he stood still in the hallway but he could hardly even hear his own shouts finally he went through into the living room now he knew why they kept the windows open the smell was overwhelming it was a mixture of things human smells definitely such as sweat and urine but also rotten vegetables burnt plastic and marijuana there were piles of old newspapers and other rubbish on the floor and it looked as though a dog had chewed up the furniture though there wasnt one in evidence thankful for small mercies banks thought they probably had a pit bull three people were slumped on sofas and armchairs and one of them stood up when banks walked in who the fuck do you think you are he shouted im not a lipreader banks said stepping over to the mound of stereo equipment and turning the volume down thats better it was the man of the house fred west to a t eyebrows and all the woman banks assumed was his wife watched from one of the chairs a girl banks guessed to be about thirteen or fourteen sat in the other chair staring blankly at him the man squared up to banks and gestured to the door with his thumb right mate he said im done being polite on your bike i came to ask you to turn down the music banks said we can hardly hear ourselves think next door whats it to you youre not from around here i was here a long time before you came on the scene i grew up here its my parents house and todays their wedding anniversary well bully for you sorry we forgot to buy them a present now just fuck off before i do you some real damage you dont understand said banks slipping his warrant card out im a police officer and im asking you nicely to keep the noise down the man actually leaned forward and scrutinized the card north yorkshire he said youve got no powers down here youre out of your jurisdiction mate big word that im surprised you didnt choke on it im not scared of you now fuck off you should be said banks the man walked over to the stereo and cranked up the volume again the girl and the woman hadnt moved they were just watching banks guessed they were stoned on something or other he thought he could see a crack pipe halfhidden under a newspaper on the floor but it wasnt crack they were on these two werent jerky or manic they were practically comatose downers or smack most likely with a sigh banks walked over to the stereo picked up the cd player ripped out the wires and dropped it on the floor the music stopped the women still didnt move but fred came right at him he was a couple of inches taller than banks and thickset muscular in the upper body but banks had his wiry and deceptive strength and speed going for him he grabbed the mans wrist and twisted it so that he soon had him on his knees arm up his back foot placed solidly on his left kidney by exerting just a little more pressure on the arm banks could make the pain excruciating even more pressure and the arm would snap or the shoulder joint would pop the women just looked on goggleeyed theyd never seen anything like this before ill do you for this the man yelled ill see you bloody locked up copper or no youve got no right going around destroying a mans private property oh give it a rest fred said banks it was probably nicked anyway my names lenny youve got the wrong bloke my mistake sorry lenny are you listening im still not scared of banks gave a little twist and lenny screamed banks let him relax a moment and then repeated his question all right said lenny all right im listening let go banks didnt im sorry about your cd player he said im a music lover myself so it hurt me almost as it hurt you im sure itll be ok its just had rather a nasty shock thats all if its not then im sure youll have no problem lifting another but first id like a promise out of you what promise banks gave another little twist lenny screamed his face red with pain the woman banks assumed was his wife lit a cigarette and contemplated the scene before her with great interest as if she was watching a television programme the girl started buffing her nails banks listened in the silence after the cd players sudden demise but he could hear no other sounds coming from anywhere in the house a good sign no ambush imminent id like you to promise me that you wont ever ever play your music so loud again that it disturbs my mum and dad next door do you think you can do that lenny its my house ill do what i like in my own fucking house twist scream lenny youre not listening if you really mean what you just said you ought to consider moving to a detached house you know miles away from your nearest neighbours besides its not your house its the councils house you just rent it youre a bastard you are lenny said gasping youre worse than the fucking criminals you put away filth he spat on the floor yeah yeah its all been said before but were not talking about me were talking about your promise what promise i havent made any fucking promise but youre going to arent you lenny said nothing the woman frowned as she looked at him banks could tell the suspense was killing her will he or wont he the young girl got up and made to leave the room where are you going banks asked her bog she said making a squatting gesture banks was a little concerned that she might reappear with a weapon hold on a minute love he said wait till im finished here ill piss myself i said hold on youll live with it these are me new jeans banks turned back to lenny the girl slumped against the doorpost legs crossed banks kept a close eye on her she chewed on her lower lip and looked sulky right lenny the quicker you give me your promise the quicker your lass here will get to go to the toilet shes not my lass let her piss herself i dont care wont be the first time banks gave a harder twist and lenny cursed what i want you to promise banks said slowly is that you wont play your music so loud that it upsets my mum and dad remember i remember and if you do banks said ill have the local drugs squad over here before you can flush a tab of e down the toilet is that clear its clear is it a promise i banks twisted again is it a promise all right all right jesus christ yes its a fucking promise and if you do anything anything at all to harm or intimidate them in any way ill consider that promise broken and i deal with broken promises myself north yorkshires not that far away got it got it let me go banks let go and lenny squirmed on the floor for a while rubbing his arm and his shoulder before subsiding into his armchair and lighting a cigarette with shaking hands youre a nutter you are he said you ought to be locked up youve got that right is it over the girl by the door asked are you done are you cos im bleeding bursting here its over love said banks off you go about fucking time she dashed upstairs the woman on the sofa looked at lenny with contempt but still said nothing you in charge here lenny banks asked catching her look because theres no point my talking to the monkey if you catch my drift im in fucking charge he said glaring at the woman they know that she sniffed but banks could see fear in her eyes the first emotion he had noticed in her lenny was in charge all right and he probably used the same tactics banks had just used to rule his roost that didnt make banks feel particularly good but needs must he wondered what other sorts of abuse went on in this house in addition to drugs the young girl for example or the other kids wherever they were nothing would have surprised him maybe hed call in the drugs squad anyway and the social someone ought to keep a close eye on this lot that was for certain he heard the toilet flush as he left roys arrival at about four oclock broke the tension for banks until then he had been helping geoff set up the bar and buffet on tables in the kitchen keeping a tight rein on his temper for his parents sake even though geoff treated him like an employee now alan if you wouldnt mind just moving that over there thats a good lad if you could nip over to the shops and pick up and so on he had also been wanting to get geoff alone and have another go at him in the light of winsomes information but his mother was always around issuing instructions too wisely his father had gone upstairs to rest when the doorbell rang ida banks practically ran to the front door and banks heard her shouts of glee as she greeted roy after divesting himself of his raincoat the man himself came through to the living room clutching a bottleshaped bag and with a young woman in tow she looked about twenty banks thought with short shaggy hair black streaked with blonde a pale pretty face with beautiful eyes the colour and gleam of chestnuts in september she also had a silver stud just below her lower lip she was wearing jeans and a short woolly jumper exposing a couple of inches of bare flat midriff and a navel with a ring in it this is corinne said roy say hello to my brother alan corinne corinne shook bankss hand and said hello she gave him a shy smile and averted her eyes roy looked at geoff free hand stretched out smiling like a salesman and you are geoff geoff salisbury geoff of course pleased to meet you geoff ive heard a lot about you mum and dad say theyd be lost without you geoff beamed and shifted from foot to foot well thats probably a bit of an exaggeration very umble banks thought not at all said roy not at all he gave geoff a firm handshake and clapped him on the shoulder good to meet you at last geoff basked in the glow of roys charm like a child in his mothers embrace all this time ida banks had stood by smiling on roy turned to her again and gave her a hug then he handed over the package hed been carrying ida banks opened it it was a bottle of veuve clicquot champagne vintage she turned to her husband ooh look at this arthur champagne its the real stuff too roy said with a wink at banks none of your spanish cava or new world sparklers arthur banks grunted banks happened to know that his father hated champagne as much because it was a symbol of the upper classes as for its taste id better put it away for a special occasion said his mother taking it through the kitchen and placing it into the dark depths of the larder where it would probably remain banks thought to mention that today was as special an occasion as they were likely to have in a while but he knew it was best to keep quiet when roy was in full benevolent swing hed bought a few cans of beer and lager himself and he knew that they would be emptied that very evening without a doubt now then said ida banks rubbing her hands together and reaching out to touch corinnes shoulder what about a drink for everyone corinne love whatll you have lager and lime right you are love and you roy just a perrier for me mum said roy driving of course ida banks frowned what did you say perrier i dont think we have any of that do we alan banks shook his head only tap water well that wont do will it his mother said scornfully its all right mrs b chimed in geoff ill just nip over the road old alis bound to have some he sells everything and before anyone could stop him he was off ida banks turned to roy again you wont be driving for ages yet i hope son wont you have a glass of something a bit stronger first oh go on then said roy youve twisted my arm ill have a glass of white wine bankss mother gave him a questioning glance weve got that mum he said then looked at his brother screw top ok roy whatever said roy his lip curling banks and his father both opted for beer come on then corinne love said ida banks taking corinne by the arm you can keep me company and help me pour banks couldnt believe it his mother was fawning all over roys twentysomething bit of fluff the sort of girl whod have been granted no more than a sniff of distaste if banks had brought her home still he should have expected it roy was bankss younger brother by five years he had grown up watching banks do everything wrong and getting caught for it staying out too late as a teenager listening to the radio under the bedsheets when he should have been asleep smoking leaving home to go to college in london joining the police and roy had keenly observed his parents reactions roy had learned well from his brothers mistakes and he had done everything right now in his mothers eyes roy could do no wrong and even arthur banks not given to expressions of any kind didnt seem to disapprove of roy as much as he did of banks which was odd indeed banks thought as roy was the consummate capitalist roy sat down first pulling at the razorsharp crease of his black suit trousers so hows life at the cop shop he asked looking away even before hed got the words out indicating to banks that he didnt have the slightest iota of interest fine said banks is that your renault out there yes why not bad only it looks new been on the take oh you know me roy a few thousand here a few thousand there roy laughed corinne and ida banks best friends now came through with the drinks on a tray at the same time geoff came back from the shop sorry they didnt have any perrier he said i got this other stuff ali recommended st something or other i cant pronounce it ok itll do said roy be a good bloke and pop it in the fridge would you geoff geoff seemed only too pleased to oblige isnt this lovely said ida banks handing out the drinks we can have our own little family party before the rest of our guests arrive corinne tells me shes an accountant roy thats right mum saved me a fortune in taxes corinne sat on the floor near his feet and rested her head against his thigh he stroked her hair the way one would a faithful dog shes very good with figures arent you corinne corinne blushed if you say so roy she really did seem like a nice girl to banks and that made him wonder all the more what she was doing with roy not that roy wasnt handsome or charming in fact he possessed both of those attributes in spades under his suit he wore a pale blue silk poloneck his hair not quite so black as bankss was long over his ears and collar expensively cut and he had a small shaving nick near the cleft of his chin his energetic blue eyes resembled bankss except that they were predatory and calculating whereas bankss were curious and intense banks had thought more than once that his brother roy fitted the classic definition of the psychopath he was glib and superficial egocentric manipulative shallow and completely lacking in any feelings of remorse empathy or guilt certainly all his behaviour and his emotional responses were learned assumed through close observation of others as the best way to get on in the world underneath it all banks guessed the only things that mattered to him were his needs and how he could meet them and his success measured of course by money and power perhaps that was why he had already gone through three wives oops mustnt forget roy said putting his glass down and getting suddenly to his feet corinne almost fell over sideways sorry love he patted her shoulder just got to nip down to the porsche forgot something wouldnt want to leave it out there too long you never know on an estate like this give us a hand will you geoff geoff returned from the kitchen beer in hand stated that he was only too willing to do anything for roy and set his glass down on the table corinne smiled shyly as the two of them went out banks hadnt heard her speak yet and wondered what her voice was like her accent where are you from he asked just to find out canterbury she said well i grew up there after that i went to manchester university she didnt have much of a regional accent banks learned she was well spoken clearly educated and her voice was pleasant soft and musical a little reedy how long have you known roy about three months theyre getting engaged ida banks said so now weve really got something to celebrate corinne blushed that true banks asked she smiled and nodded he felt like warning her off roy had been married three times and two of his wives had ended up confiding in banks about what an unfaithful cruel bastard roy was he had never actually hit either of them so they both swore but he curtailed their freedom and terrorized them psychologically the second a particularly bright neurosurgeon called maria ended up seeing a psychiatrist for years after they split up trying to splice together the frayed strands of her selfesteem banks had seen her change albeit at infrequent intervals from a secure confident young doctor into an apologetic tonguetied wreck whose hands shook so much she couldnt thread a needle the third wife thank god had seen the signs before it got too late and left roy in time roy and geoff came back carrying large cardboard boxes which they set down on the livingroom floor happy anniversary roy said go on open them bankss parents looked at one another then his mother got some scissors from the kitchen drawer and came back and knelt by the largest box roy and geoff helped and soon between them had managed to drag out the computer monitor processor unit and keyboard its a computer said ida banks clearly at a loss now youll be able to go on the internet said roy well be able to send each other email will we yes but its so so expensive oh its nothing everyone should have a computer these days theyre the future ida banks reached out and touched it gingerly as if it might bite the future wed better get it out of the way for the time being said arthur banks our guests will be arriving soon right between them geoff roy and banks took the computer upstairs and set it up on the desk in the spare room thatll be nice for them said geoff banks thought it was the stupidest present he could think of his parents were in their seventies they werent going to learn how to use a computer his own present a particularly moody yorkshire landscape painting he had found in an antique shop in richmond had met with polite praise but he felt it was probably destined for the back of the wardrobe the computer he suspected would sit at this desk not even plugged in just gathering dust unless geoff salisbury decided to use it just as the three of them started downstairs the front doorbell rang here come the first guests said geoff its started first to arrive were uncle frank and aunt harriet and after that banks began to lose track here came relatives he hadnt seen for years cousins he never even knew existed it was only to be expected with both his mother and father coming from large families six and four respectively but it was a shock nonetheless geoff took to bartending duties like a fish to water and roy worked the room like a politician all hailfellowwellmet as if these people he had probably never seen before meant more to him than his own life if the truth were known he had been home even less often than banks and hardly ever in touch with the more distant relatives arthur banks seemed bewildered by it all tired sticking to his armchair glass of beer at hand though ida got into the party spirit and banks fancied she even became a little tipsy music played quietly in the background mostly crooners and big bands though pop entered the mix when someone found an old compilation album it was pretty much the same stuff as banks had found in his room or at least softer stuff from the same period cliff richard eden kane frank ifield billy fury the bachelors and the ubiquitous val doonican but it was only for background wallpaper music in a lull after the first few guests had arrived banks managed to get roy alone for a few minutes while a couple of young cousins similarly bedecked admired corinnes bodypiercing ive been wanting a word in your ear banks said its about that geoff salisbury what about him seems like a decent chap takes good care of mum and dad thats just it i think he steals from them oh come on alan its that suspicious coppers mind of yours working overtime again no its more than that banks told him about the short change could have been any reason for that roy said a genuine mistake you dont always have to think the worst of people you know hes got their pin number they give him their abbeylink card he takes care of their finances for crying out loud somebodys got to do it i mean its not as if youre around much is it banks realized he was fighting a losing battle roy didnt want to believe that geoff was anything other than a godsend and he would resist any evidence to the contrary hes got a criminal record banks went on nevertheless pissing against the wind swindling old folk out of their life savings roy just laughed mum and dad havent got anything worth swindling you know that and besides dont you believe in rehabilitation i assume hes paid his debt to society yes but well then for christs sake roy i caught him redhanded listen big brother so what if hes pocketing a bob or two here and there he practically does all their shopping for them house cleaning too isnt it worth it thats not the point if he wants paying for what he does thats different maybe its just his way its a funny bloody way roy shrugged and laid his arm across bankss shoulders like i said its not as if youre around to do it is it eh i say count your blessings and let sleeping dogs lie look theres uncle ken see you later banks muttered to himself under his breath he should have known approaching roy was a waste of time anybody suspected of swindling a penny out of him and hed probably put a contract out on them but his own parents on the other hand was roy right was banks making too much out of all this being a party pooper he looked at his parents they seemed happy enough his mother did anyway what right had he got to challenge that what gave him the moral justification to come down here once in a blue moon and spoil what little good fortune they had going for them his mother clearly adored geoff he could tell by the way she looked at him and talked about him and having him around made life a hell of a lot easier for his father too roy was right banks had been interfering too much and it was about time he backed off and left people to get on with their lives penny for them banks turned it was kay i didnt hear you come in he said nice to see you she smiled and touched his arm nice to see you too i was just talking to your mother she offered her condolences she was wearing a lemon summer dress which fell to just below her knees and she had her hair tied up and held in place with a patterned leather barrette you look wonderful banks said kay blushed thank you how about a drink for the lady of course vodka and tonic thatll do nicely she took hold of his arm and dont go too far away i dont know anyone else here of course you do said banks you know my parents i havent seen them for years and my brother roy he was just a little kid when we were together around too often if i remember correctly banks nodded he remembered being blackmailed into giving roy money to get lost on more than one occasion you know geoff salisbury he said nodding to where geoff stood by the fireplace talking to some cousin whose name banks couldnt remember kay gave a little shudder yuck i dont know about you but he gives me the creeps they got their drinks come on banks said to kay lets get some fresh air they went out to the back step banks could hear music next door but only softly the rain had stopped earlier that afternoon and it had turned into a pleasant evening the sky was already darkening and the stars coming out there was even a pale quarter moon low in the sky banks leaned against the wall kay stood quietly beside him last night he began but kay hushed him putting a finger to his lips no dont say anything that was marvellous special lets leave it at that shall we if you like banks said hed been thinking the same thing what had happened had been about the past unfinished business passing magic it had been time out of time tomorrow they would both go back to their real lives and probably never see one another again banks thought about how their relationship had ended all those years ago and how he had believed he would never see her again after he went to london this was enough this was more than enough it had to be they went back inside the party went on as these things do banks and kay talked to mrs green for a while and banks promised not to be such a stranger aunt florence regaled him with her cataracts and aunt lynn went on about her gallbladder operation he also heard about cousin patricks prostate problems uncle geralds haemorrhoids and cousin louises manic depression it was enough to make him want to kill himself before he got old then there was cousin beths divorce nick and janets third baby a girl they had named shania sharons promotion gails miscarriage and ayeshas boob job all the while kay stood politely by asking questions and making sympathetic comments or noises roy continued to work the room seemingly indefatigable inevitably uncle ted fell asleep cousin angie had too much to drink and was sick in the kitchen sink dislodging a nose stud in the process which she nearly inhaled uncle gerald and uncle frank almost came to blows aunt ruth wet herself and young lovely anorexic cousin sue with all the selfesteem of a blade of grass became tearful and made a pathetic attempt to seduce banks all in all it was just another typical family do roy and corinne left early they sought out banks and kay to say their goodbyes and as usual roy invited banks to the south kensington house said they really must see more of one another and that he hoped banks could make it to the wedding next year banks promised he would try gave the blushing bridetobe a chaste kiss on her pale cool cheek and they were gone when banks looked around he noticed that geoff salisbury had left too only one or two relatives remained and they were either very close or very drunk banks found his mother having a hearttoheart with her sister flo and said hed see kay home and be right back the street was quiet the evening air cool they saw only a few people as they walked the short distance to kays house id better not come in he said at the doorstep no he wondered what would happen if he leaned forward and kissed her on the lips would their resolve melt somehow he didnt think it was very strong anyway he said if youre ever up eastvale way of course i will she gave him the sort of smile that said she never would be then after a quick kiss on the cheek the door opened and closed and banks was left standing there alone he didnt want to go back to the dregs of the party immediately didnt want to face the drunken relatives desperately sobering up for the drive home didnt want to face the mess of spilled drinks and food smeared on the carpets he knew he would have to he owed it to his parents to help clean up at least but he could put it off for a little while longer the moon was higher now and banks could see stars planets constellations even beyond the amber glow of the street lights he wandered the quiet sunday night streets of the estate feeling oddly melancholy past the maisonettes where he used to deliver newspapers past the house where his old late friend steve hill used to live steve had kept toads in a bell jar at the bottom of the garden banks remembered but he was forgetful and one summer he neglected them for so long that they shrivelled up and died they looked like dried mushrooms that was what happened to living things you were supposed to love and care for but neglected his melancholy was probably something to do with kay he realized though he hadnt really wanted to repeat last night either last night had had a magic about it that any attempt at repetition would fall well short of he remembered how their relationship had fallen apart all those years ago his fault it had all started to change when kay left school at sixteen and got a job at lloyds bank in the town centre she made new friends had money to spare started going for drinks with the office crowd regularly after work on a friday banks was still at school having stayed on for his a levels and somehow a schoolboy had less appeal than these slightly older better dressed more sophisticated men of the world at the office they had more money to flash around and even more important some of them had cars one pillock called nigel with a plummy accent and a triumph mg particularly got up bankss nose kay insisted there was no hankypanky going on but banks became tortured with jealousy racked by imagined infidelities and in the end kay walked away she couldnt stand his constant harping on about who she was seeing and what she was doing she said and the way he got stroppy if she even so much as looked at another man the irony was given that his a level results werent good enough for university the first bone of contention between him and his parents he might as well not have bothered staying on hed spent far too much time with kay away from his studies listening to hendrix dylan and pink floyd reading books that werent on the syllabus shortly after the break up banks moved to london and went to pursue business studies at the poly a year or two after that and several brief unsatisfactory casual relationships later he met sandra a dog barked as he reached the edge of the estate by the railway lines a local train rattled by one or two silhouettes visible through the windows banks started towards home he had only got a few yards when the mobile in his pocket rang he had forgotten to turn it off alan i hope im not disturbing your party it was annie cabbot banks wondered how he would have felt if he had gone in with kay and the phone had rung just as they were it didnt bear thinking about no he said quietly he happened to be passing the telephone boxes at the end of the street so he decided to stand inside one and take the call that way he didnt seem like one of those silly buggers walking around talking to his girlfriend on his mobile phone im sorry to call so late annie said thats all right arent you off duty yes but i was waiting to hear from ds ryan in loughborough he was out at the pictures ds ryan so this is about geoff salisbury yes whats wrong alan you sound funny distant so would you if you were standing in the middle of a council estate talking on your mobile annie laughed oh i dont know im not quite as conservative as you are ok point taken what did this ds ryan come up with its interesting actually said annie at least i thought youd want to know fill me in as winsome told you salisbury was actually convicted of fraud it was a neighbour an elderly woman and he started by helping out around the place that sort of thing sounds familiar said banks go on seems he managed to come between her and her children and get himself written into her will she didnt have much only a few hundred quid and an insurance policy but he copped for most of it what happened the family contested it undue influence that sort of thing hard to prove anyway in the end mr salisbury won out where does the conviction come in just getting to that during proceedings it came out that geoff salisbury had persuaded the woman to invest in a nonexistent business venture of his a garage ahhah again it wasnt much only two hundred quid doesnt matter said banks is a man who preys on the poor any less guilty than one who preys on the rich im afraid thats a bit too philosophical for me at this time on a sunday evening but at a guess id say even more so wouldnt you i would thanks a lot annie above and beyond and all that oh thats not all really really while all this was going on mr salisburys mother died well she was old and sick how did you guess she had diabetes anyway she died or banks felt a tingle go up his spine or what or he helped her on her way nothing was ever proven there werent even any charges but ds ryan was one of the investigating officers and he says he was suspicious enough to ask for an autopsy negative the woman was old she went hypoglycaemic and that was that whats that hypoglycaemic its something that happens to diabetics apparently caused by too much insulin or low food intake he gave her an overdose of insulin no evidence of that but someone could have brought it about this hypoglycaemic coma yes hard to prove though what did ds ryan say ds ryan said that his older sister is a diabetic and she always keeps her bedside drawer full of mars bars or chocolate of some kind for just that sort of eventuality but i thought diabetics had to avoid sugar like the plague so did i apparently they do unless they go hypoglycaemic then they need a hit of sugar or coma death and in this case there were other complications weak heart for example and ds ryan says ds ryan says the doctor didnt find any traces of sugar products close to mrs salisburys bed and he found that in itself suspicious in his opinion ds ryans that is geoff salisbury was responsible knowing it was just a matter of time before shed need a sugar fix he killed his own mother is that what youre saying mercy killing but killing all the same bloody hell said banks this changes things it does id been thinking of leaving well alone but not now not now thanks a lot annie my pleasure see you tomorrow ok and thanks again missing mars bars a faulty oxygentank valve banks wondered who else geoff salisbury had assisted in their final moments on earth he also wondered how long it would be before his own father suffered that fatal angina attack and was unable to find his nitroglycerine tablets in time putting his phone in his pocket he headed straight for geoff salisburys house look i can see youre not going to let this drop are you said salisbury when banks had told him he knew about the conviction so ive been to prison its nothing to be ashamed of i served my time as a matter of fact said banks it is something to be ashamed of but those whove been there rarely seem to think so innocent were you like everyone else no i did it i was desperate and she didnt need the money so i conned her im not saying im proud of that what i did but like i said i served my time paid my debt to society debt to society roys words exactly and an odd phrase when you really thought about it would that it were as simple as that banks said salisburys living room wasnt quite as clean and tidy as he had expected but perhaps he used all his energy on other peoples homes and had none left for his own dust gathered in the corners the carpet was threadbare and lumps of mould floated on the halfempty coffee cup on the table all right said salisbury suppose just suppose that i was ripping people off some people might actually believe im a power for good around here what do you mean an estate like this the old folks need someone on their side someone to look out for them they die off you see and when they do its mostly young uns come in off the waiting list you know the sort young lasses barely out of school with three kids and no father in sight or that lot next door to your mum and dads scum now youre a copper alan you tell me if he doesnt have prison written all over him and as for the kids well itll only be a matter of time and if its not scum like that its foreigners gyppos darkies pakis them with the turbans all with their funny ways slaughtering goats in the street and whatever not giving a toss for our customs and traditions and way of life see the old folks they get frightened when everything around them starts to feel threatening and unfamiliar their worlds changing so fast and their bodies cant do what they used to do so they end up feeling lost and scared thats where someone like me comes in i reassure them do odd jobs give them a friendly and familiar face to relate to so what if i make a few bob out of it hypothetically id say hypothetically that it makes you a thief words alan just words actually no legal concepts well you would say that wouldnt you heres another one to try on for size murder salisbury blinked and stared at him what you heard me geoff oh you might have a more fancy name for it something highsounding and moral such as mercy killing but in my eyes its murder plain and simple salisbury sat back in his chair i dont know what youre talking about oh i think you do there was your own mother for a start dont tell me a woman whos been a diabetic for a good part of her life doesnt know to keep some sugar on hand in case she goes hypoglycaemic salisbury banged his fist on the chair arm thats over and done with he said i wasnt there nobody ever proved anything against me im not saying you havent been clever geoff you never were there were you mr greens faulty valve for example wouldnt be difficult for a car mechanic would it and what about mrs summerville geoff gentle pillow over the face as she slept was it nobody would ask too many questions or perhaps a little too much morphine she was alone you had a key they always give you a key dont they and what about the hundred quid you drew out with her bank card the day she died mistake that she couldnt get it herself remember she was bedridden and her daughter could find no sign of the money salisbury got to his feet you cant prove a damn thing get out of here go on get out banks didnt move you dont get away with it that easily geoff especially not when its my parents youre playing with now i saw the piece of silver paper you folded and dropped in the bin at mrs summervilles house ill bet it has your prints on it so i went there i helped her like i helped the others so what that doesnt prove anything ill bet if we exhumed the body though wed find some evidence of tampering some evidence of what you did she hasnt been dead as long as the others geoff therell be forensic evidence in the house too for the first time banks saw salisbury falter and sit down again he knew he had been guessing taking a stab in the dark but it seemed to have touched a nerve she had cancer and a weak heart banks went on all it took was a little pressure she didnt even have the strength to fight back did she what do you mean forensic evidence geoff asked theyd never dig her up oh yes they would on my sayso and you know exactly what theyd find dont you but the doctor signed the death certificates there wasnt even an inquest nothing suspicious at all why would there be geoff dont you know how it goes all your victims were medically attended during their illnesses theyd all been seen by their doctors within fourteen days of death and they were all terminally ill likely to die at any time there were no grounds for a coroners inquest and remember none of them was alone with family members when they died not even your mother you made sure you were out of the house that night didnt you this is absurd theyll never open up her coffin yes they will wed just better thank the lord that she was buried and not cremated dont you think what will they find tell me salisbury licked his lips staring at banks and said nothing for a long time you think youre clever dont you he said at last you dont know nothing about it about what suffering tell me about it geoff i want to know why should i you wouldnt understand believe me ill try and itll go better for you if you do if we dont have to exhume the body thats a lot of work and messy nobody wants to do it i think wed be able to prove a case against you geoff i really do but if you help us if you tell me about it itll go a lot easier for you why do you think they let me cheat them take their money banks frowned come again you dont think they didnt know what i was doing do you they knew all right and they let it go on payment thats what it was they just couldnt come right out and say it what they really wanted me to do but it was their way of paying me of letting me know what they wanted me to do hang on a minute geoff said banks let me get this straight did you kill mr green and mrs summerville yes no i put them to sleep i ended their suffering and your mother it was what she wanted it was what they all wanted it was beautiful what was salisburys eyes shone the transformation from pain to peace suffering to grace it was like being god did either mrs green or anyone from the summerville family suggest that you do what you did not in so many words no but that was how you interpreted their actions in letting you get away with stealing money like i said they knew it was their way of paying for what they wanted done close family couldnt do it could they theyd soon be suspects or they didnt care enough and were never around like you and that summerville girl you dont see their suffering i do day in day out i was their saviour somebody had to be banks got up what are you doing im going to ring the local police now and i want you to tell them what youve just told me tell them everything maybe youre sick maybe you need help i dont know all i do know banks thought as he took out his mobile is that i want you off this estate and as far away from my parents as possible it was about an hour later when two uniformed constables and one detective sergeant grumpy at being dragged out of the sunday night pub darts match arrived at geoff salisburys house you know with all due respect to your rank and all sir we dont particularly appreciate north yorkshire cid poking around on our patch doing our job for us said the surly ds whose name was les kelly and who was going prematurely bald luckily banks hadnt encountered ds kelly on his last trip to peterborough banks smiled to himself it would probably have been his reaction too had kelly come up north at least it would have been if he had been a ds and ten years younger believe me ds kelly it wasnt my intention he said i just came for the party you what banks sighed i was brought up around here down the street i came home for my parents golden wedding and this is what i found going on he gestured towards salisbury who was giving his statement to the uniformed officers how about we go outside for a minute said kelly the uniforms can deal with his statement and i fancy a smoke banks and kelly stood on the path kelly lit a cigarette and banks craved one a few locals had noted the arrival of the police and a small crowd had gathered just beyond the patrol car not that police cars were a novelty on the estate but it was nearly bedtime on a sunday i was winning too said kelly what the darts match banks smiled oh sorry never mind we never sleep always ready to bring another wrongdoer to justice i just transferred here from west midlands myself you say youre from around these parts uhhuh long time ago came here when i was twelve grew up just down the street used to go out with the girl whose mother that bastard killed theyll put him in the nut house likely as long as hes locked up kelly looked around and sniffed the air then he took a deep drag on his cigarette and blew out a long plume of smoke i grew up on an estate pretty much like this one he said barrowinfurness not a part of the world i know dont bother look while youre here said banks there is another small matter you might be able to help with oh and whats that the family that lives next to my parents said banks i dont know their names but the bloke looks like fred west ah the wyatts is that their name well its easier that way to be honest though i think hes the only true wyatt there shes a fisher had kids with a young and harrison and a davies need i go on how many of them are there according to the council only five thats all the place is big enough for i saw a sleeping bag on the staircase you were in there noise complaint ah yes well our latest estimation is about twelve give or take a couple can you do anything about what drugs for a start and i wouldnt be surprised if some of those kids are being sexually abused nor me kelly finished his cigarette and stamped it out on the path its only a matter of time he said you know how these things can drag on but weve got an eye on them and the socials investigating them too so sooner or later one of us will come up with something and then kelly laughed and then you know as well as i do then the farce just begins theyll end up on another estate much like this one most likely and itll start all over again the uniforms came out with geoff salisbury slumpshouldered between them done one of them said salisbury gave banks a look that was half pleading for understanding and forgiveness and half pure hatred banks didnt know which half he liked less right kelly clapped his hands lets go see what the custody sergeant has to say shall we and ill say goodnight to you for the moment dci banks we might need you again banks smiled im only a phone call away by monday morning when banks awoke to sunshine and the sound of birds beyond his thin curtains news of geoff salisburys arrest had spread around the entire estate when he went down for breakfast he found his parents sitting quietly at the table he poured himself a cup of tea his mother wouldnt look at him when he walked into the room youve heard then he asked about geoff she said tears in her eyes mrs wilkins came to tell me that was your doing wasnt it id no choice mum said banks resting his hand on her arm she jerked it away how could you do that you know what he meant to us mum geoff salisbury was a murderer he killed mr green and he killed kays mother not to mention his own mother banks thought i dont see how you can defend him you knew those people they were your neighbours mrs banks shook her head i dont believe it not geoff he wouldnt do anything like that hes gentle as a kitten he admitted it you must have forced him interrogated him until he didnt know what he was saying i dont work like that mum believe me he did it he might have thought he was doing good doing the families a favour but he did it banks looked at his father who caught his eye he knew right away that they were thinking the same thing who was next banks stood up look mum ive got to go now all you brought was trouble it was supposed to be a happy occasion now look what youve gone and done spoiled it all as usual i wish our roy was here bankss heart felt heavy but there was nothing more he could say there was as much point in telling his mother that roy didnt give a shit as there was in telling her that geoff salisbury was a coldblooded murderer im sorry mum he said then dashed upstairs to throw his few belongings in his bag he looked at the boxes of records and exercise books again and decided to leave them all he took was the poetry let go he was standing at the door of his room when he saw his father come slowly up the stairs they stood on the landing facing one another shes upset said arthur banks she doesnt know what shes saying ill take care of her ill make sure she knows whats what what is what dad im not even sure i know did i do the right thing only you know that for certain lad but you did your job youd no choice youre a copper and he was a bad un your motherll get over it she really liked him thats all he was useful around the house and he could be a right charmer i know said banks his type usually is you know she never likes admitting shes wrong about people but if he killed those people you were right you were only doing your job i dont mind a bob or two here and there and dont think i didnt notice i just kept quiet for your mothers sake but i draw the line at killing he laughed whos to say it wouldnt have been me next eh they both knew there was a lot more truth in that fear than either cared to explore bye dad banks said ill be in touch dont be a stranger son and dont worry your motherll get over it ill tell her to ring you in a day or so shall i please do his father smiled or send you an email banks moved forward impulsively and hugged him it was quick and he felt only the slightest pressure of his fathers hand on the back of his shoulder but it was enough banks dashed down the stairs and walked down the path to his car tears prickling his eyes he felt a weight in the side pocket of his jacket and realized it was kays copy of lady chatterleys lover now he decided he might as well keep it maybe he would even get around to reading it over thirty years after hed borrowed it when he got to the drivers side of his car he cursed out loud some bastard had taken a coin or a nail and made a deep scratch along the paintwork all the way from back to front he thought he saw someone watching from an upstairs window of the wyatt house bugger them bugger the lot of them he thought and got into his car and drove away peter robinson
