thérèse gregory lescroart and again to lisa with love i have certainly known more men destroyed by the desire to have a wife and child and keep them in comfort than i have seen destroyed by drink william butler yeats chapter one from his aisle seat dismas hardy had a clear view of the stewardess as her feet lifted from the floor she immediately let go of the traythe one that held hardys cokealthough strangely it didnt drop but hung there in the air floating the liquid coming out of the glass like a stain spreading in a blotter the man next to him grabbed hardys elbow and said were dead hardy as though from a distance noted the mans hand on his arm he found it difficult to take his eyes from the floating stewardess then as suddenly as shed lifted the stewardess crashed back to the floor with the tray and the drink two or three people were screaming hardy was the first one to get his seat belt off in a second he was kneeling over the stewardess who appeared to be unhurt though badly shaken crying she held him muscles spasming in fear or relief gasping for breaths between sobs it was the first time hardyd had a womans arms around him in four and a half years and that time had been just the once with frannie née mcguire now cochran after a new years eve party the pilot was explaining theyd dropped three thousand feet something about wind shears and backwashes of s hardy loosened the womans hold on him youre all right he said gently were all okay he looked around the plane at the ashen faces the grotesque smiles the tears his own reaction he figured would come a little later in fifteen minutes they were at the gate in san francisco hardy cleared customs speaking to no one and went to the tiki bar where he ordered a black and tanideally a mixture of guinness stout and bass ale this one wasnt ideal halfway through the first one he felt his legs go and he grinned at himself in the bars mirror next his hands started shaking and he put them on his lap waiting for the reaction to pass okay it was safe he was on the ground and could think about it now in a way he thought it was too bad the plane hadnt crashed there would have been some symmetry in thatboth of his parents had died in a plane crash when hed been nineteen a sophomore at cal tech a crash would also have been timely since baja hadnt helped him to figure his life out nor had two weeks on the wagon maybe there was simply no solution if the plane had gone down he wouldnt have had to worry about it anymore hed spent his days under water in the reefs where the sea of cortez meets the pacific he had held the shell of a sea tortoise and ridden it for perhaps two hundred yards hed gone over the side of the panga into a school a city a landscape of leaping dolphins while his guide tried to tell him they would kill him well if that was the way he was going to go he couldnt have thought of a better one the nights hed sit at the finis terra high above the water drinking soda and lime hed come down to baja alone on purpose although both pico and moses had offered to go with him but with them he would have been the same hardy he was in san francisco a fast and cynical mouth an elbow customized for drinking he hadnt felt like being that hardy for a while it hadnt been working very well he thought which was why hed needed the vacation the problem was on vacation nothing else seemed to work too well either he just felt hed lost track of who he was he knew what he didhe was a damn good bartender a thrower of darts a medium worker of wood he was also divorced an exmarine excop exattorney hed even for a time been a father thirtyeight and some months and he didnt know who he was he tipped up the glass yeah he thought that wouldnt have been so bad the plane crashing not good not something to shoot for but really not the worst tragedy in the world he figured hed already had that one a shroud of gray enveloped the westernmost twenty blocks of san francisco and extended from the middle of the golden gate bridge down to daly city the fog covered an area of perhaps no more than five square miles but within it gusting winds of thirty miles per hour were not uncommon and the temperature was twenty degrees lower than in the rest of the city nowhere was visibility greater than half a block and squalls of bonechilling drizzle drifted like malevolent ghosts across the drear landscape in almost the precise center of this fog sat a squat onestory frame house set back nearly sixty feet from the sidewalk hardy had thought when he bought it that it looked like the kind of dollhouse a sailor might have made for a daughter hed never seen while he traveled to warm and exotic ports it was a house that seemed to remember summers fondly with a small white latticed porch up three brick steps broad white planks surrounding a jutting bay window dwarfed on the left and right by mediumrise apartment buildings the house seemed especially quaint and vulnerable next to the porch in front of the windows a scrub juniper hugged the ground as though for warmth the rest of the area just in front of the house cleared for a garden that might have once been there was barren the lawn itself was green and slightly overgrown hardy sat in his office in the back the shades were pulled and a coal fire burned in the grate it was a monday in the first week of june hardy picked up a dart and flung it at the board on the wall opposite him he reached for his pipe stopped himself sat back the wind slapped at the window shaking it hardy pushed himself back from his desk and went to retrieve his round of darts stopping to poke at the blueburning coal he wore a dirty pair of corduroys a blue pullover sweater and heavy gray socks he rearranged some of the ships in bottles on his mantel and brushed the dust from one of his fossils it crossed his mind that the average temperature of the entire universe including all suns stars planets moons comets black holes quasars asteroids and living things was less than one degree above absolute zero he believed it it had been three weeks since hed returned from cabo he heard the cover drop at his mail slot the late monday delivery as usual his mail was a joke he would have almost welcomed a bill just to have something addressed to him personally as it was he got an invitation to join a travel club a special offer on cleaning his rugs only per room with a threeroom minimummaybe not a bad deal if he had owned any rugs a tube of some new toothpaste a free advertising newspaper two letters to the previous owner of his house who had moved nearly six years before and a have you seen this child postcard he opened a can of hash and spooned it into a heavy castiron skillet when it had stuck well to the bottom of the pan he pried under it and turned it nearly whole poking three holes into the mass he dropped an egg in each covered it and went to the tank in his bedroom to feed the tropical fish he went back to the kitchen and opened a newspaper to the sports section the giants were at home that ought to keep the ghosts at bay he ate the hash and eggs out of the skillet slowly thinking when the skillet was empty he placed it back on the stove covering the bottom with salt he turned the gas under it up high when the pan was smoking he took the wire brush that hung from the back of the stove and ran it around under the salt dumping what hed worked loose into the garbage in twenty seconds the pan was spotless he ran a paper towel over it then left it on the stove hed had that pan longer than almost anything else he owned it was the only household article hed taken when his marriage to jane had ended if he treated it rightno water no soapit would last a lifetime it was one of the few things he was absolutely sure of and he didnt mess with it in his bedroom he put on a threequarterlength green pea coat boots and a misshapen blue greek sailors cap grabbing a pipe from the rack on his desk he risked a glance outside but someone might just as well have erected a slate wall there with the pipe clamped between his teeth he walked through the echoing house as though fighting a gale as he flicked the light switch in the hallway there was a pop and a flash then a reversion to darkness while hed been in cabo the wood in the front door had swollen normally hardy took care of carpentry that needed to be done but he hadnt gotten around to replaning the door he had to yank on it twice to get it open standing for a moment in the hallway contemplating natures perversity he drew on the cold pipe then he stepped into the swirling mist on the way to candlestick park he considered stopping by the steinhart aquarium to see if pico would like to accompany him but he decided against it pico would talk about his great passion getting a live great white shark into the aquarium long ago hardy had helped walk the traumatized sharks that fishing boats brought in hoping to coax them into swimming on their own none of them had ever made it and hardy didnt do it anymore he didnt do anything like that anymore you could put your hope in anything you wanted he figured but to put it in hope itself was just pure foolishness and as hardy often said i might be dumb but im no fool chapter two the mexican guy in the upperdeck front row two sections from where hardy sat was trouble he probably weighed two hundred fifty pounds sitting with his shirt off a red bandanna around his head and a big meaty arm around a stout latino woman he was intimidation incarnate by hardys best count since the vendor had stopped coming around in the bottom of the fourth inning the guy had put away a dozen large beers he brandished a nearempty pint brandy bottle in his free hand the entire upper deck smelled like marijuana hardy had gotten his ticket from jimmy deecks a cop who was working the second deck casual moonlighting mostly it was an easy gig consisting of exchanging tickets with the scalpers you took their game tickets and gave them citations once in a while youd take a drunk to the holding tank occasionally like tonight with hardy showing up youd give an old buddy one of the scalped tickets youd see a lot of good baseball but sometimes hardy knew you had to work a guy would try to prove he was the worlds greatest asshole hardy had a feeling about tonight and this guy jimmy was going to earn his bread although the sun was barely down and the sky was still blue the lights were on the asshole was standing up waving his arms trying to get the attention of a beer vendor screaming cerveza as though someone were torturing him by putting him through beer withdrawal cold turkey like a foghorn players on the field looked up to see who was making the racket hardy looked around wondering when deecks and his partner were going to come bust the guy suddenly the asshole took a swing at the fan sitting behind him the fan swung back missed and took one aside the head that sent him sprawling that got some other guys up a couple of women screamed the crowd up there roared of course what a good time a bonus during the ballgame hardy left his seat jimmy deecks or not this bullshit had to stop but then he saw jimmy running down the steps loosening his nightstick no partner in sight the mexican woman was pulling at her mans arm trying to get him to stop but three or four other guys were joining in now with the asshole just screaming and swinging at random jimmy blew on his whistle to no effect hardy tried to keep moving through the seats but more and more people were closing in to see the fun all right enough hold it break it up he heard jimmys words the same ones always used the ones that never worked things started to quiet when jimmy laid a couple of taps on shoulders with the nightstick hardy trying now to step over some seats saw that only the asshole was still standing his woman was pulling on his arm glaring at jimmy deecks come on now lets go downstairs the sweet voice of reason hardy loved it he caught jimmys eye briefly then saw him fix on the woman seeking an ally get him downstairs and take him home huh how bout that the asshole just kept glaring the woman pulled at his arm again and he looked down as though just being reminded she was there and casually cuffed her face backhand shut up then something else in spanish hardy couldnt get through the crowd that had formed jimmy rolled his eyes toward him as if for support then unsnapped his holster though drawing down on fans wasnt a recommended procedure at the ballpark it seemed to work for an instant the asshole appeared to forget what was going on he looked up behind jimmy deecks and started yelling for beer again it was all the distraction jimmy needed he stepped toward the guy and slapped him hard alongside the head just over the ear and the guy went down sideways right now there was a hearty round of applause from the stands the woman her own nose bleeding leaned over the asshole seeing if he was all right jimmy turned again to hardy a plea for help in his eyes somebody yelled a warning and he turned as the asshole was about to slam into him drunk stoned and probably half concussed the guy was formidable jimmy sidestepped the main force of the tackle but still fell backward across some seats the asshole was up again as fast as he was and he charged back down the steps hardy saw jimmy duck away and swing hard with his nightstick as the guy passed hitting him high on the back of his neck probably aiming for and certainly hitting the lower edge of the bandanna the guys momentum carried him down to the railing which he slammed into leaned over weaving went over some more and finally almost in slow motion disappeared off the second deck abe glitsky was figuring out his chances he was one of policemen in san francisco the voters in their wisdom had just rejected a mayors referendum calling for a citycountywide increase of two hundred cops the rejection completely unexpected though maybe it shouldnt have been in the city that once knew how had come after the department had already hired many of the new officers which meant they would now be laid off worse from abes point of view was that all the promotions that had been based on the hirings would be rescinded as usual in the bureaucracy they were using last hired first fired so the officers with least seniority would get knocked back robbery inspectors would go back to desk sergeants desk sergeants to the beat homicide guys to vice or robbery and all because the citizens of this clown town thought too many cops would make the city a police state glitskys desk was in a cubicle of baffled masonite he had a window with a view of the oaklandbay bridge and his own coffee machineseventy square feet of the high life the perks of his seniority he sipped some cold herb tea and thought maybe he should move to la pick up the wife and kids and go someplace where they believed in law enforcement hed heard that down there they were increasing the size of the force by a thousand a thousand he ran that number around in his brain and no one in their right mind would say la was overrun with cops everyone already knew that half the town was controlled by gangs a thousand new cops probably wouldnt even make a dent and here in san francisco a mere fifth of that made people think about mussolini abe didnt get it he really ought to go home he thought get away from it the atmosphere in homicide outside this cubicle was not good three new guys all just promoted knew they were going back down and this was happening in every department which made the entire hall a pure joy to work in to make matters more complicated glitskys lieutenant joe frazeui was retiring of course this assured that only two of the three new guys slated for demotion would actually go back to their old jobs one would stay in homicide wonderful for cooperation among the rookies abe along with frank batiste and carl griffin was up for frazellis job which was ninetenths administrative and which took you off the street which was not what any of the guys wanted but there were other considerations like power and not unimportantly money also it was another rung up the ladder to captain maybe chief and like most cops glitsky entertained thoughts of moving up but it wasnt easy being half black and half jewish some days when his paranoia ran high he was amazed hed come as far as he had which was homicide inspector other times hed think the sky was the limithe was a good cop he knew his way around he could lead others but if he was honest he had to admit there were some problems first he knew he could direct investigations but he had a problem working with the other guys out of the fourteen homicide cops only two worked solo and he was one of them he told himself that it was just the way it had happened but in his heart he knew that hed worked it around this way hed come up four years before when an armedrobbery suspectj robert ronka hed never forgethad dovetailed into a wife killer frazelli had admired his handling of that case and put him on another hot one as soon as hed come on board in homicide there had been no free partners at the time so frazelli had asked him if he minded going solo again until somebodys vacation ended or somebody else quit or got promoted leaving another solo spot to be teamed then hed put glitsky together with that guy except abe had never pushed it and it hadnt happened and now he sometimes thought that not being particularly close to anybody might hurt his career but that wasnt as serious as the other problemthe race thing the san francisco police department has two unions one for white officers and one for nonwhite officers and abe would be good and goddamned if he was going to use any affirmativeaction bullshit to get himself moved up when he finally did make captain or chief he didnt want even the tiniest smell of that in his background and so far he thought hed avoided it the trouble was some black cops resented him for rejecting the hardfoughtfor rights that theyd earned and a lot of white guys wouldnt believe that he didnt get special consideration because he was black regardless of what he said or did about it hell he was solo wasnt he the fact that the other solo guy mcfadden was white wasnt a comparable situation because everybody knew mcfadden was just a mean sorry son of a bitch who hated everybody and their dog spot he wouldnt work with his own mother and his mother wouldnt want to work with him a telephone rang somewhere out in the main room glitsky could see three of the maybe five guys who were at their desks doing paperwork the secretaries had all disappeared it was close to nine oclock on a monday night frazelli had gone home abe and griffin had rank in the shop wearily abe stood stretched and walked to the entrance to his cubicle griffin three cubicles down poked his head out the same way they nodded at one another warily as abe feared it was the desk phone one of the new guys went and picked it up listened for a minute then covered the mouthpiece anybody want to see a dead guy he asked abe wanted to go home he was working on four current homicides and one hed been hounding for sixteen months on the other hand his plate had been fuller and he was gunning for looie he stepped out of his cubicle want to flip for it he asked griffin where is it griffin asked the new guy candlestick naw baseballs boring griffin said okay ill take it abe said not liking it griffin should have gone for it too and there seemed to be a personal edge to what hed said something was going on abe didnt like it the giants beat the phillies to after the last out hardy stayed in his seat drinking beer and waiting for what crowd there was to thin out they stopped selling beer after the eighth inning and hed gone back and bought three to hold him over to the end of the game he still had one open but untouched in the deep pocket of his coat they left the field lights on hardy squinted below to the place the man had fallen theyd stopped the game back in the seventh right in the middle of what turned out to be the giants gamewinning rally when they had two men on nobody out and will clark coming up most of the spectators had gone he figured by now it was just the cops so he got up and meandered through the seats sipping beer the area was cordoned off with yellow tape deecks was sitting slumped his legs hanging over the seat in the row in front of him the cougarrafe cougat deecks partnerwas talking to one of the techs they were getting ready to move the body hardy felt a hand on his shoulder and turned around abraham my man he said then the thought occurring to him this a murder abe glitsky grinned and the scar running through his lips lightened fifteen years before he and hardy had walked a beat together they still wrote christmas cards you see it happen abe asked no i was watching the game still fascinated by crime huh against hardys will the sarcasm rankled slightly i read the sports page sometimes the food section i get my current events across the bar glitsky jerked his head these low railings he said i mean you see kids leaning over em all the time going for fouls they ought to put up nets or something three men lifted the body bag and were carrying it over the seats another group waited on the cement stairs the gurney waited at the top of the ramp im kind of surprised you bothered to come over and check this out hardy lifted his shoulders an inch parades he said cant get enough of em a section of seats separated them from the rest of the group hardy asked why abe was here himself if it wasnt a murder glitsky pursed his lips thinking for a minute long story he said finally politics you i thought you didnt do that glitsky made a face i used to think you got political to move ahead now you need it to stay even hardy sipped at his next to last cup of beer gets to that point its too much stress thats how people live diz glitsky answered its how you stay alive hardy took a long deliberate drink is it glitskys nose flared they had come up to the concession area still away from the others the gurney yeah it is i got a wife and three kids what am i supposed to do the vehemence took hardy back a step you feel that locked in abe i dont know how i feel im trying to do my job right and not lose what i got well theres your problem hardy said trying to make it lighter youve got stuff you care about the gurney went by deecks and the cougar followed it talking quietly one of the techs came up and started saying something to glitsky he listened nodded once started walking but to answer your question he said no this wasnt a murder the gentle victim got a little overenthusiastic near the railing deecksll write it up end of story so whyd you come out glitsky sucked his teeth because like you diz i am enamored of all aspects of police work he flicked a finger at hardys cup you spare a hit of that hardy took the backup beer out of his pocket boy scout training be prepared they walked out of the park and started down cardiac hill both of them sipping beer the politics really that bad hardy asked i dont know maybe im just on the rag tonight tired this call came in i was thinking about going home so go home now yeah they got to glitskys green plymouth hardy tipped his cup back you notice beer never gets warm here its one of the great things about this ballpark glitsky squinted through the fog out toward the bay nothing gets warm here he stood without moving maybe waiting for some signal im gonna check in he said suddenly hardy eased himself up onto the cars hood waiting wondering what was abe checking in again for after he should have been home with his wife and kids five hours ago hardy didnt believe anybody had to be that much of a red hot but when glitsky came out of the car he was smiling his tight scarstretching smile serves the fucker right he said who the guy who scammed thishe motioned back to the stadiumoff on me two minutes after i left he got himself a righteous homicide ought to keep him up all night the smile tightened further you know diz i think i better see how hes doing that smacks of cruelty abe you know i believe it does they sat in the front seat and waited while glitsky got patched through carl abe what you got what do you want to know for i got done here thought you might want some help hardy heard the voice change i dont need no help abe i said want carl not need there was a pause okay sorry no we got it under control what is it white male midtwenties tentative id cochran edward shot once in the head find out where it is hardy said what hold on abe said to the radio find out where it is hardy repeated i know an ed cochran it better not be him the rookie giometti was coming back from the fence that fronted the canal you all right griffin asked the kid tried to look brave even smile but it didnt work what he looked even in the phony bright lights that had been set up for the techs and photographers was ashen his lower lip hung loosely off his mouth as though hed been hit and it had swollen his eyes still had that watery look some people get after they throw up sorry he said griffin turned back to look at the body happens to everybody you get used to it no he thought that wasnt true you dont ever get used to it what you do is get so you dont react the same way your stomach still wants to come up at you you still get that dizzy lightheaded yawing feel that youre going to go out but if you want to stay working as a homicide cop what you do is move that feeling into another plane you observe small things better maybe which keeps you from seeing the big picture that will make you sick or you deny altogether and make light of the goresomething the tv cops do so well or you just look at it say yeah and concentrate on your job then go drink it off later griffin knew all that still he put his hand on his new partners shoulder and repeated you get used to it the body lay on its side covered now with the tarp giometti kneeled down next to it you dont want to look again though griffin said i better i think he aint changed come on get up check the polaroids you want to get used to it giometti took a breath thinking about it then straightened up without lifting the tarp whyd he want to do that what griffin asked kill himself like that out here nowhere they were in a goodsized parking lot between two office buildings in china basin in the middle of the lot a car registered to edward cochran the presumed deceased sat waiting for the tow truck to take it down to the city lot griffin and giometti had looked it over finding nothing unusual in or about it except for its distance from the body why do you think he killed himself griffin wasnt senior here for nothing the boy needed some lessons giometti shrugged its pretty obvious dont you think the note the note griffin snorted he didnt know what it was but calling it a suicide note was really stretching a torn piece of paper in the front seat of the car saying im sorry ive got to that was it but he wasnt in the mood to chew out his partner the kid so he spoke calmly quietly nothings obvious vince thats our job okay take what looks obvious and find out the truth behind it the best murders in the world look like something else if they didnt nobodyd need us giometti sighed he looked at his watch carl its eleventhirty the guys got a gun by his hand there was a note i think theres a few things we can assume here yeah we can assume you want to go curl up with your wife and go goo at your new kid a pair of headlights turned into the lot then another one photographers probably if that was the case it was time to go but he wanted to make his point first get the gun vince would you giometti walked the few steps over to their car other car doors were opening and closing griffin looked over but couldnt see anything outside the perimeter of light he opened the ziplock bag and stuck a pencil into the guns barrel lifting it to his nose okay its been fired he said we knew that we didnt know it we found it next to the stiff and we assumed it and we wont know for sure til the lab gets it but griffin sniffed it again it smells like its been fired giometti rolled his eyes are we detecting now he asked looking over at the sound of footsteps hey abe glitsky nodded to the boy that the weapon he asked griffin no its a fucking garter snake what are you doing here i got a potential id yeah us too glitsky turned diz he said another man stepped out of the shadows he and glitsky walked over to the tarp they both went down to a knee and abe pulled up a corner of it the guy put his hand to his eyes something seemed to go out of his shoulders glitsky said something got a nod patted the mans back as he stood up he walked heavily back to griffin and giometti we got a positive he said mind if i look at the gun a minute griffin handed it over by the pencil its been fired giometti said glitsky missing the joke glanced at him blankly then sighted down the barrel backward into the chambers yeah twice he said hardy and glitsky sat in the plymouth in the parking lot the heater made a lot of noise but didnt do much for the temperature or the fog on the windows the only thing left to be done in the lot was towing ed cochrans car and the tow guy was here now seeing to it glitsky rolled his window down and watched without much enthusiasm it was better than looking at his friend these guys had worked together partied some got along but most of it was on the flip side when part of the work got to somebody it made glitsky nervous he glanced across at his expartner hardy was leaning against his door arm up along the window jamb bent at the elbow his hand rubbing at his temples his eyes were closed the tow guy came over and asked glitsky if there would be anything else they sat in the car hearing the sound of the tow truck dissipate into the still night then there was only the heater which wasnt doing any good anyway glitsky turned the engine off hardy let out a long breath opening his eyes just cant hide can you he asked it comes back and gets you sometimes hardy would say things like that if you stuck with him glitsky knew hed get around to saying it in english but this time hardy said fuck it it was nothing glitsky rolled up his window you want a lift home hardy motioned with his head i got my car abe yeah i know maybe you want company hardy stared into the foggedup windshield after michael he stopped he rubbed a hand over an eye glitsky looked away again giving him the space michael had been hardys son whod died in his infancy anyway i told myself i wouldnt feel this shit anymore he shook his head as though clearing it whod want to kill eddie he asked glitsky just nodded that was always the question and it was easier talking about cases than trying to find some reason for the deaths of people you cared about so glitsky followed that line you see him recently this guy eddie he say anything anything like what i saw him a couple of weeks ago up at his place he said a lot of things i mean anything to indicate troubles somebody pissed off at him maybe depressed himself hardy looked away from the dashboard what are you talking about depressed glitsky shrugged into his coat guys dead alone in a parking lot with a bullet in his head and a gun in his hand possible he did himself hardy took it in said no it isnt okay just a thought itll occur to griffin what is he two weeks on the force he rolled the window down and looked across the lot nobody comes out a place like this to kill themselves people take people here and kill them or meet here and kill them there was no moon the fog hung still a streetlight behind them caught the lot in its muted garish yellowing pool hardy was right glitsky thought this was an execution spot besides hardy continued eddie wouldnt kill himself he wasnt as they say the type he rolled the window back up all right glitsky said you knew him put it out of your mind abe it flat didnt happen im not arguing but hardy was staring into the middle distance again unhearing he abruptly jerked open the car door i better get going he turned to abe ill probably be in touch hardy came up to the doors where he worked and pushed his way through moses who hadnt been home was at the bar six closersfour at the rail and two at one tablewere passing the time until last call willie nelson was singing stardust on the jukebox no one was throwing darts hardy stood a minute taking it in home as much as anything could be hey diz moses automatically started a guinness for him what are you doing here sent lynne home early felt like tending some bar hardy pulled up a stool in front of the spigots reaching over he stopped the flow of the stout the glass had gotten about twothirds full what am i supposed to do with that now moses asked his weathered face creased with laugh lines that hardy knew wouldnt get much use in the next weeks you losing weight again you stop drinking guinness my business goes to hell hardy couldnt think of a damn thing to say he cleared his throat took off his hat and put it on the bar you hear anything from frannie tonight moses started to answer you know its funny she called here maybe stopping short what happened hardy held up a hand shes okay moses let out a breath frannie was about ninety percent of everything he cared about what then hardy met his eyes okay just say it he told himself but moses asked eddie okay she called to see if he was here we gotta go up there mose eddies dead moses didnt move he squinted for a beat what do you mean he asked dead hardy turned on his stool he slapped the bar okay guys lets suck em up he said were closing early he got up went behind the bar and sat moses down on the stool back there he was hearing the beginnings of the usual drunks stupid moanings about how they needed last call and it wasnt fair he lifted the shillelagh an endknotted twofoot length of dense kentucky ash from its hook under the counter and ducked back out front of the bar he tapped the bar a couple of times hard making sure he had their attention dont even suck em then were closed and youre all outside now everybody moved hardy had wielded the stick before and most of them had seen it he glanced at moses lets go buddy he said quietly lets go tell frannie chapter three all twelve trucks were parked in their spots behind the squat building that was the office of army distributing at a backboard against the building a tall black man named alphonse page shot hoops he was a rangy semiyouth with a hair net wrapped around his head his shirt off revealing a hairless and flat chest and hightopped generic tennis shoes his fatigue pants were doubled up at the cuffs showing six or seven inches of shiny thoroughbred leg between his white socks and his knees the backboard was set flush against the building making layups all but impossible although if you swished the basket just right you could get a reasonable bounce back into the key and follow up with maybe an inside hook a fading orange datsun pulled into the lot around the trucks then behind the building back by the wrapping shed alphonse stopped shooting and began dribbling all his weight on his right foot bouncing the ball slowly about once a second and waited for linda polk to appear from around the building which she did in under a minute he fell in next to her dribbling as she crossed the court nobody much around he said daddys not in a note of desperation of hope long since abandoned shi but wheres eddie no show he aint here by six everybody went home she seemed to take in the information like someone who was almost certain they had a terminal disease finding out for sure she stopped walking the sun atypically strong this early morning was behind them glaring off the building you mean nobodys here nobody at all alphonse the basketball held easily against his hip with one hand pointed his other hand in toward himself hey what am i he said no offense alphonse offered her his white teeth except for some acne his long smooth face was not unattractive his skin was very black his nose was thin his lips were sensually thick there was a light sheen of sweat from the workout and his longish hair which linda thought his worst feature was held in by the net no offense alphonse repeated linda sighed so what happened to the papers alphonse began dribbling again walking next to her the papers werent his problem aint too many anyway they rounded the building in front of the warehouse linda could see the morning newspapers still wrapped from their publishers without la hora they made a pitifully poor pile in front of the corrugated iron door linda drew up again and sighed so i guess thats really it she said she threw her head back looking to the sky for help and finding none she moaned i wish daddyd come in yeah thats what im waiting for and eddie didnt come in at all did he call alphonse smiled again i dont do the phones sugar they had come to the glass front doors linda got out her keys and let them in alphonse followed her across the small entryway into her office which was in front of her fathers she went behind the desk and sat down alphonse dribbled on the linoleum floor the sound of the ball bouncing flat and harsh was interrupted by the telephone ringing maybe thats daddy linda said she answered with a hopeful army distributing and then said yes a couple of times when she hung up the terminal illness had progressed that was the police she said and alphonse felt an emptiness suddenly appear in his stomach they want to come by here and ask some questions alphonse plumped heavily quickly onto the arm of the leatherette sofa what about they said eddie she stopped what about eddie they said hes like dead she fumbled at the desk for a couple of seconds then reached into her purse for a cigarette id better call daddy she said mostly to herself the cigarette was misshapen and half burned down alphonse nodded knowingly to himself as she lit the end and inhaled deeply holding it in he got up crossed to the desk and held out his hand cops be comin they better not smell that linda still held her breath in handing him the joint she let out a long slow stream of smoke so well open the windows you callin your daddy id better she said yeah you better alphonse said i gotta talk to him too the police had already arrived at franniesone blackandwhite and another supposedly unmarked plymouth parked closely behind it the light over the doorway was on hardy and moses could see shadows moving in the corner window hardy had decided he wouldnt go in he left moses and drove on home he let himself into his house pushing hard swearing against the stuck front door the house had been cold the only light came from the muted glow of the aquarium in his bedroom he must have stared at the fish awhile sitting on his bed his greek sailors hat pulled down and his coat collar up he didnt remember all he knew was that now it was morning bright sunlight streaming through his bedroom window was falling across his face the coat was bunched under and around him the hat flattened under his neck hardy rolled onto his back staring at the ceiling it came back to him in a floodthe vision of eddie on his side three feet from some nondescript china basin building a black pool under him this wasnt supposed to happen this wasnt vietnam anymore eddie wasnt into anything heavy he was a regular guy a kid and this kind of stuff didnt happen to regular guys before sure hardy had lived for a while in that lifeanddeath reality where things happened all the time vietnam partnering with glitsky on their beat even his short time with the das office but hed passed on all that a long time ago now his life didnt need any adrenaline kick start you cared too much and it came back and got you now you had your job not your yuppie career that ate up your time and your insides but someplace you went and did reasonable work and got paid and came home and forgot about you had a couple of buddies moses and pico did just fine you drank a little and sometimes a little more but it was mostly topshelf goods or stout and you kept it under control everything elseambition love commitment whatever that meantwas kid stuff kids like eddie maybe who essentially didnt get it the way hardy thought he now finally got it hardy had been through it the kid stuff elements werent real they were crutches blinders to keep you from seeing hardyd proved that by getting away from all of them and surviving he got along okay maybe he skimmed over the surface but at least he avoided deep shoals hidden reefs monsters lurking in the depths sure diz he thought thats why you went to cabo cause everything was so peachy cause fulfillment was the very essence of your existence goddamn it hardy laid his arm up over his eyes shielding the sun goddamn it eddie the problem was why was he feeling now like he had to do something anything at all to make some sense out of this he shouldnt have let eddie or eddie and frannie get inside of him he hadnt seen it coming so hadnt been prepared for it hed thought hed kept them outside enoughacquaintances not friends eddie was gone and nothing was going to change that still something nudged him hurting almost like a cramp or a screw turning in his heart he moaned and sat up in bed the beginning four and a half years before new years eve frannie mcguire still a few months shy of the legal twentyone but damned if hardy was going to card her with madness raging all around and only swelling as the night wore on frannie nursed a few rum and cokes at the bar hardy in what he called his fun mode pounded down everything in sightbeer scotch tequila gin yahoo and nobody to drive that party animal hardy home except the quiet little redheaded very much younger sister of his boss moses sitting in front of his house then the party overreally over and enough juice in him to forget that all of his own kid stuff was in his past that he didnt care about any of that not coming on to her but spilling his gutsthe whole thingand finally passing out he guessed without so much as kissing her or even trying waking up a cold dawn his arms around her waist his head cradled in her lap on the front seat of his old ford and before he dropped her off back at her dorm she said i hope i meet someone like you dismas before life eats him up id marry him in a minute she did his name was eddie cochran and after about three dates she appeared with him at the shamrock took hardy aside and whispered remember what i said as though shed only said one thing to him before in her life but hed known what she meant one sunday afternoon a barbecue at mosess apartment up on the roof looking over the haightashbury the what hardy had asked get out of here big brothers frannie telling hardy it wouldnt have been like eddie to mention it he didnt preachhe just did hey its one day a week diz eddie had said in defense gimme a break maybe do some good couldnt hurt anyway it sure could hardy thought it could hurt you you fool most likely your little brother will wind up taking a chip out of your heart but he didnt try to argue with eddiethere wasnt much arguing with eddie on anything but hardy had said you think you can make a real difference dont you the twohundredwatt smile that wasnt a puton i doubt it except what got to hardy was that underneath it all eddie didnt doubt it he thought everything he did mattered a lot that he personally really could make a difference it reminded hardy of the way he thought he used to be himself like eddie long time ago rose stood at the top of the steps by the back door of the rectory father dietrick was crossing the parking lot head down returning from bringing father cavanaugh the news bless them both but it was going to be a hard month june was always a hard month in san francisco it felt like god had given his promise in the spring and then taken it back this morning rose had thought it would stay bright and sunny but already the fog was on them again she wiped her hands on her apron her eyes came up to meet the young priest questioning he sighed not too well he said he took off though he wasnt yet thirty he mounted the stoop like an old man rose followed him inside just took off he sat at the kitchen table his hands folded in front of him rose brought over a cup of coffee three sugars and a drop of cream you know father cavanaugh he said sipping the coffee there wasnt an easy way to say it he stood there getting out of his vestments and i thought id try to make him sit down but as soon as i asked him to he knew something had happened im sure you did whats best father father dietrick sighed for a minute it was as though id hit him then he looked down at his hands at the vestments and just ripped the surplice off rose made a note to go pick up the surplice shed just sew it back up and no one would be the wiser she pulled up a chair next to father and ventured a pat on his hand you know how he is father he gets upset and its like the priest in him gives up for a minute he has to let something go it doesnt mean anything i know but maybe i should have gone with him rose knew what father dietrick meant father cavanaugh was a bit of a rogue priest it was she was sure why hed never made monsignor not that hed ever done anything seriously wrong shoplifting that one time occasionally a little too much whiskey but sure that was the good mans weakness hell probably go scream at the ocean she said and lord why shouldnt he losing someone close enough to be his own son father had a temper but he was still a beautiful man and a fine priest all the more human for his faults she thought let him scream at the oceanhe had a right jesus himself had a temper didnt he throw the money changers out of the temple but thiseddie cochrans deathwould not have loosed his temper it would have broken his heart i know where hes gone rose said suddenly over to see erin the priest acted like he didnt know who she was talking about she sighed exasperated come now father youve got to learn to see things erin cochran eddies mother hell need to be with her you think so rose bit her tongue and said only id bet so father she didnt say what she also knew that hed need to be with her because he loved her the water was a long way down slate gray through the fog jim cavanaugh shivering leaned out over the railing of the golden gate bridge his teeth were clenched to keep them from chattering whether it was the cold or everything else he should have grabbed a coat before rushing from the church but hed had to get outget out now before he broke down in front of dietrick so it had happened eddie was dead and erin what would become of erin now he knew he ought to go see her but would she want to see him would she ever forgive him could he be a priest to the cochran family ever again last week he had tried to kiss her to tell her it had been a temporary weakness that was all but it had made a breach between them and now this with eddie the family would need him he would have to be there now for them all the kiss her rejection and his flash of anger at her now they could all be forgotten she would forgive him he could live again he put his hands in his pockets and began walking back toward the tollbooths chapter four hardy had loved his suzuki samurai when hed bought it but since learning that it tended to roll in strong winds or on weak grades he had renamed it the seppuku now he parked it at the corner of tenth and lincoln the fleeting sun that had gotten him up had long since disappeared the fog the june freeze insinuated itself into every corner out here swirling gusting hardy pulled his pea coat up around his neck now he was staring at the sign over his place of employment the little shamrock established in he found himself marveling at mans originality the sign cleverly was shaped like a shamrock the sign itself had been established in its spot over the swinging double doors in and the green paint had chipped enough over the years that the sign at night now read le rock maybe it was a good thing hardy reflected the shape of the sign if it had been shaped like gibraltar people would think the bar was named the rock or some french word that meant rock le rock maybe they should paint the l to look like a capital letter maybe they should have the neon repaired altogether but no he thought it fit the shamrock the bar wasnt exactly rundown but it didnt place too much emphasis on fixing itself up it was a neighborhood bar and moses mcguire hardys friend and boss the owner of the place didnt believe in attracting an unwanted element tourists with too many ferns video games or flashy signs the shamrock was an irish dart bar as nonpolitical as any of them got it poured an honest sometimes more than honest shot and did a respectable business with locals both male and female hardy had worked days there tuesday through saturday two to eight for over seven years every night hardy worked moses mcguire followed him from six until closing at two and then until hed rung out and cleaned up sometimes having an afterhours drink sundays and mondays a thirtyish ravenhaired beauty named lynne leish with an eighteeninch waist and more than twice that on either side worked double shifts and brought in a crowd of her own but she was a good bartender a pro at it moses mcguire would have no other kind it wasnt yet noon most days hardy would arrive to open the bar and get it set up in ten or fifteen minutes today between his thoughts and the memory that theyd closed without the usual cleanup last night he thought hed come down and kill some time so he wiped the bar took the peels cleanly off the lemons with an ice pick cut up the limes checked the wells and stocked the back bar he ran himself half a morning guinness and whipped up the cream for the hated socalled irish coffee for which he cursed stan delaplane the buena vista bar and the dublin airport there were some glasses and bottles out front left from the hurried exit of the night before some of the tables hadnt been wiped down the cash register it hadnt been rung out he refilled his pint glass to the halfway again somebody knocked while he was counting the money through the door he saw that it was a retired schoolteacher a regular named tommy who ought to know better two oclock hardy yelled holding up two fingers tommy nodded and shuffled on by past the front window hardy went back to ringing out he looked at his watch slow down he told himself but he didnt in five more minutes he was ready to open he sat at the stool behind the bar time weighing a ton and not getting lighter he didnt want to have that time to think about the unaccustomed restlessness inside him about ambition where love had gone especially he didnt want to think about the ridiculous idealist eddie cochran and his wife frannie he didnt want to think that it might be important to help her in some way maybe keep her from losing what hed lost the inside pocket of his pea coat hanging on its peg at the end of the rail held his darts the leather case velvetlined worked on him like worry beads as he rubbed it gently passed it from hand to hand finally he opened it on the bar the three gram tungsten beauties sat in their slots awaiting their flights the paleblue dartembossed bits of plastic that hardy had made himself and that in turn made those hunks of metal fly true carefully he emptied the case and fitted the flights to the darts over at the board he threw some rounds not really aiming not really shooting just throwing three darts walk to the board and remove them walk back to the chalk line do it again sometimes stop for a sip of guinness it didnt matter where they hit although even without trying hardy put all the darts in the pie bounded by and with in the middle hardy in the bar by himself throwing darts hardy behind the bar looked at the lined face of his friend the oftbroken nose the mountain mans beard mcguires eyes were shot with red moses had gotten his phd in philosophy from cal berkeley when his deferment had run out he hadnt viewed being drafted as the tragedy many others hadhe was a philosopher and believed that one of lifes seminal experiences was war as it turned out the war tempered both his philosophical bent and his intellectual appreciation of men killing each other and anything else that moved he was two years older than hardy and back then only two steps slower which hardy had told him six hundred times explained his getting hit in both legs at chi leng while hardy made it to cover only to turn around and carry moses back out picking up some lead in his own shoulder in the process so tritely moses felt he owed hardy his life when hardy had changed careers moses had been there with the shamrock and owing him his life had made a place for hardy in the rotation something he would have done for no one else with the possible exception of his sister frannie so hardy asked finally mcguire looked into his glass found it empty twirled it between his thumb and forefinger the bar still hadnt opened hardy reached to the top shelf behind him and brought down a bottle of the macallan the best scotch in the house if not the world he refilled mosess glass this afternoon i gotta go see about getting the body taken care of frannies in no shape to do it especially after all the cops they were all over the place wouldnt leave her alone why so many cops you think hardy the excop said reports bureaucracy bullshit someone came and pounded at the door to the bar still locked lets go where they cant see us hardy suggested they went back to the storeroom cases of bottled beer lined two of the walls on a third wooden shelves held assorted bottles of liquor napkins peanuts dart flights other bar paraphernalia against the back wall was the stainlesssteel freezer for the perishables that more than once had held the fish hardy would bring by after a successful trip mcguire lifted himself onto it the thing is there doesnt seem to have been any reason for it i mean specific heres a kid got the world on a string what the hell whyd he want to kill himself who said that that eddied killed himself well nobody exactly but but what shit diz you know they find him in a lot with a gun in his own hand what do you think happened hardy leaned against the back wall i dont think anything its not my job youre a warm human being you know that diz come on mose you know or maybe you dont that the police really do a number on any death especially violent death they dont just call something a suicide out of the blue they check into itmotives opportunity all that they really do i mean even an old man they find who died in his sleep they check out so what do you think happened you think somebody killed eddie you think he killed himself you knew eddie hardy kicked at some debris on the floor yeah i knew him im sure not saying he killed himself but the cops arent either are they not yet believe me they wont why wont they it could be it could have been right hardy scratched at nothing on his leg mose ive been a cop right takes more than a gun in somebodys hand maybe there was more hardy felt a chill somewhere behind him was moses hiding something what do you know i dont know anything but moses was looking down its bad luck to lie to your friends hardy said what do you know moses fidgeted his heels hitting against the freezer its probably nothing probably but what anyway just that eddie has been a little down been in the bar a little more than normal that kind of thing hardy waited you know they planned things frannie and eddie not like you and me they had this savings plan all that for when he went back to school moses was still struggling with it sipping at some scotch for something to do anyway his jobs been fucked up lately maybe ending it looked like they werent going to have enough money or what they planned on anyway i offered to loan him some but you know eddie and you think eddie might have killed himself over a little money come on mose not the eddie we knew yeah i know but the cops might think it i mean with that and the possible note abeglitskytold me the note was bullshit just some old trash in the car i dont know it might be im just thinking that the note along with the other stuff well if they do it doesnt really matter does it it isnt going to bring him back yeah but it matters it matters they dont call it a suicide hardy suddenly felt very tired why mose thinking he knew what his friend was going to say next frannie mostly i guess moses slid off the freezer and spun his glass empty again if they he ran his fingers hard across his forehead shit this is hard if what if they come up with suicide i mean think about frannie rejected for good know what i mean and theres also some money involved hardy cocked his head to one side insurance policy doesnt pay on a suicide though theres double indemnity on violent or accidental death the policy was for a hundred grand diz and i dont want to see frannie screwed shes already been through enough well hardy said then lets hope he didnt kill himself he didnt hardy said nothing i just want to i dont know protect frannies interests i guess feel like im doing something hardy figured moses had been reading his mail i dont know what you can do be there for her what else i thought id ask you if youd watch what the police do make it your job for a week or two take a few weeks off here and just check it out hardy couldnt bring himself to look at his friend who kept talking i mean you used to be a cop and all you know the procedures mose i was a street cop a couple years before law school thats a long way from homicide still you could find out some things make sure theyre doing it right i dont think so i dont do that anymore he looked down and im out of guinness fuck the guinness and fuck you the two stared it down well i dont know mose maybe ill ask around a little thats all no promises okay but i want to pay you and ill pay you for the time off anyway dont pay me that makes it like a job thats what makes you tick hardy call something your job how about i do it for frannie and whatll you live on spongecake man shrimp and guinness same as now mcguire threw a round how about twentyfive percent of this place the shamrock mcguire looked around yeah thats this place hardy sat down on that drummed his fingers on a table why dont we first wait and see what the cops come up with and what if thats suicide hardy threw a dart i dont know he said i guess i could look into it chapter five carl griffin knew he had to get over it but it wasnt easy hed gone up for his performance review on monday yesterday knowing that his performance had been more than adequate and knowing it might not matter at all glitsky and batiste a mulatto and a latin surnamechrist he loved that frank being as absolutely white as he waswere also up for promotion and there was a formal mandate in the entire city and county bureaucracy to move minorities up he thanked god there wasnt a gay guy in homicide hed be a shooin for the next lieutenant on the other hand maybe griffin should announce that he was gay was coming out of the closet and because of his new status should be acclaimed the next lieutenant so hed entered the office for his review with a bit of a chip on his shoulder what he actually said was look i got any chance for this or not cause if not lets cut the bullshit and ill go back to work and frazelli had looked over at rigby the chief and theyd both gotten that uncomfortable expression that seemed to come with upper management passing it along to carls union rep jamie zacharias who had said if glitsky or batiste fuck up at all youre in so carl before hed even sat down found his interview over what had they been planning to talk about he wondered hed gotten the bottom line out of them in about a second waiting for glitsky or batiste to fuck up would be like waiting for one of them to die eventually they would but you didnt want to set your watch by it maybe he should have asked if abe or frank had done anything better than he did were better cops but he knew it wasnt that they had to pick somebody and in todays san francisco if that somebody was a honky on any level there had better be a compelling reason this was a city where people like ralph nader and cesar chavez were considered nearfascists by some hell griffin had interviewed people who believed that karl marx himself had been right wing because he hadnt invented womens lib while he was at it along with communism so hed stomped out slamming the door then sulked in his cubicle the rest of the day leaving his interviews to giometti then letting abe follow up the candlestick stiff which left him the only logical choice when an hour later the call from down in china basin had come in now carl griffin was sitting in his car outside his partner vince giomettis apartment on noe street the fog almost completely obscured the streetlight at the intersection in front of him forty yards away the steam from the cup of doggie diner coffee clouded the windshield the stuff seemed to stay hot about half a day maybe it was the acid they put in it his partner and he had been up until after two breaking it to the wife so today was starting late he honked his horn again cmon kid put your pecker back in your pants and come to work christ he thought they ought not to let homicide guys be married so what if he was marriedit wasnt anything to talk about it had never kept him home and never would that was for sure he kept thinking about instinct if there was one thing that separated the good cops from the very good it was instinct you didnt want to overdo it griffin knew and ignore evidence but every once in a while a situation came up that seemed to point in an obvious direction and your instinct made you stop and reevaluate glitsky was up for lieutenant he was up for lieutenant frank batiste likewise okay so at this moment one of those two was standing in the roadway trying to direct traffic point griffin in the obvious direction nine years a homicide cop and not once before had abe glitsky showed up at a scene with his two cents worth why do you think that could be maybe glitsky knew something he didnt know okay the cochran kid could have done himself maybe not but why would it benefit glitsky if he griffin came down for a homicide which was the direction glitsky was pointing did he know something who was that guy he brought to the scene giometti cleanly shaved smiling opened the door he had a thermos of what was probably fresh coffee with him a paper bag full of goodies want a bagel carl he said something tells me cochran might have done himself he replied he took the bagel but the gun was fired twice yeah i know first time couldve been three weeks ago two months a year even and the wife said wives dont know how their husbands feel about squat giometti he could tell was thinking about saying something and decided against it he chewed his bagel what changed your mind he finally asked damned if griffin was going to tell him everything people talked even partners word got around it would be good for glitskys career if he fucked up and glitsky was pushing him okay subtly but it was thereto decide it was a homicide and glitsky he was sure knew something he didnt something that led in another direction put it together carl he told himself make damn sure youre not being set up instinct griffin said charles gings nose was a map of capillaries and his breath smelled like gin his son didnt often get close enough to smell him but now leaning over the blond desk in his fathers office it was nearly overpowering he was leaning over in anger his own face was smooth as though he hadnt started shaving yet his eyes were pale blue hair light brown he was impeccably dressed in an italian suit what he was saying was its beyond me absolutely you think youre doing the right thing youre the nice guy doing everybody a favor its bullshit man what youre doing is gambling with my future and dont reach for the goddamn bottle please ging shrank back into his padded chair i dont like you to use that tone of voice to me peter the hell with my tone of voice listen to what im saying will you we get blackballed by the catholic church and i am personally screwed you understand that of course but were not going to be peter slammed the desk yes we are dont you see that times are changed not changing changed past tense you dont play straight it ever comes out youre dead and it doesnt matter to you youre already finished me i gave up being a doctor to get this place continue the clean business of covering people with dirt and now you put the whole thing on the line for what for a favor to some asshole owns a bar jesus it kills me the telephone on the desk rang the older man went to pick it up his son put his hand on the receiver let the machine get it would you its after hours he looked down at the hand covering his fathers jesus pop the machine clicked they heard the woman on the recorder another voice struggling for control calling for arrangements it almost didnt register for peter anymore he thought for the hundredth time maybe hed made a mistake deciding to take over the business the endless parade of grief still got to his dad and look what it did to the guy when he finally died hed already be pickled either that or if they went to cremate him hed go up like an alcohol lamp charles reached for the bottle again and peter let himeven grabbed a couple of ice cubes from the refrigerator dilute it a little maybe it would help then he sat down after the first sip his father sighed what do you want me to do pete tell the guy who i happen to know that theres nothing i can do his brotherinlaw apparently killed himself and the church says he cant be buried in holy ground you call that charity fuck charity this is business and peter suddenly knew he couldnt deal with the business on this level much longer he had to get his dad out of it the man didnt see reality anymore look pop you tell this guy whats his name mcguire right you tell mcguire theres a chance its not a suicide you think thats the end of it there is a chance its not a suicide you saw the powder burns the wound the whole thing the guy shot himself still theres a chance he didnt so you tell cavanaugh theres reasonable doubt i didnt tell him that father cavanaugh and i go back a long way he told me he guaranteed it wasnt a suicide the boy was like a son to him and jim cavanaugh and i we understand each other and its all good old boy isnt it you defraud the church cavanaugh goes along with it nobody loses right i know you dont agree but right the son looked at the father shook his head the father lifted his glass and drained it hardy his shift over back at home in early dusk was looking at a picture of himself and abe glitsky in uniform glitskys broad unlined forehead he decided was the only part of his face that couldnt terrify the rest of it could keep small children awake with nightmareshatchet nose overlarge sunken cheeks eyes whose whites were perennially red thin lips with a scar through them upper to lower the result of a teenage parallel bars accident although glitsky told his fellow cops it was an old knife wound abe chewed ice on the telephone sometimes he was easier to talk to when you werent looking at him hardy heard the ice crunching like rocks glitsky chewed some more and hardy pictured him tipping up a styrofoam cup and hitting the bottom to loosen the last of the ice he kept chewing hardy blew again on a cup of espresso at his kitchen table he waited thinking glitsky could make an ice cube last as long as a stick of juicy fruit id just like to see the pm check the file see if im missing something hardy said glitsky must have flicked at the nearempty cup yeah i know what you want come on abe im not getting paid for this it all comes down to insurance for the widow id rather have you guys find it a homicide and thats what moses wants me to check into i have no interest beyond that you dont think were competent to do that to find that out cause thats what it sounds like youre saying and that kind of pisses me off hardy sighed are we a little defensive here in our declining years or what abe chewed on some more ice you dont understand what its like here lately yeah but im not asking for much either youre asking to get in somebodys face around their investigation thats pretty much well then you do it for me glitsky laughed yeah thatd work hardy knew that the humor he heard wouldnt ever get to his eyes do you even know what weve got why dont you wait a day or two if its a homicide well likely decide its a homicide i know that and dont brownnose me hardy had forgotten that hed never been much good at getting things by glitsky he was beginning to remember look abe he said its not like im a private investigator wanting to go around you guys id just like a little information thats all thats the line huh its the line but its also the goddamn truth glitsky flicked at his styrofoamrattattat rattattat griffin and i arent exactly sleeping together he said youll have to play it very straight i just want to meet the guy hardy said ill dazzle him with my irish charm chapter six the sun had come out the morning was beginning to get warm hardy took off his sweater before he got to his car he felt slightly nauseous he had felt it was his duty to look at the body again hed seen quite a lot of blood in vietnam before he himself had been hit in the shoulder as a cop hed run across his share but he was far from hardened to the effects of metal passing through flesh at high speed they hadnt yet dressed it hardy had started at the toes and worked up eddie had been fiveten about pounds he had an old healed moonshaped scar about three inches long on his upper right thigh calluses on the tips of the fingers of his left hand a fairly new bruise on his left forearm and a small scratch near his left ear just under the hole the bullet had made going in he drove up mission street with the windows open the radio in his suzuki wasnt working but still hardy tried to turn it on three times in the thirty blocks between gings mortuary and his destination the damage done by the tiny piece of lead kept jumping up behind his eyes shortcircuiting other connections the parking lot was between a local office of the pacific telephone company and the cruz publishing company the lot was now filled with cars hardy had a hard time for a moment remembering what it had looked like empty this was industrial wasteland without a house around railroad tracks train yards glass stone and cement he parked along the curb letting the site work itself into his consciousness the sun was hot now and glared off the side of the cruz building arturo cruz stopped dictating and dismissed his secretary then gave all his attention to the two men six floors below him in the parking lot immediately he knew it had been a mistake to send jeffrey to get rid of the copit must be another cop jeffrey was too young inexperienced loyal as a dog a body to die for but not by any stretch a jackofalltrades jeffrey was having a conversation with the man showing him around the long narrow lot that was now filled with the cars of cruzs employees his publication was a newspaper called la hora which catered to the large latino population of san francisco it was an intensely competitive market and to make it you had to do things that maybe when you started out would have bothered you now the point was youd done them and it wasnt good luck to have too many policemen making themselves at home in your parking lot the other night then yesterday had been bad enough cruz turned from the window and decided to go down himself to see what was what the back of the lot was bounded by a cyclone fence eight feet high but entrance by the front was wide open the canal now at medium tide ran parallel to the back fence perhaps thirty feet from the buildings between the fence and the canal was a nomansland of shrubbery and debris hardy leaned against the fence at the end of the tenfootwide corridor between the last row of cars and the building squinting he had brought his old badgeillegal but helpfuland was making what he thought was a little progress with a boy named jeffrey jeffrey had already admitted that hed known ed cochran just to talk to he had no doubtand hardy briefly wondered whyeddie had killed himself what stumped jeffrey was why he had gotten out of his car with a loaded gun and walked forty or fifty feet to almost lean against the building and shoot himself it was a point hardy hadnt considered hardy looked around thinking for a fact it couldnt have been for the view everything under control jeffrey hardy looked into the glare where the voice had come from you must be mr cruz he said sorry to keep having to inconvenience you but theres always this kind of thing in a violent death he kept talking jeffrey was just showing me where the body was found pretty bad was it cruz cocked his head hesitating he wasnt older than thirtyfive and he radiated both authority and good health black perfectly styled hair capped a face with a slightly arabic cast but his eyes or perhaps his contact lenses were light hazel and his skin though tan was fair his mouth turned in disgust it was pretty bad he said hardy smiled they probably covered this yesterday but you know bureaucracies cruz understanding nodded to hardy he dismissed jeffrey with a look anything to help he said though hardy thought he appeared nervous jeffrey said it was near here the body but theres no sign of it now at all it was right here he said they had it cleaned up by the time we got to work the next morning was anyone still in the building cruz was scrutinizing hardy his expression still wary but he answered quickly enough no i dont believe so we dont encourage overtime i know the lot was empty except for my car when i went home and when was that i dont know for sure i told the other inspector yesterday maybe eight or eightthirty it was still light out at hardys questioning glance he volunteered i was the last one to leave i always am bosses hours hardy grabbed at another straw any chance that someone who didnt drive to work was in the building cruz waited as though he expected hardy to say more slim i would say gossip being what it is i imagine it would have gotten around by now still if it will help ill be glad to circulate a memo hardy had noticed that the corner of the cyclone mesh fence had a gaping hole in it is this new again there was that pause no weve been meaning to fix it for months i assume some kids did it to get to the canal saves going the long way hardy dutifully noted on his pad thinking what kids the gravel and asphalt had been recently and carefully raked obliterating any possible sign of struggle hardy walked to the edge of the building and peered along its mirrored surface he squatted for a different angle then walked along the length of the building running his palm along the glass to the side door he turned to cruz well well try not to bother you again cruzs first smile revealed a perfect set of teeth too perfect to be real he held out his hand if i can be of any more help hardy asked did you by any chance know ed the pause when it ended was clipped who ed cochran the guy who died no cruz said now without missing a beat no im afraid not should i have at his car hardy looked back and saw that cruz had returned to the hole in the fence and was standing hands in his pocket shaking his head from side to side hardy hadnt gone to the cruz building for any other reason than to see the site in daylight and within a couple of minutes had found himself talking to the president of the company no wonder his questions he thought had been so random at blanches a rickety canalside café and art gallery the campari umbrella offered shade from the sun but couldnt do much about the glare coming up off the canal hardy sipped at a club soda not bothering to turn away from the canals glare and thought about this guy cruzs obsessive concern over his parking lot and his obvious lie about not knowing ed cochran hardy wiped the sweat and squinted into the citys earlyafternoon haze a small breeze carried on it the smell of roasting coffee and burning engine oil and hardy wondered what the fuck he was doing carl griffin stood by the one window that afforded a view of the building across the way and four flights down of the alley that ran between the parking lot and bryant yesterday he and giometti had dealt some more with the wife and the kids family then cruz then driven down to army distributing which looked like it was close to going out of business they didnt have a lockedup reason for cochran to have killed himself but neither did anything much indicate a homicide there had been two empty chambers in the gun but hed encountered that beforeone shot where you jerk the gun away just as you fire before you get up the guts to go through with it the next time it was a draga young guy acing himselfespecially dealing with the relatives but it happened a lot more often younger guys than anybody else he pushed some papers off to one side of his desk where the hell was giometti now he was hungry he tried but wasnt having much luck getting himself motivated to think about this guy cochran what difference did it make he could solve the murder of the century and all hed get for it would be a good job carl want to do another one he decided to fuck waiting on giometti and go downstairs and have a hero sandwich he grabbed for his windbreaker which he wouldnt need out of habit just as his phone rang he picked it up carl joe frazelli said i got a friend of glitskys here got some questions about the cochran thing you got a minute for him thats what he needed he thought he needed to help out a friend of glitskys on one of his cases i was just going down to get a sandwich thanks ill send him over frazelli said hanging up swear to god griffin thought if im ever looie im not going to do shit like that he threw his windbreaker on its peg and turned back to the window it looked like a nice day out there even a hot one he pushed at the windowsill trying to open it an inch or two for some sea breeze but it was painted shut inspector griffin he turned it was the guy from the other night they shook hands the guy introducing himself and carl offered him a seat asking what he could do for him im kind of a representative of the family the man began the family ed cochrans his wifes actually you private the man shook his head smiling almost rehearsed resting his elbows on his knees very relaxed im a bartender youre a bartender griffin repeated the little shamrock out on lincoln okay griffin said anyway ed cochrans brotherinlaw owns the place and i work for him thats the connection good we got a connection what are you representing them for hardy sat back crossing one leg over the other pulling a cuff down theyd just like to make some official request that this be investigated as a possible homicide it is being investigated as a homicide this is the homicide department im a homicide inspector i realize that hardy said but i know it looks like a suicide like it was a suicide initially griffin said but maybe it wasnt griffin moved a few more papers trying to cover his impatience maybe it wasnt youre right thats my job finding out if it was or wasnt you got anything to make me think it wasnt nothing specific specifics what we like griffin said how about general you had to know the guy i guess that called for no response and griffin waited it out his wife i mean he wasnt the kind of person who kills himself he wasnt it was hard to keep the sarcasm out griffin had seen suicides from derelicts to socialites from healthy beautiful teenage girls to terminally ill wheelchair patients ill note that in the file he said hardy uncrossed his legs its not as ridiculous as it sounds he said not defensive as though he at least understood how it sounded some people get depressed you know life gets em down there s some warning i thought it might help to know that edon the outsidewas a positive guy look mr hardy mr hardy we go on the assumption i know the routine inspector i used to be a cop i was hoping you might go a little beyond the routine in this case griffin felt his face getting red go beyond the routine for a friend of abe glitskys whos implying im not doing my job well enough go beyond the routine when no matter how good i am i wont get promoted over any black or latino or woman or fucking police dog if they had any constituency in the city and was glitsky somehow tied in to this siccing a cop on him i dont really like the implication there griffin said im not implying anything or dont mean to be seems to me youre saying my routine wont get the job done right im saying that knowing what kind of guy ed was might put things in a different light thats all yeah it might ill keep it in mind griffin stood up so did hardy so hows glitsky involved hardy shrugged it off i just know him i started with him yeah well this is my case so you can tell abe if he wants it he can go through channels hardy held his hands out look abes got nothing to do with this im a citizen im here with a reasonable request thats it griffin studied the guys face no sign he was lying which might mean he was a great liar okay but you got no evidence i know so unless we get something more that points to murder its gonna go down as suicide thats why i was hoping maybe we could go over what youve got just go fishing huh afraid ill miss something griffin couldnt stop himself the anger just kept resurfacing surprisingly the guy didnt rise to it instead he took it in for a beat then offered a smile and stuck out his hand nope im sure if somethings there youll find it thanks for your time griffin leaned his butt back against his desk watching hardy walk across the office fucking watchdog he thought he didnt know what glitsky wanted out of this but if he wanted to find something so bad let him find it himself and on his own time so official cooperation wasnt likely to be forthcoming hardy thought as he drove out to the mission district and also which he didnt understand at all it seemed to be getting to be a better bet that theyd come up with a suicide which would be a further disaster for frannie the fact that there was no apparent motive obviously wasnt making griffin at least lose any sleep in the city with the golden gate bridge suicide must not seem like all that much of an aberration chapter seven frannie and eds place was a large corner flat with a rounded window jutting out from the living room over the steep street hardy knocked at the door straight in from the sidewalk without a stoop of any kind it was four pm already a long day and by far the hottest one of the year he barely heard the who is it frannie hugged him for a long time in the doorway she was barefoot wearing a white nightgown shed obviously been taking a nap her long red hair was a wreck the skin around her eyes nearly black her lips puffed like a wound she led the way to the living room and left hardy there the first thing he did was open two windows to let in some air it didnt make much difference he heard frannie somewhere behind him the room was a friendly mixture of goodwill and teak a stereo and some small but hardy knew excellent blaupunkt speakers two mismatched upholstered chairs a couch and two bentwoods on one of which hardy sat hardwood floors reflected the lateafternoon sun onto clean painted walls there were three framed works of art on the walls one of hockneys pools a view of san francisco from the marin side of the bay and one of goiness chez panisse posters a coffee table was pushed into another corner and on it was a small television set homemade bookshelves held an impressive collection of books and some records he sensed more than heard her approach still barefoot barely five feet tall and ninety pounds tops frannie had tried to comb her hair and put some red in her cheeks but she neednt have bothered dressed now in jeans and a tshirt what she really wore most noticeably was the loss he stood she stopped in the doorway not moving sorry for the she whispered im just she tried again would you like something beer coffee to give her something to do hardy said a beer would be good she came back a minute later with two cans of bud and a chilled mug ed always liked me to keep a mug in the freezer she poured expertly but you know that you ought to work for moses she tried to smile but it didnt work hardy took a drink you feel like you can talk i know the police have probably gone over and over and over im okay did moses tell you why i she nodded and he decided to plunge right in ed left the house when roughly about seventhirty we finished dinner and talked for a while and he just decided to go out for a drive she hesitated perhaps remembering perhaps hiding no not exactly she looked at her lap biting her lip not exactly frannie look at me the green eyes were wet what did you talk about nothing just household stuff you know did you fight she didnt answer frannie no not really all strength seemed to leave her her hands went slack and the can of beer fell to the floor hardy jumped up and grabbed it righting it and letting the foam overflow ill get a sponge frannie said hardy put a hand on the tiny bony shoulder to keep her from rising forget the beer frannie did you have a fight or not she slumped back staring at hardy as though she wanted to ask him a question she looked about fifteen years old then she started crying just tear after tear rolling silently down her madeup cheeks hardy his hand still on her shoulder felt the suppressed sobs what about he finally asked the voice now husky and nearly inaudible came im pregnant i told him i was pregnant her eyes held on the floor between her feet she whispered ed always just said to go ahead when i was ready that was the way he was he said wed deal with it when it came up and if we waited til he was ready in advance he might never be and youd just found out that day i thought hed be happy she looked up at hardy the tears still flowing but it really wasnt a fight or anything i just wanted him to stay i was all emotional you know but he went out she shook her head slowly back and forth he went out do you know where thats the thing she said thats the thing i hate what just seeing him go off not even talking and then she swallowed now hes gone the thing hardy hated he told himself was being in this position the inquisitor after a minute he told her as much thats okay she said at least you believe me who didnt believe you i dont know for sure but i got the impression the police had a hard time with it i mean me not knowing why eddie had gone out or where maybe he just wanted hardy began then rephrased it maybe he needed to think about being a father maybe she said unconvinced except what except hed been going out a few times lately i think it had to do with his business uhoh hardy thought but he said didnt you talk you and ed we talked all the time about everything you know that but not this she shook her head then punched her little fist into her other palm it made me so mad i couldve killed him the hand went up to her mouth oh i mean i didnt mean that but we always shared everything and this was like he was protecting me or something like i couldnt handle what he was doing okay that was possible hardy thought so this night monday after you told him about being pregnant did you have a fight not a real fight more a disagreement i wanted to snuggle have him tell me it was all right that he wanted to have it she sighed but he said he had to go out again frannie shook her head back and forth her knuckles were white clamped on her lap hardy watched the beer shed spilled spread slowly over the hardwood see she continued his job was almost over anyway i thought it was stupid his job she bit her lip thinking i mean his concern with trying to save the business i think he got tired of arguing with me about it and just went ahead on his own not wanting to bother me or fight anymore about it hardy drank some beer im afraid youre losing me id better get a towel she brought another beer back for both of them god its hot she said eddie always loved hot days all two a year she sat this time in the deep chair in front of the window more composed now getting used to it she started talking on her own you know we were going down hed gotten into the mba program at stanford and we were going down there in september his job was so arbitrary it wasnt a career he just wanted to actually work a couple years so grad school wouldnt all be book learning you know so he got this job after college with mr polk over at army because he wanted to get into distribution eventually she looked out the window this seems so stupid now why am i talking about this talk about anything hardy said then last thanksgiving or sometime there mr polk got married and at the same time they heard they might lose the la hora account la hora thats cruz publishing frannie nodded again i know thats where he she tightened her lips and continued anyway the police said theyd check that if there was a connection if theres gotta be it sounded crazy to me but one of the policemen said it could have been like a protest eddie maybe killing himself in the parking lot as a protest against polk like a buddhist burning himself or something i dont know if he was serious hardy swore at that shook his head i know she said but at least it does put him there so would a meeting with someone who wanted to kill him she didnt answer hardy felt a wisp of a breeze and frannie sat back in the deep chair she turned her head to the window away from him he saw her wipe her face with the back of her hand as a small child would oh damn she said frannie he began and she twisted to face him i didnt want him to go she said i didnt even know he owned a gun now she sobbed and hardy got up walking to the window his back to her the street fell away sharply outside in the distance the air shimmered over the rooftops did you tell the police about being pregnant he asked finally turning around no she sniffed rubbed a hand over her eyes i didnt see what difference it would make i dont want anybody to know until i know what im going to do you wont tell moses will you not if you dont want because he wouldnt understand i mean i might not have it now i might frannie but eddie would not have killed himself over that she pounded a small fist against her leg he wouldnt have he would have been happy as soon as he got used to the idea he was happy he was in the next fifteen minutes hardy found out that the scar on eds leg was from trying to hop a train when he was a kid his guitar playing hardy should have remembered explained the finger calluses and also made him righthanded which frannie verified sometimes at work he got little bruises from moving and lifting things but frannie noticed no new ones the last few days hed never had a fight she knew of and he drank she said way way less than moses just a beer or two when he got home finally hardy lost his heart for going into details he looked at her for a long minute you really deep down cant think of any reason for it i know its a hard question frannie but could there have been anything frannie walked over to the open window she stood there for what seemed a very long time occasionally brushing the hair away from her face when she turned around she shrugged he just didnt what can i tell you he didnt do it the rest i dont understand i dont she hung her head and turned around to face the window again hardy stood up i wont tell moses he said to her back but if i were you i wouldnt do anything too soon about the pregnancy about anything okay let things settle a little she turned around i think i know now how you got the way you are at the door she managed a last halfsmile hardy thought of something awkwardly he pulled his wallet from his back pocket and looked through it i know this might seem a little weird but good he still had a couple of cards hed had made up for his dart playinghe thought they gave him a little psychological advantage when he passed them out at tournaments like wo this guys serious he gave one of them to frannie they were pale blue embossed with a gold dart if you need anything at all even just to talk call me okay and if you remember anything else the smallest thing okay he wanted to hug her again somehow ease things but it would be useless nothing was going to ease things for frannie for a very long time he left her standing on the sidewalk the sun behind her staring down at the shimmering city down the block some kids were playing on the street it seemed odd to hardy that anybody could be laughing in the whole world but they were laughing and laughing life was a ball well there were a lot of motives he thought enough to keep him thinking for a couple of days eddie wouldnt have been the first man to be driven to despair by the thought of fatherhood especially as he was preparing for three years of poverty and intellectual struggle the business he ran was going bustmaybe he took that pretty seriously too it was possible though hardy hated to admit it that he was having a love affair that had gone bad hardy guessed the police would be checking into that as well as frannies whereabouts that night he remembered cruzs lie about not having known ed but the relationship there was so obviousthe parking lot and allthat the cops would be all over cruz how far they pushed things he figured would be a function of griffin s gut feelings if he smelled a murder hed dig in if not everything to do with cruz and frannie and army would be essentially irrelevant well what griffin did was out of hardys hands he came over twin peaks down stanyan then through the park out to nd there was no sign of afternoon fog and it gave his neighborhood an entirely different feel people were outside playing frisbee on the grass in the park couples walked the streets hand in hand the heat had let up somewhat but it was still balmy he parked on the street in front of his house he had to force the front door open again with his shoulder this time though he walked directly down the hall to the kitchen through it to the tool room and pulled one of his planes off the wall in five minutes he had taken the door off its hinges and was sitting on the front porch planing a stray cat came and sunned itself at his feet occasionally it would swat at one of the shavings when the door was rehung hardy changed the light in the hall then went back to his study he owned three gunsa millimeter automatic a target pistol and a regulation special that hed used when hed started in the police department they were all in the lower drawer of the filing cabinet hed made himself using no nails eddie had been shot with a revolver so hardy grabbed that doublechecking to make sure it was unloaded he clicked off a few rounds to make triple sure then went into the living room and sat in his chair by the window the evening sun striped the room through the open bunds hardy put the gun on the reading table at his side picked up a pipe and lit it after a few puffs he lifted the gun and aimed it at a few targets around the room he passed the gun back from hand to hand feeling the heft of it checking its action he then aimed it pointblank at his head from several angles using both hands finally holding the gun in his right hand against his right temple he closed his eyes held his breath and squeezed the trigger breathing out after the empty click he leaned back in the chair still holding the gun in his right hand hardy was lefthanded eddie was righthanded the bullet had entered the left side of his head so unless he picked it up wronghanded or somehow no it was ludicrous no way he said absolutely no way chapter eight the town of colma is tucked into a pocket behind daly city and brisbane its corpses far outnumbering its citizens it was normally shrouded in fog which seemed appropriate but this day for eddies funeral it basked in sunlight bright and warm the mass had been scheduled for ten so hardy timed his arrival at the cemetery for quarter to eleven but no one else had made it yet another group of mourners were gathered in a knot out over across the sloping lawn a brace of eucalyptus at the front gate provided a feeble shade and a distinctive scent not at all deathlike the sky was purplish blue a warm breeze ruffled the high leaves another hearse and its party appeared down the road and hardy sitting on the fender of his suzuki waiched the line approach he put his hands in his pockets and walked out to the street mcguires pickup was visible midway down the line of cars it was a substantial group which he had expected eddie cochran of course had been well liked hardy got into his car waited then pulled in behind mcguire they went quite a ways back here the eucalyptus grew a bit thicker under the trees it was cool and pleasant picnic weather father james cavanaugh leaned down and glanced casually at his reflection in the car window with his hair still all black flopping kennedylike over an unlined forehead and piercing grayblue eyes he was uncomfortably aware that he could be a walking advertisement for the glory of the priesthood his body was trim his movements graceful the cleft in his chin was a constant temptation to vanity it was a glance thats all he didnt study himself make any corrections to the look he was he knew unworthyof his gifts as well as his role especially here today and now here came erin eddies mother and again the temptations the haunting realization of his sinfulness what a beauty she was and so strong in spite of losing her eldest son she seemed not to need his support though as she stepped into his arms and he held her he felt for a moment the pentup grief as she sighed once deeply into the shoulder of his cassock her hand lifted to his face are you all right james he nodded hows big ed he didnt sleep much last night i cant say any of us did unbidden again the thought came what if we had married what if when theyd both been eighteen hed pushed just a little harder he had never met anyone else with her joy in life her sense of balance her wisdom her brain and as if that werent enough even now after four children her body was rich the perfect combination of curve and plane of softness and tone her face was still smooth as a girls the skin cream white a touch of light coral lipstick highlighted the bowshaped sensuous mouth youre all right though he asked gently she stared up at him her eyes going dull i dont think ill ever be all right again she turned planning to go join her husband but she couldnt go to the grave just yet she knew she should walk with big ed be there for him but the strength simply wasnt there her husband was walking with jodie trying to comfort her god this was impossibly hard and frannie poor frannie so small in black stumbling over roots held up by her brother moses she looked over to see her own two sons mick and steven pallbearers waiting patiently by the hearse they were good boys of course they werent eddie there wasnt any more eddie she looked up at the blue sky struggling for controlbiting her tongue inside her mouth digging fingernails into her palms she stared up at the sky took a deep breath a strong hand gripped her right arm just above the elbow maam she was nearly as tall as the man he hadnt been at the funeral mass perhaps he was had been a friend of eds though he was older his face looked lived inloaded with laugh lines he wasnt laughing now though are you all right he said the hand on her arm didnt bother her she reached over and put her own hand over it just tired she said very tired then she gently shook him off and started walking toward the gravesite slowly the man walked alongside did you know eddie she asked pretty well both him and frannie then im very sorry she nodded im here because of frannie mostly her brother she stopped now and looked at him again their eyes on a level were you at the wedding should i know you he shook his head weddings arent my thing i uh got called out of town couldnt make it but now youre letting it hang her eyes wouldnt let him go moses doesnt believe he paused started again i guess i dont either that it was a suicide she looked toward the gravesite the bearers hadnt yet moved the coffin from the hearse she found herself gripping hardy by the arm talking through clenched teeth there is no way in the world that my eddie killed himself none at all suddenly it was essential to tell someone what she knew in her heart heres eddie hed bring in a stray cat or a bird that had fallen out of its nest in a storm he was almost i dont know how to say it but almost feminine in being sensitive that way he hated football hated ice hockey they were too brutal his father and mick used to tease him about it but he was just a soft man if you knew him at all you know that hardy thought a moment did not meet her eyes its inconceivable he even owned a gun she said what use would he have for it the gun is definitely one of my questions she stopped she didnt want to press didnt know why it was so important to make this point to this man eddie was gone what difference could it make im sorry she said walking again toward the grave im afraid im not being myself but he didnt own the gun i know that do you know where it came from where he might have gotten it no she stopped again and touched his arm not knowing exactly what she wanted to say but they had begun moving the coffin to the gravesitethe coffin that held eddies bodyand her emotion choked her so she couldnt speak steven didnt realize the coffin would be so heavy his brother hadnt been that big a guy but with the wood and the handles and all it was a lot of weight and his arms started hurting as soon as they got it out of the car he wasnt going to show it though give anybody the satisfaction it was only about a hundred feet he guessed over to the gravesite beside him at the back of the coffin was his brother mick twoletter jock to whom the weight of the coffin would be nothing but to him little wimpy brother steve just standing here holding the thing was a challenge whos talking to mom mick whispered mick was a junior at usf there on an rotc scholarship as far as steven was concerned they lived on different planets steven just shrugged hed seen the guy with his mother and was sure hed met him somewhere maybe over at eddies one time but it didnt matter he didnt know who he was no big deal it wasnt his business he wasnt going to waste breath speculating to mick about it father jim motioned from the gravesite and they started moving the priest was okay when he wasnt acting holy when he was just being a regular guy having a drink at the house or joyriding out along highway one at the beach yeah the priest could be okay he guessed at least everybody else liked him grownups were a bunch of sheep that way anyway herding up and following along you want to be honest the guy could be a little much flipping between holy and funny or getting that look at mom or when he was alone with him trying to act like a kid swearing and goofing who needed that shit be yourself steven wanted to tell him if they dont like you fuck em like now there he was being official holy standing next to frannie talking quietly to her it wasnt that he didnt like father cavanaugheddie had loved him and that was almost enough for steven right therebut it was like the man wasnt being himself people should be themselves yeah but even eddie had been like that lately thats the way adults gotalways smiling and playing games but eddie he saw things he was hurting bummed about his work what he was going to do with his life why else do they think hed come around to the house so much the last couple of weeks his mom now was going over to the hole in the ground the dugup earth covered with green tarp what did they think they could take your mind off the dirt off ed being buried under it if they camouflaged it finally his arms got to relax as they put the coffin on the stand that would lower it the last half of the walk had been real tough maybe he should work out once in a while he thought except he didnt want to wind up in rotc like mick his mom was standing now next to his dad the other guy shed been talking to was a little behind her almost like a bodyguard hed seemed to be watching everything at once but not being obvious about it steven checked around eddie had taken him down to his work a couple of timesmaking sure steven was included in his life and introduced him to some of the people there he was surprised to see eds boss mr polk big ears bookending the saddest face in the crowd standing behind frannie with a young woman who was so pretty steven couldnt look at her for long thick brown hair olive skin serious tits he saw the guy whod talked to his mother look at her saw her look back at him with half a smile which caused him to study his shoes what was eds boss doing with a killer like that hed never understand adults who wanted to anyway overhead birds kept chirping in the trees he focused on that rather than on father jims words which were bullshit if eddie had really killed himself which father jim seemed to have reason to believe then he was in hell steven didnt think ed was in hell he thought he was nowhere the same place everybody was goingin fact many of the living were already there he looked up trying not to think about where ed might be eddie and he had been friends even with the age thing in spite of being brothers then all of a sudden the guy behind his mother was pushing at the crowd nearly jumping over the coffin he got to frannie just as she lost it and started to go down frannie seemed to weigh nothing less than nothing her mass of red hair the green of the lawn under her only threw into greater contrast the stark pallor of her face moses was at hardys side he touched frannies face rubbing it gently trying to bring some color around the mouth she breathing hardy nodded just fainted the priest came and knelt between them he felt for a pulse in her neck seemed satisfied stood up shell be all right he announced to the mourners the color in frannies face was returning her eyes opened then closed then opened and stayed open moses said something to her got her up on his arm and followed hardy through the crowd back to where the cars were parked hardy heard a muffled sob into mosess shoulder suddenly couldnt deal with it anymore put his hands in his pockets and moved out of vision out of earshot down the drive back toward the entrance gate finally he stopped and cleared a space under a eucalyptus tree then sat down trying to face away from any tombstones which in colma is not an easy thing to do chapter nine the cochrans house was in a familiar neighborhood near hardys own on th avenue between taraval and ulloa they shared the same fog most days but hardy lived north of the park south of it was about as close to suburban as san francisco got big ed greeted him at the door and introduced himself he was dressed in a shiny black suit that looked as though it hadnt seen much wear in the past ten years the lapels were too thin the black tie was too thin the white shirt was brand new hardy had the feeling that hed caught him out of uniform like running into a cop dressed as a clown at a parish festival ed cochran looked slightly uncomfortable but not in the least diminished either by grief or attire the eyes though puffed were clear and piercing the solid mans face was startlingly controlled his strong chin and flat fighters nose conveyed an impression of suppressed power reinforced by the handshake which made no effort to crush or intimidate the meaty vice gripped shook let go but the strength was there his hand gently touched hardys back as he ushered him into the foyer his wife erin had used her hand the same wayto guideat the cemetery a family mannerism perhaps eds touch was as light as erin s and here was the priest again by the bar near the sliding doors that led out to the redwood deck goodlooking man another powerhouse but in a more subtle way than ed cochran drink in hand he turned just as hardy and ed arrived good so youve come i was hoping to meet you dismas this is jim cavanaugh ed said cavanaughs grip was firm and dry dismas the good thief hardy smiled so im told and youre catholic then was the priest shrugged as though accustomed to the answer was is its all a matter of tense and theres no time in heaven like the good thief will you rejoin the fold at your final hour hardy scratched his chin well im not much like the original dismas ive never stolen so much as a candy bar but you never can tell was he much good at darts darts darts im a pretty fair hand at the chalk line cavanaugh grinned broadly displaying perfect teeth im afraid the new testament is a little vague on that point get you a drink let me guess irish whiskey hardy had been thinking of a beer but the irish was okay cavanaugh had a knack he guessed for making his ideas feel like the best ones he took the drink they clicked their glasses then moved out onto the deck into the sunshine that was a good move at the grave dismas hardy the priest said you saved frannie from a nasty fall hardy shrugged marine training mixed in with a little boy scouts youre the famous father cavanaugh cavanaughs eyes clouded briefly i dont know about famous anybody who knew eddies heard about you you were like one of the family the quick flush of pleasure as quickly controlled i am family dismas all but he sipped his drink ive known erin and big ed since high school introduced them in fact baptized all the children then married ed and frannie and now with this he stopped sighed looked out into nothing over hardys shoulder im sorry the lord giveth and taketh away i suppose thats my counsel to the grieving isnt it he smiled crookedly but he levies some burdens i dont understand never will i dont know if the lord did this one hardy said what do you mean well if ed killed himself cavanaugh fixed him with a hard gaze eddie didnt kill himself hardy waited i just buried him in consecrated ground dismas if i had any belief at all that he killed himself i couldnt have done that do you understand do you understand what that means father what youre saying the priest squinted in the sun it means somebody killed him cavanaughs hand went up to his eyes he didnt seem to want to believe that either well he knocked back the last of his drink i just he couldnt have killed himself he didnt do it i am as certain of that as i am of you standing here why do you have any call it a moral conviction but theres no doubt your glass is empty it was erin cochran hardy noticed that she had put her arm through cavanaughs and i am dry myself cavanaugh went to get her a refill he seems like the perfect priest hardy said erin paused as though savoring some secret looking after him jim she said oh he is he is the perfect priest frannie sat up covered with a comforter and looked around the wall of the den moses had just gone to get dismasfor some reason she had asked to see him to thank him for catching her she supposed she couldnt exactly remember her mind kept flitting from thing to thing it was weird it was probably good that moses and momshe called erin momhad decided to lay her down in here she still felt weak lightheaded maybe that was why she kept forgetting things changing her mind she felt her forehead which was still clammy leaning her head back against the pillow she let her eyes rest on the wall opposite her there were the family pictures the whole history of the cochrans from dad and moms wedding through her own to eddies she remembered the pride shed felt the sense of belonging to a real family for the first time in her life when the picture of their engagementthe one that had been in the chroniclehad found its place on that wall it had been the perfect cochran way no fanfare just one time she came by and was watching tv with eddie sneaking in a little petting when they were left alone and the picture was suddenly there she looked at herself next to ed smiling so hard her cheeks must have hurt though she didnt remember that now and then next to it the wedding picture how could that be in the same life as this then she thought of the baby picture that shed envisioned as the next one the baby she crossed her hands over her stomach oh god she whispered there was a knock on the door before she could answer it opened and eddies sister jodie looked in hi she said you okay hardy saw the women hugging crying together and thought he would wait a little longer before going in to see frannie a door farther down the hallway stood open and he walked into that other room to wait it was a strange place out of context with the rest of the house rock posters on the lower end of the taste spectrum covered most available wall space shades were pulled down over the two windows and hardy had the sense that they were left down most of the time in one corner a television set was on the volume turned all the way down the picture snowy and untuned as though it hadnt been touched for months it bothered him and he walked over to turn it off what are you doing here it was the younger son steven hands on the doorsill this is my room what are you doing i was waiting for frannie and your sister to finish crying and i saw this tv on i thought id turn it off i want it on great ill leave it on good show steven ignored that seemed to be studying him i know you dont i grudgingly still hostile yeah we met up at frannie and eddies one time thats it steven seemed to file it away without interest hardy was categorized and put on a shelf in a certain place after that it seemed he didnt exist steven went and plopped himself on his bed feet crossed at the ankles and ran his hand through his spiky hair a couple of times you want to get out of the way hardy pulled a chair from under the writing desk and sat on it backward im trying to find who killed your brother no response steven just looked over at the droning white noise of the television hardy stood strode over and slammed it off hey hey yourself i dont care if you want to rot here in your room but im trying to do a little good for frannie at least and if you know something that can help me im damn well gonna find out is watching your blank tv supposed to impress me with how tough you are you dont feel anything about eddie about anything right hardy watched the kids bluff fade he wasnt really angry had just let his voice get louder now he sat down again pulled closer to the bed you know the option is you can help me if you want i just dont believe eddies gone hardy folded his hands exhaled looked down yeah he said thats the tough part what do you mean youre trying to find who killed eddie i thought he killed himself why do you think that the kid rolled his eyes up hardy reached down grabbed stevens ankle and started squeezing hardy had a good grip steven tried to pull away but couldnt do it hardy forced a tight grip and spoke in a whisper listen you little shit i do not need to take any highschool toughguy attitude crap from you do you understand me hardys left forearm was burning from the pressure stevens jaw was set let go of my leg do you understand me steven took another five or six seconds to save a little face then nodded and mumbled yeah hardy figured that was good enough he let go now if you remember i asked you why you thought eddie killed himself did the police or somebody tell you that steven rubbed his ankle but hardy had gotten his attention i mean he had a gun in his hand didnt he there was a note its easy to put a gun in the hand of somebody whos already dead and the note could have been anything what i want to know is why you think itthat he killed himself cause he was smart and whos smart wants to live it wasnt mock macho the kid meant it it rocked hardy a little he hung his head a minute took a breath hey is it that bad steven the boy just shrugged his thin arms crossed on his chest was he depressed eddie i mean yeah i guess so hardy looked up at him why do you think im doing this you think i want to be here going over all this with anybody wholl talk to me would that be your idea of a good time i dont have any idea of a good time the boy mumbled hardy swallowed that okay steven reached into the top drawer of the dresser next to his bed and pulled out a switchblade knife that he began to snap open and closed methodically modern american worry beads hardy thought hiding his surprise he asked where it had come from uncle jim brought it back from mexico uncle jim sure you know father cavanaugh but dont tell mom would you shed probably be nervous after a minute hardy was used to itthe skinny little kid moping on the bed opening and closing a switchblade for solace so you want to help steven closed the knife not exactly trust yet in the eyes but at least a lack of active distrust probably the kid couldnt help hardy at all but it wouldnt hurt himthe way he felt about himselfif he felt he was doing something about his brothers death what could i do he asked keep yourself alert think about things over the past month or two anything ed or anybody who knew him might have said or done what he might have been up to anything he pulled out his wallet heres a card why dont you keep it to yourself same for me and the knife right secrets together as good a bond as many this is a neat card steven said hardy got up be careful with that switchblade he said then at the door he turned think hard steven somethings out there maybe the wrong thing to say to a kid but he wasnt editing just now jodie and frannie holding hands were standing in front of the wall of the den now looking at the pictures hardy didnt knock your family keeps kodak in business he said they turned and frannie introduced jodie eighteen or so she was just passing through gangly her freckled face was still blotched from the crying some baby fat rounded but only slightly the corners of her cheekbones her wide blue eyes also reddened had irises flecked with gold her nose wasnt perfect but hardy liked it a little too flat at the bridge and sticking out at the bottom like a babys thumb she was obviously erin s kid but as with steven and ed and even mick for that matter there wasnt much sign of big eds genes you wanted to see me frannie confused momentarily stared back at the wall of pictures then again at hardy i think she turned to jodie and smiled my mind its okay hardy said it can wait no i know i asked moses if i could see you but i this other stuff sure jodie spoke up her voice the echo of her mothers cultured not so deep as to be husky but adult i thought you were wonderful catching frannie thank you she turned to her sisterinlaw you really went out i dont know how mr hardy did it but he was over to you thats it frannie said that reminds me what why i wanted to see you i just remembered she let go of jodies hand and sat on an ottoman ive never fainted before so i didnt know it was even coming its just the last thing i remember was i saw mr polk there hes he was eds boss i mean the owner he wasnt really a boss i dont think ed was the real manager but he made policy you know hardy put up with the rambling she had obviously thought of something and would be getting to it so when i saw him i remembered again that you said i should tell you anything that might matter and mr polks being there might matter she shook out her red hair then closed her eyes as though the thought had eluded her again jodie sat on the edge of the ottoman and put an arm over her shoulder its okay frannie its just so hard to think she pouted biting her lip mr polk hardy said quietly oh mr polk thats right why would it matter him being at the funeral frannie it seems perfectly natural to me had they been fighting or something oh no nothing like that it wasnt him being at the funeral she still couldnt seem to find it hardy put his hands in his pockets and wandered over to the wall of pictures surrounding what looked like a college graduation picture of eddie were plaques diplomas honors he turned back to the young women phi beta kappa he asked eddie was really smart jodie said he just didnt like showing off but he was the smartest of us except for maybe steven if hed work at it i just met steven again we had a nice talk hes okay jodie said he just plays tough hardy shrugged we got along i remember hardy sat down on the end of the couch it was mr polk i was just surprised to see him eddie said he hadnt been at work all last week until friday and then hed been all distracted hardy waited for her to continue thats all she said at last im sorry i guess its nothing but you said no frannie he said anything might be important he didnt push her he could find out more about that when he interviewed at army its probably nothing frannie repeated you thought it was worth telling me about its like when you took tests in school and your teacher always told you to go with your first answer it cant hurt to say it frannie looked over again at the photo wall jodie next to her stood up and spoke with a strained brightness maybe we should go outside for a while you think in a minute okay the girl was gone closing the door behind her hardy slid over on the couch closer to frannie you know he said the fainting might have had something to do with being pregnant a nod i thought of that just before jodie came in you havent told anybody have you i said i wouldnt i know but no buts no is no she smiled all right thank you her head started to turn to look at the pictures again hardy spoke up you feel up to going out yet it does get close in here she glanced toward the wall youre right im sorry hardy crossed over to her and lifted her gently by the shoulder she leaned into him lets go she said forcing a smile i can handle it i dont get it in your state that is small wonder moses mcguire turned his baleful gaze onto hardy who was negotiating traffic on lincoln boulevard he had rolled the canvas top back on his car you took my keys didnt you hardys eyes shifted ive often warned you of the perils of leaving things in your coat pockets myself i keep my valuables in my pants i keep my valuables in my pants mcguire echoed i try to get my valuable out of my pants as often as possible hardy dug into his pocket produced mcguires key ring and tossed it onto his lap friends dont let friends drive drunk mcguire tried to whistle but it came out wronghis mouth wasnt at a hundred percent thats good you just make that up and im not drunk you want to run that whistle by me again cause i miss a whistle doesnt mean im drunk say miss a whistle three times mcguire tried it once then what are you my mother he settled back in the seat missafuckingwhistle he said hardy pulled the car up at a light and turned toward his friend so what dont you get mcguire took a minute to answer hardy reminded him you said you dont get it what true love he said finally you mean frannie and ed nope mcguire faded out for a minute then came back i mean eds parents tell me you didnt notice her erin i noticed her mose mcguire tried a whistle that came out better i dont care how old she is shes the sexiest woman ive ever seen hardy nodded even burying her son erin cochran was something far beyond reasonably attractive and with big ed for going on thirty years how do you figure that if not true love i didnt really meet the guy he was just at the door nice enough broken up trying to keep it under control but erin and him why not hardy the guys been a gardener at the park for his whole life okay he works for the city probably a good gig but wheres the romance i mean the guys gotta live in horse manure who needs romance wouldnt you think erin would hardy shrugged interesting question i dont know gotta be true love and i dont get it hardy pulled the car up a block before the shamrock the day was hot and still mcguire had put his head back against the seat he looked beat breathing heavily regularly you sleeping mcguire his friend grunted you sure you want to open the bar mcguire lifted his head that priest hes the kind of guy she ought to go for dont laugh it happens his eyes were bleary and red the muscles in his face slack you cant buy true love huh its a beautiful thing for a night or two mcguire leaned his head back again sighed he spoke with his eyes closed slumped down his head resting on the back of the car seat you think frannies okay she seem okay to you shell make it mose shes a tough one you going to open or not mcguire covered his eyes noting where the car had stopped i dont think im up to the fastlane glamor of the bar business today you know hardy nodded turned the key started his car up again as he pulled into traffic heading toward mcguires apartment in the haightashbury moses said how do they do it diz whats that hold together all that family stuff you and frannie do it we had to do it hardy looked over at his friend head back mouth open eyes shut he looked strange in dark pants a tan dress shirt his tie loose normally moses was a jeansandworkshirt guy hardy noticed for the first time that his black hair was beginning to be shot with gray maybe they have to do it too hardy said for some reason not like me and frannie did hardy knew he was right moses had raised his younger sister from the time he was sixteen and she was four when hed gone to vietnam which was where moses and hardy had met she had just been starting high school and moses was paying to have her board at dominican up in marin county and sides moses slurred im talking sex not brothers and sisters ed and erin how do you keep that going thirty years hardy found a place to park in front of mosess building he pulled into it practice i guess chapter ten linda polk got up from her desk and walked the twenty feet down the hallway to the womens room at army distributing the womens room was lindas exclusive domainshe was the only female employee and guests were few and far between especially lately alphonse coming in hassling her about where her daddy was had been the only person whod been in the whole day and hed gone long before noon she flicked the light switch and walked in front of the mirror to look at herself not too bad rings under the eyes were covered pretty well the blondish bleach job was holding up okay she liked the purplish tint to the eyeshadow maybe a touchup on the mascara not that it really mattered here no shed pass on that she didnt come in here to fix herself up she smiled yes she did she thought only not that kind of fix shed rolled the stuff at home hidden it in the package of virginia slims and taking it out smiled again in anticipation shed really come a long way baby it was the very best of the third worldc c colombian and crack although just a tiny bit of the latter she lit the joint and inhaled deeply holding it before shed even let out the breath the first jolt of the crack kicked in she allowed herself one more it was a good mix the crack pumped you up to the sky but the marijuana made coming down very nice putting half the joint back into the cigarette box she checked herself out one last time in the mirror and smiled prettily at herself linda means pretty she said aloud and giggled the mood was nearly wrecked immediately as she came out to the hallway first the heel on her shoe slipped on the tile and broke off she would have fallen but for the wall fuck holding the wall with one hand she was balancing herself to take off her shoes when an unknown face looked out from her office can i help you a man and not badlooking not too well dressed but not a slob either she smiled crookedly suddenly feeling dizzy with the rush of drugs damn here shed been alone all day andit was just her luckthe minute she decided to let go just a little someone shows up im sorry she said to the man standing there in the hallway with her shoes in her hand next shed probably run her nylons the man shrugged no problem i was hoping to find mr polk is he in she walked toward him then brushed against him as she went around to her desk shed be better if she was sitting down the man looked at the nameplate on her desk are you his wife she laughed at that shallowly no his daughter suddenly she stood up again extended her hand linda polk daughter of samuel polk and descendant of us president james k he was just after lincoln i think the man had a firm dry nononsense shake i think maybe a little earlier he said whatever the glow was coming up roses she could feel herself expanding becoming nicer easier to talk to to like is your father in today no he had a funeral this morning then he and nika she stopped nika she didnt want to get concentrating on nika the man smiled he had a wonderfully inviting smile i came from the funeral myself im a friend of ed cochrans or was he extended a card that seemed to hover a long way away in his hand until she reached out and grabbed it my names dismas hardy linda do you expect your father back today i never expect him back whoops she hadnt meant to say that i mean back the way he was was when back before nika when was that linda she liked the way he kept saying her name he really was a nicelooking man maybe a little old thirtyfive good tan for a city guy maybe he did a lot of work outside pardon she said when was before nika she waved a hand abstractedly nika thats right i guess late last summer then they got married before christmas and thats when everything seemed to start going wrong you mean with the business no no no not the business that wasnt til later i mean with me and daddy oh damn she was going to cry again that was the only bad thing about the potit got all the emotions stirred up the trick was to quick get onto something else the business she said wasnt til the whole thing with la hora like in february but the man surprisingly didnt pick up on that what happened with you and your daddy he acted like he really cared he was sitting back comfortably in his chair hands folded across his chest more relaxed than she was in fact just looking at him made her feel better im sorry she said i get all emotional sometimes he nodded because before nika well you know my mom died when i was tenthats ten years ago can you believe itand daddy and i were always after that like best friends i mean i came to work here when he was building up the business and we did everything together and it was like we were a team and it wasnt like he didnt have girlfriends that was cool i mean i wasnt we werent weird you know but nika was different he leaned forward different how just so i dont know overpowering and i dont get it have you ever seen her or my dad i guess they were at the funeral but i didnt know who they were well come look at this she led the way back into her fathers office with its big desk and there was the picture bigger than it needed to be in its silver frame here theres my dad with nika i dont think shes that pretty for as long as she could stand it she glared at her new stepmother probably only five years older than she was though of course nika would never say it was she admitted a good picture but not a good likeness it made her look more beautiful and she wasnt beautiful not in real life she could tell the man only saw the outside couldnt tell from the picture how ugly she was underneath he said i wouldnt call her pretty at all he was standing very close right beside her he smelled like a clean mansome hints of aftershave maybe a pipe but no sweat or gasoline like most of the guys she saw they dont really belong together she said she realized she was still without shoes turning facing the man she raised her chin for a minute then hitched herself onto her fathers desk whats your name again dismas diz for short im a little diz for dizzy she said giggling probably better to be sitting down then unexpectedly he reached out and touched her face a light touch that tingled all over her are you all right would you like some water without waiting for an answer he was gone back quickly with her coffee cup filled with water from the fountain it was like he knew his way around already she was ready for him to put his arms around her and do anything he liked at all but instead he went to the couch and sat on the end of it she sipped at the cup so when nika and your dad got married things changed she looked down he was like a different person just didnt have time for me or anybody or even the business anymore all he wanted to do was spend timea shot at nikas facewith her and you think thats been the problem with the business i thought ed was trying to get it back on track oh eddie eddie was great i didnt mean to say he wasnt good at the job i mean fair and you know a really nice guy no hassles you know she sipped again at the water i cant believe what they say that he killed himself hardy let that go for now but there have been problems with the business and they happened when ed was managing right well yes but no it wouldve happened with anybody it was all stuff about la hora and el dia you said that before what does that mean you know el dia dont you he shook his head well its another paper you know like la hora that wanted us to distribute it la hora was our biggest client but then they dropped us took it all back inhouse she looked around her fathers office and by then it was too late to get el dia theyd set themselves up with other distributors old cruz really screwed us she shook her head swinging her legs in frustration is that why its so deserted around here now was her chance that just the slow business and eds funeral being today theres nobody here at all except us nobodys been in at all flirty eye move shrug the breasts out and its late i dont expect anybody to come the rest of the day i could even lock up now and it wouldnt matter he stood up and she slid off the desk with a little bounce well youve been very helpful linda thanks another handshake again cool dry firm she held it an extra couple of seconds looked into his gray eyes we could get a drink maybe theres a lot we can talk about or just stay here she repeated a little peck on the cheek thanks id like that he said but im working now and ive got another appointment maybe a rain check okay sure thats cool out now to her desk wait just a second she said she jotted her name and number on her notepad and tore off the sheet in case you remember something you wanted to ask then he was gone she watched him walk across the empty lot through waves of lateafternoon heat when he got in his car he turned back to look at the door and she waved a hand at him but he probably couldnt see her through the reflection anyway he didnt wave back she turned the knob locking the door padded back to her desk and sitting down reached into her purse for the pack of virginia slims linda was right hardy was thinking i wouldnt call nika pretty it would be like calling the grand canyon pretty or michelangelos david of course he remembered her from the funeral the way she kept staring at him at least now he had a name to go with itnika polk where had she come from he wondered and what was it about sadlooking basseteared sam polk that had snagged her he closed his eyes trying to visualize her again she was tall taller than her husband perhaps fiveeight jet black hair over a classically hard mediterranean face a stunning face halfparted lips that she kept licking the only reason hardy had caught frannie when shed started to faint was that nika had been standing just behind her and he had kept tearing his eyes away forcing himself to look elsewhere frannie had been in his line of vision it had been luck she had worn a simple woolen black cotton suit severely cut that nevertheless hadnt diminished the thrust of her breasts above a waist hardy thought he could encircle with both hands he shook his head no linda he thought nika aint that pretty at all he started the engine up he wanted to go back and talk to cruz and besides it would be cooler moving so sam polk had married nika about six months ago he looked to be around fiftyfive she was midtwenties maybe a little more got to be money hardy thought at least to some extent and after theyd gotten married polk had started having troubles with his business it wasnt that far a leap to assume that those troubles had led to problems at home but what was he thinking there had been no hint of any trouble between sam and nika what had made him think that and then he remembered her eyes fixing on him at the cemetery hed seen eyes like that beforethe flirting hadnt been playful it was dead serious the eyes of nika polk werent those of a happily married woman had she ever looked at eddie cochran that way chapter eleven john strout made his personal policy very clear in the first month of his tenure as san francisco s coroner the responsibility of that position according to us government code is to determine the cause circumstances and manner of death of individuals dying within a particular jurisdiction and under manner of death there are only four possibilities natural causes accident suicide or death at the hands of another in the course of doing that job however other elements many of them political have an opportunity to come into play strout a tall softspoken gentleman originally from atlanta wasnt about to let anybody or anything affect his judgment on causes of death and so he decided early on to send a message to those who would prefer a quick and sloppy verdict over a slow and correct one the victim in the case had been the cousin of the mayor and not the greatest coincidence in the world given the size of the citybrotherinlaw to one of the supervisors strout came in to work that morning and found the morgue overrun with media people as well as with members of both the mayors and supervisors staffs strout glanced at the body before going to his office where he was hounded to issue some statement he figured it was as good a time as any to get the word out a reporter for the chronicle finally asked him pointblank and rather insultingly if he planned to make any decision at all in the foreseeable future strout had stood up to his full height behind his desk seeing as this victim was stabbed twice and shot five timeshe said in his most syrupy drawlim very close and you can print this very closehe paused and smiled at the assemblagevery close indeed to rulin out suicide strout wasnt about to hurry and be wrong after eleven years as coroner it was gospel that once strout gave a verdict you could take it to the bank now carl griffin and vince giometti sat in the airconditioned visitors room at the san francisco morgue it was not a decorators paradise the long yellow couch was too low the commercial prints on the walls were ugly and hung too high the only living plant by the one window to the right of the couch was no greener or prettier than the three plastic floral arrangements that graced respectively the center table too short for the couch the blue plastic end table and the pitted mahogany sideboard griffin and giometti sat on either end of the couch between them in an almostnew cardboard briefcase was the file on the cochran case giometti a new father had just finished saying something that made griffin explode do i gotta hear this right after lunch you think this is interesting you believe anybody cares what your babys bowel movements look like whether its hard or soft or runny or whether the goddamn corn gets digested on its way through griffin jumped up unable to sit still christ if you had a kid youd know how important it was why do you think i never had a kid you think that was just dumb luck you may not believe this but i thought about it at one time and you know what decided it for me he went down on one knee in front of his rookie partner i asked myself this question i said think about the reality of babyhood and whats the first thing that comes to your mind giometti started to answer but griffin put up a hand no let me finish the first thing that came to my mind was shit rivers of it every day for like a couple of years then i asked myself another question is there anything i like about shit i mean its smell texture various colors do i look at it the way eskimos look at snow with nuances and a hundred different names no shit is shit and i am not interested in any of it your kids my own any of it okay he stood up so from today on can we do without the daily bm moment please he turned away and walked over to the window breathing hard he rubbed a leaf of the plant between thumb and forefinger its a natural function carl giometti said you shouldnt be so uptight about it griffin thought hed leave a thumbprint on the leaf he squeezed it so hard he heard the door open strout was shaking vinces hand coming over to him it wasnt exactly how hed wanted it he would have preferred to be calm and dispassionate and now if he knew strout at all and he did his mood might affect strouts decision well if he played it right maybe it could work to his advantage so boys strout said after hed sat in a straightback chair hed pulled up to the tooshort table what have you got here giometti opened the briefcase and took out the file griffin thought it would be wiser also good experience for the kid to let his partner talk until hed calmed down and he loitered again over by the window hands in pockets well sir the deceased was having troubles at work in fact the job was about to come to an end any medical corroboration of depression no sir not formal informal the family not his wife but his family family griffin saw strouts face stretch slowly you mean the one he grew up with we call that the nuclear family officer it went right by giometti yeah well he said the nuclear family said hed been on edge the last couple of weeks strout turned to griffin serious couple of arguments with his father like that did they say over what giometti took it again something he thought about his work griffin we checked it out the place is going bust he was the manager strout was inclined to be skeptical he cared enough about it to kill himself griffin finally sat down its possible sir guy was an overachiever his whole life was planning on going to business school down at stanford this fall couldve ruined his image of himself running a company going down the tubes strout nodded silent all right he said marital okay even good giometti said griffin added the wife spent the night of his death talking to his mother twohour conversation phone records verify it worried about him this and that but generally thats my conclusion griffin said any mental history at all giometti shook his head griffin said how bout you sir you find something strout leaned forward putting his weight on his elbows his elbows on his knees griffin noticed that the mans eyebrows were so bushy they tangled in his lashes when he opened his eyes wide i find a healthy young man strout began with a good marriage good family no history of mental illness hes got powder burns on his left hand and a hole in the half of his head thats left giometti spoke up oh the gun was fired twice you know the gun was fired twice so what only one slug went in strouts lashes kissed his brows looking at griffin happens a lot griffin said and while were at it the gun was unregistered strout nodded of course giometti butted in while were at things nobody seems to want to talk about the note the fuckin note griffin said it was a note giometti insisted it was a piece of crumpled paper griffin answered not wanting to get drawn into anything in front of strout but it was too late are you telling me we have a suicide note officer strout rolled his eyes up up out of his head are we wasting our time here its not exactly the rosetta stone of suicide notes griffin said its a note next to a body lying by a gun though not even that griffin told him about finding it in the car what it said or more particularly didnt say strout chewed on it a moment then nodded deciding going on to something else might he have been gay that was always a question in the city griffin knew no sign of it he said glad to put the note behind them no there wasnt strout agreed anyway thats what i find lets be frank gentlemen have you found anything points to a homicide here griffin and giometti exchanged glances what we found giometti said doesnt point either way we got a dead kid alone in a shitty place at night a couple of random weirdnesses like two shots he glanced at his partner maybe maybe a note maybe he just got depressed i dont know maybe we need more time everybody needs more time strout said on the other hand griffin said it wasnt a random parking lotcochran did deliver there people knew who he was but weve checked into that and theres nothing evident strout cracked his knuckles but we do have a note dont we he sighed in the absence of any hard evidence to the contrary im inclined to lean toward a suicide then but im a little reluctant its not very tight is it giometti spoke up you know if we go with suicide the widow gets no insurance insurance isnt my problem strout snapped carl you got something give it to me would you griffin thought about the chances of himself becoming lieutenant he knew he could continue to conduct the best investigation in the history of the department and it wouldnt mean beans on the other hand if glitsky fucked up face facts he told himself strout was right there was no hard evidence that the boy had been murdered if there was and if they busted tail for a week or a month chances are that he and vince would find something if it was there but the two of them so far had been thorough if not inspired maybe somebody wanted him especially carl griffin to hump his ass for a month and come up empty okay then he thought they want inspiration they can hold the carrot out i dont know he said im a little worried about the lack of motive nobody we talked to had a bad word to say much less wanted to kill him strout rose to it all right then lets go with suicideequivocal see if something turns up back in their car giometti seemed sullen whats eating you griffin asked knowing full well what it was this guy didnt kill himself he didnt huh you know he didnt griffin slammed the dashboard dont tell me what i know vince i been at this a long time he was feeling giomettis look on him he took a breath giometti hit the ignition turn off the car he said leaning his head back against the seat closing his eyes ill tell you something vince i honestly dont know im an evidence cop you give me something to go on and im on it like white on rice but what do we got here weve interviewed the wifesuspect number one if you go by the stats she was home all night talking to the guys mother who else cruz the guy who owns the lot and building hes with his boyfriend okay maybe not but we couldnt break himeither of them could we giometti nodded grudgingly polk his foxy wife no way this guy cochran was their star it was all on him to make the business work or keep working losing fight and he took it hard it may not be a good motive but right now its our only motive he drove out there depressed he started to write a note saw the futility of that and stopped in the middle hed gotten this piece from somewhere and shot it once to make sure he knew how it worked its sad as hell but i can see it happening ive seen it happen a lot of times griffin was winding down look he said we got five righteous homicides besides maybe this one maybe probably another gets reported this afternoon or tonight how much time you want to waste on this one its not wasted if somebody killed him true but we got nothing pointing anywhere we get something anything we go back on it its not like its closedits equivocal we havent given up technically were just putting it on hold in lieu of evidence vince look were in the collar game you want to make it in homicide bring in your collars these other ones put em on your desk check em every few months keep an open mind but if nothing sticks out after three four days of lookingand i mean nothing he shrugged cruz wouldnt see you today too busy today he said does he think youre a cop abe id never impersonate a police officer thats a felony im pretty sure but he might at your first interview have reached the conclusion that you were of the citys finest glitsky tolerantly scratched at the scar that ran between his lips its always surprising what the mind can sometimes come up with hardy said i guess its possible he thought that if he let his imagination run wild glitskys telephone rang it was five oclock and hardy settled back relaxed it had been a long day but not without its rewards even cruz refusing to see him had been instructive into the phone abe was saying something about angles of knife wounds heights of suspects hardy listened with one ear it was real that kind of stuff like his problem with eddie cochran having been righthanded glitsky hung up as though thered been no interruption he continued so what about when cruz realizes that youre not a cop why would he do that glitsky tried to sound patient because hardy cops get interviews they dont say sorry ill come back tomorrow they flash their buzzer and say look im busy too i never used to do that which is not to say its not the proper procedure the inspector got up abruptly want some coffee hardy shook his head if you got a beer glitsky reached into the drawer under the mr coffee and tossed hardy a warm sixteenounce can of schlitz alcohol is forbidden anywhere in this building he didnt go around again behind his desk but sat against the edge of the steel file cabinet sipping at his black coffee waiting hardy pulled the tab on the can sipped and grimaced it aint bass ale fresh though its probably only been in there about two years after the first taste though it didnt bother hardy he took another so whats suicideequivocal suicideequivocal means stroutthe mewants to straddle the fence why cause hes got a rep for not being wrong but ive got to have it come down one way or the other glitsky stared out the window sipping his coffee yo abe hardy said griffin came by and said it was a bullshit verdict should have been a righteous suicide he said hed recommended that to strout so hes not inclined to do anything else glitsky motioned to his desk theres the file he gave it to me said i should tell my friendthats you dizto call him if you found anything so no id say griffins not gonna do much but the case is still open glitsky shrugged some cases stay open its a technicality it sucks hardy drank half the can of beer as glitsky continued memorizing the skyline until he finally said if you got anything ill listen i got nada hardy admitted cruz told me a flatout lie i directly asked him if hed known eddie cochran and he paused thought about it and said no i wonder why that kind of thing and he wouldnt see you yeah that they were silent outside glitskys office there were sounds of people going home hardy could see the traffic backing up on the oakland bridge he drank some warm beer then reached over and grabbed the file off glitskys desk began leafing through the few pages after a minute hardy tapped the file like here look at this glitsky came to stand over his shoulder yeah thats weak he said im sorry ive got to hardy read whats that supposed to mean maybe he had to go to the bathroom maybe anything griffin calls this a suicide note he doesnt say not hardy closed the file abe this isnt exactly what youd call compelling whered they find it in the car glitsky pointed down on the page see there in the car not on his person even he mightve written this a year ago i know glitsky crossed to the window leaned out over to see the street down below maybe something else is going on yeah and maybe that something is screwing frannie out of her insurance glitsky without turning around nodded maybe hardy went back to reading tipping the beer back and this griffin couldnt tell me this what the gun was fired twice what ed wanted to take a few rounds of target practice so hed be sure he didnt miss glitsky said nothing hardy turned more pages paused at the photographs closed the file and drank more beer sucks this really sucks glitsky went back to the file drawer and leaned against it i tell you what diz you find me some evidence for feeling like that hardy nodded this was a firsttime maybe onetime offer a good sign it undoubtedly nagged at glitsky too hardy forced himself to look back at the pictures of ed the gun maybe a foot from his right hand under his head a large pool had formed looking black under the cameras lights he stared at the picture a long time the body lifeless lying on its side perhaps two feet from the building you also wonder if he killed himself that he wasnt sitting back against the building when he pulled the trigger hardy said glitsky finished his coffee and dropped the styrofoam cup into the wastebasket yeah you do he said its a marvel how much there is to wonder about chapter twelve arturo cruz had the top down on his jaguar xke enjoying the rare warm evening as he drove up out of china basin on his way home last night hed been furious with jeffrey for one of the first times since theyd been together they hadnt made love jeffrey had gotten huffy and stormed out before dinner and hadnt come back until this morning so when he walked into the office all cruz could think of was his relief that he was back and he hugged him his anger forgotten the reason for the fight everything if he was back then everything was okay and everything had been all right again a good day a good issue on the streets another good one put to bed the may figures of la hora had come in and ad linage was up six percent over last may revenues up over fourteen percent and the revenue increase was all because of their circulation on which they based their ad rates and now with distribution going inhouse the bottomline figure would skyrocket next year if they could keep el dia away from their market share but they would do that la hora was the better paper el dia was still a rag maybe five years away from quality still the threat though distant caused him to frown he had to keep his eye on the ad linage if that dipped even a little it might mark a trend hed better have some projection graphs made tomorrow he dictated a memo on that then put the handheld tape recorder into its holder on the dashboard that was enough business and it had been a good day until that fellow hardy had come back and thinking of that he almost got mad again why had jeffrey told hardy he had known ed cochran and how had he cruz then been so stupid as to deny it the day before hed told the other inspector giometti that theyd been business acquaintances well thats probably what hardy had come back for about that inconsistency cruz would just saynow that hed examined itthat he thought hardy had been talking about a personal relationship between him and cochran that would take care of it but in any event he had to clear up the misunderstanding with jeffrey he turned his car left onto market lowered the visor against the setting sun he should have taken care of it today but with jeffrey coming back hed been so happy it had just slipped his mind that wouldnt do he thought that kind of carelessness he would have to watch it and uncomfortable though it might be he would have to talk to jeffrey about it again but this time it would be when he was relaxed and he wouldnt be angry hed simply explain it all very clearly so that all the nuances would be understood then if hardy or giometti came around again theyd be ready for him and the questions could stop that was all he wanted really that the questions stop hardy opened the door to schroeders an oldfashioned german restaurant downtown and was nearly overwhelmed with a sense of déjà vu it had been a favorite haunt back in his postcop days as an assistant da before the divorce with jane he realized he hadnt been in the place since that time maybe eight years before he wasnt at all surprised to find it hadnt changed a bit what was atypical he knew was how he felthe actually wouldnt mind casually running into someone almost anybody and schroeders had been that kind of place back then offduty cops other das reporters attorneys who werent corporate and didnt want to be people hanging out mingling schmoozing over a few beers tonight if it worked out he might get back in touch with the city he lived in or not he thought it sort of interesting that he considered it afterward he wasnt sure about the order of the two jolts he had just gotten his dortmunder and was looking around enjoying the feel of things when his exwife jane stood up not forty feet from him across the room that was the first one then came the sharp first tremor of the earthquake hardy stood up and made his way through tables away from jane until he got to the hallway leading back to the rest rooms it was a good shaker perhaps a five or six and it continued rolling as he walked the restaurant became quiet as everyone held their breath the chandeliers swung heavily and several glasses fell from the back of the bar hardy stood in theory secure under a beam and waited the tremor stopped and after a round of nervous laughter the room went back to being itself hardy watched jane walk directly toward him she looked after eight years impossibly the same now thirtyfour she could have passed for twentyfive her face was still as unlined unmarked by the passage of years as a babys that made sense hardy thought its what lack of a sense of guilt could do for you she was still unaware of him and he couldnt help taking her in tall slim radiant dark hair casting highlights even in the dim room looking down slightly as she walkedgraceful serene the face again he kept coming back to the face with its slightly oriental cast though no one knew where that had come from it was really only a heaviness in the eyelids but with the wide cheekbones the rosebud lips there was a geisha air she was elegantly dressed as always gold earrings a blouse in pink silk pleated dark blue skirt low heels now ten feet away she finally looked up and there it was that milliondollar slow smile that had completely changed his life she stopped looked let the smile build just slowly enough to work on him and it did he found himself smiling back small world he said his first words to her since hed left their house of course she would kiss him hug him but not gushing slow and savoring an old old and very dear friend you look wonderful she said how have you been how are you what are you doing now he had to laugh im good jane ive been fine she touched his arm smiled into his eyes i cant believe im seeing you she stopped impulsively hugged him again some sensememory made him remember why it had been so hard to consider someone anyone else his whole being just responded to her it wasnt a social thing he just looked at her and smiled his life full and complete like a moonstruck teenager but a halfdozenplus years dont after all go away without a trace whole new synapses had been created and the warning janglings that he felt had become a part of his makeup were sounding like crazy who are you here with she still held his arms just above his elbows just daddy and some friends daddy judge andy fowler the doyen of the san francisco benchwhod gotten dismas his first interview for da whod been during the troubles a surprising confidant then that sly look why do you want to know he told himself to stop smiling dammit but standing here so close to her looking into her amused eyes even now catching a whiff of the perfume i thought maybe a drink would be nice she nodded id like that then if you want he laughed shrugged i dont know if i want to tell you the truth she kissed him again quickly let me go pee and dump daddy no one she asked didnt you wish you could love anybody she drank absolut now rocks she had given up smoking he told himself she couldnt possibly care about his nonexistent love life i dont know anymore if loves a feeling or an attitude she laughed throat extended looking up dismas she said when the laugh was all finished she sipped her drink that is such a dismas thing to say why didnt that annoy him well the point is i never felt enough you know to make any decisions decisions not decisions really i guess commitments he swallowed the rest of his scotch and signaled the bartender for another round jane covered his hand with her own im sorry i wasnt laughing at you i know she squeezed the hand gently not coming on not consciously coming on anywayleaving his hand on the bar covered with hers there hasnt been anyone where there was anything going on i mean he didnt like the way that made it soundas though hed been pining away for jane but its been no big deal he said one way or the other there that put it in perspective how about you he asked to his surprise shed been married and divorced again it wasnt very serious she said it was more a rebound thing being married wasnt serious she sighed it seemed serious for a while i guess i was just lonely confused you know it wasnt long aftershe hesitated perhaps wondering what it would sound likeus the new round came and she moved her hand hardy watched it tap the bar once then settle into her lap he reached over and held it holding her hand in her lap i dont care he said not sure what he was referring to dismas she began squeezing his hand he interrupted her lets go outside the night was still warm the building felt almost hot as he pressed her up against it no nonsense none at all out the side door to the alley and around the back near the employee entrance between some parked cars empty cardboard boxes scattered here and there a building or two down there was a light up high holding hands all the way out then stopping when they had turned the corner the kiss openmouthed hungry backing away a step pulling up the skirt stepping out of the shoes a quick look around then the hose down and off and thrown somewhere maybe into one of the boxes and then the warm building hardys pants not even down pressing it to her into her wet and ready legs hitched up high on his hips the kissing wonderful wordless pumping of it oh god daddys still here hardy had her arm they neither of them were about to invite the other back to their respective houses and so they decided on a nightcap back inside what if hed come out knowing andy he wouldve come back in here and had a drink and hed never let on he saw us what if he notices my stockings hardy squeezed the arm youre not wearing any a look that said thats what i mean when suddenly there was no avoiding him getting up from his table as they came in hardy was still weak in the knees wanting to talk to jane about what it might mean but knowing hed have to put that off andy saw him flashed a look at his daughter then closed the space between them you said an old friend to jane with some hint of reproof not old family the eyes took hardy in you look fine son life treating you okay they got through the small talk meeting his dinner companions who were going home anyway getting to the bar if hardy looked fine andy looked incredible still skinny as a stick face unlined hair thick and the color of stout dressed now in a camelshair sport coat and tie andy wasnt famed for a beataroundthebush approach so whats with you two together was the first thing he asked at the bar pure accident jane answered anybody believes in pure accidents in this life isnt paying close enough attention he sipped a cognac maybe meeting here was an accident but sitting here with me two hours later has the ring of volition hardy laughed andy had the same style from the bench he took it right to hardy so what are you doing with yourself i keep expecting to see you in court one of these days get back to the trade jane sat between them included by position hardy talked a little occasionally touching janes back with the flat of his hand she leaned back or overinto it hardy exassistant da shook his head im just not that cerebral i think if i did anything id go back to being a cop andy raised his eyebrows doesnt rule out cerebral maybe we dont know the same cops if were talking cerebral maybe we dont know the same attorneys anyway hardy continued i think my friend glitsky might try to help me get back on the force but im not really inclined to it i dont like having a boss me neither oh for a spot on the federal bench but this was an old lament and not too sincere federal judges were appointed for life and barring outrageous impeachable conducta likelihood never ever to occur with andy fowlerthe job was one of those on earth most resembling gods but andy had been at superior court for twentyfive years and hardy knew he was happy there not that he wouldnt take the job with no boss but he wasnt lobbying for it after hardy had gotten into what he was doing now andy stopped smiling i know a little about arturo cruz he offered hes a dirty son of a bitch isnt he this was news to hardy who knew only that cruz was a liar if i get the case ill have to disqualify myself damn shame hardy looked blank and andy explained one of his foursome out at the olympic club represented some people in litigation against cruz a baitandswitch case seems cruz had suckered a group of his distributors into laying out big bucks to buy into his newspapers growthtrucks and coin machines and so onand then when the paper got into the black he cut them off went inhouse with the distribution and of course being good thirdworld brothers and sisters for the most part it was all oral jane touched her fathers arm daddy im not worked up he said and that wasnt a racist remark and if it was even here in the bosom of my family i retract it thats why he might lie hardy was thinking about knowing one of his distributors employees could i meet this guy your friend missing the fatherdaughter exchange altogether andy nodded finishing his drink sure got a pen he gave hardy the number on a card then kissed his daughter well we working stiffs have to get up in the morning he stood up extended his hand again dismas i mean it ive missed you come around sometime get arrested if you need an excuse he took them both in damn shame he repeated as though to himself about as subtle as a dart in the eye they watched him weave through the tables jane put her hand on hardys thigh let it rest there now what she half turned to him on the barstool his thoughts had suddenly turned to cruz back to ed and frannie i guess im going to call your dads friend no dismas the eyes flickered briefly with amusement about us it was a flat questionno coy girl stuff us you and me us it seems funny doesnt it it didnt seem funny a half hour ago shed gotten him there he had to admit no it didnt then do i have to answer right now he reached out his hand along the bar and there was hers again holding his shit jane were divorced jane lifted his hand and kissed it out there hardy nodded but that was never the problem anyway no i remember no smile just stating a fact maybe that was rare huh maybe they both went to their glasses janes hand rested on his unfamiliar and frightening he noticed the coral nail polish flawlessly applied the cool trace of blue vein under the olivetan skin janes hand right there he put his glass down and reached over with his other hand covering it how about maybe next week or so we go on a date that had been something between them when theyd been married theyd gone on dates a real date she asked yeah you knowdinner a movie like that she thought a minute what night chapter thirteen at the rectory jim cavanaugh sat in his library a book face down on his lap it was ten in the morning and the unseasonable warm spell was continuing that day hed gotten up at five and walked the streets around st elizabeths for a half hour reading his breviary after the sixthirty mass attended by twentythree elderly women and his two altar boys he had returned to the rectory and gone directly to the library that had been nearly three hours ago rose peeked in to see him staring at the window father he looked at her grief all over his face are you all right the question seemed to throw him im fine rose thank you the old woman paused not wanting to push him but concerned will you be having breakfast then i could just reheat the eggs the micro works good on those or even make up some new ones cavanaugh smiled at the housekeeper i forgot breakfast didnt i my rhythms seem all off she supposed he meant to laugh at himselfthat was how he was secure enough to enjoy his own foibles but he didnt laugh maybe as hed said his rhythms were off instead he sighed and went back to staring at the window she didnt like to see him taking the death so hard not that eddie hadnt been a wonderful boy no she guessed he washed beena man though sometimes it was hard to realize it when they grew up right in front of you like that but that was the way life was she thought a vale of tears as the prayer said eddies death was a tragedy no doubt of that but you didnt let yourself sit and stare out windows at least not for too long she learned that when dan had been killed in the war that was life it wasnt fair it was a tragedy all right but it was gods will not for her to understand and she never would not ever she would just have faith and believe that she would see dan again in heaven and if she hadnt pulled herself up by her bootstraps and forced herself back to life she might not have ever recovered that all seemed so long ago now strange to remember that she really thought she wouldnt survive not that there wasnt some pain but it was a different kind now certainly nothing to die over so she could understand fathers reaction in many ways eddie was the son he could never have and his death was another bond to erin lost too she wondered if that hurt him as much as anything no she thought he was after all a priest he probably didnt let himself think like that though a blind person could see the love he had for that woman well she couldnt blame him for that erin was a saint and beautiful to boot she sighed father the priest faced her but didnt even seem to see her his eyes had that hollow look they sometimes got it was her privilege to see him like that when he wasnt on he was lost inside himself shed try to bring him back but slowly in the pioper time no sense bothering him anymore this morning quietly she closed the door and walked back to the kitchen for lunch she thought ill go out to the store and buy some corned beef and a fresh loaf of rye hell be hungry come lunchtime hell never turn down a corned beef on rye erin was thinking that it must be easier for everyone else with their daily activities big ed was back at work steven and jodie were in finals week mick had gone off to rotc drill camp jim cavanaugh had his duties at church everyone had something to take the mind off it she sat at the table in the breakfast nook a cold cup of coffee at her elbow her calendar open in front of herthe calendar by which she ordered her time being there for everyone who asked always finding the energy now she looked down at it slowly she turned the page back to the past week all those appointments unkept look at them dinner plans with ed for wednesday friday and saturday nights his knights of columbus picnic and her note make pasta salad on sunday volunteer work at st marys hospital take mrs ryan to physical therapy the si womens committee had their annual housecleaninggetting the classrooms at st ignatius prepped for the painters before summer school started babysit lotties kids while she and hal went to monterey and that was just the public list there was also the general housecleaning for her perfect house the screens had to go up she had wanted to plant the impatiens for summer the wallpapering she and jim cavanaugh had had their usual thursday lunch although after last week well hed apologized for that had called her that afternoon broken up but managing to sound very much like his old self what had gotten into him wanting to kiss her naturally she had known jim felt something for her but it was probably like the sevenyear itch in marriage the priesthood must have its own cycles it had been her fault reallylistening to him so sympathetically over lunch she had been stupid to ignore the signs she knew them well enough with other men jim was a man and all men even priests had their egos she hadnt meant to hurt him of course but but really that whole thinggod less than a week agohad happened in the far distant past what did it matter now she glanced down at the calendar what did any of it matter now she sighed what if she had seen one week ago the real calendar monday eddie is killed what would happen this week she touched her face her hand shaking no dont start thinking like that but she looked down anyway the week held far fewer appointments none of which she felt she had the strength to keep she wondered who had taken hal and lotties children if theyd gone on their vacation to monterey after all they hadnt been at the funeral stop it she said aloud but her mind kept humming she saw eddies casket at gings heard big eds one sob as he kneeled before it saw frannie almost go down at the gravesite she shook her head again yes the others had it easier now it had been bearable getting breakfast made because big ed had been there next to her touching as they passed one another but now with nothing to do but think and remember she didnt know if she could stand it maybe she should go and wake up frannie but frannie nowhere near as strong as she was needed her rest she was sure of that hi there she was in the doorway erin hadnt even heard her are you okay frannie asked sure im justshe motioned to the calendarthe week just seems kind of long frannie came over next to her she was barefoot wearing one of jodies robes and ran her hand across erins shoulders leaving her arm draped there erin shook her head again unable now to see the calendar why is that she thought and what is this rushing sensation she turned into her daughterinlaw hiding her face in the front of the robe frannie hugged her close and suddenly erin couldnt hold back anymore its all right frannie said its all right over and over as the tears wouldnt stop bunch of dorks steven thought as the class filed out around him everybody talking about how tough the test was what was hard was having to sit there after you were finished for twenty minutes while the rest of the class labored over this bullshit okay so if that got to him hed just stay longer until everybodyd gone you finished steven mr andre a majorleague nerd though he knew his math stood up by the desk waiting normally he called steven mr cochran all the kids here at si were mister so maybe andre felt sorry for him because of eddie well fuck that i was done a half hour ago too easy steven shrugged andre was stacking the other tests cutting him all the slack in the world you want to bring it up he gathered his books head hung down andre was standing right over his desk ill take it im very sorry about your brother thanks that helps a lot steven thought as he squeezed out by him yeah he said big ed didnt tell erin that he called in sick he figured not telling her didnt break their rule about being truthful to each other even when it would hurt she didnt have to know hed come here shed only worry about him and she had enough on her mind the gravesite seemed different they had put the stone up was one thing edward john cochran jr he wished he could somehow wipe off the last numbers make them not have happened go back with his wife and kids to two weeks ago and just stop everything right there for all time kneeling on the wet morning ground he thought about the last time hed seen eddie alive the disagreement theyd had he wished it hadnt happened the same way he wished every tiny event of the last week hadnt ever been as though any small change might have prevented what was anyway the argument hadnt been important and it wasnt as if father and son hadnt gotten along in general sometimes eddie got a little carried away with his brains was all maybe thought his dad was a little too saltoftheearth ed didnt know maybe he was a little simple things seemed to work for him though what was so tough you had to get all worked up over them he didnt get it you just did your job you were faithful to your wife you stuck by your friends that was it not he knew that there werent hard questions like eddies problem with his boss sure that wasnt easy to figure out maybe the man was in trouble and getting deeper but big ed really believed it wasnt eddies problem if it got too serious eddie could just go get another job for a couple of months before starting graduate school there were tons of options all of em gone he moved back into the shade and pulled himself up to sit on a horizontal cypress branch he guessed hed come up here to say a few prayers but for some reason they werent coming out very well his mind kept jumping or rather remembering what if eddie had said what if youd been alive in germany in the thirties and had seen what was going on with hitler would that have been your business well sure so where do you draw the line and ed had sat there in the trophy room surrounded by the memorabilia of his familys life and said its a commonsense thing you figure where its going to hit you so what if you werent jewish and you had a good government job in the third reich it wouldnt have hit you at all yeah but there youre talking evil god versus the devil huh big ed realized how dumb that sounded i guess you also have to figure out if its a big enough issue if it is you get in it how about if getting in it early might keep an issue from getting big in the first place he couldnt help smiling as he thought back on it howd he raised this white knight he had changed tacks whats the matter are you bored at home not enough to do meaning it to be funny but eddie didnt have much of a sense of humor about his notion of right and wrong he hadnt actually spoken harshly to his dad but big ed could tell hed said the wrong thing sometimes eddie said there are just things youve got to do even if everything in your life is rosy or its inconvenient i agree with you hed said placating all im saying is youve got to pick your shots you waste your ammo taking target practice and when real shooting time comes youre out of luck thats really what hed said and suddenly it brought him up short he had really talked about guns and ammo and then less than a week later if there was a connection he thought between that talk and his sons death his brain jumped again what had eddie said about his boss polk at army distributing something about him and his wife and the business was it just that they were in some kind of trouble or was that only what big ed remembered across the cemetery through the trees a black limo was pulling slowly up the hill leading another group of cars to another hole in the ground no he was sure eddie hadnt said what it was big ed kicked at the ground then stood up goddamn he thought i should have listened to him not argued with him maybe id have some idea now about the why of it all theyd laid the sod over eddies grave it was a good job he noticed all but seamless as hed done countless other times working at the park he walked the sods edge pressing it into its bed he wanted the grass over this grave to grow nobody home no surprise there he put his books on the table adjacent to the front door and walked back to his bedroom probably out dogooding somewhere making frannie feel better by taking her to lunch or a museum or a park never mind its my last day of finals never mind how i might feel about eddie being gone never mind anything about ol steven and eddie was gone he was dead eddie dead say it say it say it she hadnt made the bed again well that experiment had certainly worked sure mom told him it was his job but funny it hadnt been eddies or micks or if it had been they hadnt done it and mom had covered but she didnt cover for him not one time and every day he left the bed unmade hoping shed come in as hed seen her do every day with his brothers in their room shed cluck disapprovinglybut then make the beds he turned on the television game shows give me a break he couldnt believe all the smiling and crapola for a couple of questions that hed known every answer to since he was about six he and eddie testing each other on dumb things but loving it what island is tokyo on name the pharaoh who believed in one god what was that gods name who was alben barkley what kind of books did yogi berra read on the road yeah well that was over he punched the remote and killed the sound watch a game show without sound someday if you want to see what theyre really all about so he thought summer vacation he pulled the window blinds up and looked out onto his backyard with its orderly flowers and its fence that he and his dad would patch for the hundredth time in the next few weeks back to the bed into the drawer there next to it snap the switchbladeopen and shut and there was that guys card what does the dart mean he closed the switchblade and laid it on his stomach then crossed hands behind his head on the pillow you think that guy hardy was really doing something about eddie what could he do eddie was in the ground so what could it matter he blinked hard wiping a hand over a leaking eye standing up abruptly switchblade in pocket card in pocket he went to the window again and stared at the fence pop was going to have to fix it himself that wasnt his summer he looked back at the unmade bed and nodded that told him everything he needed to know what a joke hanging around waiting for something to change it was all right here to see if you opened your eyes it might be hot now but he wouldnt be tonight so he grabbed a jacket and carried it outside over his shoulder uncle jim crossed his mindmaybe he ought to go and talk to him sometimes he said a few things that made sense not always but once in a while but hed already walked two blocks down to th which was the opposite direction anyway and it would be just too much troubleone last little fling at trying to salvage what he knew couldnt be time to grow up stevie he stood at the corner of taraval and th watching the traffic line up waiting for the light southbound he stuck out his thumb chapter fourteen another beautiful day this was getting weird hardy thought as he opened the window in his bedroom to let in the fragrant air eddie cochran and jane fowler were playing tag around in his mind if someone had told him he would make love to his exwife ever again in his lifetime he would have bet the ranch against it so here he is last night wandering this house from office at the back to living room up front wondering how it could have happened and at how he felt now that he supposed was the thing how can someone who hed been with so intimately seem like an entirely différent person had she changed that much had he or had they both just forgotten theyd met at a party her father had thrown for her graduation from columbia to celebrate her return to san francisco hardy had been hired for the night as a rentacop moonlighting finishing out his last few months on the force before starting law school there had been some good years he admitted diz in law school thinking he was coasting after vietnam and police work married to the beautiful daughter of a judge yes he remembered thank you the memories had kept him up until dawn which was why when hed finally slept it had been until noon now sitting at the kitchen table sipping espresso when the telephone on the kitchen wall rang he bolted up knocking over his coffee cup he hoped it was jane forgetting that his number was unlisted and he had intentionally not given it to her i dont know glitsky was saying the more i think about it the more it bothers me it bothered me the first time thats cause youre a genius diz me im just a street cop so you are looking into it the pause was a little too long hey abe yo yeah im here glitsky let out a long breath i had a talk with griffin this morning a rare pleasure all too and what did the talk encompass hardy could imagine glitskys face angles sharpened by intensity i dont know diz the more i think about it the harder time i have with it its like im being set up for what remember the politics we talked about is griffin part of that were both up for lieutenant as though that might mean something to hardy so so its griffins case no matter how i feel about it but hes wrong hes not necessarily wrong you dont get to homicide being wrong a lot hardy waited maybe he wants me to make a wave then wipe out on it hardys kitchen window faced across the avenues in the direction of downtown the top of the pyramid and a couple of other skyscrapers floated over pacific heights like mirages shimmering silver against the deepblue sky so why are you calling me he finally asked you got something at stake here i dont i got zip hardy said this is mostly a favor im doing for moses even as he said it it didnt ring very true okay but ill be damned if im going to get officially involved be wrong and look like a horses ass hardy played reasonable abe dont you think the whole might of the force would have a better chance of finding something than me by myself glitsky snorted im a professional investigator ill be around to bounce things off okay hardy took a breath how bout thisi found out why cruz might have lied he ran it down though it too seemed somehow flimsier in the daylight glitsky evidently shared that feeling people lie especially to cops you know that doesnt mean they kill i never said it did glitsky sighed again loudly into hardys ear you know griffins report wasnt completely worthless dont you hardy waited i mean we ran paraffin and cochran did fire the gun there werent anybody elses latents on the weapon no witnesses saw anybody else leave the area yeah he aced himself i guess ill quit hardy motive glitz ive got this oldfashioned idea that people dont just yawn after dinner get up and blow their brains out without some reason but in a week you havent found one four days okay okay yourself after he hung up he stared for another minute out the window his job was simple he didnt have to find whod killed ed he only had to come up with enough evidence to have the coroner conclude that thered been a homicideby person or persons unknown would be fine for his purposes he reached into his pocket took a piece of yellow paper from his wallet and dialed again no answer at frannies what he was lacking was a sense of the sequence of events he wondered what time ed and frannie had finished dinner glitskys call wasnt any kind of help but it made him feel better as though he wasnt in so much of a vacuum through abe he could maybe get his hands on lots of information if he could come up with the right questions just now though he didnt have them his date with jane was tomorrow night he supposed that after most of a decade he ought to be able to wait another day to see her so he went back to his office sat at his desk and started trying to figure out some areas where glitsky might be able to help him he then called the friend of janes fathermatthew r brody iii it turned outand was told he could have an appointment on monday morning he tried arturo cruz at his office and learned that the publisher had taken an early and what was expected to be extended lunch he listened to twelve rings at army distributing before deciding that linda polk probably wasnt at her desk and if she was she was staring at the ringing thing there either thinking it was really groovy or wondering what would make it stop well he thought that killed fifteen minutes it was onethirty the shamrock opened in a half hour maybe moses and he could while away another few hours so long as he was careful to omit any mention of jane the mose had spent many hours reconciling hardy to having put jane out of his life he might have a hard time accepting putting her back in well wait hes here right now moses handed him the telephone and returned to preparing the bar for friday night he pulled the backup bottles from the cardboard boxes on the floor humming offkey as he picked up the nearempties dusted the shelf and put the full new bottles behind him hardy was the only customer and wasnt yet halfway through his first guinness in what seemed like a month although nobody knew for a fact that he was here anyone who knew him at all knew they had a decent chance of finding him at the bar he took the phone spoke for a couple of minutes and hung up moses glanced over at him getting born again doesnt really make you younger i dont care what they say just cause hes a priest doesnt mean hes not a human being hardy answered cavanaugh drank irish whiskey but by the time hed finished his first one the bar had gotten crowded hardy suggested a walk maybe through the park across the street while were talking about reversing roles hardy said you ought to be playing detective howd you locate me at the shamrock i called erin and she asked frannie who gave me your number at home and then when you werent there she said to try calling her brother that he might know where youd gone it was just luck you were there right then if you believe in luck luck faith all those intangibles theyre my stock in trade dismas but something else struck hardy howd erin get in touch with frannie she just asked frannies at her house she didnt go home after the funeral yesterday hardy should have remembered that somewhere he wasnt thinking very well why do you want to know cavanaugh asked hardy shrugged just something i wanted to remember to ask her they had come up by a lake with lots of couples in paddleboats it was a slow midafternoon still and warm they walked along a red cinder path covered over closely with pines dotted sporadically with horse dung on the lake swans floated among the paddleboats while nearer the dock a dozen ducks quacked for a young girls bread innocence the priest said what a beautiful thing hardy looked sideways at the priest alert for a touch of the blarney but cavanaugh seemed genuinely moved his eyes roved around to the trees the sky overhead he seemed almost to be memorizing this moment as though its innocenceif he wanted to call it thatwere something hed later need to draw on in a different life i just couldnt get going this morning cavanaugh said enigmatically their steps crunched in the cinders hardy hands in pockets nodded i really appreciate this the priest repeated apologizing for the third or fourth time reversing roles thats what hed said thered been a bond he felt with hardy instant two guys catholic backgrounds a lot in common there he needed to confess no more he needed absolution and not from another priest he didnt just need the form of forgiveness but its substancethe understanding of one of his fellow men so sure hardy had said why not he felt oddly drawn to the man himselfvictimized perhaps by the charisma but most of hardys friendships had started like that some spark something a ittle unusual as long as there was that confident presence and jim cavanaugh had presence to burn but this apologizing was getting a little old hey father you talk ill listen then maybe you buy me a beer if i get bored ill let you know how about you call me jim okay jim whats the problem jim waited until a couple on horseback had passed i feel likehe stopped and hardy had the sense he was going to apologize again but he didnt nope thats not it he muttered to himself then he took a deep breath i am fairly certain that i sent eddie to his death the crunching sound of their footsteps suddenly sounded more loudly in hardys ears he came by last week im kind of i guess youd say the other father figure in that family he chuckled without any mirth ive always prided myself on my how can i put this my moral courage its what people talk to priests for i guess what they want to hear the rest of the world says to compromise and just get by but ive always viewed our rolemy role the priests role that is as counseling that the hard choices the right choices get made and eddie had some hard choice im sure its why he came to me he wouldnt have bothered if he didnt want to hear it youre sure of that maybe he just wanted to talk jim cavanaugh shook his head no hed had a fightmore a disagreement reallywith big ed his dad if he didnt want to hear somebody else come up with his answer he just would have driven home and forgotten about it you can tell dismas our jewish brethren have a saying if youve got to ask its not kosher this is a little the same thing ed felt he had to ask me he laughed again at himself he wanted to hear that the right thing to do was what he planned to do anyway more he wanted to see if he could get away with not doing it and moral authority that i am i told him he couldnt although his father had said he could suddenly the priest stopped up short he kicked at the wooden border to the riding trail so violently that it broke fuck he said the wooden slat had splintered at the vicious kick cavanaugh stood shaking his head the outburst over he went down to a knee and tried to pat the border back in place then still genuflecting he made the sign of the cross a few seconds later he stood and faced hardy shamefaced im sorry that selfeffacing chuckle some priest i am huh hardy shrugged shit happens he said cavanaugh hadnt heard that one before he laughed looser now well he said now you know why i didnt want to go to regular confession so what was it eddie had to know about they were walking again turning down now through lengthening shadows onto the paved road again you know about the troubles at eds work the distribution thing a little well thats not all i mean it was bad for the company all right but eddie thought they could just tighten belts and build up again within a year or so he was talking to this new company some other newspaper el dia yeah el dia i think anyway he was also trying to get back in touch with the guy whod cut them off cruz hardy thought the priest continued to make a long story short it was just a matter of time before they were rolling again at least that was eddies opinion so whats the moral dilemma there thats not it thats background the problem was that eddies bosspolk i think his name ishe was having a hard time dealing with the longterm approach he didnt want to rebuild the business essentially thats right hed recently married a younger womanvery much younger evidently very beautiful she is youve seen her hardy nodded so have you they were at the funeral that stopped cavanaugh son of a bitch he said hardy was again surprised at the mans flair for anglosaxon what i think if id known that i might have i dont think i couldve done the service whys that i think were going on the assumption that somebody killed eddie isnt that right i dont think he killed himself well if somebody did kill him id just about bet my breviary that polk was involved dont tell me ed was sleeping with polks wife dusk was catching up with them they came out of the park halfway down to the ocean and turned back up toward the shamrock clearly the thought had never occurred to the priest i was eddies confessor dismas and im not abusing the secrecy of the confessional when i tell you that he was faithful to frannie completely he was madly in love with her hardy thought he knew that but it was still nice to hear it okay he said so what about polks wife cavanaugh was grappling with something all this you understand is just trying to get at the truth he said i dont want to be saying things that may be scandalous if theyre irrelevant to what youre doing jesus hardy thought suddenly remembering all too clearly why he had left the church if you took it all seriously as jim cavanaugh certainly did the rules could bind you up til you couldnt even think much less take any action why dont you let me decide this is confession remember it aint going anywhere else the priest considered a moment then nodded eddie thinks thoughtthat polks wife was in it for the money and after the drop in business when the company started losing money suddenly maybe mr polk wasnt so attractive anymore did he know this or was it just a feeling he found out again that hesitation that slow decision to continue he found out something hardy couldnt help himself he stopped walking and laid a hand on the priests shoulder i said id tell you if youre boring me cavanaugh grinned back selfconscious its like i cant just keep talking every single further step seems like a separate decision in high school hardy said id make out with somebody and wonder if the kissing and petting were all separate sins finally i decided no if it was a sin it was just one of em same thing here youve made the commitment so lets get it out cavanaugh grinned his moviestar grin maybe you would have made a good priest after all i think my past was a little too checkered the priest got a kick out of that youd be surprised quite a lot of priests have as you put it checkered pasts i didnt find my vocation til after high school myself that was interesting hardy thought but it didnt get any closer to nika polk so mrs polk what did eddie find out polk was in a hurry for money he laid off a lot of guys eddie would have kept and kept a couple eddie wouldve let go the staff was down to a few marginal workers anyway one of those guys figured eddie was in on it too and let it out that polk was planning some drug deal theyd arrived back at the shamrock behind them an orange and pink dusk was settling onto the pacific the fridaynight traffic here on lincoln was kicking into gear the bar was hopping jukebox blaring moses working the bar like the artist he was he had hardys guinness and cavanaughs bushmills in front of them so fast he might have seen them coming up the street four blocks away the couch against the back wall was flanked by entrances to the bathrooms over it a dirty stainedglass window let in a bit of the days last light patrons kept up a steady stream going by in all it was as private as any confessional hardy could remember cavanaugh had removed his collar he sat hunched forward shirt open startlingly handsome sipping slowly at the irish his reticence was gone it had to come out so here i am listening to a boy i could easily feelhell i do feelis my son and hes just burning i tell you dismas burning to do the right thing he wants to confront polk somehow convince him that it can all work out with his wife then go back to the publisher take em all on one at a time and win them over just by the force of the argument he really saw it so clearly if everybody involved was fair and upstanding it would all work out the company would be saved polk could keep his wife happy the whole magilla hardy sipped his guinness thats eddie sure as shit excuse me although apologizing for swearing in front of this man was upon reflection unnecessary he really thought that way didnt he yeah he did and you tried to point out a little uh reality cavanaugh sat back now the broad shoulders sagging theres my sin dismas thats what ive been getting at the eyes lowered matching the voice we talked a long time eddie and me he was the most wonderful speaker even one on one passionate elegant really convincing he was the kind of kid could flatter you that he wanted your opinion he drained his drink so here i am father cavanaugh and i send this fine man off to slay the dragon do i think about the reality of it about his pregnant wife his real duties whether hes the man for the job no way not me the good holy father cavanaugh thinks about how right he is what a wonderful notion it is how everyone will be so proud his eyes came up pride dismas my pride killed eddie cochran chapter fifteen sam polk stood in the upstairs bathroom combing his hair out the window in the warm night he heard the bubble of the hot tubs jets the soft music his wife was listening to it was nice having a beautiful naked woman in your hot tub hell its nice having a hot tub he took the tiny pair of scissorshe could barely get his thick fingers through the holesand carefully snipped at the hair that persistently grew out of the top of his ears his stomach tightened up on him again not now he thought just think about nika downstairs not the other stuff the hot tub was new the whole houseafter a lifetime in a flat in the missionwas new his life was good think about that dont let the stomach betray you he opened the cabinet and popped two antacids sammy he opened the window the tub glowed in the surrounding darkness looking down from this height he saw her body through the waterthe patches of shadow the curve of flesh be right down he yelled out the window he didnt care what it took he wasnt giving this up it was bad luck the way the business had gone just after the marriage and sure he should have thought more for the future during the good years but he would be damned if hed let anything interfere with this hed worked his whole life starting as a shoeshine boy downtown before he was ten then selling peanuts at seals games finally getting a job with the old callbulletin as a newspaper boy and where the other kids his age had seen it as a parttime gig for spending money he figured he could turn some decent bread by covering the same route and then all the adjacent ones for all four of the local papers those jobs had bought his first truck and now it was fifty years later near what should have been his retirement six months after buying his estate in hillsborough eight months into his marriage to the woman whod made him remember what it was to be a man nosiree he wasnt going to get beaten at this stage but he was getting nervous the money had been in his safe at work all week that had made everything suddenly seem very real before that while not exactly a lark it had had the quality of makebelieve he hadnt yet done anything illegal or at least anything he could be caught for but then the call that the boat had arrived put everything into a new light it was out in the bay waiting for the drop did he have the money where and when could he take delivery so friday had been a scramble day and though hed prepared for it he found there was no way to lessen the fear of carrying around over one hundred thousand dollars in cash hed gone to different branches of his bank in the course of cleaning out his savings in the hopes that no one would review the account activity and by the end of the week hed told himself hed been sure hed have it all back reinvested and no one would be the wiser and now it was the end of the week the problem with this drug thing was that nobody had ever written a book on how to do it it was all seatofthepants and the cash aspect was a major problem if they only took american express and then there was the whole situation with the middlemen his business acquaintance his supplier was one thing they were exchanging product for money but alphonse page who worked for him at the shop was another matter entirely young black street smart neither intelligent nor creative he was nevertheless the person sam found himself depending on the most to pull the whole deal together he had the connection to get rid of this stuff in town he was important he eliminated a whole layer of distribution the problem was after his years doing business he didnt like the fact that someone like alphonse had become important it made his stomach hurt he smiled at himself in the mirror and his stomach answered him with a growling cramp he grabbed his robe from the bathroom door and padded out to the landing down the stairs through the alcove by the front door and into the living room how are you doing sam he nodded and swallowed alphonse he said and seeing his daughter now behind him linda he tried to smile whats going on i was kind of wondering the same thing what do you mean alphonse was tallerfar tallerthan sam but he had an economy of movement a swift jagged way of acting that made him all the more of a force he was absently cleaning his fingernails with a pocket file and sam saw the quick flick outward before he checked himself todays payday man linda popped in remember you were gonna come in to sign the checks i mean alphonse really needed the money alphonse smiled all around i dont do charity man cept my own sam feeling the sweat start to run down under his arms tried to sound calm right no problem there see daddy linda was saying so i figured it would be cool if we just came by i mean i knew where you were so sam held up a hand sure linda he thought take the man i most want to avoid and walk him inside my face his daughter he thought was hopeless no its a good idea why dont you go make yourself a drink while alphonse and i go in the office she seemed to look to alphonse for permission he definitely gave her some message before she started moving back to the bar off the kitchen linda she turned would you mind telling nika ill be out in a minute shes in the hot tub nice place alphonse said as he entered the office then as the door closed what the fucks going on sammy sam his stomach now a jumbled mass of razor blades and ice picks leaned against his desk i think wed better leave it mr polk alphonse okay reestablish that old authority he thought alphonse took the knife and before sam had seen it move his arm was bleeding through the slash in the white robe we do business and its mr polk alphonse said most reasonably as sam felt the blood draining out of his face you fuck with me and its whatever i want sam looked down at his arm registering the blood as interesting he felt no pain except in his stomach im not fucking with you you didnt come to work today fact you didnt come to work this week i didnt know ed cochran was going to get killed monday night you didnt alphonse had turned around and was running his hand over the leather on the back of one of the chairs no of course not why would i sam considered getting to the desk drawer and pulling the gun on alphonse who was getting way ahead of himself sam thought probably thinking about his future riches but then he remembered that until the deal was done he needed him suddenly his arm throbbed and he looked down to see the blood he lifted a thigh over the corner of the desk and slumped against it i feel bad about ed alphonse said i really do i liked the guy he turned back to his boss but like you and me we had business hey you all right sam was feeling himself going over alphonse snapped the knife closed and crossed to the front of the desk he held sam upright pulled the arm of the robe up roughly come on man get a grip you aint hurt let me get in my chair go ask linda to get me a drink force of habit sam thought alphonse still obeyed orders when they were given like orders thats the way to keep control never show your own weakness he was in his chair the terry cloth now pressed tightly against the wound nothing were just talking he heard alphonse say to linda then he had the drink a water glass filled with bourbon he drank off half of it all right he said all right what alphonse swung his legs heels tapping the front of the cherry desk what did you want me to do the place was crawling with cops didnt you tell that to your people alphonse sucked at his front teeth my friends the time thing is like its like critical with them i understand that the booze was working he took another drink whats the matter alphonse this got you nervous the boy had evidently worked his way up and past his earlier bravado now the rush was wearing off im not nervous my friends got contracts they gotta fill sam forced a cold smile at his employee dont give me any of this pseudobusiness bullshit alphonse they got a buncha junkies they gotta keep highsqueeze all the money they can out of them before they die that moneys your money a very small percentage alphonse very small but a nice package yeah sam thought four hundred twentyfive thousand dollars cash a nice profit for his onetwenty investment but only if it worked if it didnt he was basically tapped out he couldnt think much about it if it didnt work tapped out could be the least of it his stomach was arguing with the bourbon but it felt so good everywhere else he ignored it my guys wouldnt deliver not there and not on that particular tuesday thats all there was to it so where and when sam put his head back against the firm leather this wasnt going to fly very well and he knew it theyre gonna let me know shi what can i tell you they said this weekend tomorrow maybe they want to find a better place alphonse pushed himself off the desk walked nearly to the door turned around so what do i do meanwhile what im doin alphonse you wait he came right up under sams nose and sam thought he could smell the fear i cant wait man theyre on my ass they been holdin their money a week now well sam thought i know what a good time that is couple more days tell em by monday night im wrong again theyll cut my nuts off sam finished the bourbon every business has its risks alphonse point is you gotta trust me cause if im scamming you youre meat anyway youre the one sold me to them remember hed been in distribution his whole life buy something from one source move the merchandise and sell it to another for profit that was the american way the only hitch was in this cocaine business you had people who were not entirely trustworthy that was fine sam knew as far as it went people cheated wherever they could at solitaire even but it would be especially stupid to forget it here and he had done that with cruzforgotten that cardinal rule after playing straight for all those years the bastard had just walked away from the deal keep cruz in mind polk told himself if ever again youre tempted to trust somebody in business the arm had stopped bleeding alphonse had been rightit wasnt a bad cut maybe four inches down the front of his arm since he wasnt about to trust anybody on this deal he thought hed set it up smart he still thought so the connection had been from years before an importer a businessman never touched drugs himself theyd talked at a partyit must have been the early seventies when cocaine was just starting to catch on but at the time sam was doing fine with newspaperswho wouldnt in san francisco with the free press rolling stone and the other hippie rags to say nothing of the majors he hadnt needed to risk anything back then hey any time i mean it seed moneys always in demand the connection had said so now the newspaper business had gone bellyup and cruz had hung him out to dry cut off using him for distribution just when he couldnt afford to go broke nika wasnt the kind of woman to go betting on the come hed promised it up front had delivered up to now that was their deal if he broke it he wouldnt even blame her for walking who could a woman who looked like her who could do what she did she could have it all and right now she could demand it anywhere and get it and he knew it more importantly she knew it so hed made the call to the old connection one hundred twenty would bring him between three fifty and five or if he wanted to step on it himself and peddle the street maybe a million or two no he didnt want that he wanted in and out what he wanted was to put up the money to make delivery worthwhile then unload the stuff deal with buyers and sellers individually to groups of guys who didnt know each other who wouldnt be likely to get to each other and set him up everybody makes a profit and everybody needs the middleman so hes safe that was the theory the only problem was he had to take delivery himself he needed alphonse for when it was time to pass the trash and deliver him his money but he didnt want anybody else involved with the actual delivery for that the canal behind cruzs had been ideal hed gone down last weekend cut the fence set it all up perfectly by all rights it should have been over already goddamn cochran he thought god damn ed all to hell jesus sammy no robe even i dont notice much on you move over nika looked at her husband with approval he didnt have a great body but he was hung like a peeing horse and for an old guy he sure wanted to use it a lot well as long as he didnt try to pull any more of that holding out her allowance hed tried last week two could play the holdingout game as shed taught him she reached over and touched the cut on his arm what happened she ran her finger along the cut a lamp got broken linda tripped on a cord what was she doing here anyway nika asked sam shrugged i forgot to sign some checks thats all shes gone does it hurt she moved next to him thigh to thigh he felt a hand come to rest above his knee its nothing he said cant even feel it chapter sixteen hardy had never heard of the town of gonzalez his first inclination after he got the call was to think that for some reason cruz had wanted him out of dodge and had asked one of his workers to call him but that would have made no sense coming from cruz after he hung up hardy went to his map and found the placesouth of salinas on it was a real place on the way down he thought he should have made some calls before getting in his car he almost pulled over in redwood city but then thought it would be better not to worry anybody needlessly what if it wasnt what he thought it was also he was reasonably certain that someonepossibly cavanaugh especially after their hearttoheart yesterdaywould have tried to reach him earlier he hadnt been down the peninsula in nearly a year and it hadnt changed what was left to change the whole thing had been developed so the only possibility of something new was afacelift on a business park a tastee freeze turning into a burger king astroturfing a gas station around palo alto the bay and the flats struggled for the natural look for a few miles along the freeway before widening out into moftett field with its airplane hangars so big that it rained inside them and then the other santa clara fun parksthe minigolf courses batting cages gokart tracks hardy kept his eyes on the road his head hurt just slightly from too much beer really from getting up too early he had told himself really from too much beer the old notenoughsleep routine as the reason for his hangovers was wearing thin even to himself south of san jose the countryside began to open up the foothills still green from the spring rains the scrub oaks starting to bud man he thought when california doesnt screw with itself it is some kind of beautiful place he was speeding and knew it but didnt care the road was all but empty and he had always had a knack for spotting the highway patrol besides he would say he was on a summons from sheriff muñoz of gonzalez and probably get off with a warning anyway but for some reasonmaybe the thickness in his headhe found he couldnt concentrate for long on the reason for the trip it made his headache worse getting into steinbeck country he rolled down the car window to gilroy and the smell of garlic the sun was higher now though there were still wisps of mist over the occasional patch of water it was getting on toward ten oclock a sign at the town limits told hardy that gonzalez was the home of the tigers they sure kept the move from detroit a secret he thought as he passed the onestory high school with its faded billboard his destination was a square concrete emergency clinic painted an institutional yellow set two streets back behind what passed for downtown sheriff muñoz greeted him at the door with a head of balding gray hair and a deep softspoken voice he had all the authority of the smalltown cop with apparently none of the arrogance maybe hed been in the job a long time his uniform was lived in his body solid and big but with no flab the face was square cleanshaven and worried is this your card hardy nodded its the only thing we had tying him to anything no wallet muñoz just looked at hardynot glared lookedbut his eyes were saying that theyd already covered that is he still alive physically he hasnt come up yet hell come around now hes sedated there were only two rooms behind the open reception area steven cochran was in the second one hardy swallowed hard remembering the vision of the brother eddie less than a week ago on a similar gurney jesus they look alike he thought he hadnt noticed it beforesteven had initially struck him as much thinner he forced himself to look maybe because the damage appeared so similar the right side of stevens face was covered with bandage his right arm in a sling with a bandaged hand sticking out of it what happened do you recognize him first things first muñoz was right we gotta call his folks hardy said if you dont mind sir whats your connection to this boy they were in the other empty examination room drinking eleven coffee brought in by the nurse receptionist hardys headache was gone he explained how steven had come to get his card funny thats all he had it was a statement not meant to be accusatory where was it front pocket maybe he lost his wallet the sheriff nodded maybe listen hardy said im not any kind of official but you mind if we talk about it ive got a reference you might muñoz struck hardy as a thorough cop so it didnt surprise him much when he got up to make the call to glitskys home number when the sheriff returned he seemed satisfied okay he said you think this is related to what youre working on hardy drank some coffee and asked him what exactly had happened muñoz had his elbows on his knees hands out in front of him holding the nearly full styrofoam cup his black sunken eyes focused unblinking on the wall over hardys head hardy thought they were about the saddest eyes hed ever seen the sheriff said lady named hafner grows chokes maybe six miles south she and the family were on their way up to the farmers market in salinas they usually leave before dawn and try to get a good place you know so theyre turning onto and one of the kids sees what he thinks might be a deer by the road anyway thats food you know so momma stops and its stevens the name huh steven so she got here and the doc called me there was a long pause as though muñoz was trying to fathom how things like this could happen i figureand the doc says it makes sense he was thrown from the vehicle already unconscious thats probably why he lived he was so loose just pretty much peeled the right side of his body broke his arm collarbone couple of foot bones could he have just fallen bounced out of the back of an open pickup maybe yeah he couldve he didnt though hardy waited he was muñoz paused sexually molested maybe the rest of the injuriesthat look a hell of a lot like a beatingmaybe they could have come from the impact hitting the ground at sixty but the one got it hardy said just once id like to catch up with somebody does something like this not after a trial or anything but catch em redhanded it would be a great joy hardy agreed your friend glitsky in the city he gonna call missing persons you think let em know hardy thought that he probably wouldglitsky believed in following through but hardy didnt feel right making the commitment for him after all glitsky dealt in homicides lost and found children were not his problem and if somebody in san francisco had the bad grace to get killed on this fine saturday morning its possible he might forget it wouldnt hurt if we called he said though he let muñoz do it officially warm and drowsy smell of fresh linen had mom finally made his bed steven tried to open his eyes they didnt seem to work the eyelids were too heavy his whole body too weak well just a few more hours sleep cant hurt its the summer after all but that jarred some memory leaving the house striking out on his own riding in the truck with those two guys heading for la but in no real hurry mostly theyd said into partying into cruising that sounded okay it began to come flooding back and involuntarily he groaned theyd accepted him right away including him when they stopped for a few road beers before theyd left the city the beers didnt taste very good but steven wasnt about to let on this was part of being an adult and he was tired of being treated like a kid or worse a nothing so hed act like an adult go along be cool he got a little more worried when the joints came out but knew he was just being uptight lots of guys in school smoked dope all the time it just hadnt been his thing but it wasnt as though it was any big deal or really wrong it did make him cough though and the guys had laughed at him a little but he could tell it was all in fun they coughed too only not so much after that in this blurry haze theyd stopped for something to eatmaybe in gilroysome really fantastic burgers that they took to this special spot for a picnic and then things got scary kind of with the two guys starting to tickle him and other stuff then really rough if he hadnt been so dizzy and messed up he probably could have outrun them but when he pulled loose and tried that his coordination was gone and after they caught him he thought he remembered other things but the drowsiness was still there and it was too hard to think about and where was mom then if the bed was made just in the other room probably god itd be great to see mom he called out for her that was a sound hardy waiting for muñoz to return from his phone call ran around the corner to stevens room the boy lay still unmoving this was the hostility kid he rememberedswitchblade fuzzedout television and all he shook his head talk about a bad week for the cochrans had eds death somehow precipitated this driven him over the edge of his own despair or was there some more immediate link like might steven have known something he shouldnt have hell hed find out when steven came to if he had known his assailants or more particularly if hardy knew them big ed looked anything but big staring down at his bandaged youngest son he was a shell of the man in the old but elegant suit hardy had met at the funeral reception now a very worn green usf sweatshirt hung loosely over work pants and boots everything hung too loose one bootlace wasnt tied he stared as long as he could then squeezed his thumb and forefinger into his eyes muñoz stood next to him are you all right sir big ed nodded long night he said we thought we thought sure but hes not not even close hes not close he repeated and suddenly a shudder went through him and he was crying hardy went out to the reception area where a small boy with the beginnings of a shiner and a large red knot on his forehead sat stoically as his mother explained to the receptionist how hed stepped on the tines of a rake and the handle had popped up and hit him in the face hardy walked outside into the bright sun he was hungry the place on gonzalezs main street sold burritos the size of a suitcase for and hardy bought three chewing on one while he carried the other two wrapped back to the clinic muñoz and ed talking by the sheriffs car took the food big ed seemed a little better sorry i didnt recognize you in there he said to hardy hows the boy still sleeping you have any idea who did this i wish hardy said you reported him missing did he run away or what whats the other option muñoz asked hardy shrugged its unlikely but he might have been kidnapped thats crazy ed said we dont have any money it might have been to keep him quiet maybe he knew something the two men chewed their burritos about ed i mean that stopped big ed what do you mean they say eddie killed himself he swallowed hard i doubt it i doubt it very much well then what hardy could see it was almost too much for the man his hand went up to his eyes again he shook his head as though trying to clear it the receptionist came to the door the boys awake she said at least he wants to be home big ed was thinking thats something being back home hed said it daddy take me home daddy nobodyd called him that in ten years it was always either dad pop or ed well if steven wanted daddy now daddy was taking him home there he and erin might be able to figure out if and where theyd screwed up so he wouldnt want to run away again he looked around to the back seat where steven lay sleeping again strapped down by the seat belts he okay hardy asked ed nodded muñoz and hardy had thought itd be better if ed didnt have to drive back alone with his son so they arranged that the sheriffs one deputy would drive hardys car back to the city later ed again glanced into the back seat he couldnt look enough at his son couldnt really believe yetafter the fears of last night sitting up with erin his daughter jodie and franniethat steven along with eddie wasnt dead and gone forever whatever had happened whatever hed been through at least he was still with them breathing he mustve sighed with relief because hardy looked over at him this guy hardy was driving wellslow and careful no bumps on the kid and it was a good thing he was drivinged was pretty sure he couldnt have kept his mind on the road they were up to san mateo the sun was behind the mountains already where had the hours gone to in another half hour theyd be home maybe sometime today erin had gotten some sleep he hoped so she hadnt slept now in almost a week erin his thoughts as always were never far from his wife he didnt know how they were ever going to get over this time though something told him they would well almost theyd never be the same of course the woundlosing eddiewas too deep to ever heal completely but there would be something some new challenge that would get things into a new perspective at least he hoped so why had his boy run away you have any proof somebody killed eddie he asked suddenly nope but then hardy told him what cavanaugh had said about sam polkthe drug thing thats something ed said i knew something was going on with polk eddie and i kind of argued about it thats what cavanaugh saidthat eddie wanted another opinion when did you talk to jim yesterday last night he thought he might have something of a lead i was going to check around a little today but then this morning he ticked his head toward the back seat i dont know why youre doing this but thanks hardy kept his eyes on the road i knew ed and frannie pretty well her brothers my best friend turning west up the now as dusk deepened passing the huge cemetery with its thousands of white squares gridding the grassy fields marking the graves of military dead ed reached behind the seat and rested a hand on his sons leg feeling the warmth of it through the blanket steven stirred and moaned softly but didnt open his eyes almost there hardy said hed made a dumb turn coming up this way even though it was the most direct route the cemetery was closing ed up and hardy swore at himselfhe should have remembered it maybe he could distract him a little get his mind off it your friend father cavanaugh is some kind of character jim yeah hes a great guy only thing i cant figure is why hes not a cardinal or somethingat least a bishop ed smiled i know hes got that flair dont he he paused but if he were a bishop hed have to leave erin and i dont think hed like to do that that remark surprised hardy he must have shown it its no secret hes in love with my wife ed said but then held up a hand no no not like that hes one of us erins his best friend hes hers except maybe for me he smiled again except sometimes im not sure of that either i think thatd make me nervous hardy said well after thirty years i figure erins my gal weve talked about it but she says the physical thing just never was there with jim he shook his head how do you figure that she prefers a galumpf like me she says i figure its her one flaw but believe me ill take it hardy glanced over at him he said it in such a selfeffacing way you almost missed the serene confidence this man knew without a trace of doubt that he knocked his wife out its good to know they dont always go for the movie stars not being one myself hardy said relieved they had finally gotten by the cemeteries into daly city and all the little boxes on the hillsides i dont think theyd let jim be a bishop anyway why not ed shrugged hes not political enough done a few unusual things for a priest such as coming to me for his confession hardy thought but asked like what oh nothing serious just stuff okay they werent going to talk about it but then it took him about twice as long as anyone to get out of the seminary they kicked him out twice kicked him out ed shrugged well it was the fifties early sixties the church thought it had a lock on these guys any little thing theyd say you didnt have a true vocation and boot you not like now where if youve got a history as a gunrunner to nicaragua you still got a pretty good chance they need priests so bad so what did he do jim ed laughed remembering i should know i went with him he got about two weekends off a year and so this one time we got plastered and took in some strip showserin was at school so the two of us were ripe for some hijinks but the problem was the next day he showed up back at the seminary hung over and confessed everything bad scene they put him out for a semester to rethink his vocation what was the other time that was different i dont know i ever got the story right erin and i were on our honeymoon it was maybe a month before his ordination wed already received the invitation anyway jim had decided he wasnt worthy or something like that he wanted to be a priest but didnt feel he was holy enough can you imagine that if jim wasnt holy enough there was no hope for anybody else i mean where it counted hardy looked across the front seat by now it was nearly dark the streetlights in the lower avenues had come on see they tried to tell him everybody had those doubts priests werent supposed to be saintsthey were humans like the rest of us they werent about to let him drop out he was the president of his class was going to be the speaker at the ordination theyd invested too much in him so what happened so he stole the deans car crashed out through the front gate and disappeared for three days cavanaugh did that and then showed up looking like a bum and without the car he never talks about those three days except to say it was his time in the desert whatever that meant anyway he pissed everybody off pretty good now those same guys his classmates are becoming the bishops and they all like jim probably but think hes a flake or at least a little bit of a flake for sure too unstable to move up in the hierarchy but he did finally get ordained yeah two years later hed done his penance but he wasnt valedictorian they turned onto taraval in the back seat steven moaned gently almost home son ed said almost home frannie looked much better erin much worse hardy sat drinking his second scotch waiting for the opportune moment to make an exit everybody here was tiredhell exhausted jodie was already asleep her gangly frame draped over the love seat erin and ed sitting together like statues holding hands kept looking at each other as if wondering what was going to happen next but there was a toughness hardy noticed in ed here was a man whod lost a son only a week before just that morning hardy had seen him break down into tears but here now sitting next to his wife he was hanging in there for her in spite of his own hurt hardy thought he might be the bravest man hed ever met thanks for the drink he said i think its time i called a cab frannie walked with him outside how are you making out he asked her can i ask you one more question sure her red hair gleamed in the porch light she looked like shed finally eaten something her eyes were clear you said eddie left right after dinner she nodded do you have any idea what time that was he hated to ask to see her eyes cloud over again but he had to know it was still light out pretty early i guess sevenish why the cab pulled up because it shouldnt take two and a half hours to drive from your place out to china basin no its only like fifteen minutes yeah i know he admired the way when her shoulders started to sag she tightened up her jaw he leaned down and pecked her on the cheek im checking this stuff out frannie you keep hanging in there she put her arms up around him and held tight for a moment the cabbie honked she let go when the cab got to the corner hardy looked back frannie was still standing out by the curb hanging in there hardy thought nope abe come on you said yourself hed never seen the guys before how can there be a connection its too big a coincidence dont you think no i dont think but that plus the drug thing with eds boss possible drug thing whats the matter with you hardy you taking drugs yourself after another minute hardy hung up what more did glitsky need where theres smoke theres fire right and there was enough smoke here to cure meat it was ten oclock saturday night the deputy hadnt yet arrived back from gonzalez with his car not for the first time hardy wished he didnt have a rule about keeping hard liquor in his house he went into his bedroom fed the fish walked back to his office he picked the six darts from the board by the fireplace and stood by his desk just at the tape line hed put down there and threw methodically trying to let his mind clear frannie was positive that ed had left the house around seven cruz said that he had left work around eightthirty and nobody had been either in the building or the lot at that time it was about a fifteenminute drive from eds to cruzs hell of a lot of time to kill and that was the minimum he might notve gotten to cruzs until ten nobody knew damn glitsky there was something here hardy was sure of it a little manpower and they could at least get a fix on the whereabouts of all the principals where for example had cruz gone at eightthirty maybe hed just sat in the lot waiting for a meeting and polkwhat had polk been doing monday night maybe eds meddling in his private business was going to cut into nikas lifestyle and he couldnt allow that all right he had the background it was beginning to look as if hed have to do some oldfashioned police work and he didnt relish the thought thats why they have police departments he thought because the legwork is awesome its why they have rookies and he hadnt been a rookie in nearly twenty years but if abe wouldnt help he reached again for the phone intending to give it one more try even if it was a saturday night and glitsky was at home relaxing with his wife he turned off the answering machine in the office and plugged the phone into the jack the doorbell oh my god jane he dropped the darts on his desk and sprinted around the corner through his bedroom and kitchen and down the hall it wasnt jane mr hardy hardy nodded your keys sir and the sheriff says thanks again hardy remembered his manners you want a cup of coffee how you getting back down he had stood up jane there was no way she was still waiting for him highway patrol will pick me up if i could borrow your phone the sheriffhe got it okayed hardy made a pot and the two men talked baseball for most of an hour while they waited for the highway patrol after the deputy had gone hardy stood outside on his front lawn the fog had come in though it wasnt heavy it presaged a return to normal weather without a coat on he walked up to the corner and saw the restaurant where he was to have met jane the lights were still on he stood outside its front window looking in jane wasnt there cold now he jogged back to his house coming up the steps he heard the telephone ringing but it stopped when he was inside running back to the office maybe if it was jane he could meet her for a nightcap explain what had happened maybe shed even believe him but there was no message on the answering machine because he had unplugged it somebodys trying to tell me something he thought picking up his darts again he hit every number from twenty down to the bullseye in thirtyfour throws chapter seventeen he and jeffrey had to get it straight it had eaten at cruz all day from the earlymorning jog along the marina to brunch at greens it had kept him from his saturday nap had even driven him from his house to the office in the middle of the afternoon now after the late dinner and two bottles of wine in the afterglow he saw no way to avoid it any longer jeffrey lay flat on his back half covered with a pink sheet he appeared to be asleep but cruz didnt think he was he was very much like the cats he loved so much he just relaxed completely with his pilot on slow burn at the gentle touch cruz running a finger from armpit to nipple he opened his fantastic eyes visible as blue even in the halflight hi jeffrey whispered im right here this was the boys element the trick to cruz was to be happy with him here and to quit trying to turn him into something he wasnt hed thought about it all day jeffrey wasnt made for intrigue or businesshe was made for pleasure for relaxation you are here arent you always cruz sighed god he loved him can we talk a little funny how he wasnt really the boss here at home and it didnt bother him at all sure he sat up pulling the blanket around his waist i think we have to get clear between us that ed cochran never came here jeflfrey cocked his head but he did arturo i know i know he did but our story yours and mine should be the same if anyone else asks about it jeffrey opened his eyes all the way but why shouldnt we tell the truth we talked to him whats wrong with that in itself nothing but there are people who might try to make it something but why because jeffrey he was killed in my parking lot but he wasnt killed he killed himself you said he did of course cruz said speaking slowly now i know that thats what i meant but his death is connected to me by that very fact and i think it would be smarter not to draw any further attention to it jeffrey reached out a long hand and drew his fingernail across cruzs jaw turo you didnt kill him did you cruz folded his hands in his lap and forced himself not to lose his temper jeffrey tended to keep missing the essential point no jeffrey i didnt kill him but you did see him that night no when you came home so late we agreed i came home before nine oclock didnt we weve already told the police that arturo jeffrey shook his head from side to side yes and i love you for the world you came home when around nine right but between us he let it hang the police think it was a suicide you called the police i just happened to notice it at the office this afternoon the daily police reports for the paper you know thats why you went to the office cruz hated that bitchy petulant tone but then the real hurt showed you could have let me know jeffrey said reaching out and touching his face you dont tell me enough we are together he said we share we do share cruz said i want to share jeffrey got up and walked naked over to the window and you want me to say we never met ed here probably no one will ask i just want to make sure jeffrey turned back toward him think being honest is the best thing arturo if you start telling lies they tie you all up you can even forget what the real truth is jeffrey i agree with you im finding that out now the only thing is i already told the police i didnt know ed if we juston this one thingagree we wont lie about anything else jeffrey sat again on the bed you promise promise how could he expect jeffrey to understand he sat on the brocaded couch downstairs facing the fireplace the vodka which had once been iced was nearly untouched and had now gone warm through the gossamer drapes light from the street filtered into the living room enough to make out the familiar outlines the chandelier over the twelvefoot marble table the twin sculpted marble pillars that bracketed the fireplace the polar bear rug at his feet the trio of original gormans on the far wall bought long before his tiles had become available in every boutique in the west in the quiet house cruz took stock of what hed acquired it still felt like it was worth it in fact it wasnt complete yet the room was beginning to feel a little small the house just slightly worn he was ready to move up again keep that in mind he said comfort is stagnation keep wanting more that was the key keep that sharp edge if you werent expanding you would contract a car labored up the steep hill and a minute later cruz heard the soft plop as the sunday paper hit his driveway morning already the darkest hour before dawn before the black began turning to gray no it would be impossible for jeffrey to understand jeffrey hadnt come up the way he had cruz didnt even have to try to remember it was always with him when hed been jeffreys age he was starting to think like an old man sound like his father had sounded when he talked about the bracero life i used to be up by three turo to work the fields before the sun got too hot well cruz had done his own laboring only in different fields no jeffrey could never understand what it was like to be mexican poor and gay and cruz was never going back to poor even now in san francisco where the heteros joked about their minority status in the latino community to be gay was to be a leper macho still ruledcruz knew it would never change during his lifetime every week or two he would come across a story about one of the mission gangs or another beating mutilating or killing some poor maricon long ago he had decided not to run those stories people didnt want to read them they werent newswhat happened to those pervertidos was not important at least not among la gente not among his advertisers and readers cruz had learned well no one could ever know about him his parents had died never suspecting at least his mother never stopped pushing girls at him especially after la hora had started to become successful so hed simply done without sex except for the vacations that had brought him back home disgusted with himself he had done withoutuntil hed met jeffrey and even with jeffrey even with love for him pumping so hard through his veins that he didnt feel he could control himself he had been cautious first hiring him getting to know him at the officea joy just to watch him move then a late meeting or two until the declaration and after thatbliss but still the need for secrecy which jeffrey didnt really understand but respected gayness to jeffrey had never had to be that big an issue he was the type of boy whod always known what he was and who was happiest in a relationship they lived quietly at home a publisher and his employee private lives discreetly handled the house creaked somewhere upstairs was he up cruz listened but the place reverted to silence even ed cochrans visitthe most surprising thing that cruz could remember in his business lifehadnt started out badly if both jeffrey and cochran hadnt been so naïve so idealistic it mightve been okay he slugged at the tepid vodka his face contorting into a grimace remembering that thursday night it hadnt yet gotten dark they were finishing an early dinner when the doorbell rang and jeffrey had jumped up to answer it seeing the nicelooking kid in a coat and tie with a briefcase jeffrey had said sure they had a couple of minutes cruz had wanted to scream no jeffrey we dont not here but ed cochran was already inside the house shaking hands and there was nothing to do but be polite and bluff it and theyd sat right here in this room as cochran had explained that he hadnt been sent by his boss or anything hed just done some figuring on his own and had devised a way to keep armysam polks companyin the distribution chain for another year after which time they could be phased out and cruz could have his inhouse operation at no loss of profit see hed explained it was more or less a loan situation that would enable army to keep drawing income and stay in business while polk set up some other networks to cover for the loss of la hora cochran had had all the details right there on paper he was sure that cruz didnt mean to wipe out all the families who worked at armyespecially when there was an alternative and it was just a matter of a slight compromise on his part cruz couldnt believe it here was some dumb kid asking him to forgo his entire reorganization to accommodate some businessman whod gotten caught in the squeeze but it wont have any negative effect on your business hed said after cruz had said no it will affect cash flow for a year minimum why had he even argued with him it was strictly a business decision having nothing to do with the personal fortunes of another companys employees but you could survive that couldnt you wouldnt it be worth a little sacrifice for the grief youd save other people was this kid for real no one not even cruz could predict what his business would need to survive what might el dia do if he gave them a hole to crawl through cruz had been about to toss ed but then jeffrey had butted in he might be right arturo it could perhaps be done it cant it had been an outburstatypical behavior for him normally it would have rolled off him but he recalled he had felt jeffrey might be coming on to cochran well in any case he should have kept his cool not started bickering with jeffreyand in front of cochran where if the boy wasnt blind he would see that they were arguing not like employer and employee but like lovers even if it could be done he wasnt going to do it he had no investment in army distributing or any of the others what happened to them was their own problem and if they hadnt planned contingencies for the loss of la horns business it just showed poor management and validated his decision to stop dealing with them in the first place thank god he had realized what was happening in time hed smiled pulled back into himself and asked jeffrey to go get a bottle of wine when he was gone hed turned to ed cochran i will meet with you after hours at my offices i do not discuss business at home and jeffrey though welcome to his opinions does not help me make policy is that very clear cochran had nodded i appreciate it there will most probably be nothing to appreciate cochran gave him a warm smile well at least ill have tried yes youll have done that and before jeffrey had come back theyd agreed on monday night at ninethirty just the two of them to talk chapter eighteen the more alphonse thought about it the more it didnt hold up he sat having early ribs and greens at maxies on buchanan trying to figure how to keep himself alive until this deal went down james his man was losing faith in him this being hisalphonsesfirst pass at middleman his credibility was low it had taken all of his jive to persuade james to keep the buy happening and even at that he wasnt certain any longer that it would come off if he couldnt get the deal closed right now it would be over everybody else would just walk from it it would maybe take him some time but polk would find other buyers and james would just write him off as a loser and go on to a better source if he didnt just off him meanwhile alphonse got no bread for all the hassle and wound up where hed always been on the goddamn street unconnected and going nowhere fast he thought about it the smart bloods made things happen themselves didnt wait around while everybody else figured how they were going to get their piece and the more he thought the more it felt all wrong i mean cochran for instance nicest guy in the world no two ways about it but why had he been at the delivery spot straight eddie must have been part of this thing and that meant polk was somehow trying to cross him he chewed on some gristle trying to figure out these money guys outside it drizzled through light fog still as death a dog peed on the building across the street sniffed at one of the paper bags in the curb everybody had gotten nervous when the money hit the table that was the problem until last week everybodyd been very cool just putting together some times when the transfer could get made and down at army with most of the crew laid off with cochran out trying to drum up new business and sam gone half the time there hadnt been any work so he and linda had just hung out around the office getting high but then suddenly it wasnt just talk and everybody seemed to want to move very fast and there had been nowhere to move to polk didnt have the stuff sure there was an excuse about eddie being killed there but that smelled bad that smelled really bad the more he thought maxie was pouring some more chicory coffee into the cracked white mug she was a good mama black and fat as they come but just hanging back cooking her ribs keeping cool hey maxie alphonse said i ask you a question i need a second opinion maxie stopped pouring looked down at him yep you ugly she laughed and laughed alphonse smiled himself waiting til she stopped okay honey what but suddenly before he could even ask her he saw it it was so obvious he couldnt believe he hadnt seen it he put his full mug down hard spilling it out over his hand watch out child what you doin he smiled up at maxie thank you mama he had to get away from it a little maybe just far enough to laugh for a minuteto see it all clearly everybody was playing the same game james had protection for his moneymajorleague protectionand still he was nervous and polk had the same case of nerves which meant he had the same basic situation his money was sitting waiting to move it was on the table out but in polks case it probably wasnt protected the question was where was the table alphonse was surprising himself and liking it the thing with linda on friday had started it when hed been so uptight about james that he just couldnt deal with any excuses about how her dad was having a tough time and couldnt alphonse wait til monday for his check he couldnt have cared less about the goddamn checkwhat he wanted was to talk to fucking sam polk who was stringing him out so hed slapped linda hard the first time hed slapped anybody he didnt think much of guys who slapped their women around before and of course linda wasnt his woman but slapping her had gotten her attention of course she had known where her dad was she just hadnt wanted to tell alphonse but then suddenly they were allies of a kind it was as though she looked at him now not as a jiveass employee of her father younger than she was but a man worthy of respectsomebody who could get things done it was a good lesson he got off the bus and transferred to the cable car near union square it took him up by the fairmont and back down toward the wharf he jumped off without paying the tourists oohing and aahing freezing their asses off they paid hed never been to lindas apartment before standing in the gusty alcove he had a moment of doubt before he rang the bell what if she wasnt home wouldnt let him in wasnt alone maybe he should have called to make sure but then he remembered the slap the power he was starting to tap into he was on a roll he had to go with the feeling and linda might know where her father was keeping the money she might not even know that she knew but alphonse now had no doubts that he could convince her to talk and if something was worth finding out it would come out he could make it happen whenever he wanted now that he knew how to go about it damn she should have fixed herself up you just never knew what was going to happen now here it is before noon on a sunday and somebodys at the door and if its daddy hes going to see me in my robe and hair still uncombed and the place a mess and hes going to think im a slob when really im just alone and its hard to do all these things for yourself with nobody to care about it pushing the voice button who is it pressing the door buzzer at the same time hey its alphonse she had to stop doing that letting people in before she knew who it was but then he was probably inside the door downstairs and there wasnt anything she could do about it now besides thinking about it what a nice thing shed thought about alphonse a couple of times this weekend just spaced out watching the tube yesterday sure he was like pretty young and black and all that but he did have kind of a cute face and a nice hard body and it was a neat rush just to fantasize and driving home from daddys with alphonse sitting so quiet next to her she really had gotten the feeling that he was nervous like he was thinking about them being together in the car at night he hadnt done anything though it was like other things were on his mind over saturday maybe hed been fantasizing a little too maybe he really liked her a little shed studied him on friday after hed hit herit wasnt any big thing she knew guys just got riled up sometimes and had to make a pointdaddy would still do it cuff her from time to time but with alphonse it had kind of made her look at him different like he was showing her this private part of him opening up flattering in a way she was four floors up and it wouldnt take him long so she ran into her bedroom dropped her robe on the floor and pulled on a pair of jeans and a tshirt no time for underwear then a quick brush through the hairbarefoot was okay in the bathroom the water was cold but felt good on her face no makeup but at least shed be clean a last look not bad the place wasnt exactly a mess certainly it had been much worse a couple of pillows out of place some dishes on the drain on the way to the door she dropped the pizza delivery box into the garbage then kicked the coffee mug and the box of ritz and the empty coke cans under the couch hey alphonse said sauntering in past her whats happenin he wore a red tank top under unbuttoned army fatigues his face seemed to shine in the rooms light howd you know where i lived he smiled looking his real age for a minute i looked it up man he bopped over to the window and looked out his body became very still hands at his side he stared without a word at the bay and alcatraz beyond as though something was on his mind well she could give him time she didnt know him very well yet this was kind of how hed been on friday though at work he had always seemed more energetic jumpy almost especially that last week when theyd done the tootthen hed really been fun laughing and cutting up he could do eddie murphy better than anybody he turned around motioned with his head righteous he said the view he seemed to notice her for the first time his eyes rested for a second on her breasts traveled down her body im glad you came by i wasnt doing anything she made what she thought was a cute shrugging gesture you want a beer or something help yourself in the fridge im not done making up yet she went back into the bathroom heard the refrigerator door open a second later he was leaning against the doorway looking at her in the mirror as she brushed on some powder heyshe made it sound lightill be out in a minute okay he just stayed there sipping at his beer come on alphonse youre making me nervous he shrugged nothing to be nervous about its just me he put the beer down on the back of the toilet just reaching over casually she felt his hand on her waist then move down across her backside what are you doing moving a step sideways away from his hand but turning around toward him giggling come on give me a minute i dont got a minute he said his eyes werent laughing she caught a look at them in the mirror then turned completely to face him whats the hey she said thas right he still wasnt smiling his penis was jutting out from the front of his fatigues his eyes locked onto her face alphonse he held it in his right hand and pulled her toward him with the other you want some of this it wasnt a question he took her hand and put it on him it was going pretty fast now his other hand went behind her neck and she was kissing him still gripping him hard as though holding for her life on a thick piece of wood it felt hard as wood she pushed him back he wasnt fighting her anymorethey were in it together she let go of him for a minute and undid her jeans pulling them half down getting herself up on the countertop god alphonse throwing her arms around his neck yeah he said yeah i got this situation they sat at the glasstopped kitchen table each drinking some mickeys big mouth from the sixpack that alphonse had gone down and bought on the corner about a half hour earlier he was finally getting around to what hed come for or getting around to something else hed come for they werent exactly doing lines as a thing where theyd just keep going through the day and into the night but theyd had a few toots from the small pile of blow on the tabletop alphonse was wearing his red tank top and his camouflage pants linda had some hipcut bikini briefs that with the tshirt hanging a little low made it look like she was wearing nothing when you looked from the side say what you want about the face alphonse thought the girl has got legs that go all the way up but that part was over for the time being and he had some business to conduct she looked at him with a cocked head loose now and feeling pretty good talk to me its like this he began and ran down to her the scam hed developed on the way over borrowing heavily from his experiences in the past two weeks he had this situationhe liked that word the mysterious authority behind itwhere he knew two guys one of them had formed the impression that he alphonse was a dealer another dude he knew was in fact a dealer anyway the first guy had a couple of grand to lay out for some good blow but his source had dried up where the second guy had a good stash and was always looking for buyers so i figger put em together and whats for alphonse he sucked on his index finger and picked up some powder running it around his gums then a little wash with mickeys get me linda nodded solemnly butalphonse smiled a big smilei lay my hands on some green i buy the stash cut it sell it keep a pile for you and me to party a bit andhe held up his stilldamp index finger and have some pocket money left over maybe do the whole thing again its hard to get money linda said getting started thats always the thing he sipped at the beer again taking his time then reached a hand across the table and patted her face you a bad woman he said gently he ran his finger over the table again pressing into the pile of coke to get a lot on it and put it at lindas lips she opened her mouth and he put the finger down under her tongue and left it there a second umm she said bad she held his hand there his finger in her mouth with both of her hands they stared at each other when all the cocaine was surely long off the finger she took it out and giggled wow she said she looked down at the last of the pile getting low thing is alphonse said if we could just score a loan they dont loan for that but think maybe two hours the whole thing takes thats all we need is some bread for two hours alphonse sipped beer again then brought the bottle down in middrink hey as though hed just thought of it your old man linda shook her head hes not into stuff like that with the rush and all feeling pretty good it was hard for alphonse not to laugh maybe he wouldnt have to know he could front it and never know it like think it was something else maybe you ask him for a down on a car like that six months ago maybe not now alphonse looked down disappointed now play this one cool man here is the punch line you think he got anything at the office the office yeah you know petty cash like that linda shook her head no i dont think so sometimes but worth lookin i dont know its hey its gone two hours if its there wholl know like where though he got a safe or something or what yeah sure in the back behind his desk we check it out what do we lose what if hes there alphonse looked at her he been there all week he reached over and touched her face again like a reminder he tapped her cheek we look huh nothing there no big deal wed have it back hey like tonight even hed never even know linda still unsure he just wouldnt have that much in the safe hey but if he does why would he the way the business is going shit girl i dont know maybe hes saving to buy his cute piece o honey somethingdont want her to find out linda stopped arguing looked down at the table ran her own finger through the last of the pile and rubbed it in against her gums youre right she said her voice suddenly gone husky it cant hurt to check can it you know the combination i know its under the blotter on the desk but it wasnt so they spent about forty minutes looking for it until alphonse got on the floor and pulled out the elbow rest or writing pad or whatever it was that was stuck in the desk with a little groove on the bottom that you could put your finger in and then pull out he always kept it under the blotter hey baby its cool the main thing is we got it now he whistled five numbers up to eighty you ever open the thing she nodded sliding off the desk where shed been sitting sulking coming down very hard you got any more blow she asked alphonse had a few lines as always and he hadnt poured them out back at lindas on the general rule that you dont tap out but he figured now was tap city or bust this be the table jacks he felt it and as hed earlier proved he was on a roll maybe a line two he smiled his bright smile and the man be dealin he was careful pouring the cocaine onto the wooden desk cutting it cleanly into four lines with his pocket knife the one hed used on sam it was a sharp knife they made a game out of it right two alphonse said and linda on her knees with her ass sticking outwas she doing that on purposeand her titsand alphonse loved titsbig and firmlooking held up under the tshirt just turned that little dial left eighteen daddys gonna shit we dont get this back well get it back right seventyseven sunset strip you wanna she giggled right nine he said okay leftdont go past itsixtythree he expected theyd go at it nine eleven forty times but goddamn if the thing didnt open just like a refrigerator linda wordless reached in and pulled out one of the packets of hundreddollar bills tied with a bankers ribbon on which was written in red felttip pen alphonse eased his ass off the desk and made himself go slow the fifteen feet across to her she just held it out like what is this he took it riffled it realizing deep in his heart that it was the real thing that this was the numberone end of the line roll to end all rolls he crossed back to the desk the packet of money fit easily into the front pocket of the camouflage pants goddamn he said surprised at the high end to his voice he turned to look at linda still kneeling by the safe goddamn you hear me god goddamn he felt like he had to go to the bathroom how much is there linda asked her voice small now behind the cavernous roaring rush in alphonses ears he didnt even hear her over at the desk now he saw the knife and maybe a quarter line of powder and knowing hed just busted the house he leaned down and scraped it into a small pile licked his finger ran it over the wood and then popped it hito his mouth how much is there enough for your deal he turned around what was she talking about she was still kneeling by the open safe which seemed to be filled with packets like the one in his pocket and she was crying is that enough she repeated it was like he couldnt understand what she was saying he crossed over to her took her face in both his hands hey going to kiss her but she turned away again hey her eyes came up to him its all for her isnt it she asked he saved all this for nika what what are we gonna do then she asked alphonse didnt know what she was talking about but he understood the literal question we gonna walk outta here he said pointing inside at the stack of money with that shit no she said what do you mean no i mean no its not ours just to borrow she went to close the safe door he remembered the lesson then the slap that had made her somebody he could control and he slashed out what he forgot just for that second was that he still held the knife razor sharp open in his right hand and the next thing he knew there was blood all over him the floor everywhere linda just opened her eyes wider as if wondering what was going on she opened her mouth but no words came out just more of that blood alphonse looked down at the knife in his hand remembering he dropped it grabbed at his shirt couldnt rip it and so pressed lindas shirt up against her neck as she collapsed into him hey girl its all right its all right now he said he patted her head on his lap but the blood was getting out everywhere spreading in a stain across the floor he backed himself out from under her cradling her head in his hands then laying it gently in the pool that had formed under it he leaned back on his heels shi but the blood was spreading over to where he kneeled and he thought he already had enough on him so he slid back then forced himself up whatd you go do that for he said he didnt know though who hed asked the pockets in the pants were big but they wouldnt hold twelve of the packets of money and thats how many there were all togethereleven more he took them out of the safe and stacked them on the desk outside sams office past lindas secretary spot and down the hall across the parking lot back to the warehouse he walked to where they wrapped newspapers when it was wet which was most days the machine there spit out wrapping plastic and had a bar that heated it and cut it off clean he flipped the switch on it took him only two trips trying not to look at linda he could hold three of the packs in each handthree and two the second trip he put two of the packets of three end to end then next to them put the last packet of three and the one of two the ten grand in his bloodstained pocket never entered his mind what hed put together wasnt exactly symmetrical like a newspaper but the machine worked perfectly sealing the whole thing together so it would seem like one long packagea loaf of bread maybe alphonse breathing hard now and not high in the least found one of the brown paper bags they used for sunday papers and slipped the plasticwrapped bundle of money into it out in the parking lot lindas car sat alone in the overcast and windy midafternoon alphonse walked by it carrying the bag on his way to the street he had the money he didnt need to drive if he walked tall and fast hed be home by dark he never even thought about the knife lying on the floor in a thickening pool of blood about midway between the open safe and linda polks head nika always slept after they made love and normally so did sam but he couldnt get his mind off the money he could get down to army check it out and be back within an hour and after that hed get some rest tonight it had been a long weekend and it still wasnt even sunday night he got the call that morning same time same station okay no it wasnt hed said the cruz parking lot was just too stupid why run up flags how about the coyote point marina the old cement dock nobody used anymore monday at eightthirty so that was settled but the money still kept his stomach churning hed just check the office safe and make sure it was okay then tomorrow would be the delivery and it would be all over hed tried to reach alphonse but nobody was home that was all right alphonse would be in at work in the morning theyd lay out the details of the transfer thenbut after fridays display sam would bring his gun couldnt be too careful he thought nika slept soundly breathing heavily uncovered above her waist one leg out wrapped over the blanket on her side sam ran a hand along her flank as he took a last look at her before heading up to the city perhaps checking if she was worth all this he decided she was he made it from hillsborough to the army street exit in twelve minutes then in another three he was at his lot and there was lindas car overtime it was possible though he knew that they had been having their troubles lately with her there he knew the money would be safe he almost turned to drive back home not wanting to deal with her to hassle her jealousy but he softened look at her shes okay working in here on a sunday trying to keep it alive maybe with the new money ill take another run at it he thought patch up things with the kid he pulled into the lot chapter nineteen hardy was walking a shark wearing one of the wet suits that hung on the back of the door behind picos office he trudged around and around in the circular pool in the basement of the steinhart aquarium his gloved hands trying to hold on to the great white shark that some fisherman had delivered in the hope that it would be the one that somehow would survive the trauma and become the centerpiece of picos shark tank but hardy wasnt walking for fame for the feather it would be in the cap of pico morales who happened to be the steinharts curator hardy wasnt walking the shark to make picos career he walked it to save its life when pico had called him this morning suddenly it had occurred to him that though this shark madness had always been futile that didnt necessarily make it any less worthwhile hed surprised himself this time by saying hed do it pico had first gotten the bug maybe two years before and hed explained it to hardy to breathe sharks need to move through water diz time they get here theyve usually been badly mangled sometimes just kept on deck while the boat limits out then rolls in from the farallones so theyre wasted when they get here i figure if we can keep one moving long enough he shrugged so i need volunteers to walk around with em and you a true aficionado of things nautical to say nothing of the underdog or undershark in this case seem to be the perfect candidate hardy couldnt say why after the long hiatus suddenly the endeavor was bearable once againmore it was appealing pico had never given up on him kept calling every two or three weeks whenever they got one and hardyd kept saying no thanks until this morning it was now three oclock though if any place were timeless it was this enclosed green room within the bowels of the aquarium surrounded by its vague bubblings and hums its shiny wet windowless walls hardy was on his third onehour walk the other volunteers were as unlikely as he wasa retired car salesman named waverly and a japanese kid named nao who worked mostly as a porter at the miyako hotel and of course pico there were other eccentrics in picos stable but today it was waverly and nao hardy had gotten in at seven am he hadnt been planning on doing anything about cochran today anyway and hed just as soon avoid thinking about jane pico arrived to spell him in his clothes pico appeared to be moderately overweight in his wet suit hardy thought he most resembled a sea lion heavy with calf he stood at the side of the tank smoking his mustache drooped to his jawline his thick black hair was uncombed under his arm he held a newspaper hows orville hed taken to naming his sharks helped them with the will to live he said although the theory hadnt proved itself out at least not yet hardy didnt stop walking orvillehe goosed the shark under its bellyis lethargic pico walked into his office and reappeared a second later without either the cigarette or the newspaper vaulting the side of the tank with an agility that belied his size he fell in next to hardy he put a hand on the huge dorsal fin and walking sideways tested for reflexes in the tail lethargic you call this lethargic hes in the pink orville he petted the sharks headforgive him that was just some poorly timed sarcasm he gave hardy the bad eye try to be a little sensitive would you hardy let pico take over hoisted himself out of the tank and went into the office to change when he came out in a couple of minutes picos newspaper was in his hand pico was coming around with the shark and hardy started walking outside the pool along with him you read this hardy asked la hora si keeps me up on my ethnic heritage you know anything about the publisher about as much as you know about william randolph hearst hardy opened the paper scanning the front page as he kept walking the water slushed behind pico and the shark i talked to the guy he lied to me who who are we talking about pico william randolph hearst what did patty get kidnapped again hardy pressed on cruz he tapped the paper the publisher he lied about what that question stopped hardy it was one he hadnt asked himself and should have cruz had lied about knowing eddieat least hardy had felt pretty sure about thatbut maybe that hadnt been all pico had gotten to the other side of the pool whatd he lie about but hardy was already at the door headed out thanks peek pico tightened his grip on the shark dont let it get you down orville hes just like that sometimes he forgets to say goodbye hardy hit the twenty on the first throw then the nineteen eighteen seventeen the sixteen took him two fifteen through twelve he nailed but eleven his in and out number in hung him up for four throws that was really abysmal he prided himself on never using up an entire round of three darts on one namberand especially on eleven hanging out there at nine oclockfor a lefty the easiest angle on the board he shook his head in disgust the shamrock hummed slowly in the late afternoon bruce hornsby was on the jukebox allowing as thats just the way it is some things they never change lynne was behind the bar hardy had the dartboard to himself a fine time for emptying the brain just letting things happen a guinness his first of the day was half finished on the table next to him he began the next round shooting for the ten and when two out of three of the darts missed what he felt wasnt disgust anymore something had worked its way up ruining his concentration he picked his darts from the board in the back by the bathrooms where hed had his talk with cavanaugh under the stained glass he made himself sit still in one of the deep chairs he put the guinness on the low table in front of him then leaned forward and removed the flights from his dartslight blue with an embossed gold dart just like his business cardfolding them up carefully and putting them in their slot in his case he laid his tungsten darts one at a time into the worn velvet grooves the case went into his jacket pocket okay he sipped the stout and leaned back in the chair if he wasnt going to be getting any official help he was going to have to start paying more attention to details he resolved to start a written report when he got home that night for now something was bothering him what else had cruz said almost nothing it had been the most superficial of meetings if he hadnt lied about eddie hardy would never have thought of him again he went over everything theyd said first the kid whod freely admitted he knew eddie but then cruz had gotten rid of him pronto then there was the vandalism with the fence which had apparently caught cruz by surprise hardy remembered him standing at the fence after hed gone to his car just staring at it hands on hips shaking his head kids must have done it hed said but again hardy came up with a question what kids and what about the car eddie had driven to the lot had the department checked it out for prints hairs fabrics had griffin maybe it was still in the city garage he got up and went to the bar lynne gave him a pen and some paper and he scribbled a few notes while he waited for the next guinness to settle out he looked at his watch it was nearly six oclock hed put it off long enough getting out of the house early to walk orville maybe thats why hed said yes to pico this time without even thinking about it too much he asked lynne to hand him the phone over the bar dialed information got the number and called it she answered on the first ring please dont hang up he said a long silence then why not she asked he struggled through an explanation i dont know why she said when hed finished but that upset me more than i can remember he sat biting his lip not knowing what to say hoping shed stay on the line i thought you were just getting back into character running away she said im not doing that anymore hed let her get her jabs inhe owed her at least that much i called now didnt i were talking please dismas dont do this if you just cant i dont think i could take it he thought about it long enough that she repeated his name okay he said okay what how about we try again tonight i swear to god ill show up why dont you give me your phone number that way if you dont i can do something about it you got a pencil they went to a place on upper fillmore that specialized in cajun food they sat in a booth next to one another on a bench as though they expected another couple a maroon cloth was pulled across the front of the booth between visits from the waiter jane sat closest to the wall hardy on the outside they had oysters with cajun martinis while hardy talked in a little more detail about the events of the day before for entrées jane ordered catfish cut into strips and tossed with peppers onions and baby shrimp hardy had a blackened filet extra rare with a tamale they shared a bottle of white wine and found out a little more about each other when she and hardy had been together jane had worked in the advertising department at i magnin but after a couple of years had become more fascinated she said with the fashions than with the actual selling of them she had become a buyer starting over from the bottom and liked it now very much traveling to new york los angeles chicago even to europe and twice to hong kong hardy regaled her with tales of bartending moses pico and his sharks a little about eddie cochran their desserts arrived a couple of crème brûlées and some espresso the talk wore down hardy looked at his watch jane halfturned on the bench to face him she reached out and covered his near hand with hers do you think she asked its time we talk about michael hardy looked straight ahead across the booth at the knotholes in the redwoodstained plywood he lifted his espresso cup then put it down without drinking he moved his hand out from under hers dont she said im not doing anything youre pulling away from me again hardy trapped in the booth said maybe i am jane again reached for his hand putting it as she had the other night in her lap she kneaded it slowly with both of hers because whats the point now is all this just social talking catching up on each other all what dinner clever repartee come on jane you come on but gently knowing what somebodys doing isnt knowing them maybe its enough well then i wish you hadnt called me she let go of hardys hand with one of hers and quickly with her index finger wiped a tear from each eye one after the other it wasnt your fault you know hardy was a block of carved wood unyielding inert have you ever talked about it she held his hand in hers again a couple of tears had overflowed onto her cheeks but she wasnt sobbing do you ever think about it even i never dont think about it but then as quickly as it had come it was gone it doesnt matter he said im sorry i yelled at you it doesnt matter she asked quietly you think yelling at me is the problem id rather have you yell at me any day than just disappear he barely trusted himself to breathe it wont bring him back hardy finally looked at her seeing the tears he brushed janes cheeks turning on the bench to face her you didnt kill him jane i did you didnt hed never stood up before how could you have known i should have known michael the sevenmonthold son had stood up for the very first time in his crib dismas had put him down for the night with the sides lowered the baby got to his feet leaned over and fell to the floor head first he had died by noon of the next day i should have known he repeated dismas she said you didnt know thats over its long over how long are you going to suffer for it it was an accident accidents happen it just wasnt anybodys fault he picked up his coffee cup staring across the enclosed space and put it to his mouth tasting nothing every time i looked at you i blamed myself again what i put you through me and you you didnt put me through it you didnt cause it look at me now she said she was beautiful to him her cheeks glistened with her tears im telling you i never thought it was you it might as easily have been me i should have known too all the books said he was getting ready to stand up and i never thought of it she brought his hand to her lips and kissed it the worst was losing you both i couldnt face you i know and everything else just seemed still seemshe shook his headi dont know it stopped meaning anything me too he closed his eyes perhaps visualizing something perhaps remembering no you meant something youve always meant something he hesitated all the other stuff i couldnt work up any interest they sat facing each other turned together on the bench in the cajun restaurant they held each others hands both of them between themselves when you called me from in the bar on the phone jane began you said you werent running anymore he nodded you want to think about that he nodded again there wasnt anything else to say he let go of her hands and pushed the button at the side of the booth signaling the waiter to come and give them the check glitskys voice had said to call no matter what time hardy got home after leaving jane his mind a jumble he had driven back down to china basin to view the cruz parking lot another time he walked to the hole in the fence now inexpertly patched with baling wire the cyclone fence hadnt been pulled away by kids it had been cleanly cut top to bottom hed called pico from a pay phone to see how orville was doing the machine answered from picos office hardy tried his friend at home and learned that the shark hadnt made it i should have warned you about my luck lately hardy had said and told him about the baseball game but then he had remembered that steven cochran hadnt died yesterday maybe his luck was changing pico sounded depressed and hardy had asked if he wanted some company pico had said okay and theyd sat up around the kitchen table playing pictionary with angela and the two older kids for a couple of hours so it was late when hardy got home he called glitsky immediately the sergeant wasnt in high spirits just asked hardy if he could come see him first thing in the morning about the cochran investigation sure hardy said something happen yeah somebody else died and it definitely wasnt a suicide glitsky hung up chapter twenty empty empty empty the word kept replaying like a looping tape in sam polks head ever since hed pulled his car into the driveway empty the house nika gone now completely empty he had called her to tell her after the cops had been at the shop for a couple of hours shed expressed sympathy over lindas death but by her voice he could tell she wouldnt be there when he got back home oddly her absence was all right preferable in some way the note on the table in the hallway had read sammy im sorry but i just cant handle two funerals in one week all this is getting so heavy i thought you wouldnt mind if i went to janeys you know in cupertino for a couple of days and try to get my head straight about all this you can call if you want the numbers in our book sorry about linda sorry about linda that was all sorry about linda the empty house seemed to echo more in the darkness no point in turning on any more lightsthe one in the kitchen above the stove was enough all he had to see was the bottle so this is where it allall the work all the planning and sweating and saving and effortthis was where it had gotten him to a kitchen table at an empty hour in an empty house drinking alone at midnight he wondered why it was he really didnt drink so oftennow it was the only thing he wanted to do first it had hurt his stomach but after a while that had stopped he poured another splash into the glass got up stumbled a little and grabbed a handful of ice from the automatic ice maker back at the table he flipped the picture album open again the one he hadnt been able to find for nearly a half hour nika had put it in one of the drawers underneath the bookshelves not even out in plain sight there was linda he forced himself to look she hadnt been beautiful but there was something about her a willingness to please people liked her he hadnt thought enough lately about how much he had liked her not that theyd talked all that much the last few years but some people didnt communicate that way especially since shed grown up and started doing some of her own thingsthe drugs guys and so on but what could he have done about that it wasnt his business really after she got out of high school he told himself she had been an adult he poured again clinking the bottle loudly why did linda think he had become interested in his love life again anyway gone looking for someone else to put in his life linda had made it clear that she had her own life okay then hed go and have his god knew hed earned it raising a daughter alone and running a business by himself she had had no right to begrudge him what he found with nika the telephone rang in the empty house and he felt his stomach tightening cramping again even if it was nika he didnt want to talk he let it ring eleven times then it stopped he went upstairs to his bedroom carrying the glass with him his heart pumping now with fear he realized who had been on the phone probably and it wasnt nika but that was stupid how could anybody know yet tomorrow maybeno definitelythey would know but not yet he sat on the bed hed forgotten all about that or not forgotten but put aside he couldnt afford to keep doing that not for long he was in trouble how could it have gotten this complicated so fast just two weeks ago hed had a simple problem with money and a simple solution and now he had nothing going on less naked he walked downstairs again his glass empty he had to hold the banister and even then the steps seemed to fall unevenly well so what he was alone and could do as he damned pleased and if he was tired and drunk because his little girl had been killed then he was and fuck anybody who didnt like it but then another thing intruded god there was so much it didnt seem possible it all fit together but this was important this was more important even than lindano he didnt think that but it was crucial hed told the police there wasnt any money but what if they found alphonse and he had the money that meant it wasnt hissamsmoney and of course alphonse would have the money but on the other hand once he said it was his money shit there aint no one on earth forgets a hundred and twenty thousand dollars even if his daughter just died at least it would be there in the back of your mind so what could he tell the cops theyd seen it all of it the excuses and the bullshit and they would smell this one all the way to sacramento if hed told them right away about the money then it mightve been all right because goddamn seeing linda lying there had gotten to him and they would have asked him some questions and anything would have worked a lopsided smile and admitting that he played stakes poker a slush fund for the good workers taxfree until the troubles with cruz had been resolved goddamn something but now he had trouble seeing it they wouldnt buy it and sam couldnt blame them he wouldnt buy it himself you mean mr polk that you had one hundred twenty thousand dollars in that safe this morning and you forgot it for how long six hours mr polk how old you think i am the bottle of jack daniels was empty empty like the safe like himself he went to the cabinet and grabbed another bottle this time some french brandy that nika liked okay so he was in trouble but the thing was not to lose the money once he had that back he could think of something it didnt matter what the police might think of him he hadnt done anything illegal yet and if he could just remember that hed be okay he walked outside up in the city it had been cool but the weather still held here only a dozen miles south he smelled the first gardenias maybe a touch of jasmine he breathed in again small white lights led out through the manicured garden to the hot tub he looked at them in a kind of awe he owned this this was where hed arrived at it wasnt just a crummy kitchen drinking alone it was a goddamn hillsborough estate with grounds and landscaping and a hot tub thank you he tripped on the first flagstone step but didnt go down out at the hot tub he lifted the thermometer and saw it was degrees if he just got loose and thought hed come up with something the water stung but only for a second he sat on the first step looking down at his balls and thought it was still a little too cold and he could also use the jets there now that was better a bottle of some french shit at my elbow a glass in my hand and some jets blasting away all the tension and worries people had worked hard their whole lives and gotten to worse places he closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the bricks lining the tub and had another sip of brandy maybe i dont think enough she said to herself maybe ive been on automatic too long there was only the one light on in the trophy room as they called it down the hall from stevens the one with all the pictures shed been gravitating to it a lot lately big eds snoring was audible from time to time in the next room but it didnt bother her reallyit was funnynot much of what ed did bothered her cigars maybe once in a while but she had her vices that he tolerated toonot being home enough for example running around helping everybody who asked being unable to say no she looked at the wall with its pictures she and ed had talked about taking down the ones of eddie but then she realized that there would be no reason for it it wouldnt lessen the pain it was just another of the idiotic ideas shed entertained in the last week now she ran a finger across the bottom of the frame of the one where he was down at the merrygoround at the old playland at the beach hed been seven or so when the picture was taken the little boymounted on the horse mane splayed out in the windsmiled out at her like his face would break erin remembered the day too perfectly she saw the smear of mustard still on his cheek from what had been his first corn dog somebodys hand was just visible at the bottom of the picture that had been mick reaching up to ride double she let her eyes go around the other pictures it was true there werent many of steven and none in the past two years there was mick playing ball graduating diving from the pier at the place theyd rented the past few summers at bass lake jodie was accepting her debating award last year biting her tongue in the front of her mouth in concentration over her cooking at the girl scout camp in her first formal dress for the frosh hop at mercy stepping back she tried to find the most recent picture of steven there was one of him with eddie at the wedding two years ago before hed done that ridiculous thing with his hair that big ed had wanted to scalp him for another one the year before that was really just a snapshot of him and his dad and eddie when they had come home with their limits of salmon that was it for the latest ones of steven the most recent after those was steven at about eight with jim steven forcing a smile from the front seat of that corvette jim had loved so much before that was his first communion with the white pants and jacket how could she and big ed have missed what this wall proclaimed so clearly there wasnt one shot of steven all alone by himself the star of the show for at least the past six years last night after everyone else had gone to sleep she and ed had sat in this room wondering if they could have done things differently and even then with all these pictures staring down at them they hadnt seen it it was the same as always she thought they just took for granted that steven was up there on the wall with his brothers and sister a good welladjusted kid like the others theyd raised them all the samesame environment same values of course theyd all turn out okay after agonizing over every parental decision with eddie then mick then of course jodie because she was the first girl and there were lots of things that hadnt come up with eddie or mick by the time steven had come along theyd done it all before right so raising steven would be the same as it had been with eddie or mick and finally she had been able to start taking the time shed craved for herself to somewhat offset the nagging guilt that she wasnt accomplishing much in her life except raising kids not that that wasnt important but she had more to offer and big ed too hed finally found the time for the fishing trips he couldnt ever take when the kids had been little and for the poker once a month and mostly just for the solitude reading in the room out behind the garage or walking down to the beach neither of them had meant to be neglectful of steven maybe she reflected again maybe it had just gotten too hard to think about forget what the evidence of their own eyes was telling themthat steven was getting away from them that he was nothing like the other kids no that didnt fit in with the leisure they thought theyd earned so ignore it it would probably work out and now the boy lay broken and bandaged down the hall and erin had no inclination to blame anybody but herself thank you god hes still alive she whispered a real prayer just talking to god she hadnt done that since shed gotten the news about eddie and she didnt really think about it now just thank god steven wasnt gone too she walked down the hallway the house felt empty because frannie had gone back home today no probably just a reflection of how she feltempty ed snored once again she heard him turn over in bed steven lay on his back breathing evenly she leaned over and held her face above his taking in the sweetsmelling air he exhaled it was still not adults breath but that wonderful stuff that came out of kids mouths the air in heaven she thought must smell like a babys breath she touched the good side of his face but so lightly he didnt move moving up a chair next to the bed she sat and forced herself to keep thinking about the things she was going to change in her life she really had stopped thinking enough the past few years you could be endlessly busy and still not be doing enough of the right things maybe she and ed had gotten lazy that way morally lazy selfish she put her head down on the blanket up against his hip she didnt know how long shed been dozing when he moved moaning she reached up and caressed the side of his face mom he asked im here steven she said im right here chapter twentyone alphonse page hardy said somewhat surprised to hear a name he had never come across glitsky out in the avenues on another homicide stopped by hardys as promised it made three days in a row that hardy had been awakened before seven am alphonse page of this there is little doubt they were in hardys kitchen the fog outside was thin and still the kind that had a chance to burn off you think he killed cochran abe shook his head i am fairly certain he killed linda polk thats all different mo than cochran anyway cut her throat money what else well it gets a little funny there hardy waited her father called it inthe same guy you told me about huh short sad dumpy thats him what was he doing at work on a sunday he said he was feeling guilty he hadnt been in all week wanted to get a fresh start jump on monday like that oh certainly i know the two men nodded at each other so glitsky continued there was no money around although there was a safe in the room closed up tight and the victim linda was lying in a pool of blood right by it so he emptied the safe in any event it was empty when polk opened it up for a look i guess it was either him or alphonse maybe what do you mean maybe why else would she have been aced diz the lab tells me she was filled with sperm they also found three or four hairs in her crotch appear to be from a black man jesus she was raped i dont know but that waters down the money as the only possible motive shed certainly had sex just before she died like within an hour or two but why did she go to the office where the safe was it had to have something to do with money glitsky shrugged no it didnt it probably in fact did but it didnt have to hardy got up and paced well shit abe so whos alphonse page glitsky took out a photograph hed gotten reluctantly from pages mother when theyd gone to his house the previous night with a warrant hardys forehead creased studying the picture as glitsky went on polk identified his knife at the scene prints with blood on em all over the placesome even in the back at a wrapping machine hardy threw the picture onto his table and there wasnt any money good point glitsky said and noted something down on his pad anyway labs doing a run on the car but im sure enough i got the warrant put out the apb alphonse came home early last evening dumped some bloody clothes in the hamper packed a sports bag and split so far he hasnt come back and im not expecting him he did it could he have done eddie i dont know we dont know where he was that night but well find out after i talked to you last night i got out the file on cochran read it cover to cover specially read about the car cochrans youll never guess black mans hairs glitsky smiled in the front seat youre a genius hardy labs not done with the comparison but you want to bet theyre not alphonses hardy sat down you know what i think what do you think i think weve got a drug deal gone bad here glitsky rubbed the scar that ran through his lips well damn what an incredible idea glitsky then told him about the trace of cocaine found on polks desk so did you bring him in polk he was pretty incoherent after it hit him i mean his daughter had just been killed hes coming downtown this afternoon wanna be there i wouldnt miss it cavanaugh seems to think polk did it you know i mean did eddie i didnt think he raped his daughter maybe she wasnt raped and whos cavanaugh since it was now part of his active investigation glitsky wanted to get it firsthand he and hardy drove separately over to st elizabeths and both of them parked in the empty lot behind the rectory rose greeted them at the door fathers rehearsing the graduation over to the church she said you can wait here or go on over they walked through the lifting fog sixty boys and girls in uniformsgray corduroy pants and white shirts maroon plaid dresses and white blouseswere lined up at the door of the church two nuns fluttered around trying to keep order they still do this uniforms even glitsky seemed genuinely surprised parochial elementary schools not being his everyday turf hey if it works dont fix it hardy held his hands out look what it did for me glitsky his eyes still on the line of kids started moving again when the last child had gone inside glitsky and hardy followed and sat in the sixth row in the first empty pew what are they graduating from glitsky whispered but before hardy could say anything a bell rang by the side of the altar and father cavanaugh in cassock surplice and stole flanked by two acolytes appeared through a side door he came up to the altar rail surveying the crowd nodding to hardy he brought his hands together palms up and at his signal the children all stood hardy nudged glitsky and they got up too the sergeant appeared puzzled let us pray cavanaugh intoned with a deep resonance i know that guy glitsky said course i was younger then still in uniform even before hardy and i were teamed the policeman was saying rose was used to policemen not wearing the blue except for chips and a few of those older shows no one on tv wore a uniform anymore this man officer glitsky had very nice manners even if he talked a little loud but he looked scary with that scar running through his lipsnowhere near as goodlooking or friendly as her favorite black policeman tibbs no i think i do remember father replied rose was pouring coffee from silver into fine china the policeman used a lot of sugar the other man the one who looked a little like renko drank his coffee black father of course had a lump and half half hed had cream until last year when the doctor had told him to cut down on his cholesterol margarine instead of butter half half instead of cream but he still had his eggs most mornings we talked about the riots at berkeley the police role there if i recall inspector sergeant glitsky sucked rather loudly on the coffee maybe it was too hot to drink yet you know father i think we did how do you remember that bless the father he had a memory it made a great impression on me at the time sergeant you were the first officer i had talked to who didnt just spout the official police line what was that the other man asked rose wasnt exactly eavesdropping she had been planning on dusting this room today anyway and she felt she should be around to pour more coffee if any of the men got low father answered once the students threw or broke something it was open season for the police they had the right then to use whatever force was necessary to keep things under control it was just a pissing contest the sergeant said stupid they shouldve just got some guys who didnt think all those students were revolutionaries thats all so whod they get the other man asked bunch of rednecks they recruited from alabama or someplace deputized for the riots you know bust some heads and see the berkeley chicks running around without bras on werent you around for that diz dismas that was his name dismas smiled halfway and said his major concern at the time had been stopping those dominoes from falling whatever that meant although father and the sergeant both seemed to get it well your friend here dismas is too modest he was quite a force for moderation back then it took some courage for a policeman and a black one to take that kind of stand the sergeant seemed a little embarrassed and sipped at his coffee but not so loudly mostly selfpreservation im afraid he said the trend of importing southern gentlemen for the police force wasnt going to do my career any good so what were you two guys doing together dismas asked father smiled remembering the activist days sometimes i long for them again he had never really been a radical of course an activist yes but within the system the kind of man he still wasworking for the homeless now or getting some of the businessmen in the parish to hire boys from the projects a few of us were volunteered to assist father thats all he had an ideawho knows it might have workedthat there should be a gun drive where every unregistered piece could be turned in and the citizen would get an immediate amnesty no questions asked father shrugged at dismas im afraid we were all a little naïve back then the sergeant came to fathers defense it didnt do all that bad i was surprised we got the response we did he turned to his friend got about a hundred and fifty weapons citywide one hundred and sixtythree father and his memory rose was proud of it she walked over to the pitcher and picked it up the sergeant held out his cup for more father believed he was saying in his humble way that it was better to try things and fail than not try at all they didnt know it wouldnt work until they tried it i know sergeant glitsky replied back then anything seemed possible the times they were achangin father sat back in his heavy chair sighing ah yes those changin times back then reagan was governor now all the men laughed thanks rose a little more please now what brings you gentlemen to the churchs door this fine morning darn it was more about the cochran boys death and father had seemed to be getting over that the last day or two at least his appetite had returned perhaps the accident with steven had forced him to turn his mind to more immediate problems but thats how life was wasnt it one thing after another she put the pitcher down and went back to her dusting there was some talk about dismas hearing fathers confession but that didnt make any sense then father was talking about eddie coming by with that problem when was that father the policeman asked do you remember actually he came by twice once i believe it was the wednesday before before he died as i mentioned to dismas the other day one of his coworkers had said something about not having to work for very long that he and mr polk wouldnt need much money pretty soon that he eddie didnt need to worry about building up the business again father came forward now in his chair eddie was a very smart kid he put a few things together and came up with the idea that polk was going to do something illegalhe didnt know what so he came by here and wanted my take on some options hed worked out but at that time he really didnt know much so he left pretty unresolved anyway when i saw him the next time and when was that father looked out the window trying to remember if im not mistaken that was sunday rose frowned trying to remember something lord it was hard always remaining a silent fly on the wall but then she saw father look at her and smile she lit up with contentment with his memory he was undoubtedly right and that was the end of it in any eventhe turned back to the othershe had kept on kind of pushing alphonse to say specifically alphonse the employee was alphonse that seemed to excite the sergeant rose was forgetting to dust yes i think that was the name anyway evidently alphonse wasnt too bright and said something about drugs well excuse me father but its not clear to me where you come in she knew this was a hard question for father she knew where he came infor eddie for two dozen or more other people really for anyone who asked but how does he tell the sergeant without sounding like hes bragging oh i think eddie just wanted someone to talk to about it about what she was getting a little annoyed at the sergeant he didnt have to pushfather would tell him what he should do i guess this is what he was telling me dismas said to his friend at the shamrock father nodded sadly you had to know eddie he washe paused then went on a little more quicklyhe was kind of like all of us were back in the sixties thought it was his business to be involved that if he just stuck his head in and pointed in the right direction people would see it he would go and talk to mr cruzyou know him both men nodded and see if there might be some way to get back his business for a period of time while armyeddies companyrebuilt then in the meanwhile if that happened he thought he had a chance of talking polk out of ithe pausedout of doing something wrong something that might hurt him now father hung his head so he asked me about it and i his eyes turned back to the room pained nowi wizard counselor that i am said he might as well go ahead that he didnt have anything to lose silence he didnt need to addnothing except his life one more thing hardy was saying as he got into his car last night i remembered another thing cruz had lied to me about cruz oh yeah cruz glitsky was late for another appointment not at his most attentive i asked him about the scenehis parking lotwhat shape it had been in he told me it was pretty bad and it wasnt no abe wrong point how could he have seen it his boy secretary whatever told me it was cleaned up by the morning glitsky thought a moment maybe he saw it on the late news ran down to check it out who called it in abe rolled his eyes to the stillclearing sky reached into his car and handed something over the roof to hardy you coming down for the polk interview onethirty hardy nodded so study the report between now and then and bring it back with you hardy took the folder but as youre going through it checking out mr cruz say two words to yourself every couple minutes would you whatre those abe alphonse page chapter twentytwo matthew r brody iii was the managing partner of brody finkel wayne dodd the firm had twentyeight associates and the entire fourteenth floor of embarcadero i brody fortyone stood six feet four and had lately begun using grecian formula on his thick head of now black hair he wore a charcoal pinstriped threepiece suit the coat of which now hung on the gilt rack inside the door to his office his face still looked as young as he wished his hair did with a wide but shallow forehead a patrician nose a strong chin the only moderately distinctive thing about his looks and it wasnt much was his upper lip which was too long by a centimeter he would have worn a mustachedid in fact while he was in schoolbut his wife had told him it made him look foreign so hed cut it it was one thing to shoot hoops with blacks and have a beaner roommate shed told him after hed passed the bar when shed decided to marry him but another altogether to look like a successful attorney brody didnt build the firm to its present status by taking on poorer latino clients such as those litigating against la hora for distribution hassles but neither did he do it by being unfriendly or turning down clients in the la hora matter he had gone to bat for jaime rodriguez because he was the cousin of his college roommate julio suarez who in turn just happened to run the most successful construction company in alameda which was currently developing a threeandahalfacre waterfront mall about two miles from the naval station coincidentally brody was handling the paper on that development rodriguez had been distributing la hora in lafayette and part of richmond after meeting with brody he had talked all of his fellow distributors except the main guy in san francisco into the coop lawsuit after hed studied the facts of the case brody got into it a little it wasnt often he ran across a real human issue this wasnt wills or codicils or a contract featuring an endless series of whereas followed by a now therefore of course there wasnt much money in it but it wasnt strictly pro bono either hell someone had to represent these folks he felt good about it from his desk in his corner office he could see the clock on the ferry building it was eleventhirty he was prepared for the meeting he was always prepared he knew but when judge andy fowler sent someone his way it was doubly important to have done his homework donna buzzed him and told him mr hardy was here he had of course checked back with andy about hardy used to be the soninlaw brody tried to recall if hed ever met janes first husband but that had been before he was successful enough to have joined olympic and gotten to know the judge still he was ready to recognize him if he looked at all familiar he didnt the man was a little too casually dressed for brodys taste andy had said hardy was an attorney and there were rules of dress within the fraternity but then hardy didnt practice law anymore so maybe something else was going on he declined coffee tea anything which was good brody had said hed give him an hour but hoped it wouldnt take that long interesting cases were one thing but lets not forget time was money hardy did thank him immediately for his time maybe he was still in the club brody shrugged and smiled when his honor beckons how can i help you id like to find out if i may if this man cruz might have had a motive to murder one of sam polks employees brody sat up straight then fished for a cigar in the humidor on the desk he didnt like being surprised when he ought to know what was happening lighting the cigar gave him a moment he took a stab in the dark polk the san francisco distributor thats him brody inhaled the cigar he probably hadnt heard the name in six months but he hadnt taken memory training for nothing theres been a murder in this case hardy shook his head we dont know for sure theres two dead people as of now with an angle to polk there may be some connection to cruz two hardy explained you know mr hardy polk is not one of my clients hardy obviously didnt know it i thought you were handling it for everybody but polk he was the only one isnt mex latino among the distributors but he was also the first and the biggest he wasnt interested in the suit why not i dont know he wouldnt even meet with me to discuss it although my other clients tried to bring some uh leverage to bear how was that brody held up a hand nothing illegal i dont mean that no threats or anything just some business incentives but hardy pressed a little and when he didnt come on did it really hurt your case what im wondering is could someone have tried to scare polk by hurting his people then maybe there was an accident brody acted legitimately shocked oh god no no chance all this went down months ago at that time i would have given a very qualified maybe to that theoryvery now its not even possible you must be out of litigation awhile anything in recent history couldnt be relevant hardy said okay and brody continued i dont understand it really it the lawsuit i mean was to polks advantage maybe he didnt want to pay the legal fees brody shook his head minimal in my opinion i think he just stopped caring about his business hes an older fellow probably rolling in money maybe just figured it was as good a time as any to hang em up his daughter was killed you say yesterday and the other one his manager we dont know he was killed in some ways it looked like a suicide maybe was made to look like a suicide the police leaned that way until linda was killed but now theyve got a suspect for linda and theyre willing to consider theyre related just too much coincidence to buy right hardy thought that was it and you think mr cruz might have had a motive hardy walked over to the globe and gave it a spin he appeared to be thinking hard all i know or think i know is that cruz lied to me twice while i was interrogating him id like to think he did that for a reason why did he let you talk to him hes stonewalling us eddies body was found on his lot we had a lying contesti told him i was a cop i hope you didnt tell andy that no i dont think the judge would approve anyway i got to see him and he lied to me about having known eddie i also think he was there at or near the time eddie was killed brody whistled sitting in one of the comfortable chairs in front of his desk if you can prove that youve got something hardy took the other chair saying i know but if my uncle had tits hed be my aunt brody drew on his cigar shaking his head the case really pisses me off you want to know the truth he said heres this guy cruz needs more money like a toad needs warts and ruins his relationships with people hes worked with for years friends even socially not really hes got no personal social life though hes big in as they say the community well thats a contradiction isnt it not really the community is his ad base so whyd he do it cut these guys off i mean wouldnt that hurt him the same way i dont think so its nine guys spread out all over the bay area and its not the kind of news the tv or the chronicles likely to jump on what is hardy asked well if el dia prints it its publicity bullshit and sure as hell la hora isnt going to run the story so what are you building your case on brody crossed a long leg oral contract past performance he rolled his cigar slowly in his right hand actually were almost to the point of going for a settlement and calling it a moral victory though dont quote me on that whos we your clients we is the firm hardy followed that the case was nearly lost brody had said almost and hardy had known lawyers like brody who didnt use the language carelessly he mentioned it to him we got a private eye looking for dirt on cruz but im skeptical of finding anything why would that even matter brody shrugged as i say i think its a waste of effort but my clients felt if we got to the last resort and were there now we might try some form of legal blackmail like i dont know its what were looking for something to harm his image with the community make him lose the ad support if it comes out then my clients remain discreet in return for a return to their original distribution contract brody stood up looked at his watch longshot city he said hardy got up too the interview was over you have any leads on that he beat up his dog or what no were dealing with the macho thing theres some rumor he might be gay hardy had to laugh i cant believe it here in san francisco i know but its no joke among the latinos let me tell you its another bit of news that doesnt make the papers but any saturday you want you go down to mission park on dolores and you can check out the mexican gangs beating the shit out of anybody who swishes even a little so if cruz is gay brody made a face it might be some leverage thats all its probably nothing hardy thought of something what if cochran had found out cruz was gay say and tried to use it himself get back cruzs la hora distribution business for polk that way or maybe keep the cash for himself thats a lot of ifs but given all of them id say you might have a motive there hardy thanked him they shook hands and again brody was alone in his office the clock on the ferry building said it was just past noon the fog had completely burned off and the flags along the embarcadero were flying in what looked to be a light breeze he loosened his tie sighed and returned to his desk punching impatiently at his intercom here was hardy thinking eddie cochran had been the nicest guy in the world one of the bona fide good ones hed known him pretty well and had bought his act completelybut it couldnt have been an act this is eddie were talking about hell he was married to frannie and she was the sister of hardys own best friend didnt he have to be a wonderful person and besides hardy thought as he picked at his dim sum waiting for onethirty when polk would talk to glitsky they werent even suspecting cruz alphonse page was the suspect okay say eddie had known cruz was gay and had known all about polk and his drug deal now how about he puts the squeeze on cruz or wants a cut from polk or both no that wasnt eddie was it chapter twentythree glitsky prided himself not on being smart but thorough though he didnt even remotely think that sam polk had killed his own daughter he had gone ahead and run a little background on the manyou never knew what might turn up hardys tip or hunch or whatever it was about a drug connection looked like a winnerthe cocaine on the desk hadnt been blown there on a passing windso he had ordered a guy to check out his recent banking activity there aside from an amateurish run to different bank branches he had found enough to warrant calling up the dea he didnt really care about the drug deal what he wanted was leverage on polk during the interview he had seemed legitimately strung out yesterday at finding his daughters throat cut and glitsky didnt think it would be too difficult to get him to start talking about some possible connection between lindas death and ed cochrans especially if he thought hepolkwould be named some sort of accessory to his own daughters murder what would be ideal and what glitsky fervently hoped for was that cochrans death would turn out a clear homicide and get in his own backyard glitskys thing was homicides he was getting a lot closer to certainty that somebody had killed ed and with alphonse looking like a lock for lindas murder he seemed a reasonable suspect for having done ed well at the least a good guy to start with of course a few hairs in a car seat by themselves werent going to convince any jury but alphonse had proved himself well beyond careless with linda glitsky figured that if hed killed ed hed left some indication of it and if that were true glitsky would find it it was a nice stroke of luckhitting on polks account that money was somewhere out there and that always shook things up which was good he popped the last bite of his bagel and followed it with a mouthful of cold coffee dick willis the dea guy would be up in another minute and hardy any old time he wiped at the desk with a paper napkin caught some crumbs in the palm of his hand and dumped them in the wastebasket by his right knee this was the part he really liked the case should break within the hour it was all but broken now with the new leverage polk should crack in about five minutes tell him the da might cut him a deal on the cochran thing then sit back and let the tape recorder get it all he allowed a smile it was almost too easy but hed take it hardy was whittling a popsicle stick into a totem pole hed already done the eagle at the top then a kind of halfassed bears head which could as easily have been a wolfhe should have done it in profile and was about to start on a duck as a goof when glitsky came back to his cubicle hardy looked up he didnt have to ask but he did not there huh it was twofifteen theyd waited until nearly two oclock at which time glitsky had called down to burlingame to ask if theyd send a squad car to polks house and see if something was wrong willis from the drug enforcement agency had gone saying hed be available whenever polk did show up but he wasnt about to waste any more of an afternoon for a lousy oneyard deal glitsky figured polk might have been detained at the morgue or making arrangements to get lindas body to a funeral home and hed gone out to make a few calls then check to see if hed just gotten directed to the wrong room or something at the hall hardy stayed in abes cubicle whittling his new doubts about eddies character were still eating at him it was great that glitsky had established a link to drug money and to alphonse although that didnt necessarily mean alphonse had killed eddie you think he ran polk glitsky suddenly asked im out of practice hardy said that never occurred to me why would he run as in take the money and hardy shook his head and closed his knife the totem pole got flicked into the wastebasket without a glance i dont think he took the money alphonse took the money yeah i know thats what ive been thinking but where is the guy traffic abe shopping in the bathroom glitsky straightened the line of something on his desk okay but i hate getting this close and not nailing it he might have run anyway hardy decided to let him spew he might have done anything but how could he know the police had discovered the money thing improbable no he would try to bluff things out when they started asking about money but hed show if he didnt hed be running up a flag when abe had wound down hardy said the report says the call on cochran came in at elevenfourteen pm you tape it of course it was a nineeleven you mind if i give it a listen no help yourself you gonna recognize the voice hardy hadnt thought of that before and wouldnt that be a nice surprise the call came from a booth at the corner of arguello and geary he said if you say so glitsky said but what difference does it make polk gets here and starts talking ten minutes later we know everything we need to know about linda maybe also maybe about ed its the maybes that get to me maybe we get lucky and polk finks on alphonse who maybe killed eddie in a wild druginduced spree of passion and mayhem then maybe we got a homicide where the insurance pays on eddie you want to make book glitsky said eds a homicide make it official my jobs done and ill go home and be out of your hair at glitskys baleful stare hardy smiled i figure until its official he said i can play with it hardy walked to what passed for a map of the city and county of san francisco on the wall of glitskys cubicle the map had been stabbed to death by pins long ago but the occasional street name wasnt completely obliterated arguello and geary is here hardy said pointing roughly to the middle of the map goddamn when did they move it glitsky said hardy punched his finger into the lower right quadrant of the map heres cruzs building yep just about there cant exactly throw a hat over em can you so hardy looked out the window just something else to think about the phone rang and glitsky snatched it up before the ringing stopped he said yeah a few times hardy turned around and started hoping this wasnt about polk because if it was it was bad news the scar through glitskys lips turned white with the pressure he was putting on it he mentioned a few things about jurisdiction if he could send some men down like that then he hung up a study in frustration say it aint polk hardy said glitsky sat at his desk picked up a pencil and broke it after he put the two halves in his hands and broke them again he frowned up at hardy they just found him dead in his fucking hot tub glitsky almost to himself clucked grimly timing i gotta work on my tuning he said then i was thinking about putting a tail on him overnight im slowing down diz hardy sat well at least if we can put alphonse there glitsky shook his head uhuh sure it makes sense look alphonse knows polk can identify him glitsky held up a hand spare me diz i know the facts and you dont which are no sign of struggle polk wasnt offed hardy just cocked his head we get one of these every few months you drink too much and sit in a hot tub you get poached get out of here glitsky looked at the bits of pencil in his hand he sighed wearily you get out of here diz i got work to do he hadnt even gotten to talk about the cruz angle if it was an angle he almost stopped on his way out of the office but then figured abe would only cut him off and abe was probably right it wouldnt do to forget that abe had a bona fide murder and suspect in this affair and anything else hardy might find might be interesting and all that but wouldnt have shitall to do with glitskys investigation so the afternoon gaped open before him he stopped by the audio lab with the requisition slip glitsky had signed and got the lady there to give him a copy of the tape hed listen to it at home while waiting for it to be copied he glanced through the chronicle there was a story about lindas murder no mention of any connection to eddie along with the picture of alphonse hardy read it over and learned nothing new tape in pocket he stopped at the concession stand for a candy bar then walked across the tiles in front of the wall with the names of policemen killed in the line of duty sixteen this year so far andy fowler was presiding in courtroom b when hardy entered the judge had his glasses on and appeared to be reading something at the bench the prosecuting attorney whom hardy didnt know was whispering to someone by his side the defense attorney was on her feet pointing out something that the judge should note on whatever he was reading hardy walked up and sat in the second row on the aisle the judge finished reading raised his eyes to the gallery looked from one attorney to another and called a recess he spoke to the bailiff on his way to chambers and the man walked across to hardy and said his honor would see him when he got into the booklined chambers hardy closed the door behind him thats what i call service he said andy shrugged out of his robes and motioned to the wing chairs in front of his desk a little tray table between them so you seeing jane again he asked i hate it the way you fiddlefaddle around hardy let andy pour some coffee were trying to see each other i mean you got plans well if it works out ill probably try to see her again about that far huh thats a hell of a lot farther than its been andy put a hand on hardys knee no push from here i mean it im just interested he sat back what i came by for hardy said i met your friend brody this morning i just wanted to say thanks was he any help hardy outlined it for him cruz ed linda alphonse and now the latest with polk andy sat back interested listening sipping occasionally at his coffee but you have a thread through this polk structure hardy nodded oh yeah everybodyall the dead people anywaytheyre all connected to polk one way or the other so whats your problem you got a suspect you got motive you got opportunity true but ive got one apparent suicide by gunshot one murder by knife and one accidental death im not sure i see the same guiding hand over it all this guy alphonse isnt he pretty likely hes pretty likely i guess given everything i mean a lot seems to have gone on in his neighborhood hardy leaned forward elbows on knees i guess what bothers me is cruz if hes no part of this at all you know theres a whole other scenario here between eddie and cruz and i mean it leaves polk out entirely and the damn thing is it works you want it all tied up neat huh the judge chuckled youre in the wrong business diz okay i acknowledge that the two men laughed it was an old joke from when jane had been thinking about going to est hardy and andy had acknowledged her into submission and shed eventually given up the idea you really think ed was blackmailing cruz thats what doesnt work no way was he that kind of guy then why do you think it cause he couldve been i guess it would have given cruz a reason to lie to me the judge stood up you gotta cut the deadwood diz he held up a hand im not saying it couldnt have happened do you know where cruz was that night didnt you tell me the report says he was home by nine that should finish it right there look you just told me that if it comes out hes gay its bad news for him so suppose he had a date hed cover that wouldnt he hed lie to cover it sure he would and thats got nothing to do with ed hardy hung on that for a beat youre right i guess damn straight you want my opinion see where alphonse leads at least youve got a good idea hes murdered someone that makes him a killer whether its a knife or a gun might not matter some of these guys get creative anyway id check him out first all this other stuffhe shruggedmore than likely its deadwood and if it is you gotta cut it well i guess thats why i came to talk to you i just couldnt see it you ever work on a case didnt have half a dozen plausible wrong turns hardy stood up goes against the grain just to follow the little arrows doesnt it a little thats probably it the judge looked at his watch seemed to decide something you know im not saying just drop it to make your life easy if its bothering you find out what he was doing but its probably a wild hair hardy smiled probably he admitted chapter twentyfour eddie cochrans car was still at the police lotwhen frannie had called that morning from her first day back at work they had told her it was being held now as part of another investigation she was stunned to hear that linda polk had been killed but what did eddiewhat did their carhave to do with that she asked if they were saying that eddie had been murdered no they were not saying that not yet still very weary of everything to do with eddies being gone shaking off some morning sickness she hadnt pursued it with them she did take out dismas hardys card and left a message for him to call her when he got home then she worked most of a whole day without taking a break or lunch or even thinking about it the paperwork after a week off had piled up which had taken most of the morning what with everybody coming by and wanting to know if she was okay well no she wasnt okay but it wouldnt do to say it she still hadnt put it anyplace where she could accept it she still expected to get home and then be making dinner and hear the door slam and eddies cheerful voice doing the honey im home ricky ricardo impression hed picked up the last month or so but she just nodded trying to be polite with all the questions saying she was fine it was odd until the seed had been planted today that eddie might have been murdered frannie had slowly been letting herself get convinced that her husband had in fact killed himself and each time that supposed reality struck home it cut deeper if eddie killed himself it meant he hadnt loved her the way hed said he did the way she felt he had but you couldnt argue with facts if he probably had killed himself and the police had investigated and said he had then whatever she had thought they had together hadnt been true and what did that make the baby she was carrying she worked it around and around coming back to it like a tongue to a hole in a tooth forcing herself to feel the pain so that maybe she could get used to it eddie had rejected her eddie hadnt loved her like shed thought but then this morning as soon as shed heard some official doubt it was like a fresh wind clearing the rooms of her mind if the police werent even sure then she wasnt a fool to believe it wasnt true she never should have stopped listening to her heart she remembered the time making love when shed conceived she knew it had been that saturday morning when she had come back to the bedroom after her shower to eddie sleeping in there was no faking his response to her and afterward lying there touching her everywhere nibbling i love your eyelids he said i love your elbow and laughing i love this little spot what you call this right at the top of her leg in the back she had to believe he loved her he did love her and if he loved her he didnt kill himself thats why the anger surprised her before up until today since eddie had died all shed felt was this numb horrible loss almost sleepwalking trading consolation with erin not letting herself think too much but now at ten to five cleaning off the desk for another day tomorrow she had to put her head down the wave of anger came so strongly oh eddie she almost said it out loud because now the next reality hit before while she was thinking he had committed suicide it hadnt mattered but now if somebody had killed him she had a pretty good idea of why they had done it all of his pushing all of his idealism his visits to cruz and polk trying to convince them to be something they werent to be little perfect eddies play fair do the right thing oh eddie she thought shaking now why couldnt you just leave them alone and be like everybody else i told you a hundred times it wouldnt do any good if youd have listened to me youd be alive now the shaking passed somebody walked by and asked if she was all right again she thought about the insurance money on the bus going home it was the first time it had occurred to her and like her anger earlier it made her feel guilty maybe this was the process she thought little things moving in to take the place of the pain she told herself this was probably natural the beginning of the healing but it didnt help with the guilt she didnt really care about the money then for a sickening moment she did well not really it was just if she did decide to have the baby then shed be able to stay at home with it for a while instead of having to keep working something else was happening and she tried to keep it out of the forefront of her thoughts like so many other things lately though it seemed out of her control it might be romantic nonsense but that first day shed found out she was pregnant all she could think was that it was her and eddies love the mixture that had made the baby it was as though their love had become a separate thing outside of themselves proving it existing alone but then the last week becoming more and more sure that eddie hadnt wanted the baby hadnt loved her like shed thought shed come to doubt whether she wanted it at all she sat by the window in the bus not caring not even aware that her face was streaked with tears she did want the baby it was eddies all she had left of eddie she crossed her hands over her stomach hardy had his elbows on frannies kitchen table he hadnt been home yet frannie had called lynne at the shamrock while hardy had been having one she wanted to know about the other investigation and hardy didnt want to get into it on the phone at the bar frannies hair was shining again and pulled back into a severe bun it made her face look older more in control she wore a plain white blouse a black wraparound skirt the face was still pallid without makeup but a string of green malachite pearls set off her eyes hardy was explaining i really didnt want to say anything get anybodys hopes up until we had something a little more definite but dont you have something definite well yeah but still maybe not definite enough did eddie ever mention a guy named alphonse page sure he was one of the last ones they were keeping on at army why him i dont know it kind of bothered eddie some kind of relationship with mr polk i think you have to understand dismas this situation at his work got funny about six months ago i guess the company was just going under and polk didnt care anymore so why did it mean so much to eddie she sighed it was just a project i think at least at first he hated to see the other men laid off when it might have been avoided he didnt like it that one customer kept the whole company alive that kind of thing so he tried to keep things happening but polk just didnt want to put in the time anymore and wouldnt give eddie any real authority why didnt he just quit i dont know really half was the challenge i guess but also he was starting school in the fall and figured he only had a few months so why start with somebody else so he thought he might as well do something worthwhile until he left something like that i think she paused we didnt exactly agree on everything you know but then he realized something else was going onwith polk i meanand thats when he got this idea to save everybody frannie got up and walked back into the kitchen dammit she said just loud enough for hardy to hear she opened the refrigerator then closed it hardy followed her in do you know did he actually go and see cruz uhhuh then he was planning on meeting him again she stopped and turned her eyes wide now god i think it was that night how could i not have remembered that monday the night he was killed she leaned back against the counter well no i mean it couldnt be he didnt she was shaking the white fabric of her blouse shimmering over her shoulders and breasts he didnt what he didnt leave here to do that im sure of that he said he wanted to think about about the baby that hed be right back maybe he remembered his meeting with cruz while he was out she didnt answer but hed seen him before you know that for a fact she nodded absently frannie its important she walked back to the table and sat again at least once the week before i think it was he went to his house there had been no point in trying to talk to frannie about eddie maybe blackmailing cruz but driving home it began to make more and more sense if he was starting school in the fall what was he planning to live on and with a baby on the way thered be that much more pressure frannie wouldnt be able to work at least for a few months extra money might come in very handy maybe he only got the idea that night he had the meeting planned anyway and it just came to him then it backfired it was possible if only eddie had been the kind of guy to try that and all indications still were that he hadnt been but turning onto his street from geary he remembered abes advice and repeated the name alphonse page to himself several times out loud he let himself into his dark house frannies earlier message was on his machine so was a call from jane just to hear your voice he went to his desk and took the tape from his pocket it was an educated male voice made nasal either by some effort at concealment or from the recording it said there is a body in the parking lot of the cruz publishing company thank you very formal and little else the thank you jarred slightly hardy listened to the clip five times hoping to recognize something about the voice it was not female it was not accented it was earlynot yet ninethirty of a long and nonproductive day tomorrow he would get to see cruz if he had to kidnap him just to get to the bottom of his lies he also wanted to check up on steven see how he was getting along maybe glitsky would even collar alphonse he was pretty sick of it all he needed was eddies death declared a homicide and he thought glitsky had enough evidence to do it now but really there was no new evidence directly relating to eddie there were just possible motives and random weirdnesses like the phone call from the goddamn middle of the city hardy picked up the telephone dialed a number and listened for three rings when jane answered he said he had to see her chapter twentyfive odis de la fontaine was more impressed with what the papers had called rape than with the murder but he was most impressed with the money and alphonsehis own older first cousin alphonsedid he ever have money odis had never seen so much money in one place before and alphonse hadnt even unpacked the sports bag yet what odis saw was the one loose pack of hundreds that alphonse was now carrying flat in the front pocket of his black baggy pants odis checked it out again as alphonse got up to go to the toilet there wasnt a sign of bulge in the pocket alphonse had stopped on the way to the airport and bought a pair of sandals and a hawaiian shirt that he wore hanging out over his pants he took the sports bag with him to the bathroom but odis would have done the same thing that was just smart alphonse wasnt worried why should he be he looked different enough odis thought with the new threads and the short hair the picture in the paper had his afro and the beginnings of that goatee hed started a year before then shaved off so it wasnt likely anybody was going to recognize him in the dark airport bar that morning after his mother had gone out to work odis had cut alphonses hair then gone shopping for both of them and dont get us no montgomery ward shit either alphonse had said peeling off five of the hundreds get us some real clothes odis nineteen had gone into macys up at the skyline mall and picked himself up a warmup jacket a new pair of adidas a bunch of tshirts for alphonse he got some of the baggy pants more tshirts and a dress coat that cost nearly a bill on the way out of the mall he passed a hat store and bought bogart hats for the both of them they hadnt decided on hawaii at the time he still had two unbroken cs and maybe thirty more alphonse hadnt even asked him about the change theyd left the house before odiss two sisters had come home from school and definitely before odiss mother got back from work she hadnt been happy about alphonse appearing on the run at their doorstep but he was her sisters only kid and she wasnt about to turn him away but shed made it clear it was a onenight stopover no more taking odiss car theyd shot some pool in san bruno til six oclock during which time they decided on hawaii to chill out until things got more mellow around here they got some steaks at a sizzler couple of glasses of wine and then theyd stopped while alphonse bought his shirt they had parked the car in the longterm lot now odis thinking about white pussy waited for alphonse to return he hadnt heard nearly enough about it alphonse had said it was just like any other pussy he didnt seem that much into talking about it he told odis he hadnt raped the girlshe was a friend of his and when she died it had just been an accident which sounded right the way he told it alphonse sometimes hung out with some bad brothers but he wasnt ever going to kill anybody on purpose he was too nice a guy he looked out at the planes taxiing out in the night wondering if the plane hed be on in a couple of hours was one of them another round alphonse had ordered up some drink with an umbrella in it from the bar when theyd come in odis turned his head and looked at the waitressmesh stockings right up to her ass over great legs blond hair surrounding a models face tits pushed out the front of the scoopneck blouse he nodded whatre you having odis cleared his throat nother one of these no two of em he smiled at her going to hawaii she smiled back thats nice i wish i was what is that a mai tai odis didnt know but he nodded yeah two of em that was nice the girl talking to him like that he watched her walk back to the bar nice wiggle a small little ass like some white girls had but a pretty pretty face she looked back at him from the bar catching him looking at her he smiled she smiled back wonder what she meant saying she wished she was going to hawaii too maybe she was coming on to him a little the thing that was on his mind kept getting bigger and he turned his head to look at the runways again hey what if he just asked her when she came back there she was looking at him again saying something to the bartender and now coming back definitely showing him something im sorry she said but im going to have to ask you if i can see your id odis just looked at her thinking whats this hey he said grinning ive already had one right she shrugged the bartender doesnt remember serving you he doesnt think you look twentyone tell him thanks would you i will but i need you to prove it there was something going on between them he was sure of it odis leaned back in his chair and tucked in his shirt pulling it tight across his chest then he looked her up and down she liked thathe could tell okay then he reached into his pocket look he said i dont got no id right now he took out his roll of bills but i got a lot of this and my cousin he got more she nodded and smiled getting it looking right into his eyes okay she said walking back to the bar damn this is easy and here comes alphonse sitting down smiling the planes on time he said bout an hour and a half odis looked back over at the bar the girl now just waiting while the bartender was busy for a minute talking on the phone she looked over to him and smiled so everything was cool odis smiled back alphonse noticed what you doin nothin yet but you got me thinking about it whats that odis jerked his head toward the bar what she got well you think when we get over there we got no time for that here i tole you it aint no different alphonse picked up his umbrella drink and sucked at the straw he stared into the empty glass i could get used to these you know maybe thats all ill do over there is suck up piña coladas piña coladas alphonse shook his head patient thats what were drinking here odis piña coladas odis was just about to tell him that hed ordered some mai tais for the second round when this guy looked like the refrigerator came up and hovered over their table excuse me he said all business a giant standing light on his feet hands folded in front of him can i ask you gentlemen to show some identification thats when alphonse bolted expecting him was one thing actually seeing him at the door was another it had been her door for so long shed forgotten that it had once been both of theirs dismas coming home from work every day thosehow manyyears up the stoop then hearing the key in the deadbolt in those days even before the baby jane getting home before him making some hors doeuvres or blender drinks before he got home sometimes bringing her friends with her sometimes dismas getting home with his once in a while twenty people descending on the hardy fun house but most nights just dismas home from work loving her and now here he was again on the stoop with no keys of his own ringing the doorbell the doors top half was a frosted window and through it the silhouette was dismas her dismas whod once wanted it all and then none of it she opened the door hi she was for some reason embarrassed unable to say more she wore dolphin shorts and a tank top and was barefoot this buyer for magnins she backed up a step he walked in all right then the weight of the place slowed him down through the living room he seemed to feel it more without talking she headed for the bedroom she was forgetting what hed have to pass he got to the door that entered the hallway by that time shed come to the entrance to the bedroom dismas stopped in front of her little used sewing room he stood there a long time the door to it was closed remember how we wouldnt close the door the first few weeks he said how we wanted to hear every sound he leaned back against the wall she walked a few steps toward him she heard the long breath maybe i should have come over to your place she said you think i was wrong he asked letting himself down to the floor now here it seems so immediate she came a little closer the only light in the hallway came from the kitchen around an lturn to the left by her bedroom i guess i got used to it she said the house i mean the room it didnt sound right but she had to say something i had to go on i couldnt i know jane came and knelt next to him she touched his hair if its any help i understood even then things just stopped mattering i know they did i mean why do anything anyway i thought everything made a difference id make a better world she pulled his face into her breast shhh she whispered i was just like ed cochran and see where that gets us she stroked himhis face his hairletting him get it out at least he was with her not running his arms around her i didnt he stopped pulling back slightly leaving you he said that was wrong it wasnt a lot of fun she agreed but i lived i never explained it did i just upped and left you think im dumb dismas i got it i just couldnt handle caring anymore that much i said i got it i had to he motioned with his head whats in there now its my sewing room you mind if i look at it they got up she opened the door and flicked on the light watching dismas trying to imagine it as it had been now it was a different placethe alphabet wallpaper gone no trinkets or kid stuff or upholstered edges it was a working room pleasant and dull dismas hands in pockets just stood in the doorway nodding i shouldve seen this about five years ago he said i kept seeing it like it was you thought nothing would change the old interior landscape he said it never did she turned off the light taking his hand so what happened she asked now i mean i dont know he said i really dont know youre the same but youre so different jane said who isnt i dont think i am which one the same or different different she decided dismas was sitting crosslegged on the bed he drank some of his wine you must be different too he said or i dont think i could be here with you she reached over and touched his leg at the knee where the jeans were worn nearly white he was barefoot his print shirt had a collar and needed ironing and the top two buttons were undone well either way im glad you are she leaned over and kissed him how am i different he asked then as though to himself how am i the same come to think of it well youre still intense i am intense he agreed but its like its more controlled now like you think about things more before you do them he kept his eyes on her gray sleepy eyes that didnt seem tired she chuckled deep in her throat see youre doing it now just looking thinking about things i do think about things he said no its not that so much its not its more the way i think i guess i just dont jump into things anymore but isnt this investigation didnt you just jump into that i make exceptions she touched his chest at the v of his shirt and pico and his shark and you definitely jumped all over me at shroeders i did i thought that was you no that was you she kissed him again mostly which makes three jumps in a week there could be a pattern emerging there dismas lay back on the bed against the pillow a hand back under his head he held out his wineglass and jane reached for the bottle on the floor and filled it you know its funny he said running into those things again that i jumped into its not like i see them and decide its almost automatic back then everything was passion being a cop the law you i guess old diz just lost himself with all that jane put the bottle back on the floor and stretched herself out beside him is that why you quit them all they filled me up they were what i was he closed his eyes and drank some wine then when michael died its okay diz i know i know but i realized all those passions they werent me i was just a guy who did things pretty wellplayed cops argued made love maybe definitely she said but none of it mattered or maybe mattered too much i guess losing the kid made me realize that there wasnt any me any dismasleft there to handle it so you dropped out i didnt look at it that way i changed careers thats all killed off that romantic idiot you cant have things be that important you lose things thats life you gotta be able to deal with it she ran a hand over the stomach of the man whod been her first husband he was smiling at her in spite of what he was saying still a wonderful smile she kissed him on the cheek the ear the neck his arms came around her so have you been happy she asked i havent been unhappy i havent thought much about it except developed your theory of love the attitude the lovewithoutpain theory he shrugged its a good theory have you been happy whos happy anyway its a dumb concept im happy right now she said i dont need to think about what it all might mean tomorrow another difference between us but really saying it all as if it were suddenly a pose his lips curving up a little eyes twinkling but this isnt bad thank you so much the kiss now slow deep hands moving feeling his breath soft over her body this isnt bad either or this or diz huh shhh it wasnt often rose couldnt sleep the last time had been when theyd had the paulist missionary for that week and that had been in february she thought or march she couldnt really remember she did know that when the diocese sent around the missionaries she was more nervous about her cooking her housekeeping it was she felt a reflection on the fathers and she didnt want to do anything to embarrass them so she tended to stay awake going over things she might have forgotten or that she could do better but on the other regular nights like tonight was normally shed finish the dinner dishes for the fathers and whatever guests they might have had then watch television doing her needlework in her room until nine or so then turn out the light the days started early at the rectory and she knew she wasnt a spring chicken anymoreshe had to get her sleep but the thing with father cavanaugh just wouldnt get out of her mind and it probably wasnt even important she could bring it up to him in the morning and that would be that but her body just wouldnt listen to her and she lay awake waiting for him to get back from seeing how steven was progressing over to the cochrans she looked at the clock glowing on her nightstand it was after eleven shed be sore tired tomorrow come on you old woman she said to herself disgusted itll keep but she kept returning to it and it might really be something father would have to act on right away even if they had a suspect already it might make a difference hed want her to bring it to his attention even if she turned out not to be right if hed told her once hed told her a thousand times rose nobodys infallible but the pope so if hed just made that little mistakeand she wasnt even sure it was a mistake lord knows his memory was so much better than hersthen she thought hed want to know especially since it concerned eddies death to say nothing of the official police investigation and it had been gnawing at her ever since morning when tibbs and renko thats what she called themwouldnt that be a good show if they put those two together had had that discussion where shed poured the coffee shed gone over it in her mind about fifty times since then the question of whether it had been sunday or monday that father had gone out with eddie and she was pretty sure it was monday the only reason she was sureor thought she was surewas that sunday a week ago yesterday they had had bishop wright over from oakland and shed made a prime rib for the dinner and everybody had commented on how good the yorkshire pudding was and the au jus sauce theyd invited her to eat with them even which was special for when they had guests she thought she remembered father dietrick opening a second bottle of wine and the three of them retiring into the library after dinner while she cleaned up but of course she couldnt be a hundred percent sure since shed gone to her room after washing up and she hadnt seen either his excellency or the fathers again that night and she knew it had been an early sunday dinnershe had timed the roast to be done at so she must have served at around so it was possible that their party had broken up early and that eddie had come by after that the thing was she remembered somebody ringing the doorbell on monday night after dinner but again she hadnt seen whether or not it was eddie father cavanaugh had answered the door himself sensitive to interrupting her and that had been the last shed seen of him he hadnt come back until after shed gone to bed and unlike tonight she had slept soundly but it was her memory of sunday of bishop wright being there that made her believe it hadnt been sunday that eddie had come by his excellency had never gone home early before usually father cavanaugh and he would burn the midnight oil over some cognac and nothing wrong with thatthe men need to be allowed some release while they discussed philosophy or theology or politics she knew what they talked about because father cavanaugh would often share with her some of what theyd said the next morning she sighed turning on her side eleventwenty maybe she should just wake up father dietrick and ask him if he remembered what time their discussion had broken up that night but no hed there it was the back door opening and closing quietly she swung her feet to the floor and grabbed her robe from where shed hung it neatly on the chair next to her bed she wanted to move quickly before father had had a chance to get to bedit wouldnt do to disturb him after thatbut she wasnt about to go out with pins in her white thin and brittle hair either even in the middle of the night she stopped by the bathroom and took them out she stepped into her slippers father stood in front of the open refrigerator peering inside seeing him bless him she knocked softly on the wall by the kitchen door rose he said smiling caught me im afraid she made some gesture what are you doing still awake i couldnt sleep no point in rushing right into it now it probably wasnt that important she moved into the kitchen can i make you something he stepped back acknowledging the kitchen as her domain she knew what they had left over he leaned over and pecked her on the cheek which made her blush with pleasure father loved her and it was a wonderful feeling as comfortable as being married ill just sit at the table and you surprise me he said but do you think a beer while i wait would be sinful he opened a mexican beer while she took out the plate with the chicken on it see it paid to take the extra minutes to slice the meat from the carcass then the best foods nothing but and clausens pickles she saw the swiss cheese swiss cheese why not and the potato bread that came in such big slices how is steven she asked assembling without turning around she could see father shaking his head that poor boy is he all right hes been through a lot but hes all right id say itll be a couple of months before hes really over it now sipping his beer it really was amazing she thought that she knew his rhythms so well she didnt even have to be looking at him to know what he was doing youth is really something isnt it rose that it is father though im not the expert on it i once was father chuckled at her jokes that was another thing none of us is rose none of us is lettuce no not with the pickles one green was enough frankly father said im almost more concerned about erin and big ed well of course you are she thought but she kept it to herself how he felt about erin was a secret at least he thought it was but anyone who knew him like she did could tell without any effort she brought the sandwich over along with another beer it was a good big one and she knew hed finish the first beer right in the middle of it are they all right she asked he dug into the sandwich chewed carefully swallowed then drank some beer oh eds a rock you know its mostly erin she nodded she feels like shes neglected steven drove him to running away so everything that happened because of that is her fault how has she neglected steven thats what i tried to tell her it doesnt make sense maybe she had other things she was doing but i really dont think it was at stevens expense look at the other kids he took another bite of the sandwich besides erins always been very active could it be steven just needed more attention but how do you tell that rose and how do you blame yourself for it she nodded again nothing in the universe would convince father that erin cochran had done something wrong great sandwich by the way she beamed but you know what i think it is really i thinkno im sure its still eddie how do people bear with all that in one week he closed his fist on the table and pounded it dear god if i could just change one thing she reached over and covered his hand now dont you go blaming yourself father youve said it yourselfsometimes god takes the cream of the crop early back to himself he took eddie and nothing you or anybody else does is going to change that youve just to pick up and go on from there erins strong and ed will help her go on from there thats all you can do isnt it his eyes softened the pain visibly left his face thank you rose youre a gem she blushed again looking down finish your sandwich she said now she thought would be a good time you know father while were talking about eddie what i mean is the reason i couldnt sleep is i was wondering if youd made a mistake father swallowed and smiled no ones infallible but the pope rose what did i do this time well i dont know you did but she outlined it all for him everything she remembered or thought she did it took only a couple of minutes but sure enough that must have been what had been keeping her up because suddenly she was exhausted father had left the second half of the sandwich had she made it too big and didnt open the other beer maybe what she was telling him was important you might be right rose he said when shed finished his lips were tight the wide forehead creased in concentration id better call the sergeant in the morning im sorry i just thought he patted her hand nothing to be sorry about you did the right thing exactly im sorry i cost you some sleep she sat back in her chair relieved but only for a moment then reached for the dish father held her hand again ill get the dishes rose you get some sleep chapter twentysix inspector sergeant glitsky answered the telephone on the first ring his adrenaline pumping calls in the middle of the night meant one thingone of his cases had come in he kissed flo who didnt even stir anymore when the phone rang after midnight and looked in on the three kids two in bunkbeds and one in a crib all in the same twelvebyfourteen room and they did have to get moving on a new house even if they couldnt afford it if he didnt make lieutenant in the kitchen sucking a quick microwaved cup of mud he called dismas hardy as a courtesy the phone rang four times and then the machine clicked on and abe said hardy glitsky they got alphonse then he hung up now he was looking through the small hole in the door of the interrogation room at the hall of justice it was by his watch exactly am a familiar and therefore not ominous silence prevailed all around him the silence was familiar in this place normally strafed by obscenities and bedlam because glitsky had done this many times since becoming a homicide inspectorcome down in the middle of the night to interrogate a suspect still without his lawyer and therefore perhaps likely to talk if as was also likely his iq didnt hover much above room temperature if he waited until the morning even a rookie courtappointed defense attorney would tell alphonse to say nothing and that would be that until the trial this was the prosecutions one big chance to break something in any case and if an inspector wasnt willing to forego a nights sleep for it he was in the wrong job alphonse slumped maybe sleeping at the small table his hands were not visibleit was likely they were cuffed to the chair behind him a deputy hands folded also perhaps dozing sat at one end of the table glitsky knocked alphonse my man how you doin abes voice boomed in the small room everybody was awake now alphonse even managed a more or less welcome look possibly relieved that he was getting questioned by one of his brothers a notion glitsky was not above using but that all in all he found pretty funny hey we got you huh alphonse shrugged he had abrasions on his forehead and cheek a swollen mouth a little clotted blood under his nose you get caught in a door or something abe asked airport cops hurt me he muttered glitsky glanced at the deputy making a clucking sound weve got to do something about those airport cops he been mirandized the deputy nodded bout five times does he want to talk ask him alphonse you want to talk to me yeah you wanna do something about them beating me up he flipped on the tape recorder an old squeaking reeltoreel glitsky turned back to alphonse says in the report you resisted arrest and necessary force was used to restrain you alphonse rolled his eyes he had a way of saying shit that took about two seconds and didnt end in t shi so whyd you run i knew you was after me saw your picture in the paper huh hey you got your hair cut looks bad man alphonse bobbed his head at the compliment so whyd you have to kill her i didnt kill nobody glitsky smiled warm and inviting oh thats right somebody planted your knife there smeared her blood on the pants we got out of the hamper in your mothers house glitsky raised his eyebrows alphonses brain squeaking made almost as much noise as the reeltoreel finally he said what if i dont wanna talk to nobody what if i wanna see my lawyer first then absolutely its what were gonna do were gonna stop right now and get you a lawyer in here there was a long pause abe waited it out finally alphonse said i got rights no question i dont like one lawyer i can get another righteous right on glitsky gave him a sarcastic black power fist then folded his hands on the table and just sat there after about thirty seconds alphonse said what what do you mean what what you just starin at im just waiting i thought you were thinking about it alphonse strained stretching against the cuffs glitsky mr nice guy turned to the deputy cant you undo those alphonse rubbed his hands together when the cuffs were off he gingerly touched the bump on his forehead thinking about what he asked abe thought he ought to get his attention again you know sam polks dead too sam aint dead he aint breathin abe grinned now the tightlipped grin that showed his scar his eyes didnt grin his hands were still folded calm in front of him he twiddled his thumbs slowly finally resting his eyes on them his thumbs hey i didnt kill any sam polk you not layin that on me too glitsky shrugged i didnt say that who killed him i didnt say he was killed what made you think he was killed you just said glitsky shook his head uhuh i didnt say anything about him being killed you did glitsky had him on the ropes it was almost depressing how dumb these guys were alphonse didnt even know what was happening but glitsky knew that alphonse understood one thinghe was in deep shit alphonse talk to me man if you didnt kill him im the only friend you got shi no shit for real alphonse put his hands back up to his face rubbing his eyes craning his neck i didnt kill no sam polk okay abe sat there sometimes sitting was the best technique in the world he looked somewhere midway between them with no expression at all on his face he kept twiddling his thumbs alphonse fidgeted as though he had a hemorrhoid how we work something out he asked at last we trade trade what you tell me what happened you didnt kill him i prove it and you dont go to the gas chamber that sound fair glitsky kept smiling it was good he knew to drop the old gas chamber in there keep the intensity at the proper level you know we got a new court now alphonse we got judges now believe in the death penalty alphonse swallowed hard touched his forehead again he was beginning to sweat glitsky was if anything cool the tape recorder spun around and around squeaking a little like the steady drip of chinese water torture it was the first time abe remembered having a squeaky reeltoreel in an interrogation but he thought he might request one in the future he wondered waiting for alphonse whether there might be something like wdo in reversemake things squeak that made him smile again he ran with it the humor alphonse i got to draw you a picture or what what what you want i dont know nothin truer words abe thought were never spoken see the thing is when we got multiple murders in the course of a crime like we do here its the death penalty special circumstances they call it like if you kill a cop that kind of thing his eyes crinkled up you hear me they find you guilty and you could fry if youre lucky you go to the joint and you never get out they dont even talk about it it was shaking him glitsky could tell whatever passed for logic in the brain of this poor sorry son of a bitch was being whacked out of kilter but i tole you i didnt kill sam polk an what crime hey alphonse said abe his close personal friend you had a bag with like a hundred grand in it you sell girl scout cookies for that sam give it to you linda got it out abe shook his head nobodys gonna believe that to a jury its gonna look like you stole it you killed linda for it then you slammed the safe i didnt mean to kill linda i mean that was an accident you cut her throat by accident alphonse paused maybe catching up to the fact that hed just confessed to a killing he shrugged as if to say hey it happens so the thing is abe continued pressing his advantage that much money around youre dealing right you know it i know it so why argue about it you didnt kill polk maybe somebody else did but it was about the dope thats what we want to know what the hell abe thought might as well go for it they had him cold for lindas murder might as well collect some bonus points for dea if he could then work it around to the cochran thing he looked at his watch then at alphonse and i dont got all night okay alphonse was wrestling with the problem the sweat was now pouring off himabe could smell it across the tableand his nose was running slightly he sniffed and ran the back of his hand over his upper lip i know what youre thinking alphonse abe said in his most gentle voice youre thinking you talk and your friends find out theyll kill you right the eyes across the table told him thats what he was thinking okay that might happen it might you understand but you dont talk and i guarantee guaranteethat youre going down no maybe no if you go down we dont get you for sam polks death we definitely hit you for eddie cochrans alphonses mouth just hung open now youre going to tell me you didnt kill eddie i know alphonse you didnt mean to kill anybody save it though huh im tired glitsky looked at his watch again he wasnt particularly tired but it was closing in on four am and he had his confession he ought to go home he pushed his chair back from the table and stood up where you goin i said im tired if youre not gonna talk im going home alphonse reached his hand out across the table hey i mean it i didnt kill eddie sam mighta kilt him but i didnt abe pulled the chair around backward and straddled it we got your hairs in his car alphonse the same ones we found on linda so dont give me any more of this shit hey i swear to god how many times had he heard this everybody was innocent of everything unknown was the man who said yeah i did that and i did it because no it was always an accident or a mistake or somebody elses fault often the denial got so vehement that the perp actually came to believe he hadnt done it and since more than four out of five were either drunk or on some controlled substance when the crime occurred it wasnt surprising that it might all seem like an hallucination or dream that it hadnt really happened you swear to god abe replied wearily but you got a better chance of talking yourself out of sam polk we got you at the scene of eddies murder almost he added to himself i wasnt there his eyes had widened abe found himself forced to look closely at him there was something about this denial that was different look i rode in eddies car most days maybe even that day i dont know but you gotta believe me i liked eddie i didnt kill him abe wasnt about to get suckered by sincerity he shook his head made a production out of checking his watch you sure as fuck did then he stood up motioning to the deputy to turn off the recorder take him upstairs he said he got his hand on the doorknob before alphonse called out again hey slowly acting frustrated and exhausted though his adrenaline was still pumping awayhe wouldnt need any sleep the rest of the night glitsky turned back look ill talk okay but i didnt kill nobody you killed linda he waved that off i just thoughti got people saw me that night eddie got killed like all night yeah who your mother no man i play basketball city league that was a monday right abe nodded alphonse rolled his eyes up again straining for the memory finals were that night we played four games came in second good for you yeah good for me who came in first abe glared at him lips drawn tight alphonse smiled bunch of cops he said whole team full of cops chapter twentyseven the morning sun cast long shadows over the cruz parking lot it was barely seven am and hardy had been there for over an hour taking the chance that cruz had told the truth about one thingworking bosses hours hed slept at janes gotten up early and decided to find out about arturo cruz once and for all he wrote jane a note then drove across the wakening city to china basin where the whole thing had begun and it was he thought a whole thing a whole new thing jane was right it could be a pattern emerging two weeks before he was a bartender he wasnt in love either the feeling or the attitude he hadnt talked to abe glitsky in almost a year or walked sharks or cared about some stupid idea of picos to get them into the steinhart he wasnt sure what was going on exactly but having an hour alone to think about it on a morning they were probably shooting postcards all over the bay made it all very real and a little scary it was just a favor for moses and frannie he had told himself at first but that wasnt washing very well anymore it had gotten inside him this feeling that he might be doing something worthwhile it reminded him of why hed decided to join the police force and then go to law school what seemed about four lifetimes ago and it wasnt that he wasnt proud of tending bar it took a certain kind of person to be good he knew and there was a simple and profound art to the pouring itself especially of something like a draft guinness also there were principles like you didnt put a call liquor with a sweet mixa jack daniels and coke a tanqueray and tonic no you explained to your patron that the finest palate in the world could not tell the difference between a call liquor and a ninetycent well drink when it was mixed with some sugary bubbly stuff then you let them see for themselves you even gave them that drink on the house and then if they still wanted their remy martin vsop presbyterian you directed them to another establishment hardy wouldnt pour that shit and mcguire supported him hell mcguire had trained him butno doubt of itsomething else had been going on since he had started digging into eddie cochrans death as jane had pointed out he thought about the consequences of things and he had a hard time just now envisioning going back behind the bar rail fulltime or even parttime maybe he was getting a little old to be a bartender he didnt think he had wasted his life or anything like that or wish hed done things differently for the past few yearsdoing them had gotten him to here what really knocked him outthe surprise of it as much as anythingwas that here right now felt so good he wasnt worried about being hurt or failing or anything he wasnt worried about his potential he was having fun getting to know who he was not who hed assumed he had become it was interesting in fact he thought it was a gas the jaguar turned into berry street and hardy parked opposite the cruz building not in its parking lot got out of his car and started walking across the street the jag pulled into the empty lot and by the time arturo cruz alone had opened the door and stepped out hardy was standing in front of him mr cruz he said ive got a problem mr cruz ive got a problem the questions werent going to go away he knew that now you couldnt build a whole fabric of lies he thought and have it all hang neatly together and the weight of all of them was still affecting him and jeffrey especially after the story on linda polk had broken yesterday of course theyd run it in la hora thank god hed been with jeffrey the whole day sunday that the police had another suspect otherwise jeffrey might have thought hed killed linda too and now here was the man again he might as well come clean right now he thought get it off his chest he couldnt see hardys face though he had recognized him as he was driving up he was forced looking into the bright low morning sun to squint then try to shade his eyes the man was a fighter plane coming out of the sun he turned back to the car there that was better he could see fine he reached inside for his briefcase then straightened up come inside he said and started walking toward the building hardy fell in beside him i was going to call you he found himself saying as he did every morning he unlocked the huge glass double doors what about cruz pushed the door and held it open linda polk was killed sunday right and sam died when yesterday i heard about it yesterday anyway sunday night we think they were at the elevator inside it the doors closed shut quietly the man hands folded behind his back didnt say another word was he humming the doors opened on the secretarys station of the penthouse being in the news business i tend to hear about things why wasnt hardy saying anything well try again at least now in his office on his own turf he sat behind his desk so whats your problem you said you had a problem cruz said why were you going to call about sam and linda thats your problem hardy shook his head patiently he was sitting very relaxed in one of the deep white leather halfbanquettes in front of his desk no he said you brought that up i thought id pursue it a little well i mean since linda and sam and uh that other fellow the one who died here cochran ed cochran yeah since they all worked for the same company thats a pretty large coincidence wouldnt you say absolutely well well what well i mean what did he mean he hadnt been planning to call hardy he didnt know why hed said thatnerves maybe but hardyhe could tellwasnt going to let it go what do you mean the persistent bastard i mean there must be some connection wouldnt you think between them i ought to shut up right now he thought say goodbye to him and call my lawyer its funny you should mention that hardy said it kind of brings it back to my problem seehe crossed his legs elaborately ankle on kneethe only thing i can see that ties them all together is the cruz publishing company la hora you and the other thing is what brought me here in the first place after i thought about it enough is you lied to me at least twice when we had our first interview he paused letting it sink in at least twice cruz started to turn on the glare the one that worked with his employees even sometimes with jeffrey but hardy held up a hand said no meaning that isnt going to work and then folded up the hand leaving one finger out one you said you didnt know ed his wife says he saw you the week before he died and had another appointment scheduled right around that night maybe exactly that night the one he died i mean cruz was glad he was sitting down he could feel a sponginess in his legs and knew they wouldnt have held him if he was standing he would have had to slump against something and two hardy continued sticking up a second finger you described to me how bad it all looked with the blood and all now my question my problem the bastard was really enjoying himself is how you could know what it looked like if you went home at eightthirty or nine when the lot was empty he tried to swallow then cleared his throat no good wheeling around in his chair moving slowly carefully he took one of the cutcrystal wineglasses from its tray on the bookshelf behind his desk and pushed the water button on his small refrigerator god the water was delicious he spun back around i didnt kill him there now thats direct hardy stood up cruz didnt like looking up at himit threw off any sense of balance between thembut he still felt too weak in the legs to risk rising himself you mind if i get a glass then hardy had the water and was sitting back down on the edge of the chair elbows on his knees holding the glass in both of his hands in front of him what about the black guy the suspect we ran his picture in la hora hardy nodded hes a suspect and so am i lets just say my curiosity gets aroused when i get lied to eye to eye in no hurry whatsoever pretty natural reaction dont you think cruz gulped down the last of his water maybe i should call my lawyer hardy sat back in the chair youre certainly welcome to but im not here with a warrant i came to talk i really didnt kill him but you saw him he closed his eyelids and the sight flashed up behind them againturning into the dark lot headlights finding the body keeping the beam on it as he drove up hed gotten out of the car and stood staring for who knew how long not recognizing ed cochranthere wasnt much to recognizebut knowing who it had been in any case i shouldve called he went to drink more water raising the glass to his lips but it was empty when was that when i saw him that night he found himself sighing feeling the release wanting to keep talking now that it had started with nothing to hide i had an appointment with him at ninethirty i stayed working until maybe eight eightthirty got hungry and went out to dinner where hardy asked he didnt have to think about it every minute of that night had been looping in his mind for over a week place called the rose up on fourth hardy nodded i know it anybody see you there could swear to it of course wendell could swear to it they had flirted a little discreetly i think the waiter i had might remember whatd you have to eat again no need to think calves liver pasta some blush zinfandel then what then i came back here there was a cari assumed it was edsin the middle of the lot but you didnt have your meeting he was already dead just like the police found him yes i assume so now that hed said it he started shaking again he didnt trust his hands to reach for his water glass to refill it he put them on his lap out of sight under the desk hardy leaned back in his chair now frowning what was the meeting supposed to have been about did he really want to hear about it all of it cruz realized it might not seem on the surface to have made a lot of sense but if he could just make hardy understand the issue with jeffrey how jeffrey had started to take eds sidethen it would be all right anything was better than trying to keep all those lies in his mind he hadnt realized at first how bad it would be having jeffrey not believe him even think he was capable of murdering somebody but now once he came forward the police would find no evidence they could have an investigation and find him innocent and that would end all this horrible distrust between himself and jeffrey but when he had finished hardy was still frowning so how come you couldnt tell us this last week he saw that his hands were back up on the desk folded tightly together he spread them palms up i was afraid i just i know theres no excuse i dont know he tried to smile man to man it was a lapse thats all i was nervous hardy stretched looked at his watch and slowly pushed himself up from the chair can i use your phone he asked though it was still probably too early for abe to be in the office hardy felt he ought to get the police involved right now this warranted bringing in the troops they might or might not corroborate cruzs story but he had admitted being in the lot that night at the relevant time that would be enough to get something official going then whether hed killed ed would either come out or it wouldnt either way it was now a police matter hardy left a message for abe and told cruz that another officer would be coming by later in the day he was of course welcome to have an attorney present at that time though hardy knew it was patently ridiculousthat no real cop would simply walk out on a murder suspect leaving the later interrogation to another officerhe couldnt think of a better way to continue with cruz hed done what hed set out to do which was prove hed lied finding out why was out of his province if cruz tried to run hed only get in deeper and the publisher was after all an established wealthy and even wellknown citizen hardy didnt think he would run at home hardy heard abes message of the night before about alphonse and felt satisfaction between alphonse and cruz there seemed no doubt they had the man whod killed eddie at the very least they would have enough once and for all to call it a homicide of course hed wait for the official word before passing it along to moses and frannie or the cochrans and though it wasnt going to help anybodys immediate pain much to know that eddie cochran hadnt killed himself it would eventually be a consolation the rejection factor would be gone his deaththe death itselfwas a tragedy sure but the wound could heal over now the quarter of a million dollars for frannie wouldnt hurt either chapter twentyeight steven knew his mom was trying maybe she just couldnt do it she changed the bandages religiously brought his ice cream and sandwiches opened and closed the window and turned on and off the television or radio and probably would try to build him an airplane and take him for a flight if he asked her it was all still eddie he didnt blame her couldnt blame her he felt the same thing or guessed he did maybe it was different losing a son than losing a brother but either way it was a bad loss all this reaction in himprobably even the running away had to do with that with losing eddie hed had a couple of days to think about it and bright kid that he was had come up with this theory there was this minimum amount of acceptance everybody needed to get along no matter where they were with steven it was this house and up until last week it had been close but there was enough he was at absolute zerountil you factored eddie in and even though he hadnt been living at home for a while eddie had always been there in a way his presence his attitude was felt and frannie too though not so much still though he gave frannie in those hours while the drugs were wearing down and he hadnt yet called mom a plus three more than anyone he lived with and eddie geez eddie was off the chart maybe plus a hundred and six on a scale of one to ten he couldnt exactly figure it out but he knew that to eddie he had been about the funniest smartest most fun little but not so little brother in history so with eddie in the picture he belonged weird though it sometimes felt here he was accepted because eddie dug him anyway thats what it all felt like now after hed figured it out a little so when eddie had died hed been left with a vacuum and he hadnt felt like he could continue to survive in thatnot here at home not anymore now since hed been hurt he honestly thought something had changed of course it didnt really count with everybody feeling sorry for him and trying to be nice most of all mom mom trying like hell it probably wasnt even conscious but he knew he had become just a duty to her like a paper drive or a cake sale and mom had always been somebody you could count on for that stuff here she was now steven keeping his eyes closed breathing regular pretending to be asleep hand on the forehead to check for a fever then tuck the blankets around he opened his eyes a crack groggy how you feeling honey fine really anything i can get you slow shake of the head she sits on the bed he can feel her trying to say something else but settles for reaching out a hand rubbing it across his cheek it feels oddly cold he opens his eyes again its okay mom her brave smilestill thinking of eddie its so obvious but he cant really worry about that a little fake smile you just get better she says take it easy and get better she looks at her watch time for another dose no he doesnt hurt that bad close the eyes again he feels her get up from the bed alone again how about talking mom how about suggesting i sit up and do something with you not just how im feeling well it wasnt going to happen for a while she wasnt ready for it and it wasnt as though he thought he could take eddies place nobody could do that but maybe if shed just recognize him as something other than a duty they could start to get somewhere he didnt want much he thought if only he could do something to make mom see him maybe value him a little bit thats all he needed really and it might fill in some of the hole left by eddie probably not much but maybe enough but mom seemed below zero herself and that made him real nervous maybe more nervous than anything else erin wore a green jogging suit and tennis shoes the low white socks had a little pompom on the back just over each heel and hardy found himself staring at them as he followed her back into the house he tried to keep staring at the pompom because seeing erin cochran in a jogging suiteven when she was still so obviously distraughtmade him realize that another result of the sense of new life he was experiencing was a general increase in his libido whats funny she said they had come out onto the deck into the bright sunlight and hed been admiring something other than the pompoms when shed turned and caught him he didnt think he ought to discuss it with her the way my mind works he said striving to be suitably enigmatic he pulled one of the multicolored canvas chairs out for her catching a slight whiff of ivory soap there was a wide redandgreen umbrella stuck through the center of the table the sun was high and he pulled his own chair in close to hers so they could share the shade and how does your mind work she touched his arm lightly reminding him of the way both she and big ed had used a hand on his arm to guide him on the day of the funeral she looked directly into his eyes but no way was she flirting she was one of those people to whom the world was a straightforward place obviously she was happily married to big ed and at the moment griefstricken she couldnt be bothered with whether or not eye contact could be misinterpreted the hand on the arm though the wide serious brown eyesit was disconcerting how does my mind work hardy repeated very slowly im afraid no i dont think so she poured coffee into two plain brown mugs and shifted the sugarandcream tray closer i dont think so rusty clock guaranteed tick he paused looked around came back to her eyes tick like that it was the first time hardy had seen anything like humor in her eyes she took her mug in both hands and leaned back in her chair jimfather cavanaughcame by last night evidently theres a suspect you didnt see the paper she shook her head with steven now she began then stopped how is he she lifted her shoulders noncommittal anyway the suspect is the reason i called well i think we have two actually he explained a little about cruz then went back and covered alphonse she listened but her eyes were out of focus somewhere over the middle of her backyard when hardy finished she didnt react in any way mrs cochran he said she might have been talking to herself trying to find reason in something absurd two people she said two people might have killed eddie wanted to kill eddie how could two different people want to kill my eddie it wasnt a question hardy looked down into his mug i mean it doesnt make sense no i guess it doesnt but you think it happened he shrugged it seems to be the only other option you were certain he didnt kill himself i dont know whats worse she closed her eyes now i dont know why i called you she said apologizing trying and failing to smile i mean i keep thinking something like someshe pausedsome information is going to make a difference i keep thinking well find out something and i wont feel this way anymore its stupid really no its not stupid its pretty natural she fixed him with a dark glare its stupid nothings going to bring eddie back shocked at herself she leaned forward in her chair quickly putting her hand on hardys arm again im sorry i didnt mean to yell at you hardy fought the urge to cover her hand with his own she didnt need any kind of comfort right now or maybe she needed it but it wouldnt take waste of time to try hardy was matteroffact its natural to be curious about the truth once you know what happened you can put it somewhere its not stupid she took a couple of deep breaths jim said more or less the same thing jims right she found a little nugget in that of course she said her face softening jims always right she continued the deep breathing so what does it mean the suspects it means you might have a better idea of what really happened with luck youll get some kind of a motive frannie stands to collect some insurance thats good i hadnt thought of that its the reason i took this job in the first place but as you say none of it is going to bring eddie back nobodys pretending it will its just a place to move on from thats all where to she said all but to herself the coffee had gotten cold the shade had moved enough so that hardys head was now in the sun he shaded his eyes briefly with his left hand thats everybodys question she lowered her head im sorry she said im still all inside myself as they took in the coffee stuff she started talking about steven though he remained on the pain drugs and was sleeping a lot hed sat up for the first time the previous night talking to jim and big ed he acted sulky to her or toward her she couldnt tell which its like the more i try to do for him the more he withdraws she said dismas carried the mugs and rinsed them before putting them upside down on the drain she felt guilty subjecting him and everybody else to this eating horrible pain it wasnt his business she was becoming a talking junkie where as long as someone was there to talk to it kept it at a bearable distance it shamed her feeling that way talking intimately to nearstrangers but she couldnt help herself she heard a faint mom from the back of the house would you like to see him she asked its pretty lonely for him in there steven had pushed himself up again crookedly she reached behind him to straighten the pillow come on mom it was hopeless he nearly cringed at her touch she turned with a halfbroken smile do you remember mr hardy he nodded you find the guy that killed eddie we think so it was too dark in the room for such a beautiful day erin pulled up the shade would you like the window open it doesnt matter then to dismas father jim said you were sure dismas came up and sat at the foot of the bed we ought to be sure by tonight he reached into his back pocket and took out his wallet then extracted a blue card and held it out to steven last one got pretty bent up he said you want it to her surprise he took it thank you he said just like that formally not thanks or sure but thank you then whats keeping you from being sure dismas kind of laughed and shrugged at the same time can you tell me i mean all about it dismas looked at her and she nodded it was good he was starting to come out of the pain show some interest in living but she wasnt sure whether she could handle hearing it all gone over again are you hungry steven would you like some lunch he paid no attention to her all his concentration on dismas youre not too tired he asked steven catching her eye with a question she nodded that it would be okay no i do nothing cept sleep anyway well ill go make a sandwich she said dismas was already talking before she was out of the room hardy sat at the cliff house waiting for pico to arrive for lunch he was able to see clear to the farallones in front of him about a hundred sea lions cavorted on and around seal rock the place jammed on weekends was not too bad here on a tuesday afternoon he got a table by one of the floortoceiling windows without any wait his waitress was friendly but not too and didnt even blink when hed ordered his two anchor steams at once he was halfway through the first his instinct had been to go back to the shamrock maybe take on his regular shift again or at least crow a little to moses but driving toward the place from the cochrans he decided not to jinx himself one more day ormore likelya few hours would be worth it to make sure the thing was nailed down he couldnt tell moses hed almost cracked the case that almost surely eddie had been murdered that it was likely fran would get some insurance and oh by the way there was a chance that moses owed him a quarter of the bar so hed called pico and turned west on lincoln toward the cliff house instead of east to the shamrock hed told pico he wanted to celebrate but perhaps hed been premature even in that everything with jane seemed to be going so well the case had just about concluded so what was wrong with him that he couldnt be happy was he so much out of practice he sipped at his beer watching the waves break against the rocks below him and tried to figure it out the feelingthe old gut something is really wrong feelingstarted while he was talking to steven hed started in with that just to loosen things up over there because steven so obviously needed to feel involved he knew the kid couldnt really help him at this stage there was nothing left to do out on the ocean a couple of tugs were pulling a ship toward the golden gate hardy watched it for a while then looked beyond it up the marin coast seemingly all the way to oregon it was still a postcard daya cloudless sky the bluegreen benign sea all right so it seemed hed finished the case at least as far as he was concerned he was spending all this time wondering why he wasnt happy when really why should he be happy it wasnt like it had been a laugh riot maybe there would be some small sense of accomplishment down the line about the money hed helped frannie get or something like that but he couldnt escape the basic ugliness hed been mucking around in but it wasnt just that talking to steven trying to get it all straight for the boy it had gone a little crooked on him almost every move hed made had followed from a basic set of assumptions he had developed in the first day or two of looking at it what if all those assumptions or even one of them had been wrong he shook his head it was a police matter now the proof would come outpossibly was coming out right now downtown and then it would be over it wasnt his problem anymore so what that someone had called in about the body from a phone booth three miles away from the cruz lot what did it matter if alphonse killed linda with a knife and eddie was shot and couldnt cruz really have lied out of pure fear not necessarily to cover up a murder sure sure and sure but there was one other thing it had occurred to himlike a remembered tastewhile he was talking to steven some vague feeling that he had said something that he had overlooked before about eddies murder and didnt have shitall to do with either arturo cruz or alphonse page he stared at the ship as it continued its slow progress toward the bridge sipping anchor steam damned if he could put his finger on what the hell it was chapter twentynine dick willis of the drug enforcement agency was sure it was one of those situations where the guys name had absolutely determined what he was going to be in life bargen had probably been called plea since the first grade willis sitting across from him in his cubicle in the das office looked at the nameplate on his cluttered desk the one that said p bargen and wondered if in fact that might be his real name he didnt know him as anything else plea leaned back balancing his wooden chair on its hind legs his feet were on the corner of his desk crossed and he appeared to be sleeping soundly arms crossed behind his head his tie was undone his few hairs uncombed still he wasnt a slob his body was trim his pants still had a crease in them and the shirt was ironed he was paying attention they were listening to abe glitsky talk willis didnt intend to stay long it was the end of the day and hed dropped by mostly as a courtesy at the most what they were talking about here with the alphonse deal was about a hundred thousand dollars and asking him a majorleague drug buster to put out much effort on that kind of money was like asking a homicide cop to work a weekend to get a purse snatcher but he knew abe and he knew plea theyd both delivered in the past and they might stumble on something if they muddled around in it long enough see if they could pull together anything that might lead to a bigger score after all small amounts of drugs tended to come from bigger shipments and maybe they could work backward but abe was talking all kinds of nonsense that willis couldnt connect to a goddamn thing and finally he had to hold up his hand and interrupt maybe i came in the middle here but arent we talking about this polk thing alphonse page we got a confession right plea opened his eyes and came forward in one motion very smooth thats covered yeah he said so whats all this parkinglot bullshit well there was a guy killed there a week ago plea said then added with a look at glitsky or killed himself uhuh abe said nope willis held up his hand again guys guys we go back a ways right right so look were talking drugs or not whats the connection here the connection is maybe the drop was going to be there willis stared at glitsky wondering if hed heard right this was a veteran he sucked at his front teeth drop drop did you say drop he frowned at plea he said drop didnt he plea concurred willis went back to abe abe my man there aint no drop this isnt like a shipment of brown coming in stuffed in aztec jewelry were talking maybe a couple of bags some condoms full you forgetting what coke looks like i got about fifteen tons down in evidence for that you need a drop for this you meet some guy on a streetcorner and if youre casing it and you blink you miss it its over so fast willis scratched his head sucking at his teeth again these guys were in the business even it killed him drop jesus plea rolled his eyes tried to sound patient dick you dick willis hated when he said that the dissertation was nice but this guy polk it was his first buy maybe he was being careful maybe he was nervous you know glitsky put in his two cents alphonse said there was gonna be a drop thats the word he used alphonse is never ever gonna win the nobel prize in anything but he says polk told him the stuff was out in the bay they were delivering it by boat polk never told alphonse where though now he figures they were coming up the canal and dropping it in cruzs lot what a wizard this wasnt going anywhere so willis cooled himself down look spare me the lot noise do you guys want to plead down if hell talk about his buyer thats the extent of my interest the city employees had some other agenda going but willis wasnt going to get bogged down in it unless you got something on polk himself glitsky stood up walked over to the doorsill and leaned against it looking out plea sighed polk is a wash best we can tell polk died by accident in his hot tub when willis made a face plea shrugged me down the peninsula confirms it so there you go anyway nobody knew anything about his source his wifewe saw her todaykiller by the way he stopped i mean it dick be worth your while to interview her abe turned around scowling bargen he said yeah all right anyway completely oblivious cant believe her husband had anything to do with drugs he was a businessman thats all straight as they come never did drugs himself how old is she willis asked christ glitsky said he walked a few steps out into the corridor plea again rolled his eyes held his hands inverted out over his chest and blew out soundlessly lungs to here a face to die for he raised his voice she wasnt what i call distraught except maybe over the thought that she wouldnt get the money alphonse stole she wont if its drug money she will if its stolen in this jurisdiction it was polks and alphonse admitted taking it from the safe abe came back to the door leaning against it she knew from nothing he said and alphonse didnt know about polks source i mean plea and abe looked at one another no chance willis rubbed his palms against his pants and stood up so its his buy or nothing looks like plea said maybe three four hundred grand these guys couldnt see it peanuts willis said but added quickly upbeat but it might lead someplace no sense pissing them off can i talk to him sure well set it up for tomorrow and well see what we can do willis shook hands with both of them thanks for the tip guys you never know he was out the door about ten seconds when he poked his head back in the polk woman what was her first name nika plea said ill send you the report do it willis said at least he didnt wink dea abe said dont expect anything plea shrugged they got bigger fish to fry abe plunked himself heavily on the corner of pleas desk i dont care what perspective you have half a million dollars isnt peanuts relativity abe relativity its the federal government where a fucking hammer costs a hundred and forty dollars you know their efficiency rate they gotta cover for every gs one through twelve lifer who wouldnt do more than an hours work in a day for any reason on gods earth so they gotta make maybe ten mil on a bust before they justify the overhead thank you mr bargen plea noted the scar tightening through abes lips come on abe whats the problem we got a righteous bust on the linda polk murder we keep getting one a day we end the year only about two hundred behind glitsky twisted his face in what he thought was a smile what about cruz the cochran thing plea shook his head thats a suicideequivocal not a homicide the fuck its not plea held up a hand hey you prove it ill charge it but id never even seen the file before twenty minutes ago i dont make this stuff up you guys tell me what to run with remember he opened the file with a casual hand perused it a second closed it back up nothing here gets me out of the blocks abe if its somewhere else get it for me would you otherwise cruz was there he admits it plea nodded and because of that because youre a good cop and you asked nice we looked into it didnt we in spite of no official finding of homicide didnt we abe didnt answer plea stared at the sergeant maybe he was working too hard he felt sorry for him we got corroboration on the dinner from the waiter cruz himself passed a polygraph his little boyfriend i took the kid apart abeand once he got over being scared all he did was provide an even better alibi he followed cruz all night for chrissakes thought the guy was running around on him couldnt have cared less about cochran just didnt want cruz to get all mad at him because hed been followed bargen paused scratching his scalp plus there is no shred of physical evidence no way we charge him the perfect crime huh maybe but id say he didnt do it he had a motive so did alphonse and he didnt do it either unless you dont believe at least four of your fellow officers who were playing basketball with him all of whom im sure want to protect a sweet and upstanding citizen like alphonse plea sighed and while were on it the last guy with a motive didnt do it either glitsky looked a question and plea said polk his wife had a party that night twenty thirty people polk was there the whole time i hadnt even thought about him plea nodded i know you were too busy with readymade suspects me i took it fresh and polk popped up like a plum but no huh no glitsky went and sat in williss chair whats your hardon for this thing plea asked i dont know once in a while my sense of justice gets offended i guess you ought to have this job theres no justice theres just grinding em through plea em down and move em along yeah i know so why this one he gave it a beat or two this one plea is a murder im a homicide cop that simple huh glitsky seemed to be asking himself the same question his lips tightened again loosened tightened yep he said standing up that simple the kids were asleep he lay with his shoes off on the livingroom couch his head in his wifes lap as she massaged his temples the television was on in the corner but was muted it gave the only light in the room i got my ass reamed frazelli not so gently suggested i just stay off it its griffin s case but i thought youd he shook his head nope not anymore that was when frazelli thought there was new evidence but why pull back now because now my love i have suggested not one not two but three possible suspects to the same killing within a twelvehour period it doesnt do much for my credibility especially since two of them definitely didnt do it and theres no evidence at all with the third are you sure it was a murder she moved from his temples to the forehead smoothing the crinkled brow back with the palm of her hand feels so good he said hed been awake since whatever time this morning i dont know maybe its hardy is he sure hes dead positive now i just got to wonder heres a guy was good you know good just a beat cop but he had a feel for it hell you knew him then he goes into law and suddenly burns out anyway he lays low for maybe what six eight years and now he swings back in action you got to ask yourself what for he doesnt think hes jerking himself off ill tell you that but maybe hes just wrong maybe he wants to believe it so bad hes making it true for himself maybe abe said all i know is im off it im still interested but im off it and you told him that he closed his eyes under her soothing hands yeah i told him he comes to me with a signed confession ill be delighted then ill go shove it upsorry all worked up just forget griffin tonight forget all that stuff theyre not out to get you cause youre black im only half black okay theyre still not out to get you he looked up into her face thats what you think im not allowed the luxury of being wrong she leaned down and kissed his forehead paranoid dont mean theyre not after me she smiled and continued with the massage her white hands seeming to shine in the dim room against the dark skin of her husband chapter thirty the first message on his machine said dismas jim cavanaugh just calling to find out how it all turned out see if youd like to have a drink give me a call when you can thank you the second was from jane im just thinking about you maybe thursday instead of friday maybe tonight the last was from moses who wanted to know how he was getting along and when and if he was coming back to work hardy threw darts while he listened to the messages his aim was off not that he ever missed the general pie he was half going for but occasionally hed miss his number two out of three it didnt bother him he was only throwing to be doing something if he kept hard liquor in his house hed be drinking too wired to sleep he threw darts after a while he went around to his desk two of his three tungsten darts embedded in the i to the left of the last one stuck in the to its right hed missed for two whole rounds something he hadnt done in five years he rewound his machine since he didnt have hard liquor at home hed go and have some in a bar it wasnt all that late and cavanaugh had offered he didnt want to go to the shamrock and have to answer questions from moses about his progress he got to the number switched off the machine wrote it down and dialed a womans voice answered st elizabeths hello is father cavanaugh in just a moment ill get him can i tell him whos calling when hardy told her she paused then said did father tell you oh id better let him tell you cavanaugh now at the phone dismas good of you to call okay im curious what were you going to tell me when your housekeeper just now asked me if youd told me something then said youd better tell me the priest paused chuckled tolerantly i dont know tell the truth ill have to ask her hows your case coming thats kind of why i hoped you had something for me there isnt any case anymore its gone south there was a longish pause what do you mean you mentioned a drink and i could use one can i meet you somewhere tell you all about it then you want to come over here cavanaugh asked anywheres fine no forget here we might keep someone up you name it cavanaugh took a minute then named a fern bar on irving about midway between them hardy knew the place he could get there in ten minutes these drugs were funny one minute itd be as though you were deadno dreams no memory of sleep even and then bingo you were wide awake then you had somewhere between a half hour and an hour before the pain got you again the foot was the worst it felt as though it was continually being crushed in a car door steven had done that the summer before with his thumb he couldnt believe the next day how bad it had felt it had affected his whole body with a headache and throwing up and everything hed lost the nail but that was nothing next to now when the painkiller wore off he had tried toughing it out this afternoon he hadnt wanted to sleep anymore there were too many things to think about eddie and the investigation but it hadnt worked the foot had been the worst but he was already beginning to feel his collarbone and his head was throbbing he hadnt been able to keep the tears back when mom had come in it was just from the pain the water forming in his eyes and falling out over his cheeks the bad thing about the painkiller was you woke up so thirsty every time which made you drink a lot of water which then meant you had to pee like crazy and since you couldnt move that meant mom had to come in with the bedpan you think cryings embarrassing try a bedpan but this night it was pop he took care of it with a minimum of hassle then poured a glass of water from the pitcher on the table by the bed and sat down right up next to him hip to hip he reached out his rough hand and touched stevens forehead where it wasnt bandaged very businesslike he nodded to himself so hows my boy okay that was always the answer now pop would say good and go out to the garage and do something but instead he said really really okay steven blinked a couple of times and his dad continued cause thatd make you the only one well you know steven said no i dont thats why im asking there was a small light on by the door and another out in the hallway but steven could tell it was pretty late everybody else was probably asleep his dad loomed up in front of him blocking out most of everything else no wonder they called him big ed steven had no idea how to answer i dont know not great i guess me neither just general steven tried to shrug but wound up making a face shrugging with a broken collarbone wasnt recommended you know eddie i guess mostly mom a little big ed lifted a leg onto the bed and shifted to face him more you know he said i cant say a damn thing he put his hand out resting it heavily on stevens chest and just sat there what do you want to say i really dont even know that well that was okay but it got uncomfortable steven to say something asked for another sip of water hows the pain big ed asked you need some more pills no okay youre the boss the room got blurred up slightly he leaned his head back against the pillow whats in those things the pills i mean ed picked up the little brown plastic bottle he said its called percodan extremely addictive use only under the direction of a physician well were doing that steven said i dont think im addicted i really dont want it except for the pain it makes me too tired ed put the bottle back down well thats what its for he shifted again on the bed as though he were thinking about getting up but this was one of the longest conversations steven had ever had with him and he wanted to keep him there without being too nerdy about it you know drugs arent that cool he said then blurted ahead i smoked some weed with the guys that beat me up his dad simply nodded taking it in howd you like it youre not mad ill get mad later right now im still just glad youre alive you mind if i have some of your water he poured half a glass and downed it in a gulp the pitchers almost empty he said he got up blocking the light from the door as he passed through it and left steven alone he heard a clock ticking somewhere then some water running in the bathroom down the hall he looked around the dark room at the rockandroll posters suddenly he didnt like them very much they seemed kind of phony and stupid they were one of the few things he and eddie hadnt agreed on but steven had always felt that he had to have something that set him apart at home so theyd know he was alive his father returned with the pitcher filled up and sat back down where hed been on the side of the bed stevens foot was beginning to throb slightly you want to do me a favor his dad asked sure you want to try those things try em at home i dont think i but big ed interrupted look theres going to be lots of things like marijuana beer for example or maybe cigarettes or cigars or something although god forbid you get into that sex steven almost jumped at the word sex no dont bring that home was pop grinning at him like they were friends saying this stuff out loud to him it blew him away but the other stuff you want to experiment even with some other guys you bring em around and go out to the garage and check it out but do it here okay so we can be sure youre all right youd let me smoke weed i wouldnt be too thrilled about it i wouldnt want it to become a habit but it probably wouldnt kill you it didnt last weekend did it almost steven hung his chin down to the cast but big ed lifted his head with a finger youre gonna do things we dont like hell im sure we do things you hate but were living together here and everybody cuts everybody else a little slack so we can get along the main thing is were a family we stick together sound like a deal he punched him lightly under the chin that hurt a little jerking the collarbone around but obviously big ed hadnt meant it and steven would take a lot more physical pain than that if his dad would talk to him like this once in a while but what about mom steven asked what about her what if she doesnt uh want to let me do stuff or even want me around ed slumped his face clouded over of course your mother wants you around steven tried a response but it didnt work big ed sighed deeply your mother is having a hard time steven were all having a hard time you dont think i wish eddie were still here no i know you do its not that its just your mother shes she wishes it would have been me instead of eddie ed shook his head no she doesnt not on any level she loves you too just like she loved eddie there wasnt any use arguing over that one shes just having a hard time accepting it her worlds all turned around and maybe shed doesnt know where to put things so well for a while havent you ever felt like that he nodded so what i was saying about giving people some slack maybe youve gotta be the first one try and understand what shes going through if you can i know what shes going through i miss eddie too so bad big ed took a deep breath he swallowed then jerked his head around toward the hallway still looking away he spoke hoarsely were all taking it differently i suppose stevens foot was really hurting now he kept forgetting how bad it was and hoping every time that it would let up the next time the pills wore off but that wasnt happening yet he let a long time go by or what seemed a long time with his dad staring off somewhere breathing hard every couple of seconds then he said pop big ed slowly came back around i think i need one of those pills pretty soon im sorry nothing to be sorry about yeah there is pop there really is his dad reached for the medicine bottle opened it and shook out two pills well lets start fresh then weve got a hell of a family left here okay he popped the pills and drank a little of the water maybe frannies kid will make up for eddie a little mom might like that big ed jerked again as though hed been stung frannies kid what do you mean frannies kid it frightened him ed almost yelling like that you know the kid frannies gonna have her and eddies kid frannies pregnant he strained to remember who had told him that damn the pills were working gangbusters already his eyelids were lead was it jodie he was sure it wasnt mom no it wasnt her maybe frannie while shed been staying here he couldnt put his finger on the exact time he found out i dont know he said lamely maybe i just dreamed it i dont remember but he knew he hadnt been dreaming at all he couldnt recall even a scene from one dream big ed seemed to calm down he put his palm flat against stevens forehead again its okay he said it doesnt matter well find out about that tomorrow he felt his dads bulk get up from the bed big eds hand went through his hair surprisingly gentle and he felt a kiss on his forehead maybe pop did love him and if he could only do something so mom might think he was okay they could all live together maybe someday be happy again but it was getting harder almost impossible to keep thinking he was sure frannie was pregnant but if jodie and mom and frannie hadnt told him who had the only other people hed talked to had been father jim last night and that guy hardy today and how would either of them know frannie would definitely have told mom first wouldnt she the light faded then was out completely he forced his lids apart and there was eddie standing in front of one of his posters just looking down at him smiling he went to reach out to him but then he was asleep hardy slouched over the table was looking into the priests face perhaps a foot from his something was there still unsaid after a lot of talking and the idea kept popping up between them like an insistent panhandler checking out the pickings at the latenight tables in nearempty bars cavanaugh looked down through his irish hardy thinking he might be trying to stare right through the table with his xray eyes theyd been talking and drinking starting with light stuff and getting heavier as things wore on for the better part of three hours cavanaugh kept going in and out of focus maybe anybody can do anything hardy said you give em enough juice anybodyanything cavanaugh repeated not a priest but ha the things i know priests have done you wouldnt believe i probably would high school there were some guys like springs they were so wound up id hate to see what would happen if they let go hardy and cavanaugh slowing down just a couple of guys finishing their drinks closing a place half hearing each other half listening to billy joel doing piano man that old barcloser you know what an incredible pain in the ass it is being a priest sometimes that old turn the other cheek both my cheeks are callused turning them back and forth yeah but you do it anyway you keep doing it what im talking about is guys who snap zinc buildup or whatever sex you mean hardy nodded sex is easy i mean at least its tangible or understandable you either get the physical release somehow or you as we say offer it up but either way its out there and you can deal with it you saying sex doesnt bother you guys what do you think we cut our nuts off im just saying that its not always the hardest thing he grabbed at his glass swirled the ice and drained it as if by magic hardy thought the waitress came around for last call cavanaugh ordered the round give us a couple doubles hardy didnt fight it it was getdown time for him too that old since weve already passed propriety time lets hang it out and see where it goes theres just no release ever cavanaugh was saying its not a job where some guy goes to work and gets off at five and then gets drunk or fights somebody its like you can never everhe stabbed at the tableever do anything that really lets the valve loose thats the hardest part hey jim thats just adulthood who ever really gets to blow it out anymore and you think youve got it tough try being a cop cavanaugh shook his head the girl came back with the drinks priests can make cops look like boy scouts hardy paid for the round cops cant let out a thing jim they gotta keep it in control yeah but they also let out a lot you get the adrenaline pumped up pretty good and youre allowedhell youre supposedto do something direct it to something shoot a guy make an arrest get in somebodys way i mean theres something there you dont go walking offmr mellowand read your breviary hardy took a good swig of his own irish cops dont let out near enough hardy said defensive why you think you got drinking cops you got cops on drugs you got just plain mean motherfuckers what im saying is just multiply that by about twenty for priests thats bullshit it isnt maybe thats where the sex comes in your cop at least has that option so why do you do it why do you guys keep at it cavanaugh drank again i dont know sometimes i dont know at all you believe in the theory i guess you believe that the suffering is worth it you believe in god you had better do that you sin and you sin and you sin again and you keep thinking maybe its going to get easier someday and you wont have to feel like breaking out so often that maybe gods gonna give you a break take a doctor with a headache he knows fifty ways it can be terminal you its a headache itll probably go away a doctor knows it could be a tumor cancer the beginning of a stroke or whatever same with priests we cant even allow ourselves to think were going to be okay if we do thats pride the numberone sin but if i think im a totally worthless piece of shit then thats false modesty another sin everythings a sin dismas and if its not its a near occasion being a little loaded right nowsure its a release but its also one of the seven deadlies drunkenness theres no escape ever he concluded reaching for his glass again putting down half of what remained none ever hardy sat back shaking his head all this from the perfect priest who thinks that erin cochran cavanaugh sucked in a breath what does she know one would think she knows you cavanaugh sighed shes gods reminder to me that im not perfectible much less perfect whats that mean it means youd think after twenty thirty years the old spell she throws would wear out he started to lift his glass then put it back down carefully as though afraid he might break it somehow maybe squeezing it too hard sometimes i still i think ive been in love with her since the day i met her and i wasnt close to being a priest back then hardy wanted to ask but cavanaugh answered before he could get it out you dont think i havent wanted to make love with her like any other man hardy lifted his own glass and took a drink he thought about jane about getting back with her their hurried and aching coupling after the years apart he said that must be very tough the priest made some noise like a laugh but he wasnt laughing they say love and hate are so close sometimes i dont know i hate her i hate em all and there he was unbidden that old panhandler again reaching out his hand hardy looked at the hand a minute then flipped a quarter that fell into the middle of his palm yeah ive been tempted to wipe out all the happiness i see there why should they get it all you think that seems fair he stared at hardy not seeing him looking inside himself there was a moment god help me when i was almost happy about it about eddie being dead let them feel what its like to have things go wrong to have your love lost the sum of your life reduced to zero erin thinks im perfect huh not close dismas not even close if i could feel like that even for a second when the boy was like my son my only son he put a hand up to his face going back to the cochrans burying eddiehe shook his head againafter feeling that as a penance you believe in a good god you believe youre doing something worthwhile that being around someone you love denying it is strengthening you making you a better priest a better person your reward is in heaven after all he tipped up his glass you go back you keep going back its like the old augustine monks who slept in the same bed with their women every night to test their celibacy the roots go way back deny conquer deny again sin conquer it again thats the road to salvation right aint it a piece of cake hardy sat in the lengthening silence sipping at his drink shaken somewhere even through the booze cavanaugh was in such obvious pain he couldnt believe hed been blind to it before hey hardy said lets quit bullshitting around and talk about something we really care about gradually cavanaughs face softened he laughed quietly youre okay dismas youre not so bad yourself jim another pause then cavanaugh saying so how bout them giants huh humm baby hardy said hardy switched on the light in his hallway shivering slightly from driving home with the windows open in the light fog he hadnt worn a jacket on the way home really cold with the seppukus top down hed bounced along singing a dirty country song about rodeos a good song kept up his good mood imagine feeling that a priest could be a regular friend of his maybe even a close one it was surprising the charge hardy got out of cavanaughs company jims conversation was a soup a stew a goulash of politics sports and what he called the cheap ms of popular culturemusic and moviesall seasonedpeppered more like itwith roughly equal parts vulgarity and poetry like who else but cavanaugh would have known off the top of his head that linda polk wasnt couldnt have been descended from james k polk eleventh president of the united states because polk had been childless he was also fun to hang with because you met a lot of women though the guy had to be close to sixty he had three times hardys hair and all of it looked better while they talked and drank cavanaugh in some baggy khakis and a loose blousy lightgreen thing with an open neck three women had joked with them butting in leaving openings you could drive a truck through but hed closed the door on them all with a practiced grace that told hardy this happened all the time another reason they probably got along he told himself was that they still had eddie cochran in common except for jane it was pretty much the only thing on hardys mind and once hed started talking cavanaugh had seemed as obsessed with it as hardy was himself it didnt get boringat least going over it with jim who still leaned toward the late sam polk as the murderer even after hardy said that hed been visible that whole night at a party his wife had thrown that was the bitch of the whole thingnone of the suspects could have done it unless one of them had at least one accomplice and there was no indication of that at all back in his office undressed for bed hardy saw the three darts stuck on either side of the about five drinks and one double unsteady which he thought wasnt very he pulled them from the board and went back to the line in front of his desk he took a deep breath and held it then let it out slowly he shook his head once quickly then let fly the first dart nodded as it plocked into the okay he said one thing was certainneither he nor cavanaugh accepted eds death as a suicide although jims feeling seemed to be more visceral than hardys to hardy even forgetting the suspects and their alibis the facts simply didnt support that finding with jim it was more an article of faith eddie cochran wouldnt have done itnot that way not any way hardys second dart hit the tiny slice of triple a good shot by any standards he put the last dart down on the desk tonight for a change of pace hed quit winners the wooden chair was cold against the skin of his butt and back but he forced himself down into it there were scraps of paper on the deskdribs and drabs of ideas hed entertained over the last week or so and he wanted to clear the decks for the morning he was damned glad he hadnt seen moses this afternoon he probably wouldnt have been able to have stopped himself from bragging that the case was solved which it pretty emphatically was not suddenly the drinkandtalkinspired euphoria faded hardy looked at the scraps of paper in his hand and wondered what the hell any of them meant fancy theories and clever words absently he reached over to his phone machine he wanted to hear janes voice again and he didnt think hed erased the messages the last thing had been jims phone number there it was in fact on one of the pieces of paper he flicked the machine thank you he heard the end of jims earlier message then janes voice again im just thinking about but then he stopped listening something jangled deep in his brain and the hairs on his arms and legs stood up over the chicken flesh he switched the machine back to reverse thank you he closed his eyes rewound again listened thank you he played it over in his mind hearing it fresh son of a bitch he said he had put the police tape into the drawer down to his right he held his breath irrationally terrified that it wouldnt be there anymore but it was he spun around on the chair and carefully placed the tape into the machine it was short enough there is a body in the parking lot of the cruz publishing company a tiny strained pause perhaps trying to think of something to add nope then just thank you back at his desk he lifted the phone machine and brought it over next to the tape recorder he played the two thank yous one after the other first one then the other both ways cavanaughs message of earlier that night the formal cultured unaccented voice without a personality a smile an attitude to color it put it together diz he said to himself thats why the call had come from halfway across the city cavanaugh had been driving home or took a bus or a cab or got home and went out again not wanting to call from the rectory and maybe not knowing they had automatic tracing on calls he played the police tape another time hearing the voice hed been listening to most of the night the voice that had been telling him more than hed been hearing jesus there was a safe in the room where he kept some papers and his guns he opened it took both tapes from their machines and put them inside closing it then and spinning the combination going back to his bedroom he picked up the last dart he put his weight on his left foot feeling the tape with his toes double bulls eye he said out loud he threw the dart sure enough chapter thirtyone dominus he began his arms spread wide immediately he caught himself the lord be with you slipping back into latin his mind must really be miles away raising his eyes to the tiny congregation he realized that no one not even the altar boys had noticed the slip he had to concentrate he was after all saying a mass and even a sinful priest loses none of his powers believing otherwise was formal heresy but it was difficult to pay attention he had the altar boy pour quite a lot of wine into the chalice hoping a little hair of the dog would help the nagging headache still he knew it wasnt his throbbing temples that were distracting him he had so hoped it wouldnt come to this but last night with dismas it was pretty clear that the police werent going to be satisfied with their suspects and that meant the search was still on if there was no new evidence though they would be forced to leave it a suicide or give up and his horrible mistake would never be known and he couldnt let it be known ever it would do irreparable harm to the church to say nothing of the further pain it would cause all those close to him all right hed made his peace with god now hed confessed and that ought to be the end of it until he went before st peter could god forgive him he had to believe he could could he ever forgive himself no he knew that now killing eddie had been far far beyond the worst peccadilloes hed indulged in over the years to ease the terrible burden of living a holy life the unending boredom of sinlessness he thought hed grown inured to the twinges of conscience that the occasional sin the moments of temporary weakness had driven him to but killing eddie had been if there was such a thing unforgivable when eddie had come to the rectory that nighterins first son the son they should have had togetherwith that special fire that only he possessed and told him he and frannie were going to have a baby he finally could stand it no longer how did one boy deserve all he had been given surely he jim cavanaugh who had spent his whole life denying denying being denied should have been given a chance one brief moment for this boys happiness but that had never happened and now the son of the love of his lifegod forgive him but it was truenow eddie would have it all everything he had ever really wanted and now clearly would never have it was too much to bear he couldnt let him have it couldnt let the privileged happiness go on for still another generation so that night with eddies newfound strength and hope and confidence he had suggested since he was planning to meet cruz anyway that he go down with him bring the whole weight of the moral argument to bear surely two such charming persuasive wonderful people could not help but succeed in the heady flush of expectant fatherhood eddie had lapped up those oily words believing as only he could that everything was possible and jim cavanaugh was convincing wasnt he eddie could save army save polk from himself save the whole goddamn world why shouldnt he feel that he was young strong his manhood verified he eddie cochran could do it all yes it had just been too much to take but now now living with it cavanaugh could see that the light even the dim reflected light hed lived for had gone from erin s eyes still he had to believe that god had forgiven him though it was beyond his power to fathom such forgiveness he would have to put his faith in the lord the greatest sin after all was despair despair that god would abandon any even the most unworthy of his sheep despair was loss of hope a graver sin even than murder that was what he was fighting now the temptation to despair because he knew he had to kill again he was walking out to the garage with dietrick the sun bright in a deepblue sky are you really worried about her the young priest asked cavanaugh shook his head ever sincehe stoppedthe cochran boyeddiedied you havent noticed the change dietrick stopped halfway across the asphalt trying to remember i guess i take rose too much for granted another of my failings cavanaugh laid a gentle arm on dietricks arm she confides in me thats all its no reflection on you still i thinkcavanaugh paused wanting to phrase it righti think my reaction to eddies death taking it so hard dietrick started to interrupt but cavanaugh pressed on no i know its understandable but maybe i should have hidden it from her a little better it got rose thinking about her her own loneliness i guess her husband all that shes missed over the years they were walking again you think its serious dietrick asked i think its very serious he answered quickly but then he brought himself up short i dont mean to panic you i dont know she was up when i got in late a few times the past week couldnt sleep sometimes thats an indication they got to the garage dietrick had parked his car beside it not wanting to cram his new honda into the smallish space next to cavanaughs should we get her some help do you think beyond ourselves i mean i think its worth thinking about she hides it well but i believe she really has been very depressed dietrick got in the car and rolled the window down thinking about it i ought to pay more attention its good you noticed jim cavanaugh waved it off ive got to be out all this morning but maybe this afternoon when you get back definitely well get her straightened out cavanaugh waited a minute standing by the garage watching the car disappear around the front of the rectory all right he thought dietrick was convinced he was reasonably sure that rose has been badly depressed lately would swear to it on a stack of bibles bless father always thinking of others rose thought father dietrick had gone down to the airport to pick up one of the maryknoll missionaries who would be spending the rest of the week at the rectory and preaching next sunday father cavanaugh after saying early mass and having breakfast had of course offered to make the drive himself to the airport he always offered and he would have done it too but the younger priest thought it was his duty after theyd said goodbye to father dietrick hed given her his devilmaycare grin and said well rose mdear what are your plans on this fine day naturally he knew that shed have to get the rectory especially clean for their guest so he was teasing and she told him so now rose have you made the bed of course father and youve dusted and swept yes but theres still the flowers and towels to lay out and he held up a hand have you any idea what a treasure you are he asked she felt herself flushing look at this day gods glory shines down on us it is nice she said wishing she could string together a flowery phrase as he did so effortlessly and knowing she never could its more than nice he said here ive been drowning in depression taking no advantage of these precious days of sunshine when the talmud tells us that man shall be called to account for every permitted pleasure he failed to enjoy do i want to be called to account for that the father was such a caution he wouldnt be called to account for anything she smiled at him no father certainly not then how about if we go on a picnic together and celebrate this day youve done enough for our guests room im sure hell be very happy she tried to object but he overrode her rose the mans been living in a hut with no floor in western brazil for three years i think our guest room will be fine what about the fathers lunches she asked although a picnic sounded like her idea of heaven father rolled his eyes as he sometimes did too polite to laugh at her well write a note he said theyll make do im sure so now the sandwiches were mademortadella and swiss with the hot peppers father liked on fresh sourdough rolls she made two for him and one for herself though she didnt think she could eat the whole thing she put several dills in a big ziplock bag with some of the brine and there was leftover potato salad in the fridge theyd pick up some cold beer for father on the way out to the parkthats where he thought theyd go rowing out on stow lakeand a soft drink for herself through the kitchen window she saw father coming from the garage far out across the asphalt at the back edge of the wide parking lot he still walked heavily as though he carried the cares of the world with him on his shoulders and in a sense she thought he probably did the picnic would do him good would get his mind off the cochrans and the sadness of the past couple of weeks and she wouldnt be an old stickinthemud either she could tease him along and get him laughing and thats what he needed nowa dose of the carefree a couple of beers a day in the sunshine she turned back to pack the basket so howre we coming lord he had come in so quietly it startled her im sorry rose did i scare you she was too jumpy turning into an old woman well today she wouldnt beit wouldnt be fair to father and that was that you never mind me she said can you think of anything else he raised his eyebrows in anticipation going over the items in the basket then remembering something he snapped his fingers the note rose opened the drawer nearest the sink and got out her yellow pad but father shook his head lets use some real paper he winked at her give our guest the right impression with that he disappeared back into the house reappearing a moment later rubbing his eyes rose ive got something in my eye would you mind writing it ill dictate rose sat at the table taking the nice piece of white bond that father offered fathers he said and she began writing in her big round hand im sorry ill miss you rose and i are going on a hot date father she said clucking with pleasure well be back in time for dinner he continued but youll have to make do for lunch father paul welcome to san francisco he looked over her shoulder perfect rose now just let me sign it he took the pen and quickly scribbled his name at the bottom it was an old twocar garage in the seventies theyd put up drywall redone the old pockmarked benches and insulated the roof since kids from the school had taken to using the garage as a place to sneak cigarettes and who knew what else they had replaced the old side door with a new solid one that locked with a deadbolt they had never gone for the electric garagedoor opener cavanaugh had joked that he couldnt see jesus using it but now the old garage door while sealing completely enough when it was closed sagged badly when it was open and occasionally would slam of its own accord after being opened because of its weakened springs father and rose strolled out across the parking lot on the other side of the school building children were laughing they could hear them in their next to last day of school taking their morning recess and father flashed rose the slightly guilty smile of a kid playing hooky he carried the basket and opened the car door for rose whew he said fanning himself with his hand a little sticky isnt it he crossed behind the car and got in the drivers seat lets get some air in here he rolled down all the cars windows with the automatic button all right he said and smiled across at his housekeeper ready he turned on the engine oh look at that would you he wheeled halfway around in his seat whats that father look at the sag on that door oh its always that way i know but id just hate to have it come down on the cars roof while were pulling out he pulled the keys from the ignition leaving the car running let me just make sure he went outside behind the car and pulled on the door letting it slam to the ground the springs resonated inside he lifted the door slightly slamming it down again and again as the springs rang out he threw the bolt that locked the door then pulled against it a couple of times for the effect rose he called out yes father the door seems to be stuck are you all right yes im fine all right now just dont panic ive got the keys to the deadbolt just back in the rectory and ill be right back he turned and began walking slowly across the parking lot recess had ended the kids were back in class father had said not to panic and shed resolved she was not going to be an old woman not today when father so badly needed some surcease from his cares still it was a little scary sitting here in the darkened garage the cars motor running but she would not panic there was nothing to do anyway except wait and father would be back within a couple of minutes she knew where the deadbolt key was hanging by the back door of the rectory it shouldnt take him long well it must seem like its taking longer than it should because im jumpy she thought she talked out loud to herself just calm down rose father said not to panic she forced herself to take deep breaths there that was better big deep breaths she was getting so calm it was almost silly she supposed she should be worried a little but there was no need to worry father would be back in just another second and theyd go on their picnic it would be a wonderful day one they both needed she closed her eyes he really hadnt any choice with the other suspects eliminated he couldnt have taken the risk that she would have mentioned monday night to anyone she was the only one who could tie him in any way to eddies death and now orhe looked at his watch certainly within another ten minutes in the kitchen he took the note she had written and carefully tore the paper so that it broke off after her name he put a period after the word sorry the note now read fathers im sorry im going to miss you rose it would do he walked back to the library and placed the note on father dietricks chair in the bathroom he touched a match to the rest of the note held it for as long as he could while he watched the good bond curl into black ash as the name neared his fingers he let go of the corner he held and flushed the toilet he waited when the toilet had finished he wiped down the bowl with toilet paper and flushed it again hed had to think fast when rose had pulled out the yellow pad it wouldnt do to have secondary impressions of the note for someone to notice the bond had been just the right answer there was a slight smell of smoke in the room and he opened the bathroom window to get rid of it he looked at his watch it had only been twelve minutes rose was probably still alive it was important to establish his whereabouts and his calm he did not feel like a man who was in the process of killing someone he went out the side door of the rectory crossed in front of the church and entered the school in the office the principals secretary an indian woman named mrs ranji stood up to greet him he told her his usual joke and said he had just come by to see if there were any last details about the upcoming graduation he needed to know and if there were any to have sister give him a call sitting at sisters desk he proceeded to look over some correspondence then asked mrs ranji when the next period ended she looked at the clock good fifteen minutes no that was too long to wait he would check back with sister later he hummed loudly as he walked out twentysix minutes had passed he went to the garage and opened the deadbolt held his breath and walked in he flipped on the light at the switch by the door rose was still sitting up propped by the door looking like she was sleeping moving quickly now he took the picnic basket from behind the drivers seat he was running out of breath outside again with the basket he stopped by the door relocked it and looked back toward the school then at the rectory no sign of anybody he crossed the lot three sandwiches one for him one for dietrick and one for father paul he unwrapped them and put them on a plate in the refrigerator it was plausible in character rose planning to kill herself might just have made sure she made lunch for the fathers first he put the pickles back in the jar washed out the ziplock bag and threw it in the garbage scooped the potato salad back into the rest of it breathing hard now his nerves speaking he once again began crossing the parking lot about twothirds of the way across he called out roses name he started running toward the garage and in what would look like a panic threw back the bolt the picture of a man making a horrifying discovery rose he called again dont forget to put the keys back in the ignition he had to do that in any event to turn the car off which is what he would do a final survey of the scene he put his hand on roses stillwarm forehead she had died peacefullyhe was glad of that he made the sign of the cross over her giving her his blessing last rites of sorts then he started jogging back to the house he was surprised to find he was crying but he didnt try to stop himself that was all right why shouldnt he cry and it would ring very true to the folks at chapter thirtytwo steven believed his mom was really trying after dad and jodie had left the house she came in and talked or tried to talk for a while after shed gone back out to her housework or whatever he wondered what kind of teenager shed been if she had ever done anything like run away it was the first time hed thought of anything like that and so it was a little hard to imaginemom screaming for elvis presley as she said shed done or dating anybody but pop well whatever shed done he was pretty sure it didnt prepare her for him she didnt seem to be able to find a handle to grab on to although frannies pregnancy was as close as shed gotten in a long while she sat on the bed much the way pop had done last night he felt a little stronger and had managed a decent breakfast she ran her hand through his spiky hair and asked him how he knew about frannie its true isnt it he asked she shook her head i didnt want to call her yet shell tell us when she wants to why wouldnt she want to his moms face clouded as though trying to decide whether to tell him one of the adult secrets as usual she came down saying no i dont know she did say there are reasons it might just be too soon but how did you find out hed thought about it this morning after he woke up it had been hardy yesterday he was telling him about father jim and about his pride how he had kind of blamed himself for eddies death because of talking eddie into confronting his boss which was dumb eddie was going to do that anyway hed told steven all about it the day before anyway once he got into it hardy was good at sounding like different people and he did father jim pretty well of course he had an easy voicekind of regular but the words he used in a certain way that hardy caught the rhythm exactly he spent a lot of time talking about father jim even though he didnt really have any part of it but father jim was like thathe caught your attention anyway hardy was doing father and he said i sent eddie off to slay the dragon do i think about his pregnant wife whether hes the man for the job no not the smart jim cavanaugh that part sounded perfect and steven had laughed i only see what a wonderful notion it is then he goes my pride killed him but in therethats where hed heard about frannie it had been like hardy was telling him part of another story not really telling him he tried to explain that to his mom who wondered why hardy hadnt told her she put her hand up to her brow and said god he could see that shed started thinking about frannie now or eddie again her eyes were gone out to the backyard staring at nothing mom he was going to say something like its all right or im going to help though he knew it wasnt and wasnt sure how he could she looked back to him smiling with her mouth so instead he asked if it was too early to have another pill hed just have to go ahead and do it whatever it turned out to be make his mom see he wasnt going to be any more trouble hed have to do something that would help them all get over this maybe forgive him for running away and making them deal with him when eddienaturallywas the hardest most immediate thing hed do something on his own something worthwhile adult maybe then his mom would appreciate him love him next time she came in was only a couple of minutes later but he was sailing into oblivion pretty fast and almost couldnt answer when she talked to him though she did come in and tell him about the call thats what he was starting to see she was trying steven not faking at all he had to use most of his strength to open an eye that was mr hardy on the phone he hadnt even heard it ring and it was right there next to his bed he says yes frannies pregnant maybe hell look like eddie he meant it as a good thought but he saw when he said it that it kind of hurt her she leaned against the doorsill then walked the few steps over and plumped herself down on his bed again i hope so she said it was like she was forcing herself to talk he alsoshe stopped and rubbed at her eyeshe also said that neither one of the suspects killed eddie he didnt think anything could pull him out of the haze the pills created but that almost did suddenly he was nearly awake how could that be she hunched down over her shoulders they were all someplace else i guess then he heard her say i guess eddie didnt love us that much as much as we thought what do you mean mom i mean if he killed himself he didnt kill himself i know he didnt she had that blank look again that empty stare she tousled his hair and kissed him on the forehead you try to get some sleep she got up and turned to the door mom she stopped and faced him he didnt okay she said nodding her head okay it came to him thats what hed do hed find out who had killed eddie never mind hardy or the cops they were obviously dildoes who didnt know eddie the way he had known him hed find out the truth all on his own and then his mom at least would know eddie hadnt deserted him that might get her started back to being alive hardy hung up and shook his head he hadnt called erin to talk about frannies pregnancy and he was mad at himself for having let that out to steven how had he been so careless and at the same time so obtuse no wonder hed blocked it out for so long cavanaugh had referred to frannie as pregnant and even after mimicking his damned voice to steven hardy hadnt put it together the point was how could cavanaugh have known about the pregnancy if he hadnt seen eddie after frannie had told him which was the night hed been killed which meant hed lied about seeing him sunday it had been monday he closed his eyes really pumping now hed only slept five hours but it didnt matter things were falling into place the gun had bothered him a lot and hed stood in front of his desk from dawn until about an hour ago drinking two full pots of espresso and throwing darts until it had come to him the gun drive sixties liberal mania cavanaugh had collected some hundreds of unregistered guns and what hed done of course was to hold out on one or two of them and the cops who were monitoring the thingeven the good ones like abewould never think that a priest would use a cleanthestreets gun drive to build his own arsenal i mean why would it occur to anyone to check that but hardy was now certain it was what cavanaugh had done what hed called erin for was to ask her the exact date she and ed had gotten married that was a little bit of a wild hair he knew but it might tie in with something else that had occurred to him something he needed to go back and check out before he went to see glitsky if theyd already burned up three suspects hed better have the next one the real one trussed up and ready to carve glitsky might have been hot to get whoeverd done eddie but he would be a fool to risk his career on another hunch of a civilian now hardy felt he owed him the collar for all the help hed given him but he knew hed have to do it all then call for the troops he had the two tapes in a heavy yellow envelope he didnt know if he could get anybody to do voiceprint comparisons on them or what it would cost to do them himself but he did know that if there was going to be a trial they would be good evidence in fact they were the first pieces of hard evidence he had come upon but you never knew he might get lucky with some technician so he had decided to take them downtown hed stop by the hall of justice after his visit to the chronicle glitsky himself might still be interested enough to do it on the sly he folded the piece of paperthe one with eds and erins wedding dateand put it in his wallet he was tempted to call cavanaugh put the fearif not of godof man into him and see what hed do but no build a case and blindside him that was the way cavanaugh would have no idea that the noose was tightening especially after spending last night drinking with him god he was one confident man he must think he was clear he must also think his friend hardy was a bit of a fool well he had always said he might be dumb but wasnt a fool cavanaugh playing him for one made him unhappy he was out of his chair and heading for the door when he stopped he had three guns in his safe but what after all was he planning to do with a gun he was off to do a little research he wasnt planning to confront cavanaugh on the other hand he walked back toward the safe for a twodollar fee anybody could go into the archives room of the san francisco chronicle and look up microfiche of newspapers from any date since the newspaper was founded in hardy was interested in the week of july driving downtown his police special now loaded and stowed in the glove box of his seppuku he spent a few minutes worrying about the whatifs what if there was nothing in the newspaper what if glitsky wasnt in what if nobody at the hall was willing to let him look up the past incident reports he turned on the radio it was still broken which wasnt surprising since hed done nothing to fix it he wanted to listen to anything to get the other song out of his head it was an old conway twitty tune called this time i hurt her more than she loves me and it had been number one on the hardy brain parade for two days now well he thought the hell with the radio he went back to the whatifs what if i get in a car wreck what if a meteor plunges from deep in outer space and punches me half a mile into the ground he had to laugh at himself in the chronicle archives room he put the whatifs out of his mind and now was glad hed wasted no more time on them he wouldnt have to go see glitsky about this or wade through the hard copies of some faded and musty irs there it was on page of the first section for monday july it wasnt a big article most other bigcity newspapers might not even carry it but it was one of the advantages of the chronicles parochial view of what news wasthey covered the city pretty well the article read call girl found slain in nob hill apartment the body of a call girl who had been strangled was discovered late yesterday evening in her posh taylor street apartment after the woman failed to report back to the escort service for which she worked the victim yearold traci wagner had been employed by the babydolls dating service for approximately six months police are seeking for questioning a white male in his early to midtwenties who picked up miss wagner in a dark latemodel car in the midafternoon the suspect gave his name as john crane but this appears to have been fictitious the investigation is continuing hardy went to the desk with the spool of film and asked the clerk to copy the page for him that cost him another five dollars but it would be worth that to have for glitsky john crane huh jim cavanaugh funny about those initials he thought same as jesus christ you got squat glitsky wasnt feeling patient and i simply cannot take the risk you cant listen to two tapes take you fifteen seconds abe leaned his chair back and put his head against the wall of the little cubicle hardy might be his friend but he was getting on his nerves nope i got fourno now fivelive ones out there andhe consulted his watchi got about ten minutes before i mosey out to the mo and talk some jive hardy sat down dont get comfortable i mean it hardy clucked at him look ten minutes you can hear this thing thirty times i take off a little for rewinding its gonna take me ten minutes to find two recorders hardy looked outside of the cubicle into the main office a wideopen expanse of green metal desks on linoleum guys were milling around secretaries were talking on phones occasionally typing i see at least four walkmans from here he said griffin had seen hardy wandering through the office trying to borrow a walkman from a secretary after he scored it griffin followed him up to glitskys cubicle still at it he asked hardy any luck glitsky knew that carl was aware of the ninetyfive or so suspects hed suggested in the past day he figured hed imply some frustration with diz show that he was still a professional cop who realized the utter silliness of what his friend hardy was doing now its the priest at st elizabeths griffin chuckled well you need any help just call smiling and helpful he bowed out glitsky raised his blood red eyes at hardy prick he said abe was still trying to be reasonable this is just plain old dog doo diz i mean it nothing hardy shook his head he did it look even if it is his voiceand im not saying it isso what so what it means he was there and didnt want us to know ive heard that song before wasnt that why you thought cruz killed him when was it yesterday he killed that hooker too he ran away from the seminary right after the cochrans wedding was missing for almost a week i tell you it fits oh jesus diz spare me but hardy pressed on we just saw the hookers still an unsolved casetwenty years later we got a thousand unsolved cases listen cavanaugh got the gun from the gun drive he knew about frannie being pregnant which means he saw eddie after she told him which was monday not sunday it all fits glitsky wagged his head back and forth he looked again at his watch well i listened to the tapes he got up you want to at least check the voice prints glitsky was putting on a jacket nope he said hardy followed him out abe come on suddenly his patience all gone glitsky wheeled around his strained voice loud very loud and pissed off cutting through the office noise wheres your fucking motive the room went silent hey easy abe people were looking at them glitsky glared first at hardy then back at the room in general hardy the voice of reason said hes always wanted erin cochran glitsky stared at his friend witheringly do yourself a favor diz he said showing hardy his back dont quit your day job chapter thirtythree at first it didnt seem all that hard to figure out but the only thing steven came up with that made any sense didnt make any sense father jim had loved eddie probably more than anybody except maybe mom no way he could have killed him but how else did you figure it the day before when pop and eddie had had that big fight about hitler and doing the right thing steven remembered clearly enougheddie coming into his room afterward really ticked off at pop he teaches you one thing and then when its time to do something about it he says forget it so what do you expect hed said to eddie and eddie going i dont know something what from adults hey im an adult youre a dork youre the dork what would you do that was eddie like his kid brothers advice really counted but he hadnt had any advice to give i dont know maybe ill ask father jim eddie seeing the face he made and saying whats the matter with him now its getting so you think somethings wrong with everybody hes okay but you dont really think so im getting that way with everybody cause everybodys that way not father jim steven doesnt he make you sort of nervous a little even you know when he flips out like eddie had laughed thats not flipping out its just letting go a little its harmless even a priest can be too serious all the time sometimes it just makes me a little nervous is all thats cause youre not very mature but teasing kidding then saying im gonna call him so right there in that bedroom eddie had called and talked to father jim making an appointment to see him the next night the night hed been killed and steven remembering that only now and eddie had kept the appointmenthow else could father know about frannie being pregnant then father went to where he kept the gun he eddie and father had gone shooting enough times below candlestick like the switchblade or the races down highway i just flying along against the ocean it was one of those secrets between father jim eddie and himself mick had never made the cuthe was too uptight the secret things about father jim had been another of the bonds between eddie and himself it was still too far a stretch to imagine father jim thinking he was going to kill eddie or wanting to but he could play with it for a minute see where it led him eddie had gone to visit father thinking about this problem he was having with a guy from work steven wished he paid more attention about the details of that but it had just been another thing eddie was doing then father might have said that meeting a guy alone at night trying to mess with his business might be dangerous hed go along as moral support and also just to be safe hed bring the gun he wouldnt use it they wouldnt plan on using it but what if the other guy shows up and hes got a gun too might as well be safe it hurts nothing eddie might have thought the whole idea was dumb but if steven knew fatherand he thought he did hed make it seem like some kind of game and eddie would go along with it okay so now he had eddie and father jim together with the gun at the lot and there it stopped for him maybe theyd been goofing around shooting at things and thered been a mistake an accident and after that father had gotten scared sure that made sense father didnt plan to kill him steven could see how hed feel being like one of the family and all and having to explain to mom and pop about the gun they might see it as his fathersfault and it wouldnt have been it could easily have been an accident and how about this father burying eddie in the catholic cemetery absolutelyhe used the world morallycertain that eddie hadnt killed himself for all of his carrying on father was first and foremost a priest he would never have buried eddie in sacred ground unless he knew for a fact he hadnt committed suicide and how could he know that if he hadnt been there steven leaned his head back against the pillow in the front of the house he heard his mother vacuuming mom that was the whole problem now her thinking that eddie had somehow rejected them all didnt love them enough it was eating her up and suddenly there it was the solution to everything it was easy to explain although it would be pretty hard to do except father jim and he were friends and maybe it was time to break out of the kid thing and take eddies place a little be a little more adult he wasnt as good at arguing as eddie but he was way better than mick and if he could only catch father in the right mood and alone he might be able to get to him see all father had to do he figured was tell mom thats all not pop not hardy or anybody else mom was closer to father was more likely to forgive him and that would be that and he stevenwould be the one whod pulled it all together for mom so she could start being okay again and maybe find some room to fit him into her feelings convincing father to tell mom that would be the hard part but really all he had to do was make father realize how it had affected mom how she would certainly continue to waste away like him like eddie had been father couldnt stand it when mom was unhappy so all he had to do was make it clear to him that she was miserable and why but first he had to make sure it had happened the way hed figured it and there was a way to do that just ask father hardy watched glitsky disappear into the hallway a guy sitting at a desk nearby having heard glitskys heated exchange with hardy nodded after the sergeant and said he thought a blow job would be out of the question and hardy went back to abes cubicle to get his stuff and return the walkman he still wanted verification on the voice prints but hey he thought i want to win the lottery too still the voice comparison looked doable the room had gone back to its business there was somebody there he was sure that he could hit on and get the thing done as a favor everybody by now knew he was a friend of abes whether that was good or bad was a tossup he stood leaning against the particleboard that denned abes space lieutenant joe frazelli opened his door far to hardys right scanned the room and called out a couple of names two guys sitting at desks facing each other doing paperwork stopped and got up yo one of them said hardy thought the woman hed gotten the walkman from was promising she sat about midway between glitskys cubicle and the lieutenants office where the door had just opened so hardy found himself walking parallel to the two guys back toward frazelli he was just about to open his mouth to the woman when he heard the lieutenant say we got an apparent suicide over at st elizabeths church you know the place out on taraval carbon monoxide you guys want to check it out get out of the office a while behind hardy another voice called out hey joe where was that frazelli looked right through hardy at the voice behind him st elizabeths hardy saw griffin saying something to another guy in his cubicle when he turned back to frazelli he saw hardy standing there staring at him he spoke to the two officers who had been on their way to the lieutenants office you guys mind if me and vince take it it might tie with something were on sure its yours one of them said hardy spoke up im gonna tag along griffin said its a free country steven woke up alert the pills didnt seem to be knocking him out as bad as they had or maybe it was that there was so much for him to think about probably that was it the vacuuming had stopped he heard his mother messing around in the kitchen opening the refrigerator emptying the dishwasher it was something how quiet the house was with no tv or radio going no records on mom not humming or singing while she worked shed stopped doing that and she used to do it all the time in the quiet the quiet deepened mom wasnt moving at all maybe just leaning against the counter or sitting at the table the telephone rang and he heard her say oh hi jim she paused whats the matter steven reached for the extension phone by his bed and picked up the receiver in time to hear father jim saying cant believe this is happening again right on top of it sounded like he was crying mom steven said im on the extension hang up steven i want to talk to father jim he cant talk now father said its okay hi steven what happened he asked steven you hang up his mom repeated you can talk when were finished okay dont forget he said what was the boy saying cavanaugh shook his head trying to clear it the first two blackandwhite squad cars were out by the garage with a distraught father dietrick and a confused father paul it had seemed to cavanaugh to be an eminently logical thing to do excuse himself to call erin his best friend and confidante hed establish with erin how badly roses suicide had torn him up especially now hard on the heels of eddie so that any suspicion that he might have killed rose would have to get around erins testimony he had figured that between father dietrick swearing rose had been depressed and erin describing how he cavanaugh had been deeply hurt but not altogether surprised by the suicide he would have covered all the bases so he had called erin but then her son wanted to talk and now steven was saying to him that he knew all about it describing it so closely it made him dizzy as though he were about to topple from some great height steven sounding so much like eddie it was frightening almost as though eddie had come back to haunt him and all of it whispered not wanting erin to hear he looked out at the garage again six men in uniformfour cops and two priests a paramedics van or the coroners pulled into the driveway went past the kitchen and continued out over the asphalt steven was saying you know he had to ask what it was all about steven understanding and having to tell erin all coming out jumbled or sounding that way to him words in a torrent that was drowning him steven might even be making a point but it was blunted by his own onset of panic all he knew was that once again after having to do what he did to rose he couldnt think about that even for a minute this was steven cochran eddies brother he couldnt do that to erin another time no he couldnt if he did that would really be the end of it but if he didnt it would all come out and he could never ever see erin again he heard himself saying after steven had finished can i talk to your mother again youre not going to tell her now are you steven come on he said putting a light edge on it i promised did he it would have been seconds ago but he didnt remember he stretched his neck to look out to the street dietrick had parked in front of the rectory not in the back where all the commotion was the spare keys to that car hung on the same peg by the kitchen door that the spare garage key had hung on then erins voice jim he could easily explain when he got back that hed just needed to clear his head take a walk listen i know this is an imposition but he struggled with the words but if you could come over here im all i dont know it would help me a lot she didnt answer right away he didnt wonder she thought about itanother suicide so close on the heels of her son but when erin was needed she came through except in one thing for him but he wasnt thinking about that now im sorry he said forget it i dont know what i was thinking its not fair to you no its not that she said covering whitelying i was just thinking about steven he said nothing letting her work on herself all right jim ill be over in a few minutes as soon as he hung up he took dietricks spare keys from the peg walked through the rectory and out the front door the car a yearold honda accord started right away the drive to the cochrans took under three minutes if he hurried and timed it right he could take care of things and be back here in fifteen chapter thirtyfour father paul sat on the asphalt in the shade thrown by the garage his back up against the building father dietrick had propped himself up on the hood of one of the police cars and sat as though sleeping his arms crossed over his cassock once in his second mission father paul had come to his destination a village of tukuna indians just outside of tabatinga where brazil met peru as though the national boundaries made any difference that far up the amazon he had arrived alone in time to witness the public execution of a thief where in a carnival atmosphere most of the men of the tribe gathered around in a circle keeping the condemned man inside their perimeter closing in and beating him with heavy sticks poking at his face his eyes and throat his groin when the man finally went down everybody male and femalefrom the smallest child to the oldest grandmothertook a turn swatting at the prostrate figure until he wasnt much more than a smear on the dusty and rutted road something about his timing he thought his bowels were hurting from the airplane food and the culture shock here with ubiquitous death here too in this civilized place was almost harder to take than that execution had been these trips home to ask for moneyone every blessed two yearswere supposed to recharge his batteries food wine conversation a surcease from the endless monotony and misery of the bush but too much time in the bush father paul was beginning to realize and it got inside you all these trappings of civilization the asphalt the beautiful church the grass on the lawns cars clothes everythingwere just artifacts not necessarily phony but inessential to what was most humanthe coping with mortality the fear of being alone the need to love he missed his woman sarita badly but that was in theory why they sent you homeso that you didnt become one of the tribe so you remembered what it was you were trying to do which was bring the message of jesus christ to impoverished people and somehow convince them since there was no hope in changing their situation that there was at least nobility and holiness in it father paul sighed sweating even in the shade he feared he was losing his faith in god that he might even already be a marxist coming upon a death like this in the first moments of what was supposed to be a vacation had the strength of a message and the message was dont get too caught up in what looks like the security of the civilized world the whole thing is pretty tenuous he got up in the garage no one had moved the woman even though there were four policemen in uniform and three medical people of some kind no one seemed inclined to do anything the officials stood around in two groups making chitchat he walked over to father dietrick who still leaned against a car with his arms folded on the way down from the airport they had passed the time pleasantly enoughdietrick fascinated as only someone who had never traveled could be by father pauls account of his latest mission the journey back he was exactly what was expecteda likable young man but they were about the same age with an anchormans glib enthusiasm and sincerity whom father paul could tolerate because tolerance of the essentially benign was something he believed in i would think theyd move her father paul said dietrick opened his eyes squinting in the sun this is a hell of a welcome isnt it father paul wondered at what point refusal to break out of social conventions stopped being benign and became a deliberate refusal to take responsibility but he said might they let us give her last rites dietrick said shes already dead he nodded well ill ask anyway couldnt hurt at that moment just as father paul was turning to speak to the policemen two more cars pulled into sight by the rectory and began crossing the lot the blue american car pulled up beside the van and stopped two men casually dressed got out the other car a jeeplike machine with a canvas top rolled back drove almost into the garage the driver of that car had an intensity that was totally different from the rest of the group he fairly jumped from behind the wheel and walked quickly over to where he and dietrick stood a flash of formal smile gone immediately wheres father cavanaugh dietrick spoke up he went in to make a call hes in the rectory father dietrick helpful smiled should be the man nodded the two men from the american car had spoken to the uniformed police for a minute now they were walking into the garage the man from the jeep followed them and father paul trailed behind rose lay as if sleeping still sitting up her head forward on her chest calm enough one of the americans said just went to sleep the other responded thats the way to go the jeep person said whys she on that side of the car what why isnt she behind the steering wheel the two americans looked at one another father paul suddenly wondered about that himself it was odd there she had been for maybe a half hour and nobody had noticed that maybe they all saw what they expected to see for some reason the jeep guy didnt seem to see the same thing i dont want to tell you guys what to do he said but id check the keys for her prints thanks hardy one of the men said sarcastically fingerprints you mean yeah the man hardy responded from her fingers you know little whirly things he turned away nearly bumping into father paul id bet you wont find em he said scuse me father and went back out into the sunshine who found her he asked dietrick i think father cavanaughs already made a statement to the police hardy was matteroffact i bet he has whats the matter here father paul asked didnt the woman kill herself hardy skewered him with a look doubt it he said then to dietrick the rectory you said steven said i know how it happened thats what i was talking to father jim about erin pouring a glass of water by stevens bed said how what happened you know mom eddie please steven no really he didnt kill himself mom he loved us he did okay steven she was having trouble with the top of the pill container she grimaced pushing down while trying to turn hows the foot to be honest the foot felt like it was being crushed in a vise but he didnt want to bother her with that now the pills would solve it quick enough youll see i cant tell you yet but i know how it happened okay shed listen why cant you tell me theres one or two more things i want to get right she handed him the pills he popped them and then took the glass this having only one movable hand wasnt that much fun she took a breath and held it then let it out slowly humoring him well when you get it right ill listen how about that she leaned over and kissed him not really answering anything just going through that motion along with all the others he leaned his head back into the pillow where are you going now just over to the church a few minutes ill be back in time for lunch can father jim come back with you she stopped by the door i dont know i can ask why the thing about eddie i just want to ask him something she slumped a little ill see what i can do she said you get some rest okay cavanaugh parked about six houses down the street in the opposite direction of the way he knew erin would drive there was a threequarterton dodge pickup on blocks in one of the driveways between where he was parked and the cochrans erin wouldnt be able to see the honda until she was in the street and it would mean nothing to her if she did see it it had taken less than three minutestwo minutes thirtyeight secondsand he had stopped still at every one of the seven stop signs it would be a poor time to get a ticket he waited after what seemed an hour he checked his watch and realized it had not yet been five minutes he rolled down the cars window the day was unnaturally still he reached over and cracked the passenger window hoping to get some crossventilation it didnt do much good could she have left in the time it took him to drive over he thought about it unlikely he had gotten out of the rectory within thirty seconds of hanging up with her unless she had been ready to walk out her own door when they were talking she would have needed at least five minutes to say goodbye to steven comb her hair get her purse still if she didnt come out within another couple of minutes and only a couple he would somehow have to check he took a handkerchief from his back pocket and ran it over his brow around his neck he felt clammy and now a tiny breeze finally stirring in the car made him shiver was he getting sick even his hands felt sweaty sticky come on erin he thought come on ah here she was she backed the volvo wagon into the street she didnt even glance behind her in his direction his breathing started coming a little more easily the volvo stopped at the corner let a ups truck pass in front of her then turned left out of sight cavanaugh turned the key pulled into the street and parked in the cochrans driveway he walked across the familiar brick path to the front stoop mounted the stairs and rang the doorbell steven he called erin he rang the bell again who is it stevens voice sounded thin and far away from back inside the house father jim steven a pause then another distant yell i cant get up father come on in what are you doing here hardy seeing erin crossing the little patch of lawn opened the door and stood in the front doorway of the rectory her face really was incredible he thought i might ask you the same thing she said is jim inside jim isnt around she stopped her expression flickering well of course he is i just talked to him you just talked to him he said he needed me over here when i dont know maybe ten fifteen minutes ago over here at the rectory yes is something wrong still in the doorway hardy frowned i hope not they started back through the house rose is dead you know hardy said erin touched hardys arm the way she did they faced each other in the hallway jim said she killed herself too what do you mean too erin looked down hardy picked up her chin with his finger eddie didnt he could tell it was hard for her to hear it but she had to know steven just said the same thing he said hed figured out how it happened he was just talking to jim about it hardy felt the blood draining from his face whats the matter when when what when was he talking to jim about it erin had taken his hand as though to steady him just before i left just before he asked me to come over i think hardy was frozen for a few seconds letting the coins drop jesus christ he looked behind her the front door was still closed give me your keys what your keys give me your keys obediently she opened her purse then he had the keys and was running for the door come on come on he said your car lets go chapter thirtyfive the front door was locked he was just about to call out for steven again then realized it would be better not to draw more attention to himself he looked both ways down the street it was a slow tuesday still before lunchtime there was no one outside on the entire block and cavanaugh knew steven couldnt get upso what good would calling him do he tried the door again no it was locked probably deadbolted too if he knew erin he went past the honda again along the side of the house on the driveway all the windows were closed in the backyard he went up onto the deck and tried the sliding glass doors they too were locked with a sawedoff broom handle wedged into the runner on the floor to make sure the door wouldnt open cavanaugh looked at his watch sweating now too much time was passing he had to get inside and it must not look like forced entry walking off the deck he rounded the corner and started up to the front again along the other side of the house where there was just a strip of grass and a fence it was so vivid it could not have been a dream but if it wasnt a dream then where was father jim steven was sure hed heard him call out from the front door hed even called back that he couldnt move that he should just come in but had he heard him he hadnt come his eyes were heavy and he really couldnt remember if hed dozed off or not before the bell rang he knew hed taken another dose of the pills before mom had left his foot didnt hurt so they must have already kicked in he closed his eyes maybe it was like when he thought hed seen eddie here in his room the other night that had seemed so real it wasnt until the next morning that he realized it couldnt have happened okay the doorbell had seemed real and father jims voice but it had happened right after the pills too besides it made no sense mom had just gone to see father jim what would he be doing here he had begun to figure it out just as he saw the fingers come around the bottom of the windowsill open about four inches to let in some air the hand pushed at the window and it slid up until fathers arm had straightenedmaybe another foot he heard his name again quietly this time steven glitsky heard the followup callin on his way to his appointment in the projects he was going to meet a steady source named quicksand barthelme that dick willis would love to get to know but glitsky didnt work for the dea and quicksand was too valuable an ally in the projects to worry about how he made his money quicksand could operate safely forever as far as glitsky was concerned he was small time was grateful for the umbrella of glitskys favor and knew everybody willis no doubt had a few murderers among his sources and it probably bothered him about as much as quicksands drug activities bothered abe but today quicksand didnt show it happened these guys it wasnt like you made an appointment with their secretary and did a power lunch sometimeshell all the timethe street had its own rhythm and you had to go with it so abe was half listening to the squawk box still furious with himself and hardy and pissed at quicksand and the heat when he heard that there was a suicide at st elizabeths that decided what he was going to do with the rest of his morning one of the squad cars was pulling out as he turned into the driveway he saw hardys car over by the garage as soon as he passed the rectory the guy was persistenthe gave him that he parked in the thinning strip of shade along the side of the garage coming around the building he saw two priests neither of them cavanaugh one of them was leaning up against a workbench in the garage silent the other stood by the gurney covered by a sheet under which presumably was a body hi guys abe said giometti and griffin had drawn the call he noticed and somehow knew it wasnt a coincidence fancy meeting you here they were dismissing the second squad car the rest of the homicide team had arrived and there wasnt any use for beat cops at this stage abe walked into the relatively cooler shade of the garage and lifted the sheet surprised to see rose the housekeeper bored abe giometti asked challenging coming over yeah yeah i cant get enough then he explained i was here last week on something you mind giometti shrugged knock yourself out no mysteries here though you dont think nada you tow hardy over here with you griffin heard this as he came up to them here and gone his cars still here giometti smiled hes probably inside interrogating a suspect griffin added he thinks this was a murder too me im leaning toward a gang hit said with a straight face abe went back to the gurney they had loaded it into the van he picked up the sheet any sign of struggle giometti joined him there the lady started the car and went to sleep but as you can see were running the usual the photographer had already finished his work but the print guy was still kneeling in the front seat brushing giometti shaking his head said waste of time we got nothing griffin kept playing nothing how could you forget she sat on the passenger side glitsky said what giometti snorted your friend hardy noticed that she was sitting in the passengers seat told us to make sure and dust the keys for her prints said we wouldnt find any griffin said very helpful guy giometti said we probably would have forgot right carl yeah probably glitsky wondering where hardy had gone and thinking it might in fact be a little unusual for someone whod killed herself that way to be sitting in the passenger seat walked back out into the sun he turned around and asked giometti and griffin would they mind if he checked out the house he started across the asphalt hardy could not believe he had forgotten his gun erins car was closer and so hed run for that it would have only taken him another minute to get to his own car with the in the glove box he might even have been able to talk one of the cops into going over with them but he hadnt thought at all he was in too much of a hurry he might not have a minute and still it might be too late erin had asked what they were doing as he pulled away from the curb in front of the rectory whats the quickest way to your house and tried to figure out what he was going to do or say to erin if they werent in time and he could even be wrong they could have called from the rectory and found out steven was alone and all right but he knew he wasnt wrong he kept his hand on the horn through the intersections hardly slowing at all chapter thirtysix what he thought he would do was make a couple of jokes as he came through the window steven was used to that from him when he got to the bed he would hold a pillow over his face until he was unconscious he would have to be careful he didnt want another investigation like eddies getting started and there was no way steven could suffocate himself when the boy was unconscious he would take the switchblade he had once given him and that steven always kept hidden in the drawer next to his bed and he would cut his wrists it would make sense after all the boy had just run away and been abused a few days before he was deeply depressed over his brothers death it would be compellingly believable steven had waited until he was alonehis mother had just gone outthen did what he had been building up to ever since his brothers death steven he said again hoisting himself up into the window steven willed every part of his body to move even with the pills the pain was awesome the bandages seemed to be ripping the skin off his whole side and with the cast on his foot and his arm stuck out at this weird angle still he got himself sitting upright though it had to be on the right side of the bed facing away from the open window he was trying to stand twisting to look back when father jim boosted himself onto the sill hey why didnt you answer me he said smiling steven couldnt stop him from getting in the only hope was if he could maybe get to the bathroom and lock the door he stood wobbly not yet putting any weight on the bad foot steven come onstill smilingwhat are you doing up his upper body was through the window he had to move faster he stepped onto the foot in the cast steven whats the matter it wouldnt hold him the leg crumbled and he came down on top of it he didnt mean to but he cried out a wordless scream of pain father jim in the room now over him kneeling on one knee still a gentle look on his face his arms reached out as though to cradle him get away from me steven you killed eddie you killed him father pulled his arms back no longer reaching for him he sank back on his leg what are you talking about you cant believe that he was actually surprised now youre gonna kill me arent you thats what you came here for father jim widened his benevolent smile how can he be so relaxed if hes going to kill me steven steven steven father jim said i came here to visit your mother but she just went to see you so thats why shes not home he just kept smiling youd think after all these years wed communicate a little better i thought we were meeting over here he reached down for steven again i think those pills might make you hallucinate a little come on he put one hand under his head just lean into me lets get you back in bed it was hard to keep up this charade he lifted him first to a sitting position then up onto the side of the bed he had to be in the bedthat was essential but this movement was so awkward all plaster and bone the joints didnt bend the way they should i didnt mean it about eddie steven said i dont know i just thought its okay steven but the other thing the accident i did want to talk to you about that put him at ease again it was going to be all right let me go get a beer he said you get comfortable out to the kitchen seeing nothing feeling nothing like walking in a tunnel he opened the refrigerator took out a bottle started twisting the neck going back to the bedroom good he was back lying down okay now put the beer on the bed table and remember to take it when you go here he said let me get that pillow for you whose car is that erin didnt know it wasnt jims car but there was somebody there in her house with steven oh god dismas pulled the volvo up over the curb onto the lawn she already had her door open running wheres the knife steven always kept the knife in the bottom of the drawer here hed seen him pull it out a dozen times now he was beginning to moan again he hadnt believed steven had had that much strength maybe in the second drawer and if it wasnt there hed try to put him under again but the timing of that was tough he thought hed held the pillow down too long last time when hed pulled it up and the boys lips were blue he opened the second drawer god dismas had the keys the keys the keys she pushed at the doorbell steven steven dismas was up next to her giving her the keys fumbling seconds going by which one dismas taking the key getting it in turning it pushing it open the door pushing him aside and running running into the hall yelling her sons name cavanaugh was standing by the bed when steven opened his eyes he was holding a pillow in front of him with both hands and there was mom in the door to the room hes not dead god say hes not dead then she was next to him her arms around his neck he couldnt move at all or talk maybe he was dead and mom saying you might as well kill me as kill my baby her hand running down the side of his face again and again like a cool breeze her baby she thought of him as her baby he might as well kill her as her baby erin father began hardy was standing in the doorway and his mom started crying oh hes breathing thank god she buried her face into the sheets up by his face he thought he heard cavanaugh say his moms name again but she kept herself up near him holding him touching his face his hair oh god i love you she said still crying i love you steven i love you please dont die okay he wouldnt then he wouldnt die leave em alone hardy said motioning with his head taking hold of cavanaughs arm and pulling him out to the living room he still held the pillow hardy sat on one of the stools near the bar talk he said cavanaugh even now tried his smile but it didnt work out just right i told you before it wasnt fair he said but you didnt understand you cant know i cant huh you know what its like to live right in the midst of everything you wantday in day outand never get to have it to see the kids growing perfect erins kids eds we couldve had that erin and me and she so happy with that that goddamned gardener and then it starting to go on another generation of it of the perfect cochrans and their perfect happiness well you ended that hardy said i couldnt accept it anymore when eddie told me they were pregnant it was just for a moment i didnt really plan it you planned it enough howd you get him to fire the gun cavanaugh shrugged i just bet him he couldnt hit something out on the canal it was easy and he had to fire the gun you see sure and then once he had there was nothing left to do he just gave the gun back to you and you shot him he gripped at the pillow raised it to his face left it there shutting out the world himself finally letting it down it was too much i broke like you broke out of the seminary cavanaugh opened his eyes wide how did you when erin got married you couldnt handle that either could you it isnt right it wasnt the sex not having sex being celibate it was erin fuck you father hardy said fuck yourself very hard cavanaugh walked halfway across the room and looked out the sliding glass doors to the backyard so what do we do now he asked hardy breathing hard waited a long time finally he said you know youre the expert on suicide i got a suzuki parked out by where you killed rose looks like a jeep theres a loaded gun in the glove compartment his face crinkled up you know how to use a gun dont you cavanaugh let his hands all the way down in front of him he dropped the pillow to the floor hardy found himself staring at the pillow hearing the front door open and close as cavanaugh went out abe found the note in father dietricks chair it was a strange note im sorry ill miss you did people say they were going to miss people when they were going to kill themselves maybe he didnt know what minds might do at that point he left the note where it was hed send one of the team back to pick it up check it for handwriting oils all that it seemed to close it up for him though hardy was wrong on this one speaking of which where was hardy one of the priests from outside the tan one was walking toward him in the hallway im father paul he said you know anything about this no i just got here from brazil is that right he seemed to be waiting for glitsky to say something else so what can i do for you i thought id unpack he said but the car seems to be gone the car father dietricks car the one we came in its gone he led him to the front door and opened it im sure we parked it right here in front so what glitsky thought look father were homicide you got a stolen car you should call the cops but arent you then he pointed there it is whos that driving it the car pulled into the driveway thats father cavanaugh abe said i want to talk to him the hawkfaced black policeman jogged across the blacktop and got to the honda as father cavanaugh was getting out they shook hands and while father paul was still crossing the lot fighting the glare from the van and the other automobiles he heard a funny highpitched laugh it must have been father cavanaugh as though hed just heard a good joke though it seemed poor taste to be laughing right then in the presence of mortalsin death the two other policemen came out from inside the garage father cavanaugh the hawkfaced policeman and the other two all stood in a knot out in the sun father dietrick had become a statue maybe he was in shock father paul should go over to him try to help him that would be the christian thing to do but he was more interested in what father cavanaugh was saying to the policemen he hurried his pace a little getting there in time to hear father cavanaugh saying im not lying and the hawkfaced policeman saying i dont think youre lying father cavanaugh wiped the sweat from his forehead you mind if i sit down a minute his face had a sick look shiny white as though he might faint id like a minute alone telling a joke like i think its my last chance to be alone for a while they watched him walk the ten yards or so over to the jeep and get in the front seat all three policemen were quiet watching him he sat there seeming to be catching his breath taking out his handkerchief and wiping his forehead father you all right the shorter white man asked father cavanaugh nodded the other men closed in on one another and father paul stepped up to hear them father paul glanced over to the jeep one time father cavanaugh was doing something like fussing with the radio knobs he heard the taller man say well that was easy and the hawkfaced one started to say something when suddenly father dietrick yelled father but it was drowned out almost immediately by a tremendous explosion father cavanaugh had come halfway out of the jeep his upper body lay out on the ground one leg caught at a funny angle as though it had stuck up under the front seat chapter thirtyseven though he generally preferred to stand in his doorway and bellow this time lieutenant joe frazelli elected to use his intercom he pushed the button got an answer and said frank come in here you get a sec maybe a minute later there was a knock on his door and he was looking up at the tall frame of frank batiste close the door he said then what kind a cake you like frank batiste stayed standing he was a quiet thorough officer who was especially good when paired with less experienced men of everyone in homicide he had perhaps the least pugnacious character not that he couldnt mix it up when he had to but he preferred to leave alone the office posing and pecking well frazelli thought somebodys got to be that way it sets him off a little and thats to the good cake batiste asked i dont know i guess theyre pretty much the same im not much of a cake eater joe perfect frazelli loved it goddammit frank i dont give a shit about what you like i got marylouise out there humping her telephone to make a call down to the bakery and get a cake and if she dont hear from me in about another minute then the whole goddamn office is gonna know before i want em to batiste not born yesterday nodded and broke a smile plain chocolate sir chocolate icing chocolate on the inside boy makes my mouth water frazelli punched the intercom again and whispered to marylouise that frank liked chocolate cake he asked her how long it would take and she said usually about twentyfive minutes sit down frank you make me nervous hovering like that but before you do frazelli stood up behind his desk and extended a hand congratulations lieutenant he said you mind if i call my wife batiste asked frazelli shook his head wait til after the cake would you the whole timing of this office is centered around marylouise and her fucking cakes we cant get new cops but we got petty cash for cakes up the wazoo well he said grinning it aint my problem anymore youll get used to it batiste scanned the office how long you been here sir as lieutenant frazelli twisted his wedding ring fourteen years he said with a little laugh my stepping stone to chief he sighed you want a little peaceofmind advice this isnt a step to anything just treat it like its own job god knows itll keep you busy on the other hand rigbythe current chiefhad the job before i did ill do what i do frank said see where i wind up but a cloud crossed his face you dont mind my asking whos going down the new guys i mean giomettis staying lets put it positive i decided not to make him pay for getting in the middle of a pissing contest being around it he probably learned more than a year here would teach him in the normal course of events anyway abe and carl frazelli nodded thats the trouble with pissing contests you wind up all covered with piss they both laughed i really thought one of them had it the promotion no you three were up all along you though had the good sense to not let a murder suspect kill himself in your armed and august presence frazelli got a little worked up and thank god it was only himself and not everybody else in the whole fucking parking lot i cant believe i couldnt believe it when i heard that happened i still cant believe it what were they thinking about probably what kind of cake they were gonna order when i called them in here frazelli sat back fuck it though theyre both good cops they just timed this one bad so theyll get a nod next timetheyre both due i wouldnt want em off the squad frazeui said nah you wont lose em frank theyre here cause its what they do he punched his intercom again marylouise how many people we got out there everybody she said i havent let anybody out all right dont he stabbed the button again she hasnt let anybody out jesus you know who runs this department fucking marylouise bezdikian he stopped spewing you think we ought to get abe and carl in let em know before the others batiste shrugged tough call joe up to you frazelli worried it a minute twisting his ring fuck it he said who needs it its their problem in frazellis office in the outer office everything went suddenly silent then picked up again angels passing batiste said whats that like that when its all of a sudden quiet my wife says its angels passing passing gas more likely said frazelli poetic as a cement truck he went back to twisting his ring you know batiste said i got one other question you dont mind shoot well you know you hear things frazelli listened knowing what was coming well point is i dont want to come in some morning and find a triplea bumper sticker on the door you know frazelli knew triplea was department slang for affirmative action asshole the wedding ring suddenly was getting a real workout realizing what he was doing the lieutenant stopped himself put his hands behind his head and leaned back in his chair feet on his desk frank had plenty of time to find out how things worked why ruin the moment for him now you know frank frazelli said you hear that shit all the time but you got the gig cause you earned it pure and simple anybody thinks otherwise you send em to me even after im retired and out on the bay fishin the intercom buzzed marylouise said the cakes here frazelli stood up you ready he asked lets go have some cake jane was with him her hand resting easily on the inside of his thigh she sat close up next to him at the end of the bar by the large windows drinking a negroni shed throw her head back and laugh her deep laugh she glowed in the friday dusk hardy had opened up a little after one working a short shift mcguire preferred to work friday night because of the good tips where hardy liked to come in and set up then have friday night to himself jane and he used to call it date night maybe it would be again hed gone back to work on wednesday using his time behind the bar he realizedthe way he always hadto keep the pretense of being a social animal without really having to interact it suited him now the disengagement so long as he knew why he was doing it he had felt dazed somehow wanting to be alone yesterday hed gone downtown and worked out his statement glitsky hadnt been around the new lieutenant told him that with glitsky griffin and the two priests corroborating their story theyd declared eddies death a homicide mosess reaction had been mixed at first he was all hyped up happy to have frannie covered but then a distance a sullen melancholy politeness crept in that hardy had only now just figured out he understood it but it didnt seem right to him moses after all had hired him to do a job and offered him something as payment it had been a contract as binding as anything written up signed and notarized and hardy wasnt worried about moses reneging on their deal he wouldnt do that what bothered him was mosess reaction to it how could they work as partners after being friends for so long with that friction between them and it was obvious that moses having thought about the reality of it and not the grand romance of the gesture was resenting itlosing a quarter of the bar hed owned for most of a decade when hed come in tonight with a scowl and a manila folder hardy guessed hed brought some papers to sign even jane who hadnt laid eyes on the man in some years had said this isnt the mcguire i knew the crowd wouldnt really get going for another half hour hardy pushed himself up off his stool he kissed jane casually saying hed be right back then walked the length of the bar to where moses was watching a game of liars dice as though it were the world series in other words pointedly ignoring hardy hey mose he looked up i quit hardy said moses squinted moved over and forward a step and leaned over the bar what i quit im not bartending anymore starting now he flashed him a broad and phony grin and went back to join jane what do you mean you quit moses was in front of him again just send me my profit checks hardy said i couldnt live around you feeling guilty all the time lets go jane youve still got this pan jane said it looks brand new hardy nodded over his eggs treat things right they last he said theyd gone to dinner then back to hardys then to bed too early to sleep so now sometime after midnight they were eating before going back in and devouring each other some more the doorbell rang reasonable hour hardy said he yelled down the hallway go away the bell rang again hardy swore went into his room and put on a pair of jogging shorts who is it he asked at the door it was mcguire he held the folder in one hand im a horses ass he said yep you are you want this stuff hardy shifted on his bare feet you want to give it to me you earned it thats not what i asked mcguire gave it a last thought yeah he nodded you want to sign these papers no tomorrow will be fine ive got some company now but you could just tomorrow mose when i come in to open okay he closed the door on his friend and turning saw jane standing waiting for him at the end of the long hall john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of such novels as the mercy
