christian cameron storm of arrows bc t he conqueror of asia stalked into his tent and tossed his golden helmet at the armour stand by the camp bed it hit the wooden post with a bronze clang the servants froze where the fuck are my recruits he yelled antipater promised me eight thousand new infantry he sent three thousand thracians and some mutinous greeks i want my macedonians members of his staff followed him into the tent led by hephaestion hephaestion was not afraid of his royal master certainly not his masters temper tantrums and his bronzehaired head was high he was smiling behind him eumenes and callisthenes were more hesitant alexander scratched his head with both hands trying to get the sweat and the dirt out of his hair dont stand in the doorway like sheep come in or get the fuck out hephaestion handed him a cup of wine poured another for himself drink friend he said alexander drank its not fair if people would just do as they were told hephaestion raised an eyebrow and they both laughed just like that alexander swirled the wine in his cup and looked at eumenes did he say why eumenes shorter not godlike in any way accepted a goblet from hephaestion who rarely served anyone but the great king himself and met his lords eyes they were mismatched blue and brown the blue eye ringed in black and opened just a little too wide eumenes sometimes thought that his master was a god and other times that he was mad either way eumenes a brave man and veteran of a dozen hard fights disliked meeting alexanders eyes eumenes of cardia was a greek and not a macedonian which made the bearing of bad tidings all the harder men competed to bring alexander good news when the news was bad men conspired to avoid being the goat eumenes the foreigner the smaller man was the goat lord he said carefully would you like to read the letter or shall i tell you what i think in the right mood alexander craved straight talk eumenes lacked hephaestions touch with his lord but they had an emergency and he needed alexander to act like a king just tell me alexander shot back eumenes looked at hephaestion and received no sign at all reading between the lines i would say that antipater sent an army to conquer the euxine cities and perhaps the sakje tribes sakje alexander asked the western scyths callisthenes answered amazons alexander asked callisthenes snorted contemptuously alexander whirled on him why are you here sir he asked callisthenes raised an eyebrow because you cant tell the difference between a scythian and an amazon alexander seemed pleased with this remark he flung himself on a couch hephaestion came and lay with him servants brought food and more wine so antipater made a campaign against the scythians he said not in person he sent zopryon shit for brains alexander said i assume he cocked it up eumenes nodded i think thats where we lost our missing recruits alexander snorted theyre off chasing amazons eh eumenes shook his head no lord if im right and my sources are firm on this point all our recruits are dead alexander rolled off the couch and stood zeus ammon my father zopryon lost a whole taxeis zopryon lost a whole army lord eumenes waited for the explosion and died himself alexander stood rigid by the couch hephaestion reached out and put a hand on his hip but alexander struck the hand away hephaestion frowned they almost defeated my father philip my father he was wounded wounded badly alexander was speaking very softly eumenes could remember it he nodded yes lord and darius these sakje defeated darius alexanders face was immobile he stood like a schoolboy reciting for his tutor callisthenes shrugged not so much defeated as avoided if herodotus is to be believed they made darius look like an ass though alexander glared at him callisthenes raised a shaggy eyebrow of course it took athens to defeat darius alexanders face burned as the blood rushed to his cheeks athens checked darius sparta checked xerxes i conquered asia macedon not athens and not sparta the philosopher glared at alexander who met his look and held it long seconds passed then the philosopher shrugged again as you say callisthenes said with a nod a tense silence filled the tent outside the new recruits could be heard being shepherded to their quarters in the sprawling camp a camp so big and so well built that men already called it a city alexander sat on the couch again and cyrus he said as if continuing an earlier conversation they all looked at him until understanding dawned on callisthenes yes he said yes as you say alexander cyrus lost his life fighting the massagetae well to the east of here massagetae alexander brightened amazons the massagetae are the eastern scythians callisthenes said their women do fight and they sometimes have warrior queens they pay tribute to the king of kings there are massagetae serving with bessus and with spitamenes the queen of the massagetae is zarina alexander raised his goblet in salute to callisthenes you do know some useful things he drank staring out of the door of his tent eumenes fidgeted after the silence stretched on too long callisthenes didnt fidget he watched alexander alexander ran his fingers through hephaestions hair then he watched a persian boy retrieve his helmet and polish it with a cloth before hanging it on the armour stand alexander gave the boy a smile callisthenes continued to watch him antipater has cost us more than a few thousand recruits alexander said some minutes later he leaned back so that his golden curls mixed with hephaestions longer hair our own legend of invincibility is worth a pair of taxeis and five hundred companions you are invincible hephaestion said from another man it would have been fawning from hephaestion it was a simple statement of fact alexander allowed himself a small smile i cannot be everywhere he said he rolled off the couch again and motioned to the silent slave who waited at the foot of the bed take my armour he said the silent man opened his breastplate and put it on the armour stand alexander shrugged out of his tunic and stood naked the marks of the armour clear on his alltoo human flesh naked neither tall nor especially beautiful alexander picked up his wine found it empty and held it out for a refill slaves tripped over themselves to correct the error callisthenes laughed at their eagerness and their fear alexander smirked persians make such good slaves he said he drank off the whole cup and held it out again and the pantomime was repeated even the cardian had to laugh the slaves knew they were being made game of and that made them more afraid wine was spilled and more slaves appeared to clean it up i cant be everywhere alexander repeated and macedon cannot afford to appear weak these scythians must be punished their victory over zopryon must be made to look the stroke of illfortune that it was when bessus is brought to heel we should spend a season crushing the massagetae callisthenes sensed the dismay of the other men alexander he began carefully the massagetae live far to the north and east beyond the kush and they live on the sea of grass which herodotus says runs for fifty thousand stades we will not crush them in one season alexander looked up and smiled it was a happy smile and it removed years of tension war and drink from his face i can only spare them a season alexander said theyre just barbarians besides i want an amazon hephaestion struck the king playfully and they ended up wrestling on the floor part i funeral games the sun shone on the borysthenes river the rain swell moving like a horse herd and glittering like the rainwet grass in the sun the sakje camp was crisp and clean after days of rain much of the horse dung vanished into the the general mud that filled every street the felt yurts and the wagons bright as if newmade kineas had taken the sun as a sign and risen from his bed despite the fresh pain of his wounds and the recent fear of death you should find the stone the girl said she was eleven or twelve years old dressed in caribou hide with a red cloak blowing in the wind kineas had seen her before around the camp a slight figure with redbrown hair and a silvergrey horse from the royal herd kineas crouched down wincing at the intense pain that shot from his hip down his leg and through his groin everything hurt and most actions made him dizzy what stone he asked she had big eyes deep blue eyes with a black rim that made her appear possessed or mad it is a baqca thing is it not to find the stone she shrugged put her hands behind her and rocked her hips back and forth back and forth so that her hair swayed around her face she was dirty and smelled of horse his sakje didnt run to endearments for children im sorry he said i dont understand she favoured him with the look that children save for adults too slow to understand them the stone she said for the kings barrow seeing his incomprehension she pointed at an old barrow the kurgan of some ancient horselord that rose by the great bend at the peak of every barrow the baqca places a stone you should go and find it my father says so kineas grinned as much from pain as from understanding and who is your father child he asked although even as he said the words he knew where he had seen that longnosed profile and the fine bones of her hands kam baqca was my father she said and ran away laughing he knew as soon as she spoke that he had seen the stone in dreams seen it and dismissed it he feared his dreams now and denied them if he could but he gathered a dozen of his sindi retainers and a few greeks diodorus and niceas because they were friends and anarxes a gentleman of olbia because eumenes was wounded and anarxes had the duty together they rode down the river a dozen stades what are we looking for diodorus asked he too was recovering from a wound and his red hair gleamed where it emerged from a bandage that swathed his whole head under a sakje cap of fox fur and red wool temerix the sindi smith rode over were looking for a stone kineas said for kurgan temerix said as if this was the most natural thing in the world lord kineas sees it in dreams we come find it young anarxes eyes were as wide as funeral coins at this open talk of his hipparchs godlike powers diodorus raised an eyebrow and nodded slowly he reached into his cloak and produced a clay flask from which he took a long pull he offered it around did it ever occur to you that life was simpler when we were just mercenaries he asked kineas and niceas exchanged a look diodorus pointed with the fist that held the flask look kineas is wearing a thracian cloak anarxes here as fine a wrestler as weve ever seen an olympian by apollo is wearing sakje trousers as if that were the most natural thing in the world all our men wear their caps diodorus touched his bandages and the sakje cap perched atop them are we even greeks any more he asked he took another drink of wine from his flask and handed it to kineas kineas shrugged were still greeks did travel to persia make you persian diodorus was serious it made me a lot more persian than i was before i went there remember ecbatana ill never think of greece the same way again what are you saying kineas asked theres a rumour that you and srayanka aim to take us all the way east to fight alexander diodorus said ive heard you talk around it you mean it dont you kineas shook his head lot is insistent and srayanka wants to support him the queen of the massagetae has sent messengers to the assagatje they had another yesterday he drank diodorus grunted hey hey thats my wine he seized the flask we have unfinished business before we go riding off to fight the boy king the tyrant for instance he looked out at the horizon on their right the borysthenes flowed down to the euxine sea on the left the sea of grass rippled in the wind as far as the eye could see and then another forty thousand stades or so herodotus claimed i dont want to fight alexander i dont want to see more fascinating barbarians id like to retire to olbia and be rich kineas rode along hips moving with his mount he hurt and despite weeks in a cot in srayankas wagon or because of them he felt sore in every muscle things change kineas said diodorus nodded too true the peace faction took over in athens while we were winning this campaign kineas laughed which also hurt athens seems very far away diodorus nodded he handed his flask to the silent temerix thats what i mean when i left athens with you i thought my heart would break when we were cracking dariuss empire i used to dream of the parthenon then we fought this campaign now athens is too far away to remember and im a gentlemen of olbia now i dream of finding a wife and buying a farm on the euxine he paused im afraid that ill end up in a yurt on the sea of grass kineas had stopped his horse unconsciously he was looking straight at the stone hed seen in his dream and the day seemed colder hera kineas said he spoke aloud a prayer for divine protection diodorus was looking at him its just as i dreamed it kineass voice was hushed the stone is broader at the top when we dig it up the bottom will be shaped like a horses head well flip it over and the horse head will mark satraxs grave diodorus shook his head but as the sindi dug away at the deep soil around the stone he became thoughtful and when the shape of the stones hidden base was revealed he rubbed his beard in annoyance remember when we were just mercenaries diodorus said again they buried the king in the old way it was the last act of the army that had won the battle at the ford of the river god and even as the men cut turf in the rain kineas could feel the spirit that had animated them flowing away like the rising river at their back carrying the rainwater to the sea the greeks did their part diodorus niceas philokles and kineas cut turfs side by side their cloaks soaked through and the rich loam under the grass turning to sticky slime on their hands and feet around them for stades sakje and greek worked together every warrior cutting enough turfs to cover a man and his horse then the cutters carried the turf to the builders almost all of them sindi tribesmen from the farms up the river earth people the sakje called them or dirt people they dug out the chambers of the barrow and reinforced them with heavy timbers floated down the river from the forests in the north once satrax had stood at this ford and asked kineas if he would like to go north to see the forests and now the king was dead kineas shook his head at the ways of the gods at moira and tyche fate and chance he straightened and rubbed his hip which hurt like fire with every trip he made back to his own pile of turf he could only carry one block of earth and grass at a time his right shoulder was better but the long cuts on his bridle arm and his left leg still gave him trouble diodorus and niceas and philokles had wounds too and they were working by his side kineas was determined to do his part without complaint but on his next trip his left forearm hurt so much he had to put his turf on the ground and sit in the rain i want a bridle gauntlet he said parmenion had one philokles nodded i suppose temerix could make you one he said his tone expressed his view that too much armour was effeminate look at that niceas said pointing at the new kurgan at the mound marthax the old kings warlord and srayanka the old kings niece were bickering their fists raised and their voices audible across half a stade the two had shared the burden of design and construction but they could agree on nothing they quarrelled about the kurgans size and shape about the location of the internal chambers about the orientation of the door and their own roles in the final rites when kineas saw srayanka whether in fleeting assignations or carefully arranged chance meetings she smelled of loam and spoke only of marthaxs perfidy she tried to hide her anger but out on the plain the warriors knew too much of the quarrels of their leaders they cut the turf and mourned and worried about the future in addition to turf each warrior was expected to bring a gift to the kings barrow around the base of the square of earth more sindi dug a trench a long row of tethered horses most of them chargers all brilliantly accoutred waited to be slaughtered for the burial the battle had cost the allies thousands of men but the campaign as a whole had bound them together sakje and sauromatae and euxine greeks today they all laboured together almost without orders to build a mighty grave for the dead king of the sakje the turf bricks rose from a wall to a block and then to a squat pyramid of grass as ten thousand men and women made their offerings of earth and gold and as the afternoon dripped into the evening the clouds began to break and the weeks of drizzle gave way to a soft evening the last courses of turf went up to the truncated top and torches were lit then kineas and a dozen of the lesser baqcas of the various clans hoisted the stone he had chosen and dragged it up to the top of the kurgan and positioned it carefully none of the baqcas questioned his choice or his right to be there and they were a silent and worshipful coven as they did their work by the time the stone was in place and a song had been sung over it darkness had fallen and more torches were brought forward even as kineas walked on a pair of trees laid as a bridge the horses in the trench below began to shy and call they were afraid they were right to be afraid marthax and srayanka took turns pulling the chargers down first grabbing the headstall and then giving the killing blow with a short sword slashing the beasts across the neck where the muscle was soft and the artery close to the skin they shared the task as cousins and priests but kineas could see the iron in srayankas spine and the careful set of her shoulders and a season in the saddle shared with marthax allowed kineas to recognize the same tension in the big sakje warlord each was resolved to be seen to be worthy of kingship the competition had started kineas wished they could settle it quickly the euxine greeks had other concerns and they needed a steady hand out here on the plains kineas wished that he was sure that srayanka was the queen the sakje needed or even that marthax was fit to be a king he wished that the boy for all his failings and his desire to take srayanka for himself had lived he wished that many men had lived nicomedes and ajax priestly agis cleitus and his son leucon varo of the grass cats and countless others many of them friends and companions laertes whom he had known from boyhood who had followed him across the world and back but of all of them satrax the king was the one whose death affected every man in the army satrax was the man who bound the army together and his death signalled an end the torches flared and spat in the last of the rain to the west stars were appearing in the sky the ground stank of horse blood and the light of the torches glared fitfully on gold and iron and wool marthax wore red as was his right as the commander of the dead kings bodyguard he had the kings sword across his arms and with it he climbed the pyramid of earth and grass until he stood on the top srayanka dressed from head to foot in white skins decorated in blue hair and gold cones climbed behind him carrying the kings helm this she placed with reverence at the very apex of the pyramid then she took the sword from marthax she raised it into the darkness thunder rumbled in the distance and the crowd of warriors made a noise like the sigh of the wind over the plain of grass victor in two great battles hammer of the getae lord of ten thousand horses she called kineas understood her slow sakje well enough he had heard her practise this chant for ten nights again the warriors seemed to sigh young like a god swift in battle terrible to his foes lifetaker lord of ten thousand horses she called and again they sighed marthax stood behind her his arms crossed wise like a god goldgiver great in peace and council lord of ten thousand horses she said the sword in her hand unmoving she had arms like bundles of iron rods as kineas now had reason to know satrax had helped to unite them but he had also been a reckless adolescent intent on taking srayanka for himself kineas was not altogether sorry he was gone he was the king of the sakje she shouted her voice suddenly deep and wild and at the last word she reversed the blade and plunged it into the grass the warriors gave a great shout a bellow of sorrow and anger and victory and loss and then they turned away to the banquet that awaited them a feast on the new mound a last feast with the old king they ate and drank and wept and bards sang songs of the battles and they were like brothers and sisters all the greeks and the sakje and the sauromatae one last time ataelus the massagetae warrior who led kineass scouts introduced the messenger from the east with a sweep of his arm fifty days ride to the east on a good horse with five more horses for changing beyond the kaspian farther than the lake of the sea of grass farther than sauromatae for riding fifty days and not for resting there is the queen of the massagetae ataeluss eyes roved around the open tent was packed and there were more sakje all around he stood straight fully conscious of the importance of the occasion this man for being my cousin qares speaks for the queen ataelus stepped back the messenger of the massagetae was shorter than ataelus and had something of his look black ringlets like a spartan a windburned face and a round nose like a satyr he wore a red silk robe over silveredbronze scale armour that winked like a hot fire in sunlight in his hand he held a short sakje sword with a hilt of green stone he brandished it at the council of chiefs and greek officers who sat in the fire circle in front of satraxs empty wagon sakje rules of council allowed any interested person to attend so hundreds of men and women many armed and dozens of children gathered on the council hill they were never fully quiet and the murmur of their comments and the sigh of the wind forced the speakers to shout to make themselves heard the messenger of the massagetae had a deep voice and it carried well keepers of the western gate he shouted and eumenes still stiff from wounds interpreted in a tired voice queen zarina lady of all of the riders of the east calls upon you to come to the muster of all the sakje iskander who the greeks call alexander king of macedon threatens war on the sea of grass zarina requests the aid of the assagatje he waved the sword she sends this the sword of cyrus as a token of her need let iskander hear the thunder of your hooves and feel the taste of your bronze arrows srayanka stepped forward and accepted the sword there were cheers from the crowd of onlookers but also hisses of disapproval let zarina fight her own war shouted a young war chief of the standing horse clan he tugged at his braids in annoyance and who are you cruel hands to take the sword of cyrus eh eh give it to marthax parshtaevalt one of srayankas chiefs clouted the standing horse on the shoulder silence he roared srayanka is the kings heir kineas listened to the dissenting opinions and wriggled on his stool next to him philokles sharpened a twig with his belt knife theyve just had a war philokles said quietly they dont want another srayanka held up the sword and waited for silence i accept the sword of cyrus for the assagatje she shouted we will not send ten thousand riders to the east tell zarina we have already fought iskander in the west she turned to the crowd but will we leave our cousins alone to face the monster did the east not send us lot lot shouldered forward the sauromatae prince was tall and blond and paleeyed past his first youth but still in his prime he had a new scar that ran across his face from his right eye down to the left corner of his mouth when he came up to srayanka he reached out and she handed him the sword he raised it over his head and the crowd was quieter when he spoke his excitement and his thick eastern accent made him difficult to understand just as you needed our horses he called now queen zarina asks in her time of need even a tithe of your strength would help i promised zarina when i rode west that i would bring the assagatje back with me will you make me a liar he turned to kineas and will our euxine allies desert us olbia and pantecapaeum and all the cities of the euxine have benefited from our alliance will they stand by the tribes in turn eumenes had to speak quickly to keep up with lot and the effort of translating the difficult dialect was exhausting the young man kineas put a hand on his shoulder and felt the heat of fever in the bare skin he turned to philokles take this young man to his bed kineas said shush he ordered eumenes my sakje is good enough for this despite his claim kineas glanced around for ataelus ataeluss greek wasnt of the first order but he could translate well enough ataelus pushed forward with his wife samahe lord he asked help me speak kineas said ataelus took a stand by kineass right shoulder kineas rose i am not the lord of the euxine greeks he shouted ataelus translated kineas went on speaking slowly halflistening to ataeluss version i cannot speak for olbia or pantecapaeum when the phalanx of olbia has settled the affairs of our own city we will be ready to listen to plans for alliance and war in the east we are faithful allies but we are not yet ready to talk prince lot shook his head and this time he spoke more carefully his accented sakje coming out in a rhythmic cadence as if he declaimed an epic poem ataelus still struggled to keep up for being noble allies for holding field brave standing fast but now he says no king of sakje no army of sakje no allies to go east to massagetae fight monster says he is for weeping marthax rose he walked to the centre of the circle but he did not ask for the sword of cyrus he was a big heavy man with a ruddy blond beard and a big belly he was the bestknown war leader of the sakje the kings cousin his sword arm and one of two possible contenders for the kingship of course they are for going home he said with ataelus trailing his words kineas was adept enough at listening to marthax and he followed the sakje directly listening to ataelus with half an ear to check his own translation my people are going home to bring in the harvest and ship it down the rivers marthax said satrax dreamed of taking an army east to the massagetae he was a great king but he was also a boy in his heart he wanted a great adventure now he is gone marthax crossed his arms on his chest and looked at prince lot things change seasons change before zopryon came perhaps we could have sent warriors east to the sun to help our cousins of the eastern gates but that cycle did not come to pass different suns rose and sank and now we must fill our wagons with grain and prepare to survive a winter on the plains perhaps next spring we could send a tithe of our young warriors east to queen zarina and the keepers of the eastern gate a junior lord of the standing horses stood to speak the same man who had shouted at srayanka marthax bowed to him and went to sit and the young warrior his arm in a sling came to the centre of the circle i am graethe of the standing horse he said he had the accent of his clan which kineas had come to know as the northern sakje accent but he spoke slowly as was the custom in council and kineas could understand him well enough my lord has taken our warriors out on the sea of grass to pass the summer on the wind and to watch our sindi if he were here he would say that zopryon was not the only wolf to threaten our herds but only the strongest the standing horses will not cross the sea of grass to go to the eastern gate let the massagetae see to themselves kineass eyes were drawn to a young woman or perhaps a child who sat behind marthax playing with a bow children were everywhere among the sakje they were allowed unlimited freedom but this was the girl who had called herself kam baqcas child instead of shooting toy arrows she had wrapped the bowstring around an arrow and she was using it to twirl the arrow faster and faster kineas had seen a jeweller in athens using a bowdrill and he wondered if the girl had devised the tool herself she was using it to bore holes in marthaxs great shield of rawhide and wooden slats the bronze arrowhead cutting at the bronze binding and rawhide strings until the whole structure was about to give way kineas reached out a hand to stop her and her eyes met his they were old eyes for such a young face deep and blue like cold water and he stopped the movement of his arm as if he had been stung by an insect she smiled she was a child on the edge of womanhood and her smile was equal parts mischief and wickedness the standing horse droned on in the same vein marthax watched him with drooping eyelids srayanka on the other hand watched the young man as if she might leap at him when he drew breath for another foray she stood up and put out the hand with the sword to forestall him great is the wisdom of the standing horse she said we understand that they took their place in battle and that they will not go east to the support of the keepers of the eastern gate have you more to add the young man bowed his head and said nothing but he glared we welcome your words graethe she pressed a strong hand on the young mans shoulder and he sat one of srayankas young leaders bain laughed and gave a wolf call and graethe flushed srayanka turned and glared at bain silence she said bains face burned with adolescent wickedness but he subsided when urvara rose to her feet daughter of varo the lord of the grass cats who had died in the great battle urvara had her own scars she was a bowmaiden and kineas could remember her rallying her people to support his final charge she was just sixteen or seventeen with heavy brows and full lips and arm muscles like the cords on a siege engine bain loved her the grass cats look to the rising sun she said pointing her riding whip out to the east her voice was deep and calm for such a young girl and kineas had to admit that srayanka was no fluke the sakje formed remarkable women amazons he thought we will go east to the rising sun and lend our aid to the keepers of the eastern gate she said simply your clan lands are to the east marthax said without rising your homes are on the way his tone was dismissive we came here she said simply my father died for the king of the assagatje i know what you think marthax i care not she sat srayankas eyes turned to kineas and he rose most of the men around marthax made growls in their throats before he uttered a word marthax rose as well he was almost a foot taller than kineas you have no place speaking here he said kineas caught his eye and held it my clan is the largest here he said he looked around the tent some eyes were openly hostile graethes for instance others were friendly parshtaevalt of the cruel hands nodded as if to make him speak kineas stepped up to marthax we died for you he said we stood at the ford and held zopryon until you came my people died my friends died he raised an arm that was covered in scars from his part in the fighting and looked around the tent my city is still held by the tyrant and his garrison of macedonians and i must see to it or my clan will be living among you for ever he shrugged and turned his back on marthax which made the skin between his shoulder blades itch as he faced the crowd and he thought when did i cease to trust the warlord we must be allowed to go and reclaim our city before the citizens despair and take a rash action he whirled on marthax and you cannot pretend to give me orders and then silence me in council you were satraxs warlord who are you now marthax had not expected kineas to attack him nor had srayanka who had the worried look of a woman who doubts her mans wisdom marthax stepped back as if stung and his face became as red as his jacket who am i marthax asked i am the king of the sakje he bellowed pandemonium the clan leaders all rose to their feet some denouncing others cheering or shouting to be heard marthax seized the moment i am the cousin of satrax and i was his warlord i have commanded all the tribes in battle and emerged victorious in every contest i led the expedition against the getae when we slaughtered them in battle he reached behind him and brandished his shield i am the strong shield of the sakje he roared it dropped to pieces in his hand and silence fell on the tent the silence of terror and omens a high voice came from behind marthax like a mans falsetto or the voice of a young child you may be king until the monster is dead and the eagles fly it said marthax threw the shards of his shield to the ground and reached for the girl but she rolled under the edge of the tent and was gone you are beautiful srayanka said she was stretched by his side in a welter of furs rain made a seashore sound on the roof of her wagon and her calloused hand stroked him with lazy familiarity the language barrier kept him from responding in kind he could tell her that she was beautiful he could say that her breasts were beautiful her legs were beautiful a catalogue of physical attributes but none of them would catch his meaning in greek he would say that her beauty amazed him every time he saw it unveiled that he would never tire of watching the complex curves where her hard stomach met the rise of her hips that the lush velvet of her skin and its contrast with the fighting leather of the palms of her hands excited him as no other woman ever could but her greek was still limited to fifty verbs and a few hundred nouns and the sort of subtlety that made compliments accurate and personal was as far beyond her as the comedy of aristophanes so far their lovemaking was occasional often hurried and always secretive that they were partners was suspected and resented throughout the dwindling camp and especially tonight the sakje were riding away the council had ended in division and anger before srayanka had been formally recognized to speak so that she could lay her own claim to kingship but the sides were drawn all of them together the sakje and the olbians had fought a great battle the greatest battle any of them could remember ten stades north of the wagonyurt where kineas lay entwined with srayanka the field of the ford of the river god was still an unquiet grave three full weeks after zopryons army had died on it more than twenty thousand macedonians and their auxiliaries and allies had perished and almost a third that number of sakje and a thousand euxine greeks the dead outnumbered the living and the rain that fell like the tears of repentant gods rotted the corpses so fast that men feared to touch or lift them carrion creatures still thronged the field feasting on the macedonian dead who lay defenceless their armour stripped off men said the field was cursed kineas felt it like an open wound because the unburied dead haunted his dreams demanding burial it was beyond his experience that one army might be exterminated and unable to bury its dead it frightened him as did the voices of the many dead what are you thinking airyanam srayanka asked she propped herself on an elbow she was naked in the damp heat and not so much shameless as unconscious that anyone would wear clothes on such a hot night inside her wagon she disdained clothing as long as the damp and the heat prevailed kineas forced himself away from the battlefield in his mind and back into the wagon with her marvellous godgiven body and her ambitions and her caprice but he was honest im thinking of the unburied dead he said food for crows she said with a shrug she made a gesture to avert unwelcome attention from the creatures of the underworld naming calls kineax she put a finger to his lips dont speak of the dead so lightly they were enemies now they have passed beyond the field is cursed and the sindi will avoid it for a generation and then the grass will grow greener for the blood and then the grain will grow that is the way and the mother will take their unquiet spirits down to her breasts and in time all will be healed he watched her sitting like a statue of aphrodite ticking off her points about the dead on one hand as if she was a scholar in the agora you should be queen he said you have the head for it he rubbed his untrimmed beard and scratched his head i should not have spoken today i spoke out of turn and i fear hush she said she shook her head her unbound hair swaying marthax is stronger than i kineas she watched him for a moment in the light of the single oil lamp i will not lead my people to war against each other marthax will not be a bad king you know him he does as he thinks he must she sighed i worked hard to prepare the people to accept you as my consort she shrugged and her heavy breasts rose and fell and the sheath of muscle moved from her hips to her neck and he wanted her but he was a disciplined man and he kept his hands to himself she turned to face him instead they fear you because i am foreign he asked tracing a finger along her flanks and because you are baqca and because you love me you are like a creature from a song of heroes and you bring change she kissed him because you could rule them with a rod of iron and they fear that he shook his head i have no desire to rule he said but you would if you thought it was for the good of all she rattled off the phrase good of all in his own intonation he shrugged listen my love together we could force the will of the army make it your army there it was said his own officers wanted to be gone but he had to offer to support her claim she took his head in her hands and kissed him no airyanam i thank you but no it was satraxs army and he is dead she made a motion with her hand indicating the unknowable will of the gods if he had lived another year i would have been his heir we would have been she shrugged again i will not pit greek soldiers against clansmen kineas sat up with her what will you do he asked what will we do she was silent for a long time and they could hear thousands of horses cropping grass the everpresent sound of the sakje camp somewhere men shouted by a fire i will go east she said many of the younger warriors are still willing even eager to fight the monster in the east i will tell marthax that i will lead them and he will accept because that path avoids war kineas had felt the decision coming he had known from the first that srayanka favoured sending an expedition east to support the massagetae he hadnt imagined that she would go herself but he said and stopped himself but what of us was too selfish for him or for them her choice was clear and she had made it like the hero she was could he do less i must seize olbia from the tyrant he said then i can join you just like that and the future was set join you echoed in his head echoed in the world of dreams like prophecy and suddenly he was cold she shook her head no that is what is the greek word folly madness you greeks have so many words for stupid thinking you can be the tyrant of olbia you can be king they worship you like a god you have made their city something and your army is now a strong one the grain will make you rich your hoplites will make you secure and your alliance with the sakje will make you great kineas knelt and took her hands i dont want to be rich he said and even as he said the words he knew that they were as true as they were trite the image of a long trek east to fight alexander at her side stretched away like a dream and beside it the daytoday world of patronage and politics seemed like a nightmare i dont want to be tyrant or king i want you he grinned like a boy i have had a dream that i will defeat alexander she smiled then and he feared her a little because it was not the smile of love but the smile of triumph then you shall have me airyanam and we will go far she said and put her lips on his even to the mountains of the east and alexander when they had made love again she wrapped herself around him despite the damp heat and their sweat and together they fell asleep and no sooner had he acknowledged the pleasure of such sleep her smooth hard leg pinned between his than instead he was astride the tree a branch clenched between his legs farther along the branch two eagles demanded food from a nest between srayankas thighs their screaming demands drowned out her words when he reached out to her the larger chick nipped him and he fell he glanced around and all the warriors behind him were strange all sakje in magnificent armour and he himself wore a vambrace of chased gold on the arm he could see through the slits of his helmet he was dry sitting tall on a horse the colour of dark metal and the battle was won the enemy broken and across the river the survivors tried to rally in the driftwood and by the single old dead tree that offered the only cover from the bronze rain of sakje arrows and he raised srayankas whip motioned three times and they all began to cross the river he was ready for the arrow when it came and he almost greeted it he knew it so well and then he was in the water hands grabbing at him he was dead and walking the battlefield but it was another battlefield issus and the dead were rising all around him like men woken early from rest and then they began to walk rubbing at their wounds some stuffing the intestines into their guts they tried to speak but failed and many shrugged and then greek and persian they all began to walk away from the battlefield and they were joined by the dead of gaugamela more persians and fewer greeks and macedonians all shuffling along in a column of the wretched dead a single figure emerged from the column he had two deep wounds one in his neck and another under his armpit and his breastplate was gone and his face was slack and empty of feeling rotted and black but kineas could recognize kleisthenes a boyhood friend who had fallen in a nameless fight on the banks of the euphrates kineas could feel that kleisthenes was sad indeed sadness came off him like heat from a fire his jaw almost naked of flesh three years after his death was working but no sound emerged he reached out a hand and rested his finger bones on kineass deeply scarred forearm what kineas demanded speak kleisthenes jaw worked again more like a man chewing meat than a man attempting to speak his mouth opened and sand came forth the rotting figure gathered the sand as it vomited from his mouth catching it in his hands he held it out to kineas as if it was a payment or an offering even in a dream kineas was terrified he stumbled back wake up now or die in your sleep said the voice of kam baqca noises in the dark and too much motion and the wagon moving as if a man was climbing aboard kineas rolled off the furs and his hand was on his sword as the heavy felt that covered the wagon was ripped back and an arrow skidded along his back with a line of pain there were torches in the dark and the glint of weapons srayanka was just coming to her knees and he pushed her down as another arrow bit deep into the wood of the wagon bed kineas roared the dead in greek a black shape came up on to the wagon bed with a sword in each hand kineas was still half asleep his mind in another world the creatures face was black the thing hesitated an all too human reaction and then he swung both weapons together the fog of the dream dropped a little more from kineass eyes and he saw that his opponent was a man with charcoal on his face even as he realized this he sensed that the mans clumsy attack was a distraction and as he ducked and parried he turned his head to see another black figure at the other end of the wagon illuminated by the oil lamp it was raising a bow also hesitating as if unsure what to shoot kineas didnt hesitate he cut at his first adversary a long overhand cut with a wrist rotation at the end so that the mans clumsy parry failed to stop the reversed curve of the egyptian blade from cutting into his neck he fell without a cry his head half severed and black ink pouring out in the light of the moon kineas leaped back and cut at the archer and his blow severed the bow at the grip one end of the cut bow snapped back and raked his hand making him drop his sword with the pain and the other end slashed across the bowmans face kineas kicked him and the bowman fell back off the wagon another arrow whispered out of the darkness and passed between kineass legs alarm attack kineas shouted in sakje he could hear sounds of movement from the fires around them and shouts in the distance but the attackers were silent and otherworldly and the hair on kineass neck began to stand up even in the darkness he could see the hilt of his sword gleaming against the carpets of the wagons floor and he bent and seized it the grip was slippery with blood from his wound and he bent to wipe his hand srayanka rose with her naked back to him a bow in her hand and shot before ducking again behind the cover of the benches out in the dark a man urged a general attack kineas could hear him demanding that they all go together and argument in sakje human kineas took a deep breath and steadied himself the last fumes of his dream forced down his brain was working they were men mere men not vengeful spirits who would have no need for weapons and orders and they cared nothing for him they were here to kill srayanka that was the only explanation for the hesitation of the first attackers it appeared that marthax had found a solution to the succession problem the plan and its execution followed each other in two breaths and kineas leaped down from the wagon bed and charged straight at the voice in the darkness the egyptian sword cut down a man who was just turning to confront his rush and he pushed past the collapsing body and ploughed straight into a man in full armour the man cut at him and their blades rang together as kineas parried kineas stepped back placing the armoured man between him and a fire so he could see the man hed cut down was screaming no monster from the dark world then masking all other sound the armoured man swung at him and kineas retreated ducking the heavy blows but his ripostes fell on thick scale armour he didnt have enough light for fine work and he felt the press of time at any second he could get a blade or an arrow in the back and his naked flesh made a better target than these blackpainted attackers he caught the next swing on his sword pushed the other blade high and stepped inside the mans guard then he grappled the armoured man around the waist and threw him to the ground where every scale on the mans armour scraped against his naked chest this was the fighting that greeks trained for and kineas knew there was no sakje who could stand against him down to the ground fingers in the nose thumb in the eye knee in the groin a spatter of blood the smell of shit and his man was dead kineas listened while he wiped off the gore of the mans eyes on the tunic under his armour and his gorge rose because it was one thing to practise killing a man so close and another to do it the wounded man was still screaming and off to the left closer to the wagon there was fighting he lost precious seconds finding his sword again and ran terrified that he had taken too long and she was dead she was not dead she was on the wagon shooting down and just below her philokles the spartan stood with his heavy black spear he had an arrow in his shoulder and another in his lower leg and two dead men at his feet a ring of adversaries stood beyond the reach of the black spear there were more on the other side of the wagon where srayanka was shooting kineas came up silently and cut the egyptian blade going cleanly through the mans neck and then he cut again low severing the tendons in a mans legs then he bellowed athena and philokles made two rapid lunges with the spear a man slammed into kineass side and he was suddenly in a melee blades all around him apollo from the other side of the wagon diodoruss voice kineas fell both feet sliding out from under him blood on wet grass and a blade whistled through his hair he rolled towards philokles rose to his feet and cut at a new adversary who parried and came in close to grapple kineas caught at his sword hand and froze it was parshtaevalt kineas he said and fell back then the two fought back to back for an eternity perhaps a minute their backs touching the warmth of that touch meaning life and safety apollo again in the darkness and then another and another and the pressure on kineas was lifting he cut low always dangerous in the dark and his man went down with a grunt kineas leaned back until he felt parshtaevalts back and then took a deep breath athena he called apollo came the cries and then they were all around him he pushed through them a horde of greeks and sakje mixed urvara stood as naked as srayanka a bow in her hand with a ring of grass cats around her behind her bain the young war leader of the cruel hands stood with a bow covering urvara he threw back his head and howled like a wolf kineas had no time for them he ran for the wagon srayanka still stood in the wagon beautiful and terrible by the light of the oil lamp she had a shallow cut on her neck and it had seeped blood all down her right side so that she seemed to be a statue in black and white marthax did this she said youre alive he said marthax did this she repeated he means war fool fool why did he not talk to me he fears us too much kineas said he was conscious that they were both naked indeed everyone but the dead and wounded attackers was naked she nodded get me the chiefs who are loyal to me she said to parshtaevalt who had come up kineas turned to find niceas at his shoulder the man was shaking his head what do you intend kineas asked the women he loved to take the people who will go and run she said otherwise there will be war when the sun rises and the sakje will never unite again he betrayed us and his guest oaths urvara said srayanka shook her head perhaps she spoke rapidly in sakje too rapidly for kineas to follow and the younger girl nodded to kineas she said either this attack came from one of his men and he will be forced to accept it in the day or he planned it himself and he has another thousand horsemen waiting to fall on us with the dawn i am taking my people and the grass cats and any others who will come now now i go north and east i will ride north to the city of walls if they admit me i will take money and grain from there i will follow the sea of grass kineas stood in the dark still fogged from sleep with the sicksweet wash of combat in his veins and tried to think i will never see you again he said she smiled at him and climbed down from the wagon to embrace him that is the will of the gods she said but i think that we are not two clansmen lost on the plains you are baqca and i am a priestess you will see me she said go and reclaim your city then if you wish it follow me you can go by sea to the bay of salmon any euxine greek can show you the way we will be slow we will have many horses and wagons and children if you miss us on the sea of grass find us at marakanda on the trade road it is the greatest city on the plains marakanda he asked a city of myth he shook his head if i can catch you so can marthax kineas said his wounds hurt the new ones and the old ones more but what she was saying made sense and the plains were not as empty as he had once thought there were roads and paths marthax will not want to catch me she said she grabbed his head and pulled it down and kissed him until despite his wounds and the blood on her he was conscious of their nudity and the darkness i must be the lady srayanka she said breaking the embrace and pushing him away go listen to me he said listen my love i can rally my men in an hour marthax will never stand against us the grass cats and the cruel hands and my phalanx will break him in the dawn you will be queen she smiled a smile that showed him that she had thought all of this through and didnt need his political guidance however much she loved him i would be queen of nothing she said this way my child will be king now go child he said dumbstruck as she pushed him away and yelled for hirene her trumpeter and then he was no longer a lover or a warrior but a general and he had work to do srayankas column with herds of horses goats and sheep and a hundred heavy wagons moved east just after dawn kineass greek cavalry shadowed their departure and ataeluss scouts watched marthax marthax was mounted the rising sun flashing on his gold helm and his red cloak and his warriors had their bows in their hands but they didnt move the sun was high in the sky by the time kineass hoplites marched south but they were going home and they were happy to be moving they sang the paean as they marched past marthaxs men they had fought macedon together and neither side seemed interested in conflict kineas ignored diodoruss hand on his bridle and his admonitions and rode clear of his column he trotted up a short slope to where marthax massive and red sat on his war charger a great beast easily two hands taller than any horse in the army around him sat his knights and his leaders kineas knew them all they had been comrades until yesterday are we enemies kineas asked without preamble marthax looked sad he shrugged will you marry her he asked the lady srayanka yes i intend to marry her kineas had a linen sack in his hand and he toyed with the knot of the string securing the neck of the bag then we are enemies marthax said slowly i cannot allow you the king of olbia to wed my most powerful clan leader kineas met his eyes and thought of the last year planning a campaign and executing it with this man at his side his humour his great heart his invincible size and clear head you are making a mistake he said quietly i am not the king of olbia i do not want your throne and nor do you marthax a man who never quailed who knew no fear glanced away looking over the plains i will be king he said and i am not satrax to tolerate her scheming she will wed me or no one kineas shook his head you are being a fool who is giving you this advice she will not marry you you dont even want her and her claim to the kingship is better the first time you make a mistake the tribes will desert you marthax turned slowly back to him he shrugged i have spoken my words he said if she returns from the east she will be my subject my wife or a corpse kineas opened the sack and dropped the contents on the ground she was almost a corpse last night he said around them the knights shifted and a murmur of discontent came like a breeze over grass marthax looked at the head lying there you have murdered one of my knights he said but he appeared more confused than angry this one attacked her yurt in the night kineas said pointing at the head of graethe he had fifty men they are all dead kineas looked around you are making a terrible mistake marthax and someone is leading you to it kineas raised his voice let me be clear you and you alone have split the clans this one paid for his attempt to murder the lady now she is riding east to fight the monster you will let her go you will let her go he took a deep breath i am the lord of the walking spears and of the flying horses and i am baqca harm her on her march east and i will burn your city of walls and no merchant will ever come to the sea of grass again go and fuck yourself greek marthax said rising to his full height in the saddle no gold nowhere to sell your grain the end of your way of life how long will you be king marthax will you last out the summer kineas rode his horse right up close marthax towered over him but kineas was too angry to be afraid go before we do you harm marthax said through his teeth and then the child was there pushing between the horses unseen she stood by kineas he will pretend to be king until the eagles fly she said they will pick his bones and take this carrionimp with you marthax said kineas scooped the girl up turned his horse and rode back to his column she squirmed for a while and then dropped off his lap to the ground i must get my horses she said kineas let her go a scythian even a child was nothing without her horses and kineas understood the pull even as he watched her running across the grass towards the royal herd he saw prince lot and the sauromatae mounting up they had fewer remounts and no wagons and lived in tents made of heavy felt there were two hundred of them with another fifty wounded on travois dragged behind spare animals prince lot saw him and approached his greek was terrible and his sakje stilted after a minute kineas had gathered that the sauromatae wanted to travel with the greeks kineas rode on calling for eumenes the boy scarcely a boy now had three wounds and was still in a wagon but he was well enough to sit up and translate he says i wish to travel with you i spoke to the lady she rides too fast for my wounded he says srayanka said that you would follow her by the bay of the salmon he says i can show you the road and my wounded will have more time to rest eumenes listened to lots last phrase and gave a weary smile he pointed at the fading dust cloud that was srayanka and her clans he says she should have been queen kineas smiled at the first good news of the morning i will be delighted to have you with us he said he repeated this until prince lot smiled broadly kineas also had a handful of sakje prodromoi ataelus had recruited them almost twenty now with liberal promises of horses and made them into his own small clan including his new wife none of them had deserted even the two standing horses and they gave kineas eyes far in advance of his little army wherever they marched another of old xenopons recommendations even though the man had probably been too conservative to approve of kineass use of barbarians for the role kineas waved ataelus in from his intense watching of the main sakje host and told him to include the sauromatae in his calculations ataelus grunted he rode over to the column of travois where the adolescent girls rode lighter horses with their bows in their hands for them for scouting ataelus said he spoke to lot who nodded kineas turned to leave them to it and started for the head of the column but suddenly ataeluss wife screamed a war cry and other scouts were shouting he turned his horse in time to see the lanky figure of heron the hipparch of the hippeis of pantecapaeum bringing up the rearguard he wore his perpetual scowl as he watched his troop ride by there was movement from marthaxs camp out on the plain of grass a dozen horses ran behind them came a troop of sakje all in armour they were slower than the horses they pursued and they were losing ground farther back marthaxs main line had begun to move forward shit kineas said he knelt on the back of his ugly warhorse and tried to see through the dust already rising over marthaxs line the man had three thousand cavalry no more and he couldnt hope to win a pitched battle against kineass hoplites and his greek cavalry but he could do a lot of damage by harrying kineass march he could force kineas to waste weeks he could cost kineas the city of olbia and leave the army stranded on the plain at the mercy of the winter it all went through kineass head in a few seconds as he watched a little girl on a white horse galloping towards him with a dozen more pale horses following her the riders pursuing her were abandoning the chase as herons rearguard blocked their way contenting themselves with curses and bowwaving heron himself continued to scowl as he shouted orders to his hyperetes lot had formed the sauromatae into a block and wheeled them into line with herons troop the hoplites were already deploying to the right philokles the spartan had taken his young men out of the line and was running to heron his transverse scarlet plume bobbing as he ran the greeks had been at war all summer they could form line from column in any direction at speed without wasted orders marthaxs line halted well out on the plain a good two stades clear of the greeks and the sauromatae ataelus had an arrow on his string and he was looking at kineas kineas shook his head and rode to the girl what the fuck have you done he shouted at her harsher than he meant taken what is mine and what is yours she said around her milled two dozen horses all white and flashing silver you have stolen the royal chargers kineas asked my father said that after satrax you would be king she said with the simplicity of childhood satrax is dead they are yours except for the white foals those are mine kineas was tempted to put her over his knee ares and aphrodite heron give me four men with a flag of truce to return these horses heron told off troopers who looked afraid he rubbed his forehead and allowed his bronze boeotian helmet to dangle on its cheek strap i prefer to be called eumeles he said at least in front of my men kineas smothered annoyance heron took himself very seriously but when he wasnt acting like an ephebe with his first lover he was becoming a fine officer very well eumeles kineas said the sakje host sat silently at a distance prince lot took kineass arm he spoke quickly emphatically gesturing at marthax in the opposite line ataelus kneed his horse forward and translated for saying marthax not king give horses marthax for being king you for making him king ataelus nodded the girl laughed you dont want to be the one who makes marthax king of the sakje do you kineas sat and cursed but he didnt want to offend srayanka he wished she was there to advise him the two forces watched each other for an hour and then the sakje began to trickle away they had discipline when they needed it but marthaxs force was not as unified or as singular of purpose as kineas had feared before his eyes men and women rode off collected their camps and departed small lords first and then great lords in three hours marthax had just two thousand horsemen at that point kineas ordered his line to form column he briefed his officers memnon and philokles for the foot diodorus and heron and lot for the cavalry they were careful and slow forming a hollow square from a line was not childs play and they marched with the spears on the outside and the cavalry in the middle with the wounded and the baggage it was late afternoon when kineas began to believe he had broken contact he knew how quickly marthax could be on him if he wanted to move the rain had started again thunderclouds racing over the plains and pausing to soak the whole column and fill the river over its banks so that brown water ran among the trunks of trees and washed more bodies off the battlefield the ugly bloated things passing down the river next to them the glory of battle philokles said by his side he was watching two bodies bob in the current kineas had halted his horse on a rise just twenty stades south of the great bend philokles stepped out of the ranks of the phalanx to stand with him in the distance half a dozen sauromatae girls sat their horses in a rough skirmish line on a river bluff watching their backtrail philokles pulled off his helmet and ran his free hand through his hair kineas ignored the spartans mood if xenophon had had a dozen sauromatae girls hed never have had to worry about scouting and hed never have written anabasis philokles said his voice was flat kineas laughed his first real laugh of the day ive spent all day thinking about xenophon he said because we have to get to olbia alive philokles asked marthax wont follow us his army is going home i saw kineas said you saw my friend but did you think marthax went to council to represent the faction that demanded that the war be over now he pays the price even if he wanted to fight us or srayanka he couldnt kineas hadnt thought of it that way i knew i kept you around for a reason spartan im an olbian citizen now philokles said dont you forget it they stood together as the army passed on their way home at last and the rain fell the late summer rain flattened the sea of grass and filled the rivers to a depth that only a mounted man could cross even at the best fords it washed away the blood and carried the glut of corpses at the ford of the river god down to the sea where the people of the city of olbia watched them float by bloated gross and stinking being merchants most of them kept a rough count of what they saw and smiled grimly the rain fell for days so that every hearth was wet and there was no place in a greek house that was really dry as woollen blankets and woollen tunics clung on to the damp smoke rising over the city told of fitful fires from sodden wood and the scent of woodsmoke competed with the reek of wet wool and the underlying itch of wet manure those who counted the corpses in the river looked at the gates and the roads beyond and wondered what had transpired on the sea of grass they waited for word from their brothers fathers sons and husbands lovers virtually the whole free male population a few had floated by women wept men looked at the citadel above them with its macedonian garrison and their curses rose to heaven as the days passed and the rain continued to fall the curses flowed like the rain the imprecations began to flow by day and by night a pair of macedonians farm boys really for all their airs were caught in the agora and beaten by slaves the garrison commander dion responded savagely throwing twothirds of his garrison into the market at dawn and killing a dozen men including a citizen after that the city was quiet dion told the tyrant that he had the city cowed the tyrant called him a fool and drank more unwatered wine next evening another macedonian farm boy had his throat cut the fools that did it dumped his body at the gate of the citadel dion gave his orders in the morning hed make them rue it the rain had made the city wall slick the men climbing along the wall in the damp darkness were grateful for the heavy hemp rope with knots every span and even more grateful for the strong arms of their friends and slaves at the top of the wall they were up in a few terrorfilled moments embraced and gone into the dark were too far from the gate an older man said his recent wounds pained him and his temper never really quiet was savage if they have archers on the walls were all dead the men around him were leaning forward keen as hunters listening for any sound from the city below them the nearest walls were two stades away every man stood at the head of his horse both hands up ready to stop a whinny or a neigh shut up the hyperetes said watch for the torches they ought to be in there by now caught on the wall maybe someone else said shut the fuck up the hyperetes whisper carried all the savagery of his full voice feet pounding through the lower city too much noise and no help for it wood slamming on stone as a woman leaned over her balcony to see what the fuss was and seeing bronze slammed her shutters home breath hoarse legs pumping feet splashing through the wet ordure of the city without care for the slime shields pounding away against backs the straps cutting a mans wind and leaving bruises on his shoulders eyes straining to follow the man in front turn after turn so that the long file of men wound like a worm through the slave quarter where most free men went only to get a quick fuck against a house if that not this time the citadel another wet wall of rock towering into the dark and no ropes no friends inside of course that was not exactly true the postern gate was open dion could feel that the city below him was restless he expected resistance he was glad of it time to clean house follow me boys he said to his men a quarter taxeis of raw macedonian recruits just enough professionals to act as fileclosers thered been talk ugly talk about the number of macedonian floaters coming down the river but he wouldnt hear it dion had his orders as his duty men opened the citadels main gate he turned to address those behind him kill everyone you find in the streets he said his voice carried well in the rain so that even the men pressed flat against the gate towers could hear him clearly their faces would have made studies for statues of furies at a wave of his hand their heavy sandals rang out on the citadels arched roadway and dions garrison trotted into the lower city off in the murk towards the east the sun was rising men could see the shields carried by the men in front as they ran their heavy tread carrying a sound of menace a beggar was caught at the entrance to the agora and his guts tumbled out in his lap as dions sword opened him the pair of torches rose above the dolphin gate like a pair of red stars rising in the morning the horsemen mounted in seconds vaulting on to their mounts backs with the practice of a summer of hard riding no longer concerned about the sounds their horses might make after a month the time for waiting was over now ordered kineas they rode down the long hill by the inner harbour and then straight through the gates which stood wide open there were bodies on the ground but the horses didnt shy the horses had seen corpses before their hooves pounded the ground and they were louder than the tramp of dions men and more deadly and where they passed they left only the silence of expectation in the citadel no sooner had the garrison passed the gates than the men pressed against the wet rock walls leaped into the courtyard and butchered the watch the men coming off the walls had been as raw as their victims once but that was months ago and the macedonian farm boys died with as little regard as lambs at a sacrifice a few had time to scream and one filecloser tried for the gate he died with a heavy black spear through his back plate of tawed leather dion cleaned his sword against the beggars rag of a cloak and led his men into the clear space of the agora he was intelligent enough to wonder why the agora was empty not even a single merchant opening his stall but the cowards had to know that he would come for blood he formed his men in a tight phalanx their motions masked all sound but something made him uneasy and as the last man fell into his place dion called for silence hoof beats dion was just turning to bellow an order when a spear punched under his armpit the point emerged through his neck and he lived only a few seconds just long enough to watch the wolves fall on his phalanx they looked like wolves kill them all memnon bellowed as he ripped his spear out of the corpse kineas led his men up the road that ringed the citadel still expecting a shower of arrows or redhot sand but there was a torch waving enthusiastically from the great tower over the arched gate and then he was in the echoing tunnel his horses hooves beating hollowly against the paving stones then into the citadel itself new blood in the courtyard a dozen macedonians dead in their armour and philokles with his twenty picked men facing fifty keltoi of the tyrants bodyguard across the courtyard in the cold iron dawn kineas could see the tyrant and his persian minion at the back shoving more keltoi out of their barracks kineas turned to antigonus eumenes hyperetes and one of kineass few original troopers antigonus was a gaulish kelt himself tell them to step aside and well accept their service or they may stand and die antigonus rode into the relative silence of the palace courtyard resignation could be read on every face even the tyrants the citadel had fallen the sounds of a successful escalade were the background to antigonuss voice the road to the agora was full of city hoplites hunting the last of the garrison the screams of the farm boys could be heard all the way across the river and dions head was already on a pike over the main gate antigonus spoke in the keltic tongue of his fathers gesturing repeatedly with his spear at the men behind him and once at the tyrant the leader of the keltoi a tall thin man in a heavy golden torc and massive gold bracers stood forth his heavy thracian sword held comfortably in both fists he had tattoos in heavy blue that ran up his legs under his tunic and emerged again at his neck to cover his face he nodded easily to antigonus and then to kineas when he spoke his voice was sad his greek while accented was good we eat his food we take his coin we swear oaths the heavy kelt shrugged we die here he pointed with his sword at the cobbled courtyard of the citadel the tyrant laughed it was a bitter laugh he stood straight and came forward a little drunk as was his wont well some things are worth buying he said from the safety of the last rank of the keltoi you came for my city after all he said to kineas kineas felt the rage of gods grip him but for this man and his plotting agis and laertes would still live so would nicomedes and ajax and cleitus and the king i came for you traitor he said thickly the tyrant shrugged odd how the public interest and selfinterest coincide i dont imagine i could offer you gold to let me live fight me man to man kineas said if you win my men will set you free he began to ride around to the left to get a clearer look at the tyrant at his knee another horseman moved with him it was a foolish challenge and he felt like a fool for making it he could barely stand after his wounds at the ford of the river god and the attack in the dark single combat was for young men who wished to be achilles not middleaged men in love the tyrant glanced around and laughed grimly no i think not even if i won these folk would butcher me like a heifer kineas shook his head in denial only a dishonest man fears the dishonesty of others he quoted the tyrant spat spare me your philosophy and the rest of you you plan to follow him will you be as loyal to him as you were to me eh kineas ready to ride the lion kineas sat straighter i have no intention of taking control of the city he said stiffly the tyrant smiled you lie he shrugged but what do i care your ignorance will bring about the deaths of every man here but ill be dead my share in this story ends here doesnt it the hippeis were calling for the tyrants death they began to chant the keltoi readied their shields my ignorance kineas said ignorance i am ignorant of what sort of man would betray his own city to a foreign garrison and i did not come to bandy words with such a traitor the tyrant stood up straight like a soldier on parade he stood out from his keltoi listen to me you aristocratic bastard he said the world is about to go to shit when alexander and parmenion go to war listen the monster has lost his mind we need antipater it will all come apart now everything the boy king did will collapse like a cheap market stall in a wind and all his wolves will fight over the spoils are you ready for that behind kineas antigonus translated the exchange the keltoi chieftain listened patiently his sword cocked back over his shoulder a pose he could apparently hold for hours behind the keltoi on the steps of the palace the tyrants persian steward produced a bow an elegant recurve bow that glowed with wax he raised it at kineas but before he could shoot he took an arrow in the chest and a second in the groin and he fell screaming his squeals pierced the morning damp and made men even hard men flinch the tyrant turned to glance over his shoulder he grinned a mad deathshead grin then he seized a dagger from the belt of the kelt nearest him and flourished it high like an athlete your turn kineas he shouted by all the gods hama i release you and your men from your oaths and so saying he plunged the dagger into his own neck close at kineass side awaiting his chance ataelus the scyth put his knees to his charger and it rose rearing and punching both hooves like a boxer at the top of its attempt to climb the heavens he leaned out over his chargers neck and fired two more arrows over the keltoi unlike the persian the tyrant went down without a sound antigonus spoke again in the guttural keltish tongue the chieftain hama spared the tyrants twitching corpse a respectful glance and nodded i think we live he said and placed the point of his sword carefully on the ground our oath dies with him around him the keltoi sheathed their weapons or laid them carefully on the wet paving stones philokles walked over to the tyrants corpse like ares claiming his spoil he died well the spartan said may i do as well kineas agreed kineas managed to order a guard to protect the keltoi from harm before a mob of his own soldiers put him up on a shield and carried him off to the agora and even as the city rang with his acclaim he thought of srayanka already out on the sea of grass travelling east taking the city had been the easy part because satrax the king was dead and the sakje alliance was shattered and alexander the king of kings was out on the sea of grass and the old gods of chaos were laughing the funeral of cleitus was a citywide occasion almost every household had dead to mourn between the battle at the ford and the storming of the city and the tyrants excesses the dead of the great battle were long since buried and the trophy long since raised at the edge of a field of unburied enemies a cursed spot to any greek and an uncomfortable thought but the dead were still fresh in the memories of their city and needed words said in public to mourn them cleitus who had once been the citys hipparch and remained the leader of the aristocratic faction until his death remained unburied because the tyrant had denied his family the right to conduct the funeral he had feared the public reaction now kineas had the tyrants ivory stool he did not wear a diadem and he did not reside in the palace instead he awoke as usual at the hippodrome barracks where the tyrants ivory stool leaned against the wall like a reminder or an accusation he was in some middle ground between the absolute power of the tyrant and his old role as hipparch and strategos or military commander he ordered that the funeral be a public occasion and he was obeyed the army had been in the city for five days there were athenian ships in the harbour demanding grain and the first boats full of grain were on their way down the raging river to the port the autumn market was opening on the plain north of the city although it would be weeks before cargoes could be gathered for the athenian merchants who owned the largest ships in the world on the third night he had gone to the stables and bridled the getae mare and ridden her out of the dark gates past all the farms to the beginning of the sea of grass as the sun rose he sat at the edge of her world and he reached out like a baqca across the plains that rolled under the new sun past the camp where marthax chewed on the ruin of his plans then north and east around the bay of salmon and there she was rising in the dawn naked to the waist cleaning her teeth with a twig and she gave a start as he came near and grinned he awoke cold and tired like a drunkard but he was happy again the next night kineas dreamed of srayankas tribes and their horses riding over the sea of grass and of the dead and of the tree he tried to banish his dreams he longed to be away into the dawn on the high ground north of the market camped the little army of sauromatae city slaves had built them cabins against the late summer rain but prince lots presence at his side served to remind kineas if he needed any reminder that the sailing season was closing in and he needed to leave soon if he was leaving at all five days in olbia had revealed a host of reasons why he could not leave the assembly had met twice and both times he had risen to announce his departure and both times he had instead spoken of how many of the tyrants laws had to be repealed and how essential it was that the rule of law be restored on the fourth day the assembly made him archon he went back to the barracks and talked with philokles and diodorus for hours and then he sat on the ivory stool in the agora and announced the funeral of cleitus the funeral day promised to be warm and sunny and the procession began to form under the stars of earliest morning the first stars and clear sky they had seen in days diodorus had the hippeis mustered before the first blush of dawn on the sand of the hippodrome he had good officers under him veteran hyperetes and every man in the ranks had served in a battle some in three niceas grunted they dont look the same as they did last year he said kineas rubbed his chin it was not a day for laughter but he smiled no he said as he grew used to power he was learning to say less and think more no they dont niceas grunted again weather looks better sky is clear behind him the hippeis were falling in where five hundred had mustered on the morning of the great battle fewer than four hundred would answer today the survivors of cleituss fourth troop now under petrocoluss command were the strongest they had come late for the battle and ridden only in the final charge and despite having the oldest men experience and fine horses had kept most of them alive but nicomedes was dead and his hyperetes for the third troop ajax of tomis lay in a canvas shroud sewn tight awaiting shipment to tomis to be buried by his father their troop had fought alone against a tide of macedonian horse and died almost to a man the survivors made a silent file in second troop leucon had died in the rain and confusion of the night action and eumenes despite three wounds and the treason of his father sat at the head of first troop with cliomenedes eumenes father cleomenes had been instrumental in handing the city to the macedonians either for personal gain or because he truly believed that macedon promised the city a richer future he had died out on the sea of grass leaving his son a rich man and a deeply unpopular one clio was the youngest of their officers petrocoluss adolescent son who had commanded the troop through the harrowing last hour of the great battle and he was struggling to maintain authority despite his popularity and obvious courage the two young men had all the youngest cavalrymen and his troop had seen the longest fighting if not the hardest the homes of the wealthy up by the statue of apollo were still full of wounded from this troop but for the moment only twenty troopers sat behind them only second troop commanded by diodorus and now holding all the mercenary cavalrymen looked prepared for another day of battle a summer of campaigning had made diodorus into a fine commander and antigonus the gaul was the complete hyperetes calm authoritative and efficient his appointment made the integration of the tyrants former bodyguard simpler because he spoke their language and could claim some birth that impressed even hama their chieftain there were almost a hundred of the keltoi and they were natural horsemen recent enmity meant nothing to them more important were their endless taboos and rituals a greek officer might quickly have fallen foul of them antigonus had no such troubles but for political reasons only hama and a dozen of his keltoi rode in the second troop today the rest were in their barracks this was a parade of the victors and there was heron the tall young man was no less gawky in the saddle than walking the grass and even the tallest of the captured chargers was too small for him his troop men of pantecapaeum a neighbouring city and not really under kineass command had also taken part in nicomedes desperate defence on the left of the army they had been luckier and broken earlier and fifty saddles remained filled but their victory was bittersweet they were now exiles victory in the great battle had empowered the democratic faction in their city and the troop of rich men aristocrats to a trooper was no longer wanted at home kineas and diodorus had been the victims of just such an event they knew the sting of exile the humiliation and the endless small slights that citizens imposed on stateless men but heron was a prickly fellow at the best of times and he sat in his resentment disdaining attempts to improve his lot and his men followed his lead they remained with kineas because most of them had nowhere else to go finally formed on the far left of the line of hippeis there were ataeluss twenty sakje half of them women they wore odd combinations of greek and sakje armour rode expensive horses and were covered in gold they were exotic and dangerous and they would march in the procession despite the protests of certain city factions as would the sauromatae all the survivors had benefited from the battle by acquiring the very best of the macedonian armour and the heavy macedonian chargers on the day of battle the macedonian horses had been starved and tired but a month on the grass even in the rain had restored some of their spirit and five days access to the granaries of the city meant that every man was mounted like a prince diodorus cantered up and gave a precise salute his fist clenched on his breastplate kineas returned it rains stopped diodorus said he grinned his sharp features and freckled cheeks glowing with pleasure he enjoyed command and he worried less about the future than kineas maybe theres hope after all he added you look beautiful i must say why are you so fucking cheerful kineas asked im tired of rain and coenus is better this morning his fever broke in the dark he ate diodorus tilted his helmet back so that his red hair showed at the brow you have to see him its a gift from the gods kineas felt his mood lighten immediately coenus one of his oldest friends one of his best men a scholar and a fellow exile had been given up for dead so kineas had a different look about him as he took his place at the head of the hippeis and led them out into the streets through the gate and along the edge of the market to where the priests of apollo waited with the phalanx all the men of the city there were gaps in the phalanx just as there were in the hippeis but in his present mood kineas was glad to see that there were also men back standing in the ranks who had ridden into the city in the wagons of wounded every morning another two or three of the wounded tried on their armour and either crept back to their pallets defeated or fought their way through a fog of dizziness and weakness to attend the musters the recoveries had peaked now kineas who visited the wounded twice a day had little hope for the men who continued to lose weight or whose wounds were still fevered sitalkes the getae boy was one coenus had been another with light wounds that had suddenly festered and he had been down since the army left marthax if he had recovered there was still hope for the rest movement in the sauromatae camp roused him from thought prince lot was mounting a captured macedonian mare he waved to kineas and kineas waved back a glance over his shoulder showed him that memnon was some minutes from having the phalanx in order he pressed his knees against his own captured macedonian charger and cantered painfully across the shortcropped grass his hip burning with the rhythm of his unnamed chargers hooves lot raised a fist in greeting rain stops he said in greek he pointed to the sky over kineass shoulder where dark blue could be seen at the base of the sky in the east like the glaze on an expensive cup rain stops kineas agreed the sauromatae had fought in every action that kineas had led their superior armour and battle skills had kept many of them alive despite a battering and most of their saddles would be full if they mustered their horse herd bolstered by their share of the macedonian and getae spoils numbered almost a thousand guarded by shifts of wellarmed young women and they were eating olbias farmers out of their grain yet another problem kineas had to face rain stops and ground hard again lot said hard ground makes good road east the sauromatae prince leaned close need to ride need to be home kineas switched to sakje a language where he was stilted and lot was more fluent at least a month until we ride cousin kineas had adopted the habit of addressing the senior tribal officers as cousins elder or younger as age and rank dictated lot had a magnificent if barbaric blond moustache and his right hand parted his moustache and then twirled each end a habit that was sometimes imitated behind his back need to ride he said in sakje my nephew worries me kineas shrugged nephew he asked wondering which of the many sauromatae or even sakje counted as his nephew my wifes sisters son my heir he worries me lot stared out over the sea of grass as if he could see the man riding in the distance never thought to be gone so long lot looked chagrined didnt know the sea of grass was so big kineas raised a hand to forestall him lot had done his share far more than his share to win the victory at the ford of the river god since that day lot had never ceased to press the sakje and the greeks to follow him east where his tribe and the others of the massagetae confederacy the eastern sakje were hard pressed by alexander and the five days of waiting at olbia was making him edgy patience kineas said today we mourn our dead lot bowed his head then he waved to his own nobles who began to file out into the column niceas had kept a space for them they were aliens but they were allies and with ataeluss little troop of prodromoi they represented the whole realm of the sakje out on the sea of grass a realm that might now be an enemy of olbia kineas shook his head to clear it because this was the day of mourning and politics would have to wait helladius now chief priest of apollo joined him helladius was an old and very conservative priest but he had held his ground in the phalanx memnon had noted that the old fool had ended the battle in the front rank and done his part you will lead the procession helladius asked kineas shook his head no we will return to the ways of the city before the tyrant came the priests of apollo will lead followed by the hippeis and allies and the phalanx and then cleituss body and his honour guard i will ride with them helladius nodded the god smiles on you archon he said i have interpreted the omens for you all summer and i say that you are beloved of all the gods but of apollo and athena most of all kineas narrowly avoided a cynical reply hubris was never becoming and helladius was not a sanctimonious fool or not entirely thank you he said carefully the funeral procession marched on time because the army had a summer of campaigning behind it the priests sang and the phalanx caught the tune and sang with them scandalizing the younger priests who had not served with the army and then as the procession entered the gates helladius began the paean and all the soldiers took it up thousands of throats straining to praise apollo the same chant that had settled their nerves in the last seconds before the macedonian charge dolphins of gold rose on either side of the gate and the temple of apollo was visible at the end of the long street of the gods and still the paean lifted to the heavens with its song of reverence and victory kineas found that he could not sing for the tears in his throat and when he turned his horse to see the column he could see that many men were weeping openly as they sang and yet the power of the paean waxed as if all the missing voices were there too and for a moment the distinction between the world and the world blurred and kineas heard ajax beside him his pure voice full of pride and nicomedes harsh croak in his ear and agis who so revered the god and many others when the paean ended so many men were weeping that it sounded as if the god was mourning the sound of their laments echoing from the temple and across the agora the sound magnified by the men too wounded to march but standing in orderly ranks at the foot of the temple steps and the women mothers and sisters and lovers and wives the troopers carrying cleituss ashes climbed the steps and placed the ashes where kineas and petrocolus had placed a bronze statue of nike from nicomedes house the priests sacrificed in the temple and blessed the people and the city and then helladius raised his arms and turned to kineas kineas dismounted from his macedonian charger and walked up the steps his thigh burning at every step and making his climb painful and slow he stopped below the statue of nike so that her wings were over his head and turned to the crowd i speak to the whole city the citizens and the wives and the mothers and the farmers and the smiths and the greeks and the sindi and even the slaves he said a year of speaking in public had improved his manner and the occasion gained him their utter silence nothing i can say will make the dead greater in the eyes of the gods he said cleitus who gave his life to save you from the tyrant failed because he was one man but all the dead together drove the macedonian from the field and slaughtered him and all together killed the tyrant and freed the city all the dead sacrificed themselves equally for the triumph of the city he looked out over the agora with the feeling that he could see many men who were dead and perhaps even some who were not yet alive when we faced zopryon in battle no man flinched the sakje stood and the greeks stood the hippeis stood and the hoplites stood the citizen and the mercenary stood together indeed the slaves stood their ground and this city has twice a hundred free men today because as slaves they did not cower virtue freedom and liberty is the concern of every man not a few politicians or a few soldiers he said i will chide you olbia in full view of all the gods you allowed a few men to make your laws and paid a few men to guard your walls and those few became your rulers politicians and mercenaries he bellowed and his words echoed off the walls cleitus died to pull down the tyrant and failed because he was one man murdered for his voice we waded in blood to stop macedon aye and lost hundreds of the flower of this citys best men but on our return we overthrew the tyrant in an hour with a thousand willing hands helping us into the city and into the citadel women threw down ropes to the army slaves led us to the open postern of the citadel never let this lesson be lost on you citizens of olbia women of olbia slaves of olbia in your hands are the keys to the city and the keys of your own chains chains chains chains echoed off the walls had cleitus lived he would now be archon kineas continued he was an honest man a powerful speaker and a trained lawmaker but he is dead kineas paused and then pointed at another nike also from nicomedes house beside him on the steps had he lived nicomedes might have been archon he desired the role with all his ambition and he had the talents to lead the city to greatness but he fell in the battle kineas looked out over the crowd where men shouted lead us then as if they had been paid he shook his head i have acted as archon for a few days to see the dead buried and to see good laws passed but i will not be tyrant and if i stay either i will make myself your lord or you yourselves will make me take the power i must go east to fight against macedon and to preserve the liberty you have just won our allies on the plains still need our help and i will go with them and when i return you will be a strong state with a free assembly and i will vote my vote and grumble when my motion is defeated drinking my wine in a wine shop and cursing that my side had the fewer voices then he told the story of the campaign from the first rumour of zopryon to the assembly voting for war through the campaign against the getae and on to the last battle a long story so that his voice was hoarse when he reached the end he named as many of the dead as he could from young kyros who had been a great athlete the first to fall in combat to satyrus oneeye who died in the courtyard of the tyrants palace he recounted their names and their deeds until the crowd wept again that so many had fallen and as he spoke the sun rose to its full height in the sky when he fell silent helladius saluted the disk of the sun and all the people cheered and then they sang i begin singing of demeter the goddess with shining hair and persephone her daughter fair slimankled too hades took her zeus gave her to his brother farseeing lord of thunder they sang the hymn to the end and another to apollo as the sun rose strong on their faces and then kineas raised his arms for silence and summoned the assembly for the next day he bowed to the grave markers of cleitus and nicomedes as if the men were standing with him and then he limped down the steps of the temple mounted his horse and rode away that night kineas dreamed again of the column of the dead and again a dead friend vomited sand this time graccus a longdead boyhood friend but the tone of the dream changed so that he was less afraid and then a woman came to him i have come to offer you a choice she said she had the white skin of a goddess and she looked like his mother or like someone else someone as familiar as his mother he smiled at her in the dream because it was such a greek dream a welcome relief from the strain of the tree and the animal totems and the alienness that had infected his dreams since he came to the plains she was dressed in a peculiar garment a bellshaped skirt and a tight jacket that bared her breasts kineas had seen such a costume on a priestess once and on old statues state your choice goddess kineas said she laughed when he called her goddess if you remain here you will be king you will rule well and wisely and your city will be the richest in the circle of the seas kineas nodded if you travel east your life will be short she said kineas interrupted her without intending it this is achilles choice he asked if i go east i will live a short life but a glorious one and all the world will know my name she smiled and it was an ill smile the sort that terrified men do not interrupt me she said hubris has many forms kineas stood in silence if you go east your life will be short and no one but your friends and your enemies will know your name kineas nodded it seems like an easy choice he said the goddess smiled she kissed his brow he awoke to ponder the meaning of the first dream a true one he was sure he needed kam baqca to interpret it but it occurred to him that helladius was not such a fool as he sometimes acted the second dream needed no interpretation kineas arose with the kiss of the goddess still lingering on his forehead and a sense of wellbeing a very different mood from the day before the sun was shining on the sand of the hippodrome and down the hall sitalkes sat up in his bed and coenus asked for a book and the mood of the barracks changed as if the sun had come inside indeed kineas wondered if men were simpler creatures than he had supposed that a day of sunshine could so change their mood or serve to mend wounded men who had abandoned hope and turned to the wall expecting to die men recovered in the citadel and in their homes as if the touch of the sun on their skin carried the healing of the lord of the silver bow kineas had a morning meeting arranged with the athenian captains in his role as the acting archon but well before that he donned his secondbest tunic and a light chlamys and slipped out of the barracks alone he purchased a cup of fruit juice from a stall in the agora ate a seed cake in front of a jewellers stall purchased a fine gold ring for srayanka and then climbed the steps of the temple of apollo just as the morning prayer to the sun was finished kineas waited until the last of the singers were clear of the vestry before he approached the priest and he was surprised to see the young sakje girl walking with the maidens the priest was putting away his shawl examining the fine wool for cleanliness as he folded it helladius kineas said the lord of the silver bow has seen fit to restore the sun helladius nodded my lord withholds his anger kineas raised an eyebrow anger helladius shrugged who can know the thoughts of the gods he said but i imagine that my lord was less than pleased at the unburied bodies at the ford of the river god and withheld the sun just as the lord of horses sent his waters to cover the death at his ford kineas nodded slowly his mother and his uncles had been such believers those who saw the hands of the gods in everything it might be as you say he admitted or not said helladius i commit no hubris what brings you here to honour my morning prayers who is the sakje girl kineas asked her father was a priest a great seer despite being a barbarian his daughter is always welcome here helladius smiled at her retreating back you knew kam baqca kineas asked of course helladius said he travelled widely he wintered here with us on several occasions he took kineass arm and led him into the temple i think of kam baqca as a woman kineas said we knew him before he made that sacrifice helladius said and then shook his head i dont think you came here to discuss a barbarian shaman no matter how worthy i have a dream kineas said you have powerful dreams archon indeed i saw when the sakje treated you as a priest helladius turned and began to walk towards the temple garden come let us walk together kineas fell in beside him yes the gods have always seen fit to provide me with strong dreams helladius nodded it is a great gift but i feel the gods will towards you and it is strong i dont need to be a priest to tell you that the interest of the gods is not always a blessing he gave a half grin the poets and playwrights seem to be in agreement on that point kineas stopped and looked at the priest as if seeing him for the first time helladius was hardly a humble man and the wry humour he had just showed was not his public face helladius raised his eyebrows do you receive more than dreams archon does the will of the gods come to you awake or the voices of the dead kineas rubbed his chin you make my head spin priest he looked around the quiet temple i do not how can i say this i am not aware of other messages from the gods but perhaps i do not pay attention properly tell me what you mean helladius rubbed his chin listen archon you have priestly powers i have seen this happen elsewhere among the medes it is common not every man with priestly powers becomes a priest do you know of all the types of divination kineas shook his head he felt like a schoolboy his tutor had taught him about divination there are three types i think you were tutored by a follower of plato not a pythagorean i hope there are as many types of divination as there are birds in the air but i will tell you a little of the three main types so that you may be on your guard his voice took on a professional tone my father taught me that there are three types of divination there is natural divination the will of the gods shown in the flight of birds for example i perform this right every day or perhaps in the entrails of a sacrifice such as i performed for you in the field yes then there is oracular divination the will of the gods spoken directly through an oracle these can be difficult to interpret rhymes archaic words often they sound like nonsense or leave the hearer more confused by a riddle than ever he was by the question and finally there is the divination of dreams the will of the gods spoken through the gates of horn into our sleeping minds helladius shrugged the dead may also speak in any of these ways or rather we may divine their speech for instance there is the kledon where a god or the dead may speak through the mouth of a bystander or even through a crowd so that a priest may hear the speech of the god in random utterings he smiled i am waxing pedantic i fear tell me what you dreamed kineas told him his dream about his dead friends helladius shook his head i have seldom had such a strong dream myself he said in irritation i see why the barbarians treat you as a priest and you have had this dream twice kineas nodded or more helladius furrowed his brow more kineas looked away as if suddenly interested in the mosaics of the god that covered the interior walls of the temple garden he didnt want to say that he had had the dream every night since the attack on srayanka or that he had heard voices in the mouths of other men the kledon helladius rubbed his hands together it seems possible to me he said carefully that the dead of the great battle wish to be buried and they speak through your old friend kineas nodded i wondered but i cannot arrange the burial of ten thousand corpses even if i could call on the labour of every slave in this city and today it seemed to me that kleisthenes was offering me a gift if only i had the wit to take it helladius nodded my first interpretation is the obvious one i am sorry to say that i cannot dismiss it just because its achievement is impossible the gods make great demands on the other hand your thought about the gift is interesting i shall pray and wait on you later in the day kineas bowed thank you for your help helladius the priest walked with him to the top of the steps the former archon never came to the temple without fifty soldiers and a bushel of scrolls containing new orders and taxes he said i wish you were staying kineas shook his head i meant what i said helladius it would start well but in a year i would make myself king or you would demand it of me helladius stood at the top of the steps his pale blue robes blowing in the august wind may i advise you my lord he asked and then taking a nod for permission he carried on men like you it grows the voices come more often and the dead haunt harder he shrugged as if embarrassed to admit even this much what can i do kineas asked helladius shook his head obey the will of the gods he said kineas nodded slowly i do to the best of my ability that is why you would have made us a great king helladius said he waited until kineas was halfway down the steps just even with the stele for nicomedes the gods love you he called so that every man in the market on the temple steps heard him kineas let a smile wrinkle his mouth he didnt answer openly quietly to the stele of nicomedes he said the gods loved oedipus too he shook his head at helladius to no one at all he murmured look how that turned out his first official meeting of the morning was with the athenian captains he unfolded the ivory stool and took it outside to the sands of the hippodrome so that he could watch the morning drills while he heard the captains and niceas and philokles stood on either side of him the admiral of the allied fleet demostrate stood to hand he was a native of pantecapaeum a wealthy merchant a former pirate and a pillar of the alliance that had defeated macedon and like kineas he knew that the war was not over the athenian captains were cautious and deeply respectful which made him smile archon their spokesman cleander began the blessings of all the gods upon your city and your house cleander knew kineas of old they had shared a tutor during early boyhood but he seemed to feign ignorance either from respect or fear kineas inclined his head feeling like an imposter or a playactor welcome to olbia gentlemen he said may apollo and athena and all the gods bless your venture here and your journey home they exchanged platitudes religious and otherwise for several minutes before cleander got down to business we know how hard the war has been on your city he said carefully kineas fingered his jaw yes he said cleander glanced at his companions they were powerful men the captains of athenss grain ships with large investments in their cargoes even though none of them was an owner we ask respectfully whether sufficient cargoes to fill our ships will be gathered before the end of the sailing season cleander flicked a glance at the citadel which loomed behind kineas do you have enough grain to feed athens that was the real question kineas nodded the war has slowed the flow of grain from the sea of grass he said many of the farmers had to leave their farms when the macedonians advanced and the allies needed grain to feed their army and to feed the horses of the sakje this oblique hint just the lightest suggestion of an alliance between the euxine cities and the sakje caused a rustle among the athenian captains despite this i am confident that we will raise enough grain to fill your holds the main harvest will not be in for a month your eyes must have told you that the war never came here that our fields are full of grain as are the fields on both banks of the river as far north as a boat will float the grain coming to market now is last falls grain whose sale was interrupted by early storms and the rumour of war it will trickle in but the trickle will become a rush after the feast of demeter demostrate cleared his throat and then smiled when he had their attention all the grain from the borysthenes will come here to olbia he said and my city pantecapaeum will have all the grain from the north that is brought down the tanais river into the bay of the salmon we are gathering our cargoes even now cleander smiled as did the other captains that is good news indeed but a month is a long time for our ships to sit idle at wharves can you arrange for the grain to come more quickly in past years we have filled our ships before the feast of demeter his tone carried the conviction that for the grain fleet of athens no favour was too small kineas locked eyes with cleander no he said there is not enough grain to fill your holds now cleander spread his hands archon we are not fools even now your market sells grain to the barbarians who camp north of the market allies from the war and you buy grain yourself send them home and let us buy the grain athens needs the grain right now now kineas smiled no he said im sorry cleander but i think i know more about what athens needs than you athens needs a steady strong ally on the euxine and she needs alexander kept in his place not looming over the sea of grass and all the eastern trade my army needs to eat but our ships sit idle cleander said perhaps and he smiled like a man of the world perhaps you would prefer to sell us some of your private store of grain youve been purchasing it for weeks kineas appeared to consider this for a moment that is the citys grain not my own or rather the armys grain purchased from the sale of the armys share of the loot of our victory which you could now sell to us at a profit cleander said except that i need that grain to feed the army kineas countered the army is home cleander said the need for grain is past kineas frowned it was deliberate he meant to intimidate and he did all the athenian captains stepped back you are in danger of telling me my business cleander kineas said i need that grain and he paused for effect i need your ships cleander choked kineas smiled and stood up cleander dont be a fool i was born and bred in athens and i would never harm her or her grain fleet cleander gave a sly smile i knew who you were before i left athens he said he shrugged your athenian birth might serve only to make you a worse tyrant think of alcibiades he reached into his cloak and produced a scroll i have a letter for you kineas frowned from lycurgus he asked it was his faction and demosthenes that had exiled him and arranged for his service to olbia cleander shook his head from phocion he said phocion was athenss greatest living soldier as a general he had defeated philip of macedon thebes sparta he was one of the finest soldiers in the world and he was a friend of alexander kineas had learned his swordsmanship at phocions hands he took the letter with something close to reverence cleander laughed your father and phocion were the leaders of the faction that favoured alexander he said imagine and now youve destroyed a macedonian army kineas shrugged phocion fought philip and they were guest friends kineas said cleander gave a wry smile what would polyeuctas say kineas grinned their tutor polyeuctas a pupil of plato had never ceased to harp on the evils of unfettered macedonian power and on the treason of alcibiades despite being a venal man who took too many bribes he had been a good teacher and an able politician i think about him all the time kineas said and then we heard you were dead cleander said pah not so dead kineas said and they embraced now that i seem less the foreign tyrant perhaps you would care to lease your ships to me for a month he said i have a great deal of macedonian gold at my disposal he outlined his proposition and the athenian captains began to haggle he was offering them good money for their time and adding to the value of their cargoes as well but they saw further margin for profit and the risk to their ships was real cleander attempted to demand a reduced tax on grain at the dock but kineas wouldnt budge the grain tax was the citys greatest revenue but the possibility of loading large cargoes of the purest euxine fish sauce fresh from the bay of salmon and the guarantee of escort from the navarch of pantecapaeum sealed the deal cleander offered his hand and they all shook i hate transporting horses cleander said and the other captains agreed im worried about the depth of water at the entrance to lake maeotis said another gentlemen kineas said rising from his ivory chair those are professional problems and i expect you to resolve them we are agreed cleander shrugged you drive a hard bargain like an athenian kineas laughed and they retired kineas grinned at diodorus who grinned back you win the benevolent despot award diodorus said played to perfection ill get you a mask and you can play all the tyrant roles in the theatre ill settle for a cup of wine kineas said his second official meeting of the morning was with leon nicomedes former slave leon waited for him in the portico of the barracks leaning against one of the carved wooden columns and watching while the athenian captains haggled indeed he had gone inside and tasted the soup that simmered on the hearth added a spice and brushed kineass cloak before arranging it neatly over the armour stand while he waited kineas caught his eye several times in an attempt to apologize but leon smiled wryly each time and found himself another small chore when diodorus had brought kineas a cup of wine and departed to see to some horse training leon finally stepped forward archon he said i greet you kineas rose from the ivory stool and grasped his hand free man leon he said citizen if i understand yesterdays assembly the assembly had moved to make all two hundred of the armys freed slaves into citizens less a patriotic gift than an acknowledgement that the holes in the phalanx and the economic life of the city needed to be closed up immediately leon smiled he was dressed in an elegant tunic a fine piece of wool with a narrow green stripe at the bottom edge it was a valuable garment but it was also one he had owned when he was a slave nicomedes left me half his fortune he said without preamble kineas put his hand on the big africans shoulder welcome to the hippeis he said can you ride leon met his eye he left you the other half he said in the event that ajax died oh said kineas oh leon handed him a scroll we are to divide his goods between us leon looked away and then back i am eligible for the hippeis that is very good and yes i can ride despite his serious news he smiled in fact all nubians can ride his smile faded and became a frown i cannot manage his business he did business based on his own web of friends men who owed him favours men who wanted his patronage i inherit his money but not his power kineas was still struggling with the shock of sudden wealth you must be very rich leon shot him a look even as he began to polish a helmet that had been left on a bench we are very rich he must have loved you kineas said leon rolled his shoulders as if shrugging off an uncomfortable cloak i might say the same of you he loved ajax kineas said outside diodorus and niceas were shouting at each other about horses philokles pushed past them wearing a simple linen chiton and cloak with a broad straw hat and a satchel of scrolls over his shoulder he looked like a philosopher only the width of his shoulders and the exaggerated muscle lines on his arms suggested the monster he became in combat he made me slave leon said and his voice quavered for the first time and now he has made me rich philokles crossed the floor of the barracks to the heavy pitcher that was always filled with cheap wine and poured himself a cup then he poured a second and brought it out to leon on the sand of the hippodrome you look like you need this he said i heard about your good fortune in the agora both of you theres a certain amount of ill feeling he shrugged but it is not universal i want to leave olbia leon said i am sorry to intrude on you archon he drank the wine flicked his eyes over philokles and back to kineas i had to inform you sir philokles dragged over a stool and forced leon to sit drink your wine the archon can spare you some time you are after all one of his men kineas was still wrestling with the riches he had suddenly inherited leons internal crisis was almost easier to bear he says he can ride he said and realized how inconsequential that was to leons revelation i want to leave leon said i cant remain here in his house with his patrons and his relations he shrugged it is not the life i want what do you want philokles asked he pulled up a stool and sat kineas was staring at a wallhanging trying to estimate the value of nicomedes wealth and wondering what he would do with it leons reaction was understandable no man wants to be a slave and leon was clearly not slaveborn but kineas found it difficult to understand the mans lack of feeling he had never worn mourning never appeared downcast and nicomedes had been a very popular man i want to come east with you with the army leon said in return i will help to support the costs to kineas he said before i was taken as a slave i was a warrior he gave a hesitant smile and perhaps in the east i can make trade contacts of my own his face shut down as if at a bad memory or find a life kineas poured himself a cup of wine and drained it leon you helped to save my army you will always have my obligation why ask me of course you can accompany the army you are among the hippeis now you probably own more warhorses than a sakje he shrugged leons mouth trembled his eyes were full of tears and kineas turned away to spare the man embarrassment philokles put his arm around the former slave say your piece leon leon stood taller and shook his head no i am no weakling philokles drank off his wine how old are you he asked leon shook his head perhaps twenty he said there is no shame in asking for protection kineas pay attention leon needs your help and hes too proud to ask like some spartans i have known kineas said its an epidemic among greeks i find philokles agreed a pity it has spread to africa he pushed the younger man forward speak your piece boy leon took a deep breath nicomedes lawyer wants me to divide the estate i think he means to cheat me as a former slave i have no friends slave or free you are a fair man he glanced at philokles as are your friends he paused i have thought this through i want to go east but i want my fortune to stay here and not vanish i want to be a citizen when i return if we hold things in common your name and mine together no man will steal from you and they will think twice before they murder me kineas had never been a fan of slavery in any form but leons description understated as it was that left alone he would lose the fortune and perhaps his life brought home just how effective slavery was at robbing men of their dignity and rights murder you he asked surprised slaves are freed and become rich all the time philokles snorted like a warhorse no my gullible athenian friend people talk about slaves being freed and becoming rich all the time such slaves are the supposed cause of bad politics and the butt of comedians but have you ever met one thais was a slave before she became a hetaira kineas said he shook his head point taken he looked at leon i knew i disliked slavery very well are they really proposing to murder him nicomedes nephew demothenes was just discussing it in the agora philokles said he gave kineas a serious look which kineas interpreted correctly very well kineas repeated he felt a vague anger the sort of feeling he had when he was cheated in the agora lied to about the quality of wine or the age of some fish he rose and took leons hand philokles has been a lawyer let him draw up a document of alliance i seem to remember that you have some skills at mathematics leon inclined his head i do and hard won they were help me compose a logistikon for this little army he said and then you can help me spend some of our money he put his hand on the boys shoulder welcome to my staff his third meeting was the hardest in every way harder still for being so unexpected leon had his head down over a scroll of numbers and philokles had gone to shelve the works he had purchased in the market when sitalkes still hobbling from his wound leaned in the door of kineass private office where the archon sat with his own bag of scrolls there is a gentleman to see you he said he was afraid or deeply moved kineas could see arni another former slave past sitalkes shoulder he rose but he was unprepared for the man who entered isokles he said isokles was the father of ajax ajax who was dead his body wrapped in linen embalmed who had died serving kineas fighting for olbia a hero the mans face was red from grief his eyes haggard kineas he stood silently in the door my son is dead the words tailed off and the man stepped forward and put his arms around kineas and wept niceas who had also loved ajax took the father away and left kineas in peace so that he could read the letter from his boyhood hero phocion of athens to kineas son of nicocles greeting fate which cast you as a soldier of macedon and then as an exile now has raised you high we hear the reports of your generalship for olbia and of your defeat of forces sent by antipater to conquer the euxine cities fools here prate of war with macedon the notion that athens is a power in the world dies hard and men whether old or young will deceive themselves about the power of their city even when i offer them the example of thebes i write to you not as a supplicant nor as a friend of macedon although either role might suit me instead i write as the man who taught you to use a sword the antimacedon party claims you as if you were their possession their slave and claims all of your actions as their own they will ask you to gather your army and march into thrace against antipater when they exiled you and then sent you to olbia you were a tool a sword but now that you are a commander you are the man who holds the sword beware what you cut please send my greetings to young graccus and to laertes son of thallus and diodorus son of glaucus and coenus the nisaean kineas read phocions letter with pleasure because he could hear the mans growl as he said the words aloud and he could see on the scroll where words had been scraped out and others added with care phocion was the greatest athenian soldier of his generation perhaps of all time and one of his fathers closest friends and political allies the second scroll was from lycurgus or rather from a scribe in his service it had no greeting and no salutation your exile will be lifted immediately consider the restoration of amphipolis your next task and athens will again be great amphipolis was an athenian colony in thrace long since taken by macedon the recovery of amphipolis an old ambition of the athenian assembly would require the complete overthrow of macedon as a power kineas made a face diodorus came in from the exercise field fingering a bruise on his arm ares is my witness i need more time to heal little clio just pounded me on the palaestra floor the summer has put muscle on the boy and you are getting old kineas said diodorus winced here is something that will lift the sting kineas said holding out the letter from phocion diodorus read it while drinking wine then sat and drank again he cant have known of the battle yet he said kineas handed over the other message it is not a long journey from the battlefield to this city by river nor to athens by sea for a swift ship diodorus shook his head he began to read kineas rubbed his beard something going on here that is beyond me he said amphipolis are they insane diodorus put down the second scroll yes he said i fear that demosthenes and lycurgus are so desperate to restore their party that they will dare anything and we cost them nothing they can cast us as dice and pay no political cost he looked at the scroll did they lift all of our exiles or just yours all of us kineas said poor laertes hed have done anything to win praise from old phocion diodorus said and then he grinned so would i kineas nodded i thought it would make you feel better you wont take us to war in thrace diodorus asked kineas shook his head im going east he said and if i can find the money and the men ill take an army diodorus picked up the letter from phocion and pointed it at kineas against alexander kineas narrowed his eyes squinting against an invisible sun against alexander he said and then because he and diodorus were closer than most brothers he grinned and said to hades with alexander i want srayanka and to keep her ill war down invincible macedon i swear that i would storm olympus diodorus grinned and put a hand on his knee we all know he said and then avoided kineass blow isokles enduring grief did not pass in a day kineas sent the prodromoi out to find the best landings on the bay of salmon and still the man grieved kineas began the complex problem of moving men and horses by ship sending grain and cash to the selected landing sites and still isokles grieved he moved listlessly around the barracks until leon moved him to nicomedes house kineass house now he came to the barracks every day and sat with the veterans to hear tales of his son tales every man had to tell ajax and his relentless heroism were part of the tradition of the company the boy had been reared on the heady wine of the poet and the feats of achilles had fired his blood he had left a trail of single combats and brilliant exploits across that bloody summer and his father heard them all embellished by the passage of time until ajax seemed ready to take his place with the heroes of the iliad a place accorded to him by every trooper in the hippeis but after three days of hearing his son praised and drinking wine isokles pushed his way into where kineas was surrounded by his staff reading lists of goods to be shipped with his little army and exploded like a nest of wasps hurled on to the floor he didnt need to be a hero isokles shouted without preamble diodorus sprang to his feet isokles had the gait and the look of a madman his eyes were wild and he had a sword kineas put a hand on his friends sword arm it is grief he said isokles was yelling the sword almost forgotten as he shouldered his way towards kineas he was handsome and young he was well loved smart enough at business i sent him to you for a single summer to knock the foolishness from his head and he is dead dead for ever dead in a war that was nothing to him niceas grabbed him from behind pinning his arms but isokles thrashed nearly breaking niceass grip not an easy thing to do philokles tackled him around the waist and isokles hammered his elbow into the spartans face breaking his nose in a fountain of blood you killed him all of you with your talk of glory and honour isokles spat the words glory and honour like poison kineas considered reason he had warned isokles that his son might die a year or more ago at a pleasant symposium in tomis but isokles was beyond reason and although kineas had a lifetime of practice at watching those he loved die and moving on the death of the golden ajax had cut at him too so that he could seldom pass the room where the mans body lay wrapped in linen without touching it or shedding a tear we all loved him kineas said quietly if you loved him he wouldnt be dead isokles came to a stop in the middle of the room with niceas pinning his arms and philokles his face a mask of blood hanging gamely around his waist you used him for his heroism like other men use a prostitute for her sex he wept bitterly that was a charge that bit deeply ajaxs relentless heroism had been a foundation of the daimon of the hippeis kineas was silent he didnt have an answer for isokles grief and he felt the justice of the mans charges he had never wanted to take ajax but he had wanted the boys youth and enthusiasm for his company and for his own morale isokles had stopped struggling now he stood in the middle of the barracks floor weeping all of you have stories of his heroism he might have died in any of them you revelled in it you stood back and watched as he threw himself at death niceas was right at isokles ear he had the mans arms from behind your son was a great man he said but youre a fucking idiot he took a deep breath isokles sagged in his grasp we told your son every day to keep his head down and stop pushing himself at the gods niceass voice broke and he too began to weep how many times he cried as he shook the father how many times did i tell him to watch his own back and mind his place in line the night before the great battle philokles said his nasal consonants broken like his nose kineas told him to grow up and stop acting like an idiot leon who had known the boy in a different way spoke with the hesitation of a former slave my master nicomedes asked him many times to take care if nicomedes were alive i would kill him isokles said he bears the responsibility above all philokles who had worn the wreath as the armys hero himself rose to his feet he burned very bright he said he burned bright in virtue and honour and died young and he will live for ever with the gods isokles turned sane and griefwracked eyes on him the orbs white stele in the red wreck of his face keep your philosophy spartan he is dead he might have lived and burned just as bright growing wheat and rearing children in the sun philokles nodded or disease might have crippled him or accident or he might have drowned on a ship he chose his way isokles and despite all your sorrow you are unjust to us who were his friends he chose the manner of his life and death more than most men almost like a god i honour him philokles shrugged he loved war it is a terrible stupid thing to love and it showed its true face by destroying him isokles and philokles stood nose to nose the one crying tears from red eyes the other still pouring blood from his nose so that he seemed almost to cry tears of blood and then isokles fell forward into philokles arms and they all wept together after grief the hardest part was arranging who would go and who would stay many citizens most of the hippeis had little interest in further campaigning for rich men they had seen more war than they ever expected like most veterans few of them had any inclination for more among the officers all were either men of consequence or young men likely to rise as a result of their military service the campaign against alexander would do nothing to add to their civic laurels and their fathers were not eager to see them march indeed it was only as a tribute to kineass service to the city that the assembly voted to allow the expedition at all and more than a few men rose to speak against it led by alcaeus who bore kineas ill will for his discipline during the campaign for the first time in months kineas was referred to as an adventurer and a mercenary charges that he met by rising and publicly renouncing the archonship the city demanded that the army be sent to open trade routes in the east but the men who were going called it what it was were going to fight alexander they said in the agora in the end the expedition received the grudging sanction of the city and later that of pantecapaeum olbias sister city to the east among the younger sons there were quite a few who were willing to follow kineas anywhere and all of kineass professional soldiers were content to go soldiering was what they knew and there was not likely to be another conflict around olbia in the near future rumours from the plains came down the river with the grain suggesting that marthax no longer had any force in the field and that every chieftain had gone home to see to his farmers and his grain as philokles had predicted it was also said that macedon had a war against sparta to prosecute and no men to spare to avenge zopryon best of all in the eyes of the assembly kineas proposed to take the keltoi with him that they yet lived was a sore subject to the more democratic elements in the city as they had been the tyrants tool of oppression for five years and more many felt that they should have been massacred with the macedonian garrison their presence in the hippodrome was more fodder for alcaeus and his new allies they were big men gauls and even germans among them and they scared the greeks and the sindi memnons original three hundred the first mercenaries the tyrant had hired were all citizens now but citizens without a trade memnon remained the commander of the phalanx and he had told kineas privately that he intended to stay behind but that he had no hesitation in allowing his lieutenant lycurgus or any of his men to sign on for the expedition to the east the mercenaries had been hired to oppress the population and later kept on to stiffen the raw men of the town but the men of the town were all veterans now and the mercenaries had little to do and no one to oppress and of course some of the poorer citizens or men just on the edge of poverty saw the expedition as a chance for regular pay and a life theyd grown accustomed to in the summer kineas had seen it all before all his life war begat war and men with a taste of victory and plunder took to the life of the soldier eager for more easy gold casually forgetting the nights in the rain and the pain of wounds and the constant fear in the end he mustered three hundred greek horse under diodorus well mounted and well led a better force than any squadron of mercenaries under the circle of the heavens with the keltoi in the ranks and all of herons exiles he had another three hundred infantry all hoplites under lycurgus with philokles refusing rank but accepting some nebulous role the loot of macedon allowed kineas to mount them all on mules and the riches of nicomedes allowed him to imagine that he could keep them all fed he also had fifty sindi the survivors of the company that temerix had formed and still led they were psiloi armed with sakje bows and heavy axes tattooed men who feared nothing and looked for death and served as skirmishers for the phalanx then there was prince lot and the sauromatae two hundred knights in the heaviest armour on the plains all told with the inevitable tail any army carried he had almost a thousand mouths to feed and more than two thousand animals to move only an athenian grain fleet had the capacity to carry so many and the food to supply them even for a week luckily he had one to hand he still worried about food and fodder for the march and despite some chests of gold and a great deal of silver he knew that eventually he would be forced to seize food to continue a prospect that frightened him he had already sent ataelus with his scouts and a dozen sauromatae in a galley to locate camps on the shore of the bay of salmon and to pick a route inland before the assembly met he sent eumenes with arni and a dozen keltoi troopers to visit pantecapaeum gorgippia on the east coast of the euxine and even dioskurias to the south by ship with orders to buy cattle and get them driven to the bay of salmon eumenes needed to be out of the city anyway the political factions were out for his blood because of his fathers treason or so they said every day there hurt him more and his presence was being used against kineas politically someone was aiming at kineas already some days he wondered why he was going and why he was leading a thousand men to the same fate he was rich and powerful in the way that greeks accounted power he could be tyrant he could be king and his death awaited him in the east but so did srayanka and the sniping in the assembly was already getting to him the battle of the ford of the river god was only two months past and already the assembly had returned to its traditional bickering the unanimity of the early summer vanished with the threat of macedon because kineas had already relinquished the title of archon and the possibility of being tyrant smaller fish began to circle the ivory stool looking for power kineas said as much to philokles fish you say philokles responded they were seated together in the assembly which had gathered in the hippodrome because of the seating and because the balance of power of the city had shifted away from the citadel vultures more like demosthenes nicomedes nephew had performed the political acrobatics of converting himself overnight from an aristocratic snob who used his power to avoid military service to a fullblown democrat bent on restoring complete power to the assembly the fact that the man had avoided service with the hippeis and had seen no action over the summer sat ill with many of the assembly but political memory was short and demosthenes promised action on a number of fronts that would please the voters the men in the phalanx and when alcaeus denounced kineas for his antidemocratic harbouring of the keltoi and cleomenes traitor son it was demosthenes who rose to his feet amidst the hissing to support him one of his first proposals was that kineass expedition to the east be held back until kineas had cleared his accounts with the city this proposal was met with another chorus of hissing when he first proposed it but by the third meeting of the assembly enough wine had passed enough lips for the idea to appear to have some merit kineas sat and writhed like an unhappy child through the rest of the day the resolution to call for his accounts failed by a good margin but it had not been hooted down ares and aphrodite kineas said as he threw his cloak at his bed accounts what accounts philokles smiled rubbing his beard i imagine that the honoured demosthenes knows full well that we kept no accounts diodorus came in with his hetaira who called herself sappho on his arm she was an elegant woman of thirty with good bones a long nose and an imperious air that belied both humour and real learning diodorus had purchased her contract with his loot from the battle and seemed satisfied with the exchange bad day in the assembly diodorus asked his freckles burned as he grinned why dont they ask at the citadel for accounts kineas said his voice as close to a whine as his men had ever heard diodorus shrugged demosthenes doesnt want to see the accounts he wants to hold you and your expedition hostage until you give him something kineas poured wine from a ewer and drank it off glaring at all of them his uncles inheritance perhaps sappho asked her plucked eyebrows lifted would someone pour me a cup of wine well i am an idiot kineas said brought up short of course thats what this is about philokles looked at him as if he had two heads diodorus cocked his head to one side as if he was a dog examining a particularly good bone kineas shook his head no i didnt get it diodorus shook his head sometimes i think its good for all of us that you chose not to be tyrant kineas felt the chagrin of a man who had failed to see a fairly simple stratagem ive had a great deal on my mind these last two weeks it sounded weak even to him can he carry the assembly diodorus snorted and philokles echoed the sound if you continue walking around with your head in the clouds looking hurt and being silent then yes i suspect he will eventually carry the assembly on the other hand if we lay out a few silver owls on wine for the voters and start reminding them that demosthenes is a coward and a pompous ass hell probably fade away hell they all served with alcaeus theyll remember that he was an idiot without much prompting philokles shook his head demosthenes wont simply fade away hes already got his claws into the traitor cleomenes political patronage and he inherited a great many of nicomedes clients even if he didnt get the money he paused not that im against what our fox here suggests when odysseus says to make firehardened sticks mere mortals dont refuse to build a fire sappho drank her wine watching them kineas barely knew her diodorus had introduced her and she sometimes sat in a chair during their symposia and sang or played on the kithara but he only guessed at her intelligence she was another theban sold into slavery by alexander she was quiet and her flows of good humour could be interrupted by sudden moments of deep unhappiness but something in the way she looked at them across her wine cup suggested wisdom you have a suggestion despoina kineas asked she shook her head it is not my place she said carefully diodorus came up and took her elbow sappho is as wise as any woman i have met before she was enslaved she was the daughter of a boeotarch of thebes and the sister of another philokles smiled i am from sparta where women speak their minds and men listen he said sappho held her head up thanking philokles with a small smile well then demosthenes has help and money deeper pockets than yours lord even with the money that nicomedes left and with your share of the spoils and he seeks to prevent the expedition because someone behind him wants it stopped she regarded kineas and the weight of her eyes reminded him of scythian women he couldnt remember a greek woman holding his eye in such a way i have reason to hate alexander and i will do my all to see that he goes down choking on blood and cursing the gods if i can be of aid against a slug like demosthenes pray command me kineas stroked his chin so if we spend money on buying votes hell outspend us sappho shrugged i think hes a deeper player than you think or his master is i think that he seeks to provoke you he doesnt expect to win this round although hed like to he probably wants you to go on this expedition while you remain hell never have any power here but it will be enough for him to start a story to your discredit which he can use against petrocolus and his son clio when you leave she raised a plucked eyebrow am i not correct in assuming that you intend petrocolus and his son to hold power here in your absence diodorus nodded kineas noted that although sappho looked as if she had more to say diodorus cut her off without a second thought kineas saw the cloud pass over sapphos features even as diodorus began yes he said whatever sappho thinks and im sure she knows a great deal demosthenes is the sort that pericles called an idiot out for himself and only himself he seeks to discredit you so that when you are gone he can work to reclaim the inheritance and perhaps use the case as a stepping stone to fill petrocoluss sandals he turned to sappho who is the mans master surely not alcaeus sappho shook her head i do not know but alcaeuss wife is penelope and she inclines how may i say to the company of women through her i have learned what i have said if i learn more i will see to it that you gentlemen are informed diodorus gazed at her with unfeigned admiration i have always fancied political women he said the company of women indeed kineas rubbed his beard and looked at philokles philokles shrugged spartan solution he said kineas looked a question kill him philokles said everyone in the room breathed in sharply except philokles who poured himself more wine and chuckled a few days ago you held ultimate power in this town in point of fact you still do dont play athenian games with the wanker summon him for military service and if he refuses get the assembly to vote a punishment they all spoke together diodorus shuddered at philokles highhanded measures and said so antidemocratic he shouted niceas had just come in from drilling in the fields north of town he listened to them drank wine and grinned a look that made him appear to be a demon or a monster just threaten him niceas said into a lull diodorus spoke dismissively in politics never threaten only act niceas shrugged and held diodoruss eye until the other mans air of superiority melted away they were old friends and sparring partners and niceas was reminding the other athenian that for all his aristocratic airs he didnt have a grasp of assembly politics and he managed it all with a raise of the eyebrow and a sneer demosthenes is a fucking coward who ducked military service this summer hes afraid of his own shadow i dont mean an empty blustering threat i mean a little fucking terror and the promise of more he looked right at diodorus let me arrange it kineas ran fingers through his beard a habit he meant to break and promised himself a shave and a trim he finished his wine and grinned at them i think you are all right i have to tell you what a pleasure it is to have such friends and such advice beats moping and suffering in silence doesnt it philokles quipped kineas ignored him philokles get some cash from leon and put it out on the street niceas give demosthenes some idea of my unhappiness with his actions dont get caught tonight niceas asked can you arrange it kineas asked give me another day niceas said and temerix kineas nodded and diodorus perhaps you would invite the man himself to pay us a visit perhaps the day after tomorrow diodorus fingered his red beard i dont like it if niceas is caught were giving him what he wants he shrugged glanced at niceas and smiled if only kineas was tyrant philokles snorted again if he was tyrant wed be doing this every day putting the screws to every man in the city sappho laughed that must be why it is called democracy she said the next evening kineas hosted a symposium the attendees were mostly his friends and officers although after the campaign neither group was as exclusive as it had been before diodorus shared a couch with sappho the first time he had done so in public he received some glances olbia was an oldfashioned city and even in athens the presence of a woman any woman at a symposium threatened a debauch but his place as a hero of the city was so secure that glances were inevitably followed by smiles one of those smiling was petrocolus who lay with his son cliomenedes trying to ignore the presence of the woman cliomenedes couldnt ignore her as he had to lean over her to talk to diodorus whom he idolized instead he asked her about her life her hairstyle her role as a courtesan and she answered him with clear direct intelligent answers philokles shared his couch with kineas he was particularly well dressed in a beautiful wool tunic and fine dark leather sandals and he smelled like a talent of gold kineas wondered whom the spartan sought to impress and even tried to make a joke about it a joke that fell flat niceas shared his couch with sitalkes the getae boys first symposium he was still a recovering invalid and had a cup of heavily watered wine to keep him from excess past him memnon shared his couch with craterus a city hoplite who had made a name for himself during the campaign and now bid fair to replace lycurgus as memnons lieutenant lycurgus lay on the next couch with heron of pantecapaeum two taciturn men who were likely to remain silent throughout the meal but they were both officers and both had agreed to go on the eastern expedition lycurgus was the oldest man present save petrocolus with a beard that was mostly grey pale skin and pale eyes his beard had white streaks where it sprouted from the scars on his face his feet and lower legs were blotchy with the ingrained dirt of twenty campaigns heron by contrast was young and darkhaired wore no beard and was ruddyskinned like the sindi and his legs were unblemished coenus shared his couch with young dion the heir to the political family formerly headed by cleitus and leucon dion had served with honour if not distinction throughout the summer and his fathers death at the battle left him heir to three fortunes he was close to cliomenedes in age and temperament and kineas had assigned coenus to woo him for their faction and for eventual office coenus with his education flawless manners and aristocratic habits made easy work of the boys affections lykeles another of kineass old companions lay alone still too pained by wounds to make an easy companion at dinner he would not be going east because his days as an active soldier were probably over and the angry marks at his neck and shoulder suggested that even routine motions might hurt for years to come but he smiled as often as pain would allow glad to be alive he would be left behind to help cliomenedes manage the hippeis and to maintain the companys communications with the city with arni as a factor he would manage their fortunes and their estates plead their lawsuits and keep the wolves from their various doors he had the experience of city politics to manage such a job and kineas hoped that he had enough reputation from the summer to keep the likes of demosthenes from becoming too bold the two gauls now both men of property shared a couch andronicus the larger of the pair had blond hair and blue eyes while antigonus had dark hair and green eyes and tattoos just visible at the neck of his tunic both of them had practised for a year to attend a symposium with philokles and diodorus as the drillmasters and they could hold both wine and discourse although antigonuss more limited command of greek tended to leave him smiling genially rather than conversing leon lay just by them and completed the circle of couches by lying close to kineas and philokles as well crax shared his couch the bastarnae had also begun his life with kineas as a slave and he too was now free and richer by a string of horses and a shelf full of gold cups made in macedon crax had taken many blows in the great battle but none had broken his skin and he was the healthiest of all of them every other veteran present bore wounds and they lay on their couches in comfort that verged on somnolence alone of all of them lot sat in a chair uncomfortable with greek dining but happy with a cup at his elbow and men he liked all about him he raised the first toast offered libation to his own gods and thanked his host who is closer to me than my battle brothers he said who could be closer than men who will follow me east to fight iskander lots bold assertion silenced them for a while and when talk restarted it was light and seldom dwelled long on any subject and only the efforts of sappho at one side of the circle and coenus at the other end both in their own way masters of social intercourse kept the gathering from silence the dinner itself was superb the product of kineass kitchens and leons cooks or vice versa they had not divided their fortune and so far owned nicomedes property together neither seemed in any hurry to divide the estate as such a division would only serve to make lawsuits easier the dinner featured more opson than kineas liked fish followed fish oysters in sauce lobster in more sauce bits of bread that looked more like decorations than the main course but there were no athenian moralists there to decry the decadence and given the way theyd all eaten during the summer no one could really accuse them of wanton luxury every man ate to surfeit lot spilled lobster on his fine silk robe and laughed and philokles already a little drunk tripped with a ewer of wine and spattered half the room by the time the last mutton went round and the last flatbread to wipe up the last of the fish sauce they were all a little greasy as the meal went on they discussed matters of the city such as lawsuits and politics and listened politely to sappho as she played on her instrument and sang when the main courses were done they pulled their couches closer and drank together the wounded men more quickly flushed but soon they were all redder of face and louder and sappho smiled and withdrew diodorus tried to restrain her holding her hand stay he said you are no greek matron to be shocked at what men say with wine in them she shook her head and her smile warned him that he had wounded her i am a hetaira she said with grim courtesy not a flute girl when she was gone diodorus looked ruefully at kineas who knows he asked kineas knew but he rubbed his beard and made a mental note to explain to diodorus sometime what was plain enough to him that in her mind sappho was still a matron of thebes ill usage slavery and worse had not broken her notions of proper behaviour he honoured her for it when sappho was gone the talk grew louder the jokes a little wilder but every speaker seemed to be waiting for something and the party lacked focus until kineas rose to his feet kineas waited for a pause in the noise and raised his cup and they all raised theirs as if they had been waiting all evening for this moment i want to talk about the expedition to the east he said he gave them a grin against alexander they sighed together as if relieved lot gave a shrill yip like a sauromatae war cry are we allowed to say that aloud philokles asked kineas was sober and serious i am going east because i need to be out of this city and because my destiny is there moira awaits me in the east i cannot be plainer with you than that around him the men who knew of the power of his dreams nodded all gaiety gone while others looked puzzled memnon laughed kineas ignored him i must go that is not true of you many of you all of you now have property here and reasons to stay every man of you can settle to a farm and a wife and i am too fond of you to force you to come indeed his voice choked a little and he faltered he drank some wine to cover his confusion and then said indeed i dont expect to return and i do not wish that to be your fate they looked at him with questions their eyes brimming with misgiving and he saw the hesitation he sought he had considered the matter for days and decided he would do his best to make the ones he loved most stay in olbia but philokles made a mocking noise with his lips and then laughed your life or death is with the gods he said and the same can be said for every man among us kineas shot his friend a look but philokles ignored him as he often did our fearless leader believes that he goes to his death in the east philokles said in a mocking tone of course he was equally certain that the recent action on the borysthenes would be his death it would appear that the dreams sent to him by the gods were mistaken all the men laughed because there was no mockery more precious to them than the rare moments when philokles turned his tongue sharp as bronze on kineas it was precisely because kineas was their leader in many ways the best man among them and every one of them conscious of his advantages that they enjoyed it the more when he was the butt of humour kineas pointed to the spartan you mock sacred things he said philokles grinned no my lad i mock you unless like the tiresome boy king you have appointed yourself a god kineas narrowed his eyes red tingeing his vision as rage threatened him he rose from his couch and began to stalk towards his friend i do not want to drag my friends to their deaths he bellowed philokles drew himself up to his not inconsiderable height as if to remind kineas that his rage might accomplish nothing and laughed again your friends will follow you to the ends of the earth he said if only to see what you do next the party cheered him and kineas deflated pleased that so many of them clamoured to go and touched and bemused by philokles tone and i call you my friend he said you get too much worship and insufficient straight talk philokles said in a low voice his tone covered by the laughter you need us and im damned if ill let you go off and find a way to die then he turned to the others hear me men of olbia kineas of athens marches east not to open a road for trade but to make war on alexander king of macedon he makes this war not for his own profit but on behalf of every man in greece if there was a lion loose in a nearby town would you not pick up your spear and go to kill it so then take up your spear and go with us for the monster is loose on the sea of grass and then they rose from their couches and crowded around and kineas embraced them amidst a storm of affection and was humbled in the dawn of the next day while the guests of the symposium slept in drunken fitfulness demosthenes awakened at a loud noise he shouted until his slaves were awake and he made their lives more unbearable than usual seeking explanations for the dead frog in his water cup he scared them sufficiently that it was several hours before any of them dared to tell him that he had a long mark in red ochre drawn on his throat like a giant grinning mouth he fainted he did not appear when invited for dinner at the barracks and his excuses were sketchy later kineas spoke to the survivors of the symposium in the barracks they were quieter from the results of the nights debauch this will be the largest expedition of its kind since darius crossed the plains he said tapping a copy of herodotus isokles copy in fact the difference is that well have the cooperation of most of the tribes or at least we wont have their outright enmity but the major issue will not be hostile action it will be food he gestured to leon who sat with niceas we have worked out a logistikon based on a thousand men and two thousand animals he said all of you served enough with the sakje last summer to know how they live on the plain with our own scouts and the sauromatae we should never lack for grass or meat the cavalry professionals all nodded but we will lack grain for the chargers and bread for the troops greek soldiers eat bread opson is all very nice but it is grain that we need and it is easier to buy it as we go than to try to carry it with us philokles raised his hand grain is so cheap here he said other men nodded in agreement olbia was the capital of the grain trade the stuff flowed around them like the waters of the borysthenes river even in a summer beset by flooding and war kineas nodded i thought so too he said and so i learned a new lesson of war listen he picked up leons scroll assume that every soldier eats a measure of grain a day and every horse eats two measures he quoted the old soldiers nodded agreement at the figures that means that our little army will consume five thousand measures of grain a day he looked up from the scroll every man can carry ten measures of grain in addition to his equipment each horse can carry twenty measures of grain in addition to its equipment so the army can sally forth with ten days food his eyes raked them it is at least ten thousand stades to the roof of the world where the massagetae await us at best if we never slow we will take sixty days to cross the sea of grass the sakje themselves allow fifty days for their fastest men and ninety days for tribes he began to make marks on the wall of the barracks with a piece of charcoal from the hearth none of us has traversed the land to the east except prince lot and of course ataelus i have only his report and the contributions of the more adventurous merchants from here and pantecapaeum if we go north to follow srayanka we risk tangling with marthax even if his forces are disbanded and well have to cross great marshes as we go east srayanka will follow the great road of the sakje the high grassland that runs east into sogdiana and bactria and the land of the massagetae well have to wait for spring coenus said with a happy shrug niceas sneered at him i take it we have another option he asked kineas with the raise of an eyebrow kineas nodded ive sent eumenes to arrange it i hope merchants cross the high ground between the euxine and the kaspian what some men call the hyrkanian sea by following the course of great rivers and then arranging passage on the hyrkanian sea when they arrive if i can ill take the whole army along the tanais river and across the high ground to the river that the sakje call the rha if we go hard well make the mouth of the rha before the snows come he drew on the wall with the charcoal indicating the position of lake maeotis and the bay of salmon the course of the tanais and the course of the rha and the distant salt sea with flicks of his stylus diodorus whistled were leaving the world we know he said looking around kineas could see the same thought reflected in every man he nodded when some of you chose to follow me to olbia we left our world behind he said he rubbed his beard and sipped wine when we marched out on to the sea of grass in the spring we left the world behind this is farther and farther yet but the world continues petrocolus and leon and other grain merchants know the tanais and the rha well enough and their factors attest that there is a route across to the hyrkanian sea a route that many men have travelled kineas turned to his sketch on the wall and then turned back prince lot has made the journey several times as has ataelus niceas raised a hand and then we cross this hyrkanian sea one boatload of horses at a time kineas made a sign that indicated that it was with the gods twenty boats at a time they move caravans niceas they can move us niceas shook his head caravans have a hundred horsemen and two hundred horses he said and what little kingdom will receive our army without feeling that they have to massacre us kineas rubbed his beard yes he said he shrugged nicomedes traded with a kingdom on the kaspian sea philokles laughed yes youve got it taken care of or yes its a good point kineas raised an eyebrow feeling the opportunity to make back some of the ground he had lost the night before it seems to me he said with all the effort of a good rhetorician that our company has a fine man gifted by the gods with the power of making fine speeches with a tongue that drips honey and a talent for philosophy the very man to go from here to the far side of the kaspian sea with the summer caravans and arrange for a proper welcome and a winter camp in the barbarous country of hyrkania philokles glared at him but the other men laughed niceas grinned if were sending philokles he said then im confident well be massacred unless he kills them all before we arrive diodorus said kineas looked around humour aside thats my intention he said across the high ground and the sea before winter falls and a winter camp in the thousand kingdoms thats what it is called enchanting philokles said ill wager its called the thousand kingdoms because there are a hundred thousand bandits all fighting among themselves yes said leon he smiled namastae is the most vicious of the lot thats where were going they all looked at him he shrugged we have a factor there he said after we lost half a dozen merchants my master that is nicomedes sent a mercenary and asked philokles now there are a thousand and one kingdoms leon said and namastae trades with us hyrkania has riches philokles leaned forward interested despite himself and hyrkania means leon grinned the land of the wolves he said niceas stretched and rubbed his nose food he asked kineas looked at leon and leon rose to his feet his voice was shaky as he began he was not used to speaking to groups of men and as he went on he spoke faster and his voice became shrill well march with a herd of bullocks and ten days grain he said the tanais is farmed by the maeotae and the sindi as far north as the great lakes and we will not travel so far on the river kineas interrupted because he could sense the ignorance of the audience and because leon wasnt doing credit to himself much of the grain traded through this port and through pantecapaeum comes from the tanais he said the soldiers nodded leon emboldened glanced at kineas and then continued at the portage well leave the tanais and cross the high ground to the rha merchants do it every year in the summer and autumn his voice was getting quieter and his words came more slowly as his confidence improved lycurgus memnons former lieutenant and now their commander of infantry raised a hand son he said with authority and he was obviously old enough to be leons father are you trying to tell us that we can get grain as we march leon gave a shaky grin glanced down at his scrolls and frowned yes sir lycurgus motioned to a slave for water then just say so son leon stuttered for a moment and then began again it will be harvest time when we march from the bay of salmon or close enough by the time we run out of our rations the harvest will be in and well have access to the cheapest grain in the circle of the world kineas stood again i will pay for the grain at least for this winter lycurgus grunted that will convince the shirkers he said at least until spring kineas smiled and then itll be too late to change their minds he said memnon laughed it worked for xenophon he said you almost tempt me to come along whats in it for us lycurgus asked im in however you put it i followed you this summer and i like the idea but for the boys in the ranks whats in it for them whatever loot we can get kineas said was anyone dissatisfied with the booty from the macedonian camp diodorus snorted but coenus cut him off are you seriously suggesting that well get to loot alexanders camp he asked im not sure but id bet that counts as hubris kineas spread his hands acknowledging the point i cant say because were talking about a march of ten thousand stades at least ten thousand stades four hundred parasangs and maybe more i will say that i expect some pay from the massagetae he tilted his head to give philokles a private look and then said if you know your herodotus were marching right into the land of the eastern sakje the land of gryphons and gold lycurgus nodded i can sell that he said especially if they can leave their loot from this campaign here safe and march knowing that youll pay to fill their bellies until we run out of money niceas said then well just start taking what we need diodorus said some of the younger men looked at him he met their glances and shrugged sure it gets ugly but thats what armies do out on the sea of grass theres no one to plunder leon said and after the grass theres desert he looked around but chances are any army that you march out there will be the toughest proposition in hyrkania therell be contracts in plenty if we want to spend the spring fighting for their petty tyrants i can arrange one before we arrive if thats what you want lycurgus shrugged cross that desert when we come to it he said and they laughed after listening to kineas and leon and wrangling over halfmade plans they were all tired arguments had begun to have a personal edge and the fumes of last nights wine were like poison it was then that sappho entered and arni and a dozen of the barracks slaves with ewers of water and flagons of wine and loaves of bread best of women diodorus said and got a real smile from his companion kineas bit into the bread crusty and excellent and savoured the olive oil with it sappho you are a paragon she lowered her eyes and smiled i crave a boon kineas kineas mopped his beard with his bread anything he said expecting humour allow me to accompany the army she said kineas flicked a look at diodorus but he appeared as surprised as if a bolt from zeus had fallen among them sappho took his hesitation for an opportunity every army has followers she said i can manage them i can ride a horse i am as hard as a rock kineas whose hands could remember the muscles in srayankas legs doubted that sappho was as hard as she thought but he couldnt ignore the fact that she was correct every army had followers often their fortunes affected the morale of the army generals and strategoi often ordered them to be abandoned as if the men who served in the ranks had no feelings for the bodies that warmed their beds or the voices that shared their campfires they were wrong kineas looked at diodorus she was at least temporarily his property in many ways diodorus smiled his devious smile and kineas wondered if the man hadnt known of her request all along kineas disliked being managed as much as most men but he liked sappho well enough and he liked the idea of having an officer to deal with the followers you agree to obey my orders he asked and if i order you home youll go as meek as a lamb she raised her eyes i am always as meek as a lamb strategos she said no one had referred to him as strategos before he felt himself blushing nonetheless he hardened his tone that is not an answer he said yes she said i will agree to obey you in all things she raised her eyes just a little on the last word so that he caught a flash of their colour the glance affected him he turned his head away and tried to ignore the pulse that shot from his head to his groin and met diodoruss eyes and his raised eyebrow kineas looked away in confusion made an excuse to walk out to relieve himself counted to a hundred in sakje then he rejoined his company made jokes and laughed at them and fell back into the tide of masculine camaraderie after they had shared bread and wine kineas rose and carried his wine cup to the centre of the room a year ago in this room i asked my officers to swear an oath if you will accompany me against alexander ill ask you to swear again he raised his cup niceas rose and gave him a rare grin whodve thought a year ago when we had a tyrant to tame and the threat of macedon stirring that today wed be planning to march an army into the east diodorus sober raised his cup whod have thought that we would be officers with commands or rich men or citizens coenus raised his cup who would have guessed which among us would have fallen and which would live to ride again andronicus raised his wine give us your oath strategos for me i long to ride then kineas raised his cup hear us god who shakes the mountains and whose bolts cause men to fear hear us goddess of the olive who wears the aegis hear us god whose horses ride the very waves whose hand raises the storm or stills it may all the gods hear us we swear that we will remain loyal to each other and the company until it is dissolved by us all in council kineas spoke the words and they repeated them with gusto no voice lacking just as they had a year and more before and the new voices were no softer than the old despite the late afternoon hour when the meeting broke kineas threw on a cloak and went to the palaestra he needed to feel the daimon of exercise he was introspective enough to question his own motives in welcoming the theban woman on the expedition to the east he suspected that he would regret it even as his unexercised body fantasized about her he banished her green eyes on the sand of the palaestra by the time he had loosened the muscles around his two healing wounds and freed his thighs from ten days of lassitude the sun was low in the sky but he was determined to run other men were drawn to him and his progress across the exercise floor attracted an entourage and his announcement that he would run brought a chorus of approval philokles appeared at his side and diodorus as well and coenus they ran well without a lot of conversation except some rude banter about the length of kineass legs more banter when he slowed out by gades farm and then they had only enough air in their lungs to run memnon led the pack his dark skin untouched by frost or the exertion and he ran with his head up as if he could go all day and all night which he probably could philokles stayed close to him all the way and the two were just visible to kineas a dark back and a pale back in the distance kineas was at the rear of the pack a stade or more behind the leaders and he ran on willpower and annoyance burning off the last of his wine and bad temper and temptation the air coming out of his mouth in gasps until he got his second wind with the dolphin gates in sight his head came up again and he ran across the agora in fine shape gaining some lost ground memnon was already running a strigil across philokles in the marble portico of the palaestra and the steam from the baths was welcome but kineas felt like a better man before he ran past the temple of apollo and he enjoyed his bath with the devotion of a man who might not see a gymnasium for sixty thousand stades or ever again he was lying in the steam with a slave working carefully around the wound on his bicep when helladius sat on the next slab it must be nice to be so young said the priest i was comforted that i could run at your shoulder but then in sight of the gates a god gifted you with new strength and you ran away from me as if i stood still kineas laughed and pointed at philokles who was waving goodbye clean strigilled massaged and cloaked for the walk home you must be old indeed to finish behind me he said memnon looks like a statue of ares said helladius and your friend the spartan might be zeus you are full of flattery today priest kineas rolled over so that he could look the man in the eye it is not that the dead require anything from you the priest said suddenly kineas felt his stomach twist as if hed just seen a corpse it is rather that they are trying to give you something helladius continued his rich and melodious voice was somehow wrong for the message he was conveying as if something else was using his voice to speak what are they trying to give me kineas asked philokles might be herakles or achilles come to life said the old priest as if nothing of moment had been said that is for you to learn said the slave in his accented persiangreek kineas sat up suddenly and whirled on the slave what do you say he demanded the slave looked afraid master he asked and backed a step fearing a blow kineas looked at the priest didnt you hear him kineas asked the priest looked puzzled do you speak his barbarian tongue i doubt he speaks much greek kineas was slow to place himself back under the slaves hands didnt you speak to me of my dreams he asked after a long silence helladius summoned another slave who began to massage the older mans legs i questioned the gods and sought answers in augury and none was granted me it is a difficult question kineas felt the cold sweat of fear despite the steam and the pleasant fatigue of the run the fear would not leave him and it banished all thoughts of sappho the expedition gathered a momentum of its own so that by the day the first grain ships raised their sails kineas had volunteers from throughout the north shore of the euxine many of them men for whom he had little use and a cheering crowd to see them all off he stood on the beach with petrocolus and watched the last chargers embark and the last soldiers i will miss you kineas petrocolus said the city will miss you kineas embraced the older man and then embraced his son cliomenedes who would be acting as the city hipparch the two men father and son were now the most powerful political figures in the city but there were already factions nicomedes nephew demosthenes had taken up much of the rhetoric of cleomenes the elder eumenes father who had betrayed the city to macedon a fact that was already dwindling in the consciousness of many citizens demosthenes had not emerged from his house in a week but his terror would pass he had both money and voices in the assembly he would not be quiet long on the other hand kineas had arranged or more properly diodorus sappho and philokles had arranged that the assembly chose petrocolus as archon he was one of the citys richest men he had hundreds of clients and he had earned his own fortune through hard work and quick wit and his son was a hero of the war together they had the leverage to hold demosthenes at bay kineas handed the older man the ivory stool with relief and a certain pride dont sit on it too often he said it becomes addictive petrocolus accepted it and nodded gravely i will keep it for you he said but kineas shook his head i dont expect to return he said he pointed to demosthenes where he stood glowering with a bodyguard of armed slaves and some followers most of them men who had once followed nicomedes kineas thought bitter thoughts about his fellow citizens and greeks in general he had watched his father play the game of democracy and now he played it himself men like cleomenes the elder and demosthenes played it without rules or ethics bending men with money to suit their own tastes never considering the eudaimonia of the city as a whole or so kineas saw them he hated that good men like anarxes a rich farm boy who had ridden in the second troop served loyally all summer and acted as eumenes second officer when the older boy was lying wounded now rose in the assembly to demand that kineas show his accounts for city money he expended the man did so at the behest of his new political master and kineas was sorry for it and hurt and the more eager to leave before the call for an accounting crippled him or before he lost the special regard he had received he waved to the crowd and embraced the old man one more time and then he waded out into the surf and climbed the side of demostrates galley the navarch gave him a hand up the side you could have ruled he said by way of greeting kineas liked the ugly man demostrate was an effective commander a retired pirate and a loyal ally would you if you had the chance he asked demostrate laughed a roar like poseidons never he said easier to calm the waves in a storm than to ride the tides of public opinion he gave a lopsided grin that made him look like a satyr or more like a satyr bad enough that i stopped being a pirate kineas smiled to himself and said less than he might once have but went aft to the awning where philokles and diodorus and niceas waited and the red ball of the sun rose in the east licking the waves to ripples of fire so that they seemed to be sailing into the east on a road of flame part ii high ground the same sun burned like a line of fire on the latesummer grass of the prairies beyond the low beach in the bay of salmon where a dozen galleys were pulled up on their sterns small waves lapped against their armoured beaks and gulls shrieked and whirled where a crowd of sindi fishermen hauled a net full of silver fish from their boat to the temporary market where they would be sold for hard cash beyond the warships the grain fleet of athens was anchored out in the bay of salmon well clear of the sloping sand and mud the great ships were not built to beach like warships with their size they required the support of a volume of water or their hulls might split heavy supporting members breaking under the strain so they anchored out in the deep water and local boats and hastily built barges emptied their holds and took their cargoes on to the beach a reversal of the usual process sauromatae horseherders drove their spare horses straight over the rails of the great ships so that the horses plunged into the sea the girls then leaped naked into the sea behind them tangled their fists in seawet manes and swam ashore with their charges philokles equally naked in the latesummer sun laughed poseidon lord of horses and lord of the sea must love you athenian he said kineas gave the spartan half a smile all the gods love a man who plans carefully he said not aphrodite philokles said with a wry smile the goddess born on foam hates a man who plans too much he frowned you never mention the foamborn when you make sacrifice kineass eye caught sappho cloaked like a matron despite the sun and wearing a large conical straw hat sitting on a stool further down the beach with diodoruss not inconsiderable camp furniture speak to me not of aphrodite he said i ask only that she withhold her hand from me until i see srayanka brother that is exactly the way in which mortals ask the foamborn for trouble philokles said his eyes continued to follow the sauromatae girls as they rode their horses out of the water have you ever wondered why poseidon is lord of horses and lord of the sea kineas his head full of figures and the minutiae of the landing shook his head i must confess that i have not philokles ignored the hint i used to think that perhaps our ancestors those dorians who came to sparta and took it in the time after menelaus and fair helen that perhaps they brought a lord of chariots and the locals had a lord of the ocean and as the two peoples merged they merged their gods kineas was drawn to his friends lesson despite himself i can never decide whether you should be teaching in the agora as a philosopher or thrown from a tall rock as a blasphemer he said with mock concern but he was listening but just now watching those girls i wonder if it is not hidden like all other lessons inside the poet philokles said wherever the longhaired achaeans travelled they took chariots it is in the iliad true enough kineas said amazed that he had never given the matter a thought though as for most athenian boys the iliad had been the centre of his every military fancy since he first heard it performed in his fathers tiled garden and the poet must have seen what we are seeing many times before he lost his sight the spartan added peering from beneath his hand perhaps i was too simple perhaps the lord of horses and the lord of the sea have always gone together perhaps youve just noticed that the sauromatae girls are naked and extraordinarily handsome kineas said philokles released a great sigh aphrodite is close to you brother he said he gave a wry grin that made him look ten years younger when women stir my loins they must be stirring indeed kineas had no time to consider naked women of any sort however because as soon as the bulk of his army had landed he had to put it in a state of defence had to start the parts of it in motion had to arrange orders to cover various eventualities because he was not marching the whole of it together but sending pieces of it across the three thousand stades that separated them from the kaspian sea to the east eumenes had done his job herds of cattle waited on the beach already penned together with sindi shepherds and sindi sheep inland ataeluss prodromoi had marked the road with signs used by the sakje sticks and bits of fleece skulls of dead animals piles of stones kineas could read them and the sauromatae girls could read them better ataelus was gone long gone by all accounts but eumenes had been waiting for them when the first warships pulled up on the flats and he and philokles and leon were due to head east as soon as the first troops were prepared to travel the infantry under lycurgus because they would be the fastest to ship and the best at defending the camps kineas divided the rest of the army into two groups ataelus was gone with the first group just the elite prodromoi used to living off the land they had been off as soon as their horses swam ashore scouting the route that the army would take across the high ground kineas expected daily reports from the scouts ataelus had enough riders to send a messenger every morning diodorus commanded the second group composed of the bulk of the greek infantry and the sindi psiloi they would make their best speed to the coast of the inland sea where shipping should by then await them covered by two troops of olbian cavalry prince lot would lead the rest the sauromatae as well as herons troop of cavalry and eumenes troop they were to move across the trail blazed by ataelus in easy stages starting last by a week and covering the movement of the other groups because they were the best fitted to living off the steppe the greek infantry marched out of the camp in good order on the second day after their landing their goods piled on their mules every one of them had just completed a summer on campaign they carried too much baggage but that was true of soldiers the world over their bodies were hard and they sang as they marched out the hoplites set off at a pace that would eat a parasang thirty stades in an hour a pace they and their donkeys could maintain all day if required barring disaster they would have crossed the high ground between lake maeotis and the kaspian sea in thirty days swamps ridges and all and still have purchased grain to eat while they awaited leons boats on the kaspian the whole army marched and ate as greek soldiers had marched for generations every man belonged to a mess group eight or ten men and their women and slaves under a file leader they marched together fought together as a file and ate together buying their food from the daily common market and cooking it by turns over the groups fire when they camped that fire was often the centre of their lives home and hearth combined they had no tents and no blankets but the cloaks they all carried and rain or snow or beating sun they could live and march the system was so old and so endemic to greeks that even the gentry the cavalry and the officers followed the same system at the very top the strategos was not expected to cook he was too busy but he could cook and he did on occasion greek notions of democracy were not limited to politics and spartan or athenian olbian or heraklean every hellene soldier knew that his food was his own responsibility kineas was much given to thoughts of food these days he dreamed of food supply at night when he wasnt fighting against the dreams of the tree and awake he pondered how to ship grain ahead of his army pondered the purchase of additional mules pondered the possibilities of farming failures and war and the results for his tenuous supply do as you think best kineas had said to philokles before they rode away wrapped in his spartiates cloak of scarlet sitting beside leon in a splendid blue cloak that lacked the wear of a season in the field a study in contrasts dont be tied to my plan make your judgements on the ground if we can ride around the north of this hyrkanian sea the kaspian or if it seems better to you or if you cannot hire the shipping or if it is too late in the season philokles put his hand on kineass shoulder youve already told us every word of your worries he said kineas gave a wry smile i will worry until i see you again he said and leon shifted his weight embarrassed by their obvious emotion kineas smiled at leon dont feel it too keenly when this plan of ours is discarded he said we may never make hyrkania i wont let you down leon said ill while away the stades discoursing on your flaws and bring him back cured of hero worship philokles said he stroked the neck of his heavy charger a magnificent animal he had preserved throughout the years campaigns by the simple expedient of fighting on foot i havent missed you you brute he said my thighs will burn like a river of fire before night he embraced kineas and they patted each others backs for a long minute then they parted and kineas embraced leon do well he said and turned away to hide his tears kineas found it difficult to wave goodbye to philokles an hour later kineas stood on a low hill almost certainly an ancient kurgan like the one that now held the body of satrax and watched his infantry with pride he had climbed the kurgan alone to have time to think a luxury for a commander even of a thousand men he waved at philokles who still sat his charger like a sack of grain and leon who rode like a centaur and carried a shield on horseback one of the few men kineas had ever seen do such a thing neither saw him until the army was already a stade out on the plain their singing just a chant on the wind when leon happened to look at the top of the old mound and kineas saw him trot his mount alongside philokles the spartan turned in his saddle looked put a hand to his eyes and then waved kineas waved back enthusiastically he found that he was crying again he waved until he had to strain his eyes to see them and then he sat in the hollow at the top resting his shoulders against the stone and closed his eyes may the gods send that i see you again he swore you will said a deep voice behind him but when he turned there was no one there but the sakje child how do you know kineas asked her she looked at him with all the puzzlement that children use for adults who dont behave themselves know what lord kineas bit back a retort the voice had been hers and yet had not been hers surely there is someone else for you to haunt girl he said no she said simply and came around him to sit on the sacred stone that capped the kurgan the sword that should have rested in the stone or in the earth beside it was gone either long since rusted into the ground or taken for its power by a yatavu a sorcerer ordinary mortals avoided sitting on the kurgan stones fearing the spirits of the dead she did not what is your name girl kineas asked when will you come for your horses strategos she asked they pine for you and you ride inferior blood you are king i say so my father says so it pains him to see you astride some getae hack when you should be riding a royal horse kineas sat down on the low bank of grasscovered earth created by the slow collapse of the roof of the kurgan and sighed they are fine horses he admitted and my father is cross that you will not climb the tree he says and here she scrunched up her face and squared her shoulders so that her back was straighter an eerie performance he says that you let your fear guide you instead of your sense as a baqca kineas sighed again kam baqca is dead he said the little girl shrugged many people are dead she said should they also be silent kineas spoke too fast because he didnt want an argument and because she was annoying him we dont believe that the dead speak the little girl regarded him from under her straight dark brows thats not true she said kineas caught his own mistake and he laughed at his own inability to defeat a young woman in debate the dead may speak on great occasions he said the dead may speak whenever it suits the gods to allow them to speak the child said as if teaching a lesson so you should not lie the dead speak to odysseus in the odyssey if the poet says a thing it must be true dont you think she looked at him he felt the hair on the nape of his neck begin to rise you have read the poet he asked of course she said her young voice utterly dismissive and in plays the dead speak all the time in plays i saw one in olbia kineas shook his head who are you she got up laughing for all the world like any other happy twelveyearold girl nihmu white horse of the royal sakje she said proudly kam baqca was my father and attalos oneeye was my grandsire arraya walksalone was my mother and srayanka the archer was my fathers mother she rattled off her impressive lineage in the singsong voice of memorization kineas helped her down from the stone as he would any girl and he remembered his sisters in the family olive groves and how they had claimed to be women as soon as they could walk this child seemed to be every age and no age where do you camp he asked with the prodromoi she said the scouts are all gone for the kaspian kineas said he was disconcerted again thunder rumbled in the distance latesummer thunder that did not bring rain she frowned and shook her head rapidly youd better hurry she said she took his hand and pulled on it like one of his sisters wanting a honey treat in the agora hurry why he asked now she seemed far away because youll die came the deeper voice but the girl looked as startled as he was and ran off down the hill and into the gathering dark when kineas awoke niceas was at his shoulder shaking him i knew youd slipped off to have a kip he said kineas looked around and gradually realized that he was curled up against the kurgans stone his body was like ice and he was scared whats happening to me he asked the sky niceass raillery vanished and was replaced by concern whats the matter kineas put his head in his hands the veils between the world of dreams and the waking world are tearing he said or i am going mad the next night kineas dreamed of his own death and he dreamed of the tree and he dreamed of skeletal figures offering him the gift of sand from their mouths one a persian archer another a man hed bought a cup of wine after the sack of tyre sometimes they were not even recognizable the worst was a corpse with no head who vomited sand from the stump of its neck dreams like this cost him his rest and he began to fear to place his head on his cloak and he could not face the tree dreams the idea of climbing the tree was like an assault on his hellenism and the dreams were worse now that he had left the city behind in the morning he rode among the camps he watched the sindi farmers and the maeotae fishermen drying their salmon he watched the athenian captains purchase fish sauce by the hundred beakers in the market on the beach and load their cargoes before they weighed anchor and beat slowly out through the greygreen waves of the shallow sea towards the dykes that almost but not quite blocked navigation on lake maeotis when their sails vanished over the horizon the enormity of his commitment to the expedition his own fortune and his inherited wealth were heavily engaged began to weigh on him and that combined with lack of sleep made him dangerous kineas knew that niceas was watching him with growing alarm perhaps even anger niceas did his best to keep his kineas busy arranging inspections riding the beach throwing a seaside symposium to wish the sailors of pantecapaeum farewell none of them served to occupy kineas fully and his temper grew shorter and shorter so did niceass after a few days of inactivity and more nights of brutal dreams diodoruss command marched carrying most of the remaining grain from the magazine that eumenes had arranged the herds of cattle were already down by a third why dont we ride with diodorus niceas asked the prince can get himself across the height of land ares he could ride all the way to marakanda without us go with diodorus if you want kineas said niceas whirled on him dont be an arsehole strategos he said youve been a burr under my butt for a week and i dont have to take it im trying to help and you are shutting me out i cant go to fucking sleep kineas said niceas handed him a flagon of wine left from the symposium philokles told me how to deal with this he said start drinking ill tell you when to stop im the commander of this expedition kineas said i cant get drunk niceas held out the flagon greek wine for greek dreams philokles says kineas shook his head im sorry friend but im not as bad as that yet niceas raised an eyebrow all the gods keep me from the day you are worse kineas managed a smile youre right i need to get out of this camp niceas rubbed his nose about fucking time kineas smiled back lets go hunting well catch diodorus as we go ill inform lot the pressure in kineass head subsided as soon as he rode away from lake maeotis so that by the time his horse had completed the first of the great curves of the tanais he felt nothing but an agonizing fatigue he allowed niceas to lead him on for a few parasangs and they camped on a bluff that hung over the great river like a fortress built by nature i just want to sleep kineas said niceas handed him a horn cup of watered wine drink this first he said kineas looked across the river at the farms on the north shore were in asia according to herodotus niceas shrugged ive been to asia before he said tomorrow if you insist on keeping this up well have to hunt kineas nodded instead of relaxation he felt only the anxieties of a commander away from his troops i shouldnt have left the army he said and drank the wine then he had another cup and finally he fell asleep the tree climbed away above him an endless profusion of fecundity with ripe fruit apples lemons and richer prizes all dangling in a riot of colour and life birds swooped in and out of the tree plucking food from the tangle of branches and around the fruit branches up and up to a layer of branches and clouds that hid the horizon there were branches of hardwood and softwood each lush and perfect without disease so that the tree was all trees and it covered the world his feet were mired in the mud and the blood of the dead at the base of the tree and when he moved he could feel the bones breaking under his feet no matter how careful he was he needed to climb indeed he could see a pair of young eagles cradled in one of the branches above him and they called to him and he had to go to them their needs were greater than his but as he began to push through the ordure a corpse rose from the muck to confront him it rose gracefully without the stiffness that the dead so often displayed and the corpses face was fresh and clean and unmarked despite the wounds on his body it was ajax ajax smiled it was a smile full of sadness and other things comradeship love loss and longing but it was a smile he reached out his hand towards kineas and kineas took the hand around them other corpses appeared familiar corpses the men from his other dreams a silent clamour of dead and rotting flesh kineas shied away from them but they pushed at him each with a handful of sand beyond the heartbreaking spectacle of dead companions and friends men whose deaths in many cases sat on his shoulders who had died under his orders or at his side was a dreadful plain of dead persians and getae and others trailing away to the horizon ajax pulled at him and then pushed him towards the tree interposing his body between kineas and the other dead kineas seized the trunk and threw himself up to the first branch with all of his dream strength threw a leg over the first branch and hung there terrified and sweating as ajax vanished in a melee of the dead and kineas felt that he had abandoned the boy left him for dead and he wept and the weeping was excruciating raw pain coming from his eyes as if the eyes themselves were threatening to burst from his head and then grains of sand poured from his eyes into his hands sand intermixed with blood and he screamed and screamed and niceas had his arms and was murmuring in his ear until he calmed in his fear and fatigueswamped thoughts he knew that niceas was speaking to him as he would to a scared horse and that comforted him and despite his fears he slipped back into sleep it amazed him that he returned to the dream in the same place with one leg over the rough oaktree bark of the trees lower limbs he could not see the ground only the sort of low mist that rolled over the sea of grass in the autumn and the dead were gone he was on the tree he admitted to himself there in the power of the dream that he had resisted going to the tree since the day of the battle and now he welcomed it he climbed to the branch where he had seen the young eagles and they were gone higher in the tree he could see now they leaned out from their branch their immature and drab brown plumage somehow comic and watched him with curious eyes and made raucous calls at him as he hoisted himself to another branch each branch at this height was as large as a noble tree in a royal forest in persia or in a temple grove in arcadia and climbing the main trunk was a matter of careful searching for hand and footholds in the rough bark he searched and climbed and his head was filled with memories from his youth memories of sitting in the dust of the agora in athens and listening to tutors and philosophers some wiser than others some brilliant rhetoricians and one unable to speak more than a few phrases without halting and staring blankly at the world around them often to the hoots of his companions his own hoots why why had he been so derisive the man was a pupil of plato a brilliant mind who studied many things in the circle of the heavens but his halting speech had earned him nothing but ridicule and their tutors had done nothing to stop them until the poor man had fled the agora even in dream kineas winced at remembering that he had been the first to call an insult feeling bold manly adult and why had their tutors not restrained them perhaps because they mere tutors to the idle rich enjoyed the discomfiture of one more gifted than they it was a deeply painful memory an ignoble act in which he led others to act badly and it had been one of the moments that defined his leadership over the other youths his daring had made him a leader the consequence of an evil act had been his own success as a leader of course his leadership of aristocratic youths had caused him to be sent to alexander and then exiled and moira had sent him from exile to be archon of olbia and then to here he pondered it all and climbed higher there were other forms of horror than rotting corpses he awoke in the morning better rested than he had been in weeks to the roar of niceass snores below the bluff on which they had camped the tanais swept by majestically still swollen by the rain that had lasted a month as wide as a lake the sun rose and then leaped into the pinkstriped sky as apollos winged chariot began its course across the heavens kineas listened to the sounds of the forest behind him watched a herd of deer come to the river beneath the bluff an easy javelin throw that he passed because he could feel the peace of zeus on the whole of the tanais and he had no wish to break the truce birds called he was confused by his dreams it was years since he had last thought about tormenting the scholar in the agora but he now knew the dream to be a true one indeed he now remembered the incident and his secret shame he felt the shame anew he nodded at the thought having learned something he was tired but strangely full of new life i should not have stayed away from the tree he said quietly no said the wind and the snores and the birds in the sky it was terrifying because the no was not quiet kineas sprang to his feet but there was no one there but niceas with his prosaic snores and the deer running along the river as if pursued by wolves even as he watched the deer slowed paused and with infinite caution began to drink again kineas sighed and set to work builing the fire hands shaking as they did after he had been in combat he was patient and thorough remembering many things his first hunting expeditions with his father his first days in the field with niceas he split small twigs with his eating knife and broke larger sticks into uniform lengths from his pack he retrieved a tube of hollowed reed carefully preserved through ten years of campaigns and blowing through it softly he raised the embers into hot coals and then summoned fire on the split twigs he had prepared building upon those flames one stick at a time until he had a raging fire he put a small bronze pot on for tea and sat back temporarily satisfied out in the river a salmon leaped and then another a sea eagle swept in from the right took a salmon in its great talons and beat away wings struggling to handle the extra load so that the great bird swept down the river a few dactyloi above the surface of the water thank you lord of the heavens keeper of the thunderbolt kineas said the augury was of the best and more the truce of the god was broken by the lord of the heavens himself grabbing a javelin kineas crept carefully down the bluff and then moved from tree to tree along the riverbank in the distance he could see a series of farms at the next bend of the river smoke coming from their hearths in the new morning the lead buck raised his head and kineas downwind froze a does head came up and then anothers it was a long throw and the time kineas would take to change his stance to make a cast would render it impossible he waited another head came up a young buck he took a step towards kineas and turned his head as if trying to see something across the river kineas remained motionless the does head went down back to drinking and then the young buck moved a step and did the same kineas took a step and then another now almost flat to the ground a head came up kineas couldnt see as well having sacrificed line of sight for his own cover he stopped moving he was in range now but awkwardly placed behind a hillock of grass where a great tree had fallen probably during a spring flood and then rotted into the loam to leave a miniature ridge above him just a plethron away on the bluff niceas rose to his feet and stretched the heads came up watching this new movement across the river the eagle freshly gorged on salmon let out a raucous screech of contentment as the herds heads turned together kineas rolled from behind his hillock to his feet in their panic at his appearance the young buck fouled one of the does and both stumbled losing a stride and his javelin flew arcing into the heavens before falling to strike the young buck between the shoulder blades he took one stride and fell legs splayed already dead the doe leaped his corpse and ran kineas opened the buck giving a prayer to artemis he had learned as a boy and gralloched his kill in a nearby tree he left the buck hanging there and washed in the river before climbing the bluff with a pair of steaks wrapped in oak leaves somebodys feeling better niceas said he was huddled in his cloak with a horn cup in his fist kineas laid the steaks on their leaves by the fire yes he said he wore a grin that split his face like an athletes crown of honour niceas began cutting green branches from the alder at the top of the bank if you wanted to go hunting you could just have said he joked kineas shrugged still looking across the river i didnt know what i wanted he said fair enough niceas answered he speared the deer meat carefully putting three of the springy sticks into each steak and then putting the sticks deep into the loam around their fire in the fire pit he pushed the coals from kineass earlier blaze into deep piles one each under the lattices supporting the meat the meat began to sizzle almost immediately and kineass stomach made a wet noise they both chuckled its hot niceas said hed boiled water in a copper mess pot and added the herbs hed learned from the sakje and some honey it was a good drink in the morning and it saved the wine kineas took the cup from his outstretched hand and drank he smiled were going to end up becoming sakje he said whats the herb something the sakje call garella he said i found some growing here when we made camp bitter kineas said good with honey niceas shrugged its warm and wet srayanka your medea likes the stuff thats how i learned about it kineas nodded and drank more it tasted better or was that his imagination we could go back to athens niceas said kineas stepped back from the fire as if he had been burned what he asked we could go back to athens your exile is lifted all your estates restored right kineas looked at the other man where is this coming from niceas shrugged pulled the sticks from the ground and flipped one of the pieces of meat it smelled delicious and it had very little fat the plains arent good for you all these dreams and war weve had enough war havent we kineas looked at his hyperetes as if seeing him for the first time have you had enough war the first time i saw it that was enough niceas said but like memnon its the only life ive ever known i keep waiting waiting for you to retire so that i can retire too kineas was watching his friends face i will not be going back to athens old friend niceas shook his head of course not silly of me to mention it only only i dont see an end we ride east then what you find medea and live happily ever after what about the rest of the boys do we just pick a sakje bride and settle down or what do we fight alexander do we just go on fighting alexander maybe keep moving east come back here and make war on marthax niceas was growing angrier as he spoke it wont ever end kineas youll become fucking alexander at this rate whats it for kineas rubbed his beard stung i promised srayanka niceas nodded you promised her did you promise her eumenes diodorus antigonus coenus me at each name his voice rose well leave our fucking skulls out east in some tartarus of wilderness beyond the world wont we kineas drained the garella and sat he pulled his legs up close and put his arms around them why didnt you say all this back in olbia niceas shrugged it didnt really come to me until i saw what this campaign was doing to you and when i saw the ships sail off that hurt kineas turned his face away i have to do this you dont i told you all that in olbia niceass voice was gentle instead of angry thats horse shit hipparch well all follow wherever you choose to go you have trained us to be that way and now we are diodorus wont leave you i wont leave you now eumenes wont leave you its almost funny because every one of us has our own little following the damned following the damned following kineas kineas thought of the other boys hissing their catcalls after the fleeing philosopher instead of an angry retort he nodded would it help if i promised that this was the last time he asked niceas shook his head no because being who you are it wont be the last time but itd help those of us who follow you if you put some planning into the trip home instead of just the trip out kineas met his friends eyes i wont be coming home he said niceas met his glance if you say so maybe the rest of us will though kineas nodded i understand good said niceas because the meats done an hour later they were riding across the plains between the oak woods and the river they passed farms and maeotae farmers paler than the sindi but wearing the same colourful clothes they were prosperous and the women wore gold even when they worked with hoes in their gardens or brought in the harvest twice the mounted pair passed groups of maeotae in their hundreds reaping a field of wheat there was grain in every basket and more coming in every apron stone barns and turf barns dotted the landscape along the river each with a small dock and every one bursting with wheat kineas shook his head the golden fleece he said niceas nodded alexander is wasting his time on persia he said these are the richest farms ive ever seen when the sun stood at the top of the sky kineas stopped where a group of maeotae sat in the shade of a great oak tree eating bread and cheese he dismounted the men watched him warily do any of you speak greek he asked the oldest of the farmers stood and approached but he shook his head sakje kineas asked the farmer smiled showing more teeth than gaps they were a handsome people with hair as golden as their crops in autumn and the stature of those who ate well all through the year some he said you know olbia kineas asked the farmer nodded we are from olbia an army is coming this way up the tanais my army well pay for grain kineas found that sakje forced him to be succinct the farmer nodded soldiers come horsemen come he said say same pay gold for grain he nodded kineas held up a silver owl id buy bread and cheese if i could he said the farmer shrugged he went to his wife and returned with a basket full of bread and cheese for nothing he said with evident pride for friend niceas nodded any farmer would do the same these are good folk he went to his horse and removed a cut of the buck and carried it to the farmer for nothing he said in sakje and the farmer grinned at him they rode on eating as they went march discipline must be good niceas said or those folk would be pissing themselves at the sight of soldiers this is grass cat land kineas said i dont think those maeotae would agree niceas said this is no mans land he looked at kineas under his brows you could build something here he said kineas looked at him build something he asked niceas grunted and they rode on they stayed the night in a heavy stone house kineas got a bed by the hearth the nights had developed a bite and he was asleep as soon as his head was on the furs the two young eagles were above him again and they were noisy he smiled at them and they regarded him with curiosity and then he began to climb to them he got one leg well up to a knot in the bole of the great tree and pressed himself close to keep his balance and wrapped his arms around the trunk around her waist and she made to push him away just the palm of her hand and not very hard he pushed her chiton up with his free hand until he could feel the warm vellum of her hip under his fingers and his erection took on a life of its own no my lord she said but without much force more weariness than refusal really she was pretty with heavy breasts and a slim waist and all the young men wanted her she had smiled at him many times and today when she came into the stable with two buckets of water he had kissed her and now he had her under him in the straw he ran his hand under the thin wool over the mound of her belly and on to her breast the garment bunched around her hips and she moved them in discomfort stop she said with a little more emphasis please she asked he ran his hand over her nipple and it sprang to life under his hand and she moaned no master lord no she said he kissed her and she responded slowly at first and then more until she was tugging at him and he was in her spending as quickly as he entered her then she rose and dusted off the straw and pulled her chiton into shape wiped her thighs a little and went back to watering horses she never smiled at me again kineas thought i raped her she was a slave and she could no more refuse me than refuse to eat but lets call an action by its proper name it was rape yes said kam baqca she was mounted on her great charger and she towered above him it was not meant with anger but it was ill done when a lord forces a slave where is the crime kineas thought the question was rhetorical but the dream lingered as did the question and he awoke with the question on his mind and the sure knowledge that his body thought that srayanka was too far away he rose and drank a honey drink that he enjoyed and ate fresh bread the farmer spoke to him at length discoursing about the harvest apparently and hoping for the dry spell to continue kineas understood one word in five but he knew that the man meant well they rode on in the morning poorer by a silver owl and their horses loaded with food the rafters of the house had been packed with produce drying herbs cheese dried meats and the family had owned four goblets of gold these people are rich niceas said but no slaves kineas rubbed his beard and rode on a form of riches all its own he said thinking of his dreams niceas nodded thoughtfully what was he on about there at the end kineas rubbed his beard again weather and crops and something else i think he was warning me about bandits although it might just as well have been an admonition against being bandits niceas grunted you saw the scorch marks on the stone he said kineas had seen them recent he said and niceas nodded that afternoon they caught up with diodoruss rearguard coenus was surprised to see kineas but his men kept good watch and he was saluted and greeted and cosseted as he and niceas rode the length of the column they halted for the night with the cavalry and shared a buck that coenus killed intending to ride on in the morning despite diodoruss protests that night kineas had another dream of his youth that left him quiet when he woke a dream in which he and some boys tormented a dog it had happened he had forgotten it as he mounted after breakfast diodorus came up on horseback with sappho and several of his own staff the strategos should not be haring about alone diodorus said local people say there are bandits in the hills niceas grunted kineas raised an eyebrow should i be afraid he asked diodorus shrugged you know what i mean he said ataelus will have scouted the country kineas said this valley is broad enough that ataelus could put one of his barebreasted scouts every stade and not cover it diodorus mocked you just want to have adventures yes kineas said anything he added would only encourage more teasing over diodoruss shoulder sappho smiled she was mounted on a cavalry charger a bigger horse than most women could handle she rode well lucky bastard diodorus said after a pause he said let me come too kineas considered it a moment hed like few things better than to have his last two athenians riding by his side two of the three men in the world that he loved most but he shook his head looking at the column they need you he said diodorus grimaced truer words were never spoke he said ruefully he shrugged they need you too sappho pulled her horse up by them reason my lord may dwell within a man she said quoting sophokles and yet abandon him when troubles come diodorus said capping her quote with relish their eyes met and they shared a smile that touched the faint lines at the corners of her eyes kineas looked at both of them i take it that means i have your permission to ride on he asked diodorus nodded laughing they rode along the river for half a day and kineas said nothing beyond comments on the fields and the weather finally as they crested a long ridge to see another in the distance and rising ground all around them kineas turned to niceas do you ever think on the evil acts youve done he asked niceas looked out over the river all the time he said and kineas asked niceas looked at him and frowned and what theyre done i cant undo them i can only try not to commit them again kineas rubbed his beard if we ever return to athens im going to set you up as a philosopher niceas raised an eyebrow if we ever return to athens he said you are going to set me up as a brothel keeper perhaps ill teach the boys and girls some philosophy kineas grinned at the picture and rode on keeping his thoughts to himself after dinner they curled in their cloaks the fire crackling away and for the first time in weeks sleep evaded kineas i missed this he said niceas snorted what four weeks in olbia and you missed lying on the ground kineas rolled on his back and stared up at the wheel of heaven longer than that remember the ferryman when we crossed the tanais who thought wed all be dead when the getae came ill never forget that night why kineas said that night i thought a dozen men and a pair of slaves was a weight of responsibility on my shoulders i was thinking it was funny that i could forget how much of a burden it was to lead niceas grunted you kineas asked why do you remember it niceas rustled he was changing position while trying to keep the warmth trapped under his cloak it was the last time i slept by graccus he said niceas and graccus had been friends and lovers for years and graccus of course had died the next day im an idiot kineas said niceas snuggled against his back yes he said now go to sleep when they mounted their horses the next morning they could see that the ground rose on either side of them and the river ran fast through a narrow channel so that there was no longer any possibility of a ford or a crossing kineas killed another buck from horseback a mounted throw that earned him a grin from niceas showoff niceas shook his head you could have lost your best spear kineas grinned back and they divided the meat and then bathed in the swiftflowing water to wash off the blood it felt like ice that night was the coldest yet kineas was again feeling the weight of his responsibilities and wondering if he could afford to ride off and leave them and again he lay awake still fearing his dreams with the additional complication that he was sated with sleep niceas was already snoring beside him and it was too cold to get out of his cloak and the heavy wool blanket that covered both of them as it grew colder he pushed in closer to niceas and then he worried about his army most of the hoplites in the vanguard wouldnt have a spare blanket he thought of xenophons soldiers in the anabasis and he worried and worrying he fell asleep ajax pushed him quickly to the tree and his dead friends were fewer kleisthenes was gone kineas felt like a coward as he scrambled on to the tree and began to climb it was easy to climb as high as he had gone before and then running through the fields north of his fathers farms legs afire rabbithunting he was among the last men in the field all the older men and the keener hunters stretched ahead in a long arc after the dogs he could hear the dogs their gross baying their animal eagerness to kill and it sickened him and his legs slowed unwillingness to see the result coinciding with his own fatigue he fell further behind so that even the slowest boys passed him the cry of the hounds changed and their baying became a chorus of growls and then a ferocious roar that scared him it always scared him he slowed down further hoping to avoid the end but he could already smell it the rich earthandcopper smell of an animal wrenched apart by a dozen sets of jaws you are an embarrassment his father said what did i tell you kineas cringed you said that i must not be last kineas said i tried he whined his fathers fist caught him on the side of the head and knocked him flat he could smell the dead rabbit and the sweat on his father and the other men try harder his father said he awoke exhausted his bladder bursting it was too early for the new light of day and the cold was so deep that it was an effort of will to rise from the warmth of niceas the fire had sunk to mere embers throwing little warmth and no light and he tripped on their javelins before he found a place in the dark to relieve himself a lifetime of camp discipline forced him to put the last of the wood on the fire but he couldnt find the woodpile and he stumbled around cursing the cold piss for me while youre up niceas said kineas found the firewood by tripping over it he gathered it up blind and as he found the last decent stick he heard a horse he put the firewood near the embers and felt for a javelin he could barely stand with the fatigue of his dream you hear that he asked horse niceas said he heard niceas dropping the blankets as he rose it was that quiet kineas reached into the stillwarm blankets and retrieved his sword he put the baldric over his shoulder and felt for his sandals he wasnt sure he was awake he could barely focus his attention niceas bumped into him two horses he whispered his mouth close alert and ready the two men crouched back to back after a few minutes they retrieved their cloaks and donned them the sky began to show light the first touch of the wolfs tail if theyre coming theyll come now kineas said they didnt when the sun was up they found hoof prints in the stream bed that ran around the base of their hillside camp a little further west niceas found the print of a shod horse with a heavy toe iron like a macedonian horse he shook his head could be anything he said might have been one of ours from yesterday ataelus perhaps kineas couldnt get over the notion that he was being watched high ridges rose on either side of the river and anything might be moving in the trees up there as soon as we ride out of the stream bed were visible he said so asked niceas fair enough lets get out of here kineas went back to their camp and finished the tea then retied his cloak behind him they rode along the stream bed until it rejoined the road such as it was a couple of stades downstream and then they rode quickly along the road alternating trotting with short canters the tanais was entering a great curve and the valley broadened and deepened the river was flowing almost due north as the ground rose kineas watched for the path to fork east theres a sight for sore eyes said niceas kineas intent on the trail looked up to find a barechested sauromatae girl sitting on a pony just half a stade away ataelus met them at the top of the pass where the eastern road crossed the ridge before continuing east to the rha and the kaspian he had half a dozen riders with him two of them were wounded for making happy ataelus proclaimed and grasped his arm kineas embraced the sakje man then he pointed at one of the sauromatae girls who was boiling a human skull in a pot what in hades is that wedding present ataelus said and laughed slapping his knee with a calloused hand he was so pleased with his retort that he translated it into sakje and repeated it all of his prodromoi howled kineas shook his head wedding present he asked sauromatae girl for needing to kill man before wedding ataelus said clean skull for stinking less yes he grinned who did she kill kineas asked bandits ataelus said for finding bandits in hills farmers say bandits kill us steal our grain and i say for finding bandits niceas twisted his mouth and made a noise macedonianshod he asked ataelus looked at him without comprehending ataeluss greek was good enough but it never seemed to get better than good enough no matter how much time he spent with them niceas got down and lifted a hoof of his macedonian charger he showed the shoe ataelus nodded enthusiastically and persian and sakje he pointed to two small ponies with irongrey hides and bloodstains what about philokles kineas asked ataelus shrugged eight days ahead more for riding hard ataelus waved east kineas nodded and nihmu he asked for child ataelus asked nihmu yatavu child for being somewhere for being under the foot of my pony when i fight or for dropping rocks on bandits who knows where the child is for going he grinned her horses i am for having sure enough the dozen royal chargers towered over the scouts remounts like a separate genus niceas explained that diodorus was a day or two behind and lot a week behind him ataelus watched the ridges behind them while niceas spoke when niceas finished ataelus pulled at his nose and drooped an eyelid time to find bandits he said for taking their horses bring them fire when diodorus for coming bandits scatter he pointed down the other side of the ridge towards the kaspian and hyrkania bandits thick as rain for fighting out on the high plains all way to rha lost two men getting spartan to coast kineas rubbed his beard how many bandits ataelus many and many ataelus replied kill bandits here for making others feel fear yes kineas could see that ataelus already had a plan so he nodded ataelus grinned he motioned to one of the sauromatae girls she slipped off her mare pulled her saddle blanket off her horses back and threw a double armful of dewwet bracken on the fire thick greyblue smoke pulsed into the sky the sauromatae girl put her blanket over the fire in one smooth motion so that the smoke was cut off then she whipped it clear and another pulse of smoke shot upward she repeated this three times ataelus grunted in satisfaction neat trick kineas said have we ever seen them do that before niceas asked no kineas answered already there was a picket galloping up the ridge from the eastern road he pulled on his reins in the camp and samahe ataeluss wife from the cruel hands barked orders at him he grinned dismounted cut another pony out of the herd remounted and galloped away a pair of sauromatae girls galloped in from another direction before the sun rose three fingers more there were a dozen riders gathered and they were riding hard along one of the many stream beds that crisscrossed the wooded ridges a trickle of water flowed over rocks under their horses hooves but the banks were clear of leaves or brush on either side up to the height of their horses withers indicating how full these little valleys ran when the rains fell ataelus seemed to know just where he was riding kineas was content to ride along the shadows stretched away when they stopped all the sakje and the sauromatae dismounted and relieved themselves without letting go of their reins kineas and niceas imitated them there was a hint of smoke on the cold wind over the strong smell of urine a cleareyed blonde woman handed him a gourd of water and he raised it in acknowledgement before he drank she looked to be fourteen or perhaps fifteen she had two skulls on the ornate saddle of her horse kineas grinned at her and she returned the grin we for hitting them at dark ataelus said understand for hitting he smacked his right fist into his left hand i understand kineas said for watching two days since girls get in fight and samahe for finding camp ataelus shrugged there was something untold some story that made samahe wrinkle her nose and made one of the girls blush and wriggle in her saddle a story hed never know kineas thought you knew we were coming kineas said suddenly making the connection nihmu says for coming says protect him king ataelus shrugged not for needing child for telling for protecting you watched us last night niceas asked no for today since sun rose this way ataelus closed one eye and raised a hand palm flat just over the horizon niceas shook his head they were on us last night if they watched us meet kineas took a deep breath suddenly eager to have it over with if they intended to ambush us theyve had all day to do it the shadows lengthened across the meadows below them and the air grew frostier as the suns rays fell further away niceas and kineas had to work to curb the impatience of their horses kineass getae horse was the worst fretting constantly and jerking his head at any motion so that kineas had to dismount and hold his head the blonde woman gave him a glance of pity pity that his horse was so illtrained twice they heard voices both times persian speakers getting water from the tanais below them then while the sun was just visible they saw a pair of riders come out of the meadow and ride a short distance up the ridge from where they had a good view of the eastern road at their feet ataelus grunted in disgust because by chance or purpose the new pickets had a much better chance of warning the camp below of his approach than the pair they replaced he clucked his tongue in his cheek as he watched them and after a few minutes he summoned one of the standing horse warriors in his band and the two of them rode off down the back of the ridge samahe dismounted and lay in the leaf mould her hand shading her eyes time dragged by the sauromatae women were as nervous as kittens but their horses were calm munching quietly on anything in reach and otherwise immobile niceas drew and resheathed his sword a dozen times kineas was busy keeping his undertrained horse from mischief he was amazed at their discipline all over again he couldnt have kept a dozen greek troopers so quiet without the hope of massive gain even as he thought it he wondered if he was making a poor assumption perhaps the greeks could do as well perhaps with training some rides out with sakje patrols samahe rose to a crouch and kineas snapped from his reverie to watch the ground below him the two mounted pickets were almost invisible even from above but little movements in the trees betrayed their position to a careful watcher but unlike samahe kineas couldnt see ataelus or his partner so the first he knew of their movement was a pair of arrows appearing from the rocks to the right and falling silently on the pickets now samahe said in sakje and she vaulted on to her mare and set off down the hillside at a speed that terrified kineas who was right behind her and couldnt for the sake of honour go any slower he reached the valley floor at a gallop already past his fear because the ride had been so bad in itself and he readied a javelin as the pair of them raced across the meadow he could see the camp now and it seemed to be full of men and horses dozens of them a few had bows one raised his and loosed but the arrow flew well over kineas who ducked down on his horses mane and galloped on straight at the heart of the bandit camp samahes horse sidestepped some obstruction in the meadow grass and on her next rise she shot her arrow licking across the flowers and the sweet grass to drop one of the few bandits to get mounted her second arrow was in the air the sauromatae girls werent shooting they were screaming with all the gusto of the young warrior screaming away their terror and their exhilaration and they bore straight at the bandits by the river kineas went through the camp without touching his reins no one opposed him and he rode past the huddle of bandits at the riverbank and then up a short rise to a clearing in the riverbank woods where there was an abandoned farmstead and the bandit horse herd there were ten men in the clearing and despite the screams from the riverside they seemed surprised when he appeared in their midst and two of them were down before any got weapons to hand kineas wheeled his horse and extended his arm using the momentum of the move to twirl the shaft in his fingers so that he changed grips in a single stride of his mount and a circle of blood drops flew from the point of his rotating javelin he felt like a god at least for a moment one of the men had a bow and shot his horse who crashed to the ground in another stride and he fell getting a leg under him and then rolling javelin lost he came up against a tree and he rolled to put the bole between him and the archer the archer laughed try this he called in persian he shot the arrow hit the tree and shattered and the man laughed again he had a black beard and kohlrimmed eyes like a bactrian nobleman down by the river men were dying blackbeard drew another arrow get horses he called over his shoulder and two boys sprang to do his bidding kineas pulled his cloak off and whirled it around his arm moving to his right to a larger tree try this greek blackbeard shot again and his arrow hit the new tree kineas jumped out and retrieved his javelin avoiding the slashing hooves of his dying getae mount and leaping behind another tree just as a third arrow skipped along the bark and slapped into the rolled cloak on his arm try this harlot kineas yelled and threw his javelin then he charged leaping a downed tree as he ran heedless of the odds it was better than letting a master archer take his time and something had gone wrong in the fight by the river his javelin hit the man by the archers side knocking him flat like the deer the archer turned and ran and kineas ran after him there were men in the clearing and they set themselves to stop him but none put the archers life higher than his own and kineas ran through them downing one with a sword cut as he ran by the two boys had grabbed a pair of horses apiece and blackbeard took the first he came to tossed the boy clear of the saddlecloth and vaulted astride pulling the horses head around at the other side of the clearing samahe appeared shooting as she came and the other boy went down with an arrow in his guts screaming kineas found himself crossing blades with yet another persian another nobleman from the rags of purple on his cloak the man had a good sword and he was aggressive blackbeard pulled his horse around and shot so did samahe neither hit both were moving fast flat to their horses backs and then kineas had no attention to spare the persian leaped in and cut hard at his head kineas parried and the blades rang together and the persian kicked at his shin under the locked iron kineas pushed his hooked blade up and over his opponents guard and then slipped a foot behind the mans ankle and pushed hoping for a throw and the persian jumped back cutting high he was a swordsman kineas parried and cut back a short chop at his opponents hand but the persian had seen such a move before and he made a handhigh parry that turned into an overhand cut to the head and kineas just managed a parry taking a blow that was not quite a cut to the shoulder his left hand closed on his sakje whip in the sash at his back and he pulled it clear and changed his stance to lead with his left foot the whip out as a shield the persian had a knife in his left hand and he stamped forward leading with the knife kineas backed away kicked pine needles and risked a glance over his shoulder ataelus was shooting behind him shooting back the way he had come something was wrong the persian was smiling he flicked with the knife a feint with just enough power to draw blood kineas retreated a step and the persians smile grew wider he suddenly changed tempo pivoting on his front foot and thrusting with his sword and then trying to trap kineass sword against his own with the dagger kineas just barely evaded the trap twisting his body pulling a muscle in his neck inwardly cursing again he backed away aware that this fight was taking too much time ataelus called out in sakje something about a wound kineas made a high attack with his sword scoring just a touch of a cut against his opponents forearm and drawing the same high counterattack but this time kineas gave the mans sword hand the full weight of the lash of his riding whip and then cut low with his blade catching the persian just on the hip bone and cutting him deeply the man fell back he wasnt grinning but he had the grace to salute with his dagger hand kineas leaped forward cut hard at the persians sabre and knocked it right out of the mans hand the lash had hurt as kineas could see yield he said in persian the persian glanced over his shoulder where samahe had an arrow pointed at his back he nodded three times as if some point of philosophy had just come to him and tossed his dagger on the ground i yield he said kineas raised his own blade stepped well back and looked for ataelus and niceas ataelus was at the horse herd calling orders niceas was nowhere to be seen the swordsman was the only prisoner his cousin blackbeard hadnt survived the archery duel with both samahe and ataelus and the rest of their troop had been cut down or had fled kineas was a little surprised at the savagery of the sakje but only a little he was more worried about niceas niceas lay out on the meadow of flowers with an arrow in his ribs he wasnt dead but he was deeply unconscious from the fall and the arrow had skidded up his ribs and ripped open his shoulder as well shit kineas said ill save him said nihmu kineas whirled he hadnt seen her approach hadnt seen her horse she had a strung bow over her shoulder and her quiver was empty she turned and ran across the meadow towards the bandit camp and kineas was left to make his comrade as comfortable as possible he rolled niceass cloak and put it under his head and cut the remnants of his tunic free from his body nihmu came back with a copper beaker of water still steaming hot from the bandits fire it looks worse than it is she said with the confidence of an adult then more quietly sirven died sirven kineas asked lots daughter older the blonde girl nihmu shrugged i told her she would die if she fought here but when she went down they all fought over her body ataelus took a cut she pointed at a redhaired girl of fourteen weeping her sister lost a finger and took an arrow in the leg they are all angry she sounded like the child she was and like an upset child at that kineas felt his postbattle fatigue come on him as the daimon that animated him to fight left his body empty of feelings except sorrow nihmu was washing the wound with hot water her dark hair hanging in uncombed tangles over her face so that he couldnt see her they are all angry she repeated so they killed all the bandits all kineas asked turning to look for his prisoner you should stay by him he will do you a good turn one day that one if ataelus doesnt take his hair kineas turned and trotted off into the dusk to find his persian the man was burying blackbeard kineas listened to the sauromatae mourning sirven and her sister mosva he thought shes called mosva kineas left his persian prisoner working and walked down to the river to find ataelus stupid girl ataelus said bitterly stupid sauromatae barbarian girl he had tears in his eyes and a quaver in his voice fight like wild things sword to sword with grown men hard men and me for fool too long fighting stupid greeks kineas hugged the little sakje and pressed samahes hand and embraced the little redhaired princess who clung to him and wept until he was embarrassed and then for a good time beyond so that he stared into the gathering darkness and patted her hair thinking bleak thoughts about the quality of right and wrong good and evil and about how far he was from being a man of virtue when he couldnt comfort a bereft sister but eventually she felt his awkwardness and drew back with an apology and then he punished himself and went to help the persian bury his cousin later he sat by the fire making barley soup for niceas who was deeply unconscious i came to find you nihmu said kneeling by him i didnt like it when they killed the prisoners it made me afraid killing prisoners is never good sometimes it must be done when they are wounded and you cant help them sometimes it happens he shrugged the image of the getae man he had killed a year before rising in his mind so that he gave a little shiver of revulsion it is time are you climbing the tree yet she asked kineas nodded yes he said i saw you in the dream world three nights ago i think it must have been you are an eagle kineas shuddered again with a different disgust speaking of the dream world this way was like discussing sex he knew men who did it but he didnt himself speaking of the dream world with this this child was almost impossible yes he said repressing his feelings as well as he might she flicked a smile at him and put some herbs into the barley soup he wont die she said as if niceass continued existence were obvious to anyone kineas looked at niceas and felt tears come to his eyes his throat threatened to close and he couldnt speak he knew that niceas might die in any skirmish on any day but the reality of his unmoving body was deeply painful you need a horse the girl said kineas took a deep breath to deny it and then slumped yes he said i have a horse for you the girl said a magnificent beast who will carry you from now to the day you fall kineas smiled the way i ride i may fall later today nihmu looked back at him with a childs intensity and a childs impatience for adult humour you know what i mean take the horse and kineas agreed the persians name was darius every firstborn son in his generation was darius it seemed he was tired of war which had been his life since he was seventeen he was twentythree he related the tales of his life as he sat beside a small fire heating water to clean niceas who was still unconscious and had no control of his bodily functions i left home six years ago to fight the great king he said he gave a wry smile the usurper that is darius he shrugged real persians the true persians of the great plain he was never our king he looked into the fire rolled over to get more firewood and winced as the cut on his hip pained him kineas nodded and your alexander rode right into our rebellion he defeated us in the west were you there kineas nodded pinarus river i was with the allied cavalry darius shook his head i was still a rebel then after alexander won it was clear to most noblemen clear enough to my father that if we continued to rebel we were handing our empire to the foreigner so we marched to the socalled great king at ecbatana and followed him to gaugamela he shrugged you were there kineas nodded on our left darius looked surprised our right i was there he winced again by fire you cut me deep kineas began trying to feed soup to niceas beyond the fire the sauromatae and the sakje were mourning the dead woman singing her songs to her pyre the smell of horse meat was strong it might have been deeper he said the persian nodded so it might i was at gaugamela and we almost broke you but you didnt kineas said with satisfaction he might not serve macedon any more indeed he was probably an enemy of macedon when sides were counted but gaugamela had been the last fight of the hellenes against the persians and he was proud of his role there he had won the laurel for valour because his unsung allied cavalry had held the line when the persian cavalry threatened to break parmenions flank and bury the taxeis under an avalanche of persians it was the longest fight i can remember i lost two horses and lived kineas nodded in agreement in his experience most field battles were decided fairly quickly and the other side took the punishment when they broke at gaugamela the decision hung in the balance for an hour and both sides died after the battle my father was dead and my household dispersed my cousin claimed the lordship he was older and the persian gave an expressive shrug we never got home we moved north into hyrkania but there were too many wolves there already and we kept going until we came here we thought to carve out a kingdom far from the hellenes he gave a selfdeprecating smile the same smile hed worn when he lost his sword in the fight we ended up as bandits this might make a good kingdom kineas said he pointed at niceass form he thinks so they sat in companionable silence for some time eventually kineas asked are you worth a ransom somewhere if my mother lives i have some small riches the man admitted he shrugged again he shrugged a lot i doubt it you greeks have everything around ecbatana now and most of our eastern holdings too we had a tower in bactria i doubt it even tried to hold your mad king not my mad king kineas began it was his turn and the young persian with the perpetual shrugs was a good companion kineas intended to win him as a friend and put him in a troop he was a good sword too good to waste but niceas chose that moment to sputter around a spoonful of soup his body gave a spasm and he sprayed soup out of his mouth his eyes were open what the fuck he said kineas felt his eyes fill with tears you stupid cocksucker he said with tones of those born to the agora in athens you fell off your horse niceas smiled more soup he said the next day diodorus caught up with them his part of the army camped above them on the heights where the road turned east and went down into the country of the rha diodorus came down the ridge with a dozen troopers including coenus and eumenes diodorus went straight to niceas as did coenus afterwards diodorus ordered a tent put up for the strategos and eumenes went to fetch it i heard the old man was dead diodorus said his face was still red and blotched from emotion perhaps from weeping hes saved my life more times than my nanny paddled my behind i came as fast as i could kineas nodded hed slept through the night once niceass sleep had given way to healthy snores and he felt ten years younger i thought he was gone kineas admitted coenus was feeding the hyperetes more barley soup he still looks like shit he said niceas croaked something about feeling better kineas shook his head he took an arrow in the side we werent in armour bad decision on my part and the bandits were good damned good tough fight coenus thrust his chin at the persian who was tending the soup prisoner kineas nodded and recruit when eumenes gets back put him in his troop hes a swordsman as good as me i assume he can ride coenus laughed he is a persian he coughed you and ataelus killed all his friends i get the feeling he doesnt miss them if he cuts all our throats ill be proven wrong kineas pulled his cloak tighter ill stay here with niceas coenus and diodorus exchanged glances nah said coenus youre the strategos this isnt the only bandit band ask ataelus the plains are full of them by all accounts you go and command leave me with my section and ill bring the old boy along when hes ready diodorus stepped forward hes right kineas kineas rubbed his beard you are both correct of course very well coenus ill send your section down the ridge diodorus lets get ataelus and plan the next set of marches lot is five days behind you somebody gets to tell him that his daughter is dead diodorus winced as if cut the high plains between the tanais and the rha were indeed full of bandits an endless profusion of masterless persians and outlawed nomads and macedonian deserters so that there wasnt an intact farmstead between the two rivers four years of war in hyrkania and the south had filled the high plains with the human flotsam of war and like wolves on the verge of a hard winter they were desperate men when forced they fed on each other band against band all raided the settlements on the expanding edge of their selfmade desert ataelus had already lost three men to them before the fight with the bandits on the tanais and his prodromoi were eager for revenge kineas and diodorus assigned the second troop heavy with the keltoi to reinforce ataelus kineas took charge of the column and diodorus took charge of the extermination of the bandits he didnt catch as many as he wanted to but the main body crossed the high plains to the valleys of the rha without losing a single horse or man and unknown to them the sindi and maeotae farmers blessed them diodorus drove the larger groups across the marshes to the north and twice he caught bands and the keltoi and the sauromatae wrecked them they brought back a rich haul of horses some very fine and enough gold and silver to please the men who did the fighting casualties were gratifyingly light as was to be expected when employing overwhelming force kineas called his new horse thalassa after days of riding the magnificent silver charger and trying out various temporary names brute seemed the front runner as the beast towered over most of the other warhorses by the width of a mans hand the big horse had the colour of a stormy day at sea she was surefooted and had an amazing quality of stillness not lack of spirit but something like patience that suited a commanders horse and on the day that sappho insisted that so noble an animal needed a better name than brute the lead elements of the army crested the last ridge of the rhas frontier and saw the kaspian sparkling in the distance the bay of the rha full of ships and like xenophons men seventy years before they cried out for the sea and the name was given the crossing had not been particularly arduous except for recruits and the men of second troop whod spent a week fighting bandits but the armys grain supply was very low most men had only a days grain in their packs or less if theyd been improvident the sight of fifty small boats in the bay raised everyones spirits and the presence of philokles on the gravel and mud beach drew a roar of acclaim kineas embraced him does this place have a name kineas asked philokles smelled clean errymi the maeotae call it the spartan gave a wry smile it is good to see you kineas kineas embraced him again for an answer are all those for us kineas asked if we can pay philokles answered otherwise i suspect theyll murder me and sail away kineas watched the mules bearing the armys treasury coming down the last ridge guarded by the most trustworthy men in the army and wintering over northern hyrkania philokles responded strategos your kingdom awaits kineas shook his head i dont want a kingdom philokles gave an enigmatic smile how about a woman he asked kineas laughed i have a woman shes ten thousand stades distant but ill catch up philokles gave him an odd look have you made an offering to aphrodite brother he asked kineas laughed no he said philokles gave a distant smile you should he looked over the sea our winter camp is in a kingdom ruled by a woman and she she moved me and i have no tenderness for women i fear for you kineas furrowed his brow stung what reason have i ever given you to fear for my behaviour with a woman he asked philokles continued to watch him with the air of a man who has seen the world i would prefer you to cross the kaspian with your eyes open this woman desires power and men with power fascinate her she lay with alexander they say now she awaits us he glanced around she offers a great deal of treasure for our spring campaign kineas shrugged im of a mind now to push on in spring the march went well and the bandits in the hills put some gold in our coffers he looked at the ships and our ally leons factor her late husband she remains an ally she paid leon an enormous backlog of moneys owed without demur but i doubt her i wish you to be immune to her kineas shook his head in mock wonder i am immune he said nihmu laughed no man is immune to the yatavu of hyrkania she said except those who love only men she came and went from the command group red hair like a helmet crest announcing her arrival she sat on her great white horse amid the mud and the flotsam on the beach if you fail strategos your children will not rule here what kineas shrugged and turned his back on her she spoke like an oracle but she was a stripling and he was busy think as you will this is a foolish conversation to whom do we speak about paying these ships he asked philokles philokles explained that every captain was an independent operator the boats were small half the size of a greek pentekonter and some smaller than that with ten or twelve oars a side a few were sailing vessels like large fishing smacks kineas cast his eyes across them and shook his head changing the subject again to calm his temper i dont see transport for two thousand horses he said philokles rubbed his forehead pulled his cloak tighter against the autumn wind and met kineass eye two hundred horses at a time he said it was the best i could do kineas nodded apologetically i didnt mean you havent done your best he said youve done enough that you are here and with food and so much transport lets start shipping them across the sea how many days two days each way with luck and a friendly wind it is a very small sea kineas shaded his eyes with his hand pushing his straw hat back on his head to keep the flapping brim out of his line of sight we captured quite a few horses on the way here he said let us arrange sacrifices to poseidon and some games horse races such as the tridentbearer values above all things let us celebrate his power tonight and then lets start loading the autumn is wearing on and winter is coming kineas was among the last of his men to leave for the winter camp in hyrkania he stayed on the beach in errymi to shepherd the men across to keep morale high on the beach to prevent incidents with the locals and to wait for niceas as the weeks passed while storms slowed the ferries and the stores of food dwindled and the conditions in the seaside camp worsened he found that his presence heartened his men and that all his skills as a leader were required to prevent mischief and even murder he had the cavalrymen dig earthworks an unheardof demand that served to raise a barrier against the constant wind and more importantly against boredom at least until the walls were complete prince lots knights were even less inclined to dig than greek aristocrats but time and the example of prince lot himself got most of them to it and kineas was too versed in military leadership to believe that every one of the sauromatae needed to be set to digging some hunted for food and also for bandits the killing of lots elder daughter was a mistake for which the masterless men of the high plains paid for three months and the aggressive mourning of the sauromatae would cease only when the last boats were rowed away from the empty marching camp kineas didnt intend to burn the huts that had been built however instead he handed the finished work to a group of maeotae farmers dispossessed men whose families had been burned out by the bandits and who had fled to the marshes to eke out a living with the marching camp as a fortified town they had every chance of holding their own a dozen keltoi too badly wounded in the falls fighting to make the crossing would remain as military settlers kineas discovered that it was niceas he was hanging on for when he saw the unmistakable width of coenuss broad shoulders coming down the ridge from the west closer up the dozen greek troopers were obviously not a returning patrol and closer still kineas could see niceas swathed in fur robes riding a big pony kineas sent a boy for his riding horse and went out to meet them his throat tight it remained tight while he embraced niceas who winced and cursed and coenus and crax and sitalkes and antigonus niceas looked twenty years older and coenus looked considerably thinner but the rest of them smiled a great deal and shuffled when kineas praised them privately coenus was less sanguine hes not the same coenus said niceas was sitting on the rim of the hearth visibly soaking up warmth im not sure hell ever fight again but hes alive and hes as tough as a slaves sandal coenus drank back his wine his third cup and swallowed a handful of olives was it hard kineas asked never coenus said best hunting of my life like xenophons notion of elysium after lot came we sent back for grain and later the farmers came to us it was never dull and those are good men you gave me his grin had a selfconscious air to it i loved it he narrowed his eyes niceas says we should carve a kingdom out of this land coenus usually fastidious had a bushy beard and he rubbed it with his fingers as if embarrassed by it i want to sign up ill put a shrine to artemis in that valley i know just the spot ill hunt until im too old to ride and then ill sit around losing my teeth and telling lies then he stopped grinning watching him was hard he said niceas was grey with fatigue and went to bed too soon kineas lay next to niceas in the tent niceas slept more deeply than he had before his wound and he lay still as if in death so that kineas often listened to him like an anxious parent with a sick child leaning across the older mans body to hear his soft breathing tonight kineas had philokles on his other side it was a cold damp night with a threat of freezing rain in the air and every man in the army pushed close to his tent mates kineas was tired with worry and relief but sleep would not come and he lay listening to the sounds made by his night guards by two thousand horses in the dark by a few foolish soldiers lingering late by their mess fires they too were relieved to find that boats were waiting for them and then as subtle as the first fall of snow he was standing amidst the bones at the base of the tree surrounded by the silent combat of dead friends against dead foes he reached for a limb and drew himself up until the combat beneath him vanished and he looked up the tree towered over him reaching into the sky he noticed that the tree lacked the misty quality of his first dreams now it was as palpable and as solid as any tree outside the world of dreams the owl shot by and made a showy landing above him and squawked kineas grinned at it i know what im here for he told the owl instead of a slow climb he reached for a branch overhead planted his feet and leaped to grab the next major limb he just caught it and he hung for a moment the strain on his arms as real as anything in the outer world and it took the concentration of all his years on the floor of various gymnasiums to lever himself up and over to lie panting for a full minute before he pushed himself up and climbed carefully to his feet in the agora of his youth with a sack of scrolls hanging over his arm fourteen too young to be a man and old enough to desire to be one diodorus and graccus walked by his side alert for trouble demosthenes had spoken in the assembly against philip of macedon and all of the agora was talking about it kineas and his two best friends drifted from group to group abandoning the safety of their group of rich boys to listen to the conversation of older men there was a large circle of men gathered around apollion and he walked around them apollion tall handsome blond apollion who the assembly loved and who fought in the front rank in the phalanx had made advances just yesterday making it clear that he could push kineass career as an orator if kineas would suck his dick for a few years hed put it better than that but kineass anger and fear for apollion was a big man dangerous in combat and in the assembly blinded him to rational behaviour hed struck apollion in front of everyone in the gymnasium and fled the man looked up from the crowd he was haranguing and gave kineas a wolfish grin kineas froze caught between the desire to defy and the desire to flee diodorus didnt hesitate its like finding socrates talking in the agora he called out many of the older men laughed aloud apollion often liked to quote socrates but socrates had been notoriously ugly it was a twoedged gibe grinning like the fox he was diodorus gave kineas a shove to get him moving again dont act like a deer caught in torchlight diodorus hissed hell think youre pining for him graccus who admired apollion shook his head id have him in a moment he grinned he was given to grins i cant imagine what he sees in you he swatted kineas on the leg hes saving himself for phocion diodorus said and kineas stung at last smacked him in the ear phocion athenss greatest soldier taught all of them in swordsmanship and in the use of the spear it set them apart from other rich boys many of whom disdained military service as something for those too stupid to make money kineas called them idiotai after thucydides in the dream world kineas knew what was coming and part of his mind flinched from it even as he experienced it again they had crossed the agora and were well down the road to the gates far from their own haunts still listening to men gossip and discourse they were in a bad part of athens where men went for cheap wine and cheap sex we should get out of here graccus said quietly diodorus looked around those are brothels he said he sounded interested some day im going to purchase a hetaira and fuck her every minute of the day is this before or after youve sailed beyond the pillars of herakles kineas jibed but a commotion in the doorway of the nearest knocking shop drew their attention ive fucking paid for an hour and ill have every fucking grain of sand in the glass shouted a man he sounded like a foreigner a corinthian or a theban he had a boy by the neck the boy was short toughlooking with heavy dark circles under his eyes he was naked and there was blood running down his legs he wasnt crying his shoulders were rigid with tension he suddenly burst into action breaking free of the foreigner but the man was too fast he tripped the boy and then as he went down he kicked him savagely in the stomach so that the boy heaved up vomiting the foreigner stepped back he turned back to the brothel keeper ill fuck him in the street if i please he said his voice so devoid of strain or inflection that the hairs rose on kineass neck we need to get out of here graccus said kineas felt something inside him some combination of his own ideas of right of apollions desire to force him to have sex his anger at having failed to stand up to the man the brothel keeper shook his head respected sir you must not abuse him and if he refuses you you must go the brothel keeper was not a small man and he wasnt cowed he wouldnt have held his place if violence cowed him the boy is not a slave you are a foreigner if you make a fuss ill have you taken the foreigner moved suddenly grabbing the brothel keepers ears and slamming his head against the doorpost of the brothel then he raised his knee and smashed it into the brothel keepers chin anyone else want some he asked the street he reached down and picked up the boy closer up kineas could see that the boy wasnt as young as he had thought he was in fact a few years older than kineas just scrawny and illfed diodorus reached out a hand but he was too late kineas slipped away and stood in front of the foreigner whose eyes glittered with something kineas hadnt seen before put him down kineas said the foreigner was a soldier he had all the marks of wearing armour on him and a heavy knife at his belt of the kind soldiers wore when they didnt wear swords or the man said he didnt grin or frown it was as if his face was dead kineass voice cracked in fear but he stood his ground put him down kineas said and dont even think of harming me me came out as a squeak as the man dropped the boy to fall in the garbage of the street my father is i dont give a fuck about your father little arsecunt the man said he was fast and he swung hard punching kineas in the side of the head before he was ready pain exploded in kineass head and he stumbled hit the wall of the brothel and bounced back almost into the foreigners arms guided by the gods the man wasnt ready for him and as kineas jostled him his right hand closed of its own accord on the mans knife the man shoved him annoyed now and kineas stumbled back with the knife in his hand put that down or ill rip the flesh off your face the man said graccus was no fool he was screaming for the watch running back to the agora because the watch didnt come down here a stone hit the man in the head it was well thrown a jagged bit of mortar from the illkept tenements and it made the sound of a dropped melon when it hit the mans eyes flicked to diodorus youre dead he said without changing facial expression he stepped forward intent on kineas the boy the older boy had one of his legs the man tripped stumbled and kineas blocked a piece of his blow with his left arm and thrust hard with the knife the whole weight of his stocky body behind the blow but he struck too high and the knife caught the mans breastbone and skidded up cutting sinew slashing all the way across to the point of the shoulder the man shrieked and punched leftrightleft and one of the blows caught kineas and flung him back his jaw broken and blood pouring from his nose tears burst from his eyes he didnt drop the knife or lose sight of his opponent that much of phocions training stuck he was conscious that this was a fight to the death and that to lose control to the pain would be the end but beyond that his body seemed to be in the fight by itself with his brain unable to affect the outcome and above it kineas the dreamer already knew the outcome and the pain the street was filling with people and many were calling for the watch while others wagered on the outcome kineas set himself in his sword stance left leg forward left arm out like a shield knife close to his body blood and tears and mucus were running down his face and his whole head hurt the foreigner was also hurt he took the respite to step on the boy lying under him breaking his ribs with an audible popping sound the boy screamed in rage fear helpless pain the man stepped over him and pointed at diodorus run he said or ill kill you next diodorus hit him with a paving stone he halfmissed his throw because it was too heavy and so instead of hitting the mans head it fell short on the mans right foot the man screamed in pain his right leg collapsing but even from one knee he managed to stumble at diodorus landing a heavy blow that knocked the redhaired boy unconscious kineas made himself attack he stepped forward limbs leaden with fear and made a halfhearted cut the man took it on his arm and moved to punch kineas but he couldnt put weight on his shattered foot and he fell kineas was on him without thought of chivalry he fell on the mans back and plunged the dagger into the mans kidneys not once but three or four times the man flipped him off rolling and pinning him in one move he reached back his fingers searching for kineass eyes for his throat kineas stabbed wildly squirmed landed a feeble cut that nonetheless invoked the mans flinch reflex and then he was on his feet slick with the mans blood the man was gushing blood he half rose to his feet ares he complained as if in a conversation spearwielder im being killed by a pair of whores in an alley im no whore mercenary kineas hissed through split lips and blood and a broken jaw he felt the balance shift he was going to win he stood taller the foreigner sat suddenly youve killed me he said as if in wonder not a whore you say he tilted his head to one side like a dog watching a man got the guts to put me down boy or are you going to stand there and let me bleed out im kineas cleanuss son a citizen of athens kineas held the mans glittering eyes stepped in close despite those arms and plunged his dagger into the mans throat as if he were hitting the paint on the practice stake behind phocions house and then the watch came and diodoruss father and then his own father he was wrapped in blankets in attention and love even in admiration there were too many witnesses to the mans brutality and the brothel keeper was dead only later would parents ask why three boys had been standing outside a brothel kineas insisted that his fathers slave carry the broken boy the whore home a doctor set his ribs and kineas sat by him night after night day after day diodorus came and took his turn and graccus the boy lay still so still kineas often thought he was dead and kineas would lean across his body to hear him breathe but gradually the dark stains like bruises faded from under the short boys eyes and one day they opened months later kineas asked him one day while the four of them were climbing a crag on one of kineass fathers farms looking for birds eggs why were you a whore not much fucking choice niceas answered he fingered an amulet at his neck only good thing ive got im free not a fucking slave he rubbed his nose in thought being a free man doesnt feed you is it better being my groom kineas asked niceas shrugged stupid fucking question he said and then he aimed a mock blow at kineas who ducked and awoke the next day niceas responded to kineas with grunts he never swore if he didnt want things he simply turned his head away like a child the night before they were due to take ship to hyrkania he suddenly turned to kineas i dont want to die like this he said kineas hadnt heard so much in his voice in a week he stopped pouring wine you arent dying he said niceas shrugged head down shoulders sagged i am you cant see it but i am further prodding revealed nothing and promises of a physician led only to the turned head and then he forgot those worries as they prepared to sail on the kaspian sea and a new set of worries descended on him a hard winter sun cast the last of its cold light over the icy beach as the pentekonter hove to in the appointed bay in hyrkania the anchor stone cast while the rowers backed water against the growing wind and at last came to rest a fitful rest as poseidon rocked them the land of wolves lay under a blanket of snow when kineas finally waded ashore in the bleak twilight barelegged and cursing the cold water wolves howling in the distance crax and sitalkes clambered over the side of the pentekonter carrying niceas in a litter while coenus pushed the horses over the rail and into the water to swim ashore on their own theyd lost one at sea a slow death of terror for coenuss favourite mare a painful terrible event and the big man was subdued but when they were all on the beach he led them in a prayer of thanks to poseidon and then they sang the hymn to apollo in the last light of the sun the merchants stalls at the top of the gravel beach were either closed tight or lined in drifted snow there was no welcoming party so they rubbed their horses down as best they could drying them with straw from a mouldering stack crax found and then headed inland on the only visible track kineas sent crax and sitalkes out as scouts made sure that all his men were armed and went back to the beach to pay the last coins of his passage to the captain a piratical persian called cyrus how far to the camp he asked as the persian counted the coins and tested the silver ones with his teeth three stades less the man smiled showing too many teeth before the waters went down the town was on the beach he shrugged it must be as the gods will it eh kineas agreed that it was so youre going to fight iskander yes the persian asked and not for the first time he had a gold toothpick which flashed around his lips as he talked yes cyrus extended a hand good luck they say he is a god kineas nodded he says hes a god excellent argument the pirate said they say you might throw a garrison into the fort you built at errymi i might said kineas anxious to be gone but unwilling to be rude good for business might get a piece of the grain trade cyrus winked boats like mine would pay a fee to have a real harbour in the north ill think on it kineas said and they clasped arms again the camp was less than three stades inland east of the beach and south of the town itself as the scarred man had said and as they approached they saw a pair of towers built of wood and rubble and closer up earth walls and neat rows of huts outside the walls there was a sprawl of cruder huts and leather tents and emerging from the gate between the two timber towers came a troop of wellmounted greek cavalry led by diodorus and philokles the snow in the air accented the smell of burning oak from the hearth fires and closer to the market they smelled olive oil something none of them had seen in a month niceas raised his head at kineass side smells like home he said i think we are home kineas answered it took kineas days to stop marvelling at the quality of the camp and his praise was appreciated at first and later resented a little because it suggested he hadnt expected as much of them in fact diodorus had plenty of experience in building fortified camps and philokles had chosen the site well on a clear running stream with a broad meadow stretching away to the north for exercise the town of namastopolis sat well above them three more stades to the south surrounded by tiny subsistence farms it wasnt a rich place more like a robberbarons holding than a town and the citadel was an ugly fortress of crude stone atop the acropolis although rumour had it that the inside was as opulent as the outside was prosaic lower down many of the towns least reputable elements had picked up and moved to sit at the gate of the military camp because the soldiers brought money and the town had the means to take it away the sprawl at the gate featured a market almost an agora where the soldiers bought food and oil for their messes there were legitimate merchants there with wine and olive oil weapons and armour there were a dozen wine shops from a newly built tavern with solid walls its own hearth and prostitutes hanging over the balcony of the exedra to hide tents with a board over a pair of wooden horses and a few amphorae of wine stuck base down in the snow followers abounded from prostitutes of both sexes in the market to new wives in the snug huts that lined the streets inside the walls with military precision kineass little army numbered almost twelve hundred men and women at least half the population of the town and citadel above them the town and the citadel had its own soldiers a mix of greek mercenaries released from alexanders armies deserters and survivors of various persian armies they put on airs and swaggered but the olbians didnt think much of them and lots sauromatae had killed a couple in brawls rather to make a point diodorus said kineas heard diodoruss report after he had eaten slept steamed and run he listened to his officers report in turn rubbing his beard as leon gave them a report on the armys treasury a report that made the strategos very thoughtful indeed and eumenes spoke on the state of the horses after their long march and short sail a report that depressed every cavalryman present lycurgus gave a hard smile youll all be hoplites before more snow falls he said we need a lot of fresh horses niceas growled one of his rare contributions lets save the ones we have first kineas said coenus what shall we do coenus was reading from a scroll youd think xenophon who fought his whole life from horseback would have mentioned this problem he shook his head buy more grain feed them as if we were fattening them for sacrifice ill ride out and find a good winter pasture with some rock under their feet theyre wet to the fetlocks all the time the poor things he looked around well need to buy more horses he said apologetically we dont have as much money as i would have wished kineas said even as it is well need to send a convoy back to the bay of salmon and get more money leon and i will have to sell estates ares and aphrodite but we spend money like water philokles pretended to be looking through the cabins log walls at the citadel i know where theres money he said is this another spartan solution kineas asked shes a harlot and a brutal ruler the peasants hate her she squeezes them for cash and flaunts it there was a knock at the door darius now a section leader in second troop bowed from the waist there is a messenger from the palace i held him at the gate as per niceass standing orders niceas nodded escort him to the guardhouse and get his message he comes no farther than the guardhouse kineas shook his head why are you so adversarial with the palace he asked his officers sappho came in through the door and pushed the linen chlamys she wore as a wimple back from her face have you already had trouble with the queen kineas asked his receiving room was larger than all the space hed had in the barracks at olbia diodorus and philokles sat in barbarian chairs niceas lay on a couch coenus reclined with a bucket of scrolls while eumenes darius and leon sat at the desk doing accounts ataelus sat quietly on another barbarian chair speaking with prince lot and samahe sappho sat in a chair that had obviously been set aside for her kineas wondered why she was present im glad you have all made yourself comfortable in my absence he said darius returned a drift of cold entering with him the strategos is invited to attend the queen he said in a neutral voice kineas looked around the room a hint of annoyance in his tone as no one was answering his questions you dislike her philokles has she given you trouble philokles raised an eyebrow im not the sort of man who would have trouble with the queen he said he laughed no shes given no trouble eumenes blushed and kept his head down whats all this costing us kineas asked actually were getting a few minae a month profit were defending her over the winter arent we diodorus gave a wry smile i hadnt realized that salesmanship was part of my duties kineas nodded well done not all crap every one of these petty kingdoms in hyrkania is out to eat every other one our arrival here guaranteed her farmers an uncontested harvest thats worth a few acres of land for one winter diodorus looked around the room our troops have put a lot of silver into the locals one way or another he gave his words the intonation of an actor a comic actor diodorus had a new scar on his brow from the fighting in the autumn it made him look older there was grey in his red hair that kineas hadnt noticed before the price no doubt of command he steepled his hands therell be hades to pay in the spring he said other men were nodding their heads kineas swirled the wine in his cup and waited she thinks well fall into her arms and conquer her neighbours for her diodorus said he and sappho exchanged a glance and sappho raised a plucked eyebrow before her eyes went back to her scroll leon looked up from his numbers drew breath for speech and then thought better of it kineas had to smile despite his best resolve shes a harlot he asked shes no harlot philokles said youll want to see for yourself he paused she has wit diodorus leaned forward she calls herself banugul its a zoroastrian saints name the peasants call her asalazar that means the demon of honey he gave a lopsided sneer its not meant as a compliment heron silent until then spoke up they say shes artabazuss bastard daughter barsines sister barsine is still with alexander theyre rivals in every way they say shes the lovelier of the pair and that alexander preferred her but needed the satraps alliance kineas shook his head so shes been fobbed off with a piece of hyrkania she cant be that beautiful or shed have got something better cappadocia perhaps they all laughed hyrkania was all rock the farmers among the soldiers couldnt stop commenting on the uselessness of the soil i think youve all been away from civilization too long and begging sapphos pardon you sound like characters in lysistrata you may all love her more than you love the gods but when the ground is hard and our horses have their hooves hard and their summer coats were riding for marakanda he said srayanka is waiting and alexanders army is growing diodorus nodded id rather be fighting alexander right now again he and sappho exchanged glances i must meet this goddess kineas said diodorus cut in shes trying to use us against her father and shes dangerous kineas nodded his mind already moving on to the new logistikon that leon was compiling is there enough fodder and grain in this petty kingdom to get us moving in the spring leon cleared his throat yes he said under his dark skin he was flushed but it will require some work to collect it there are not enough wagons for us to buy well need more oxen to drag the wagons and some for beef on the hoof kineas glanced back at diodorus why would we fight her father diodorus shrugged for money sappho raised her eyes and then lowered them again i think youre all barking at shadows kineas said after a minute of silence he turned on his heel and walked back into his sleeping quarters to change for his audience a slave brought kineas wine while he rummaged through his baggage he tried to read a new piece new to him by aristotle its release had apparently enraged alexander but so far he could make nothing of it he had just located his best sandals in the leather bag under the bed when he heard a noise behind him he looked up when the curtain that guarded his sleeping quarters rustled and he shot to his feet when he saw that it was sappho she smiled enigmatically as she entered sometimes she said it is almost worth three years of forced sex and the loss of my husband and children to be free to enter a mans quarters and speak my own mind kineas started to reply but his mind was grappling with what she had said and all that came out of his mouth was im sorry she nodded as am i and pleased to have your full attention kineas nodded wine he asked to cover his confusion she shook her head no ive had enough listen strategos you are a man like my brothers and my father like diodorus a man who does things worthy things i know your type her kohlrimmed eyes were large and green and very close to his kineas sat back im sorry he said again she choked a little i dont think you should meet her alone i speak for srayanka who is not here kineas narrowed his eyes i like a challenge he said that is why you will fall sappho said your own courage and your sense of challenge will betray you and you will fall she stood again look at you and you are only dealing with me you look into my eyes you measure my body you hear that i have been abused i could have you kissing me just by moving closer and putting my hand like this she suited action to the word fitting her body alongside his and putting one raised hand to the back of his head and kineas flinched away stepping back to hide the immediacy of his arousal and the truth of her assertion she laughed enough kineas said turning away disgusted at his weakness and her accuracy he nodded sharply i appreciate now that you all take this seriously and i can tell from what you say and what you dont say that this woman has caused tensions he backed away and selected a chiton at a loss how to proceed trying to cover his confusion and his sudden arousal im sure you all have my best interests at heart he was growing angrier by the moment angry at them angry at himself but i dislike that you see me as an overgrown child you control yourself so much that you are like clay for someone who can control you in turn she said please call it whatever you like make sacrifice to the foamborn and stay home tonight she smiled gently admit it you too are like a man in lysistrata kineas shook his head bah he said i am a commander not a schoolboy sappho shook her head athena i tried she said and retreated through the curtain before she withdrew her head she said philokles volunteered to try to speak to you first but confronting you before you met her was my idea kineas nodded dismissively i appreciate your vote of confidence madam he said just at that moment he hated her her feminine superiority the ease with which her physicality had taken him in then he sat on his bed considering how far short of his own notions of good conduct he had just fallen after a few hundred heartbeats he dressed quickly antigonus sat on his charger with ten of his keltoi in their best kit mounted behind him in the street by the gate sitalkes handed kineas the reins of thalassa and kineas swung his leg over the mares broad back briefly remembering back to his first attempts to mount a tall horse in the middle of the pinarus while persians rained blows on his breast and backplate his hesitation caused him to push the mare through half a circle before he got his leg up bringing him to face coenus who was standing in the snow with a bag of scrolls over his shoulder like a giant schoolboy on his way to the agora you too kineas asked coenus shrugged me too what he asked need a hand up kineas snapped no he shot out and then followed the charger through another halfrotation without getting his leg over coenus was laughing the escort were doing their best not to laugh when kineass pursuit of the horse went around again coenus grabbed her headstall need a hand up he asked again fuck off kineas said he made a face yes coenus held her bridle while leon made a step kineas sprang on to the mares back and pulled his cloak around him they arent fools coenus said pointing at the open door of the commanders building they all love you and every one of them wants what is best for you damn it this is what niceas does coenus gave a lopsided smile even on foot he came up to the middle of kineass chest while mounted im a pompous aristocrat not a rhetorician if niceas were himself hed swear a lot and youd take it the queen is dangerous she writes letters to alexander beware kineas found he could smile i had gathered that he said coenus raised an eyebrow have a splendid evening at the palace then he gave a salute kineas gave a shake of his head backed thalassa a few steps and whirled her around lets go he said to andronicus who exchanged an amused glance with coenus barked an order and surged into motion the ride up the hill was cold and longer than kineas had expected he kept his mind carefully blank the citadel was a grim reminder of what hyrkania really was the fortifications were high and strong old stone courses at the bottom and new stone facing with a double gate and towers every half a stade kineas whistled with professional appreciation as he rode under the gates tough nut he said to andronicus who shrugged we could have it in an afternoon garrison is crap andronicus said he spat walls are no better than the bronze behind them as if to make the kelts point a pair of lazy sentries in greenspotted bronze breastplates greeted them under the inner gate what do you want sir asked the older sentry invitation from the queen andronicus said the man nodded and straightened slightly not exactly attention but a better slouch he held out his hand and andronicus dropped a coin in it nice that all these fucking foreigners are so ready with their cash the sentry said in persian to his mate he was contemptuous andronicus grinned and nodded like a stupid barbarian hed served four years in persia he refused to let the palace grooms take their horses instead he told off four of his troopers to take the horses to the stables the other men followed kineas inside where slaves took their cloaks and sandals and washed their feet the floors were tiled and heated the interior of the citadel bore no more relation to the outside than the citadelpalace in olbia but the tyrant of olbia hadnt run to heated floors and mosaics and slaves kineas had seldom seen so many slaves devoted to personal service most of them were women and all were pretty and naked or next to it the mosaics were not subtle like a gymnasium the palace grew warmer as one got further in and the decorations more costly more colourful from beige and white tiles in the outer receiving rooms and barracks to red and purple and glitteringly erotic mosaics in the heart of the castle a throne room warmer than blood with naked men and women glistening with oil waiting on a dozen courtiers and the queen herself she was not naked she was dressed like a persian matron her hair dressed with ropes of pearls and lapis her limbs and breasts well covered amidst a plethora of sensual and aesthetic possibilities hers was the body that called out to be watched to be caressed with the eye even fully clothed modest apparently unadorned she was beautiful her proportions were worthy of a statue from her delicately arched feet to her intelligent eyes and straight greek nose welcome kineas of athens she said i am banugul she had an appraising look as if he was a horse and she was a sakje she crossed her legs and her median trousers of silk rode up one leg revealing an ankle and a bangle your men worship you as a god she said her intonation suggested that such worship was probably misplaced kineas grinned although it was the kind of grin he wore when he was fighting they only worship me from afar in person theres a great deal of dispute she was smaller than he had thought at first impression she leaned her chin on a small fist a mans gesture that suited her your men give the impression of excellent discipline what do they dispute my godhood we are greeks my lady we worship with a great deal of argument he looked around suggesting with body language that she might offer him a seat she sat up straight her shoulders were square and her bearing had dignity i know alexander she said she smiled and one manicured eyebrow rose a fraction her choice of greek words was perfect and her facial expression said i slept with alexander and i mean you to know it but i am not crude and i was not impressed it was an enormous burden of communication for a fractionally raised eyebrow and two greek words she handled it easily kineass opinion of her intellect rose considerably he says he is a god kineas noted with a certain reservation hmm she answered he never claimed to me to be a god he claimed gods in his ancestors but we all have gods among our ancestors do we not kineas nodded you are not impressed with alexander she asked i served him for some years kineas responded he is the best general i have ever seen and yet a headstrong man capable of error and vice you rebuke me like a philosopher she said and like a sophist you have not answered my question yes kineas said i was impressed he paused and thought why not i loved him kineas said but he spurned you did he not banugul smiled and the smile informed her face her smile said that happiness was not the normal state of her being from her green eyes to her pointed chin her smile took the sting from her words she meant no insult nor was she drawing a comparison she too had been spurned i understand that he sent all his greeks away you are well informed kineas said and now you will make war on him she asked yes kineas answered she nodded would you care to sit down she asked i thought you might be the ordinary kind of soldier who boasts and ogles my girls i apologize for my poor hospitality she waved a hand and a pair of slaves brought a chair kineas sat what could i offer you to fight my father in the spring instead of alexander she asked she motioned at a slave a small hand with almond nails and a silver cup of wine appeared at kineass elbow he sipped it it was excellent nothing my lady will sway me from my plans for the spring kineas said when the ground is hard well march she nodded what did alexander give you when he sent you away she asked gold kineas said you had the better bargain she said i got a small piece of the land of wolves and no dogs of my own to protect it what do you think of my guards kineas sipped wine they are adequate he said he glanced at her captain of the guard a thessalian she had not bothered to introduce i have seldom heard anyone damned with such faint praise she said and laughed her chin tilted back and her throat dancing in the torchlight do you read she asked kineas was startled yes he answered he was determined to stop speaking in monosyllables but she was robbing him of his wits he felt as if he was wrestling with a master missing every hold im reading the new aristotle now he winced inwardly at the boyishness of the boast she leaned forward a wolf ready to spring you have the new aristotle she asked i had a copy scribed before i left olbia it came out on the athenian grain ships he grinned at her eagerness if you have a scribe i can lend it to you for copying hah she laughed no work on my taxes this winter her eyes gleamed do you like singing she asked i like conversation that is not all interrogation he said carefully her chin went back on her hand i do apologize but were a little short of polite company here in hyrkania youre from athens youre only the tenth athenian ive ever met she shrugged men expect women to ask all the questions and carry the conversation especially beautiful women kineas smiled i like singing i enjoy reading im an excellent soldier and i will not fight a spring campaign on your behalf he rolled his shoulders i will see that your fiefdom is protected all winter and perhaps we can negotiate a garrison or a few officers to help your levies she nodded strictly business very well she sat up you are used to dealing with women arent you she asked alexander isnt kineas shrugged my mother wasnt olympias he said alexanders mother was a byword in greece for cruelty and manipulation he rose to his feet she rose gracefully despite having taken two cups of wine in less than an hour i look forward to hosting you again i burn for your copy of aristotle that made him grin if you want it you will have to wait while i finish it he said and bowed she nodded her head and motioned at a slave to escort him winter in hyrkania is long and arduous she said youll have time to read it many times i hope that i can provide you with some equally worthy amusements the next afternoon kineas was sitting with leon and eumenes in the smoky tunnel of his wooden megaron reading scrolls by the light of twenty profligate oil lamps with niceas reclining cursing the smoke and muttering advice a gentle tapping against the logs of the hall heralded lycurgus who came in through the layers of woollen blankets that covered the door greek military architecture wasnt ready for the cold of highland hyrkania patrols just picked up a soldier he said ten local horsemen as guards an athenian gentleman i expected that youd want to see him kineas leaned back so far that his stool creaked anything to free me from paperwork he said he went over to the hearth waving a hand in front of his face and trying not to breathe he started rebuilding the fire trying to find the combination of wood and draught that would stop the incessant smoke leosthenes of athens lycurgus announced returning kineas had an actual flame going he brushed off leons attempts to take over the boy reverted to being a house slave too easily and coaxed the flame adding twigs what he wanted was the tube from his campaign kit but he didnt have it he leaned forward to blow on the fire leon blew on it from the other direction then both men started coughing and had to turn away to the cold air beyond the fire kineas took a lungful of clean air and snatched a hollow quill from the table he leaned close enough to the embers to scorch his eyebrows and breathed out the embers began to make the noise the low moan of wood on the edge of ignition both men redoubled their efforts and suddenly the whole pit sprang into flame as if by magic light drove the winter shadows into the corners of the hall and a rush of heat forced kineas to take a step back you dont look as if you eat babies said a voice in aristocratic attic greek hard to eat them if you cant cook them niceas said leosthenes and kineas gripped forearms kineas smiled and the other athenian beamed leosthenes was of middle height well proportioned with curly black hair and green eyes like a cat he sat on a corner of the table without invitation the famous kineas of athens he said dramatically kineas rubbed his beard discovered that he had singed it and winced he shrugged where in hades did you come from child three years service in alexanders army and you call me a child but suit yourself i have to deal with all those years of hero worship he turned to the other men kineas was phocions star pupil the best swordsman the best officer we all loved him but he went off to serve alexander leosthenes grinned when i was old enough i followed you by all the gods it is good to see you leo kineas couldnt get the grin off his face have you been home home leosthenes asked he shook his head and flushed i havent been home ive been to parthia and back are you rich then kineas asked you know how alexander uses mercenaries leosthenes said bitterly secondline troops garrisons and the fool never really conquers anywhere so he always leaves it to the garrisons to do all the nasty bits the younger man shrugged and kineas could see that in fact most of his youth was gone there was a set to his shoulders and hollows in his eyes that kineas hadnt seen at a glance you remember arbela kineas nodded of course you do the younger man turned to the other officers you were a hero leading the greek horse i was with the hoplites in the second line we never engaged then i spent six months chasing tribesman with parmenion howd you get here niceas asked i was in the garrison at ecbatana leo said shits coming down there i gathered a few likeminded friends and we ran kineas looked thoughtful deserted he said flatly its going to be war between parmenion and alexander leo said not battlefield war stabintheback war parmenion sent me with a message to the king and i thought i was going to be executed so yes i deserted with some friends we took service with one of the hyrkanian kings these hills and the lowlands to the south are full of men from alexanders armies kineas caught himself rubbing his beard is this a social visit leo he asked leosthenes had the grace to look embarrassed no he said niceas gave a snort kineas turned to eumenes go and get philokles and diodorus ask sitalkes to bring us wine he turned to niceas i need to buy a slave he said with irritation slaves annoyed him but he was just too busy to fetch his own wine and get the fire burning have you met your employer leosthenes asked he had to notice the intake of breath throughout the room i get it youve all met her he laughed dont be crude leo kineas smiled but his voice was hard i like her diodorus pushed through the curtains followed by philokles toting a sack of scrolls weve all met her he said wryly oh my look who it is the nursery must be emptying into the phalanx kineas rose leosthenes son of craterus of athens an old friend kineas was grinning which wasnt his normal look these days more of an old student really he said with a glint in his eye leosthenes grinned back i can take you sword to sword any time old man kineas shook his head ive a persian darius you have to best first hes probably better than me he grinned in fact id like to see it philokles poured himself wine and then poured wine for the others and distributed it the local potters made good cups that fitted the hand shaped like a womans breast with a nipple instead of a base the joke was that you couldnt put the cup down you had to drink your wine or at least that was one of the jokes sitalkes pushed in through the blankets would you be kind enough to mull us some hot wine lad kineas asked the getae boy went to work without complaint it was a matter of months since hed been freed and he was still happy to serve if asked politely so youve met her leosthenes asked again yes said kineas into a silence as thick as the smoke had been and the athenian persisted kineas shrugged shes beautiful intelligent educated evil incarnate leosthenes said in a gentle voice kineas shrugged again he looked around the room the smoke had mostly cleared you didnt fuck her did you said niceas i listened to all that griping and you didnt fall for her kineas shook his head wearily my private life is mine i am not about to endanger this expedition to satisfy my own lusts philokles made a face rose to his feet and bowed i salute you philosopher and apologize i for one thought that you would fall straight into her toils apology accepted kineas said yes ive met her i wasnt shown any particular sensuality but i was made to appreciate her intelligence she wants us to fight a campaign in the spring she can pay very well im tempted my employer is the target leosthenes said im here to buy you off kineas stopped himself from rubbing his beard what she wants southern hyrkania her recent and muchlamented husband held all the land as far as parthia she lost a lot of it when she murdered her husband and stayed loyal to alexander leosthenes shrugged i serve artabazus barsines father alexanders satrap not that his writ runs here hes a canny old fox all he has to do is survive until parmenion kills off alexander and hell be king kineas nodded aware that artabazus had been named as the target of the spring campaign and unwilling to give that much away and hes told us a lot about her shes not greek shes more like one of the persian demons some kind of monster leosthenes leaned forward pressing his point kineas sat back child you put me in mind of the tale of the fox and the grapes leosthenes laughed aloud his head back i think you have it right at that he went on laughing persians never read aesop they ought to he had to clutch his hands over his stomach kineas stood stay for dinner child but dont press me on this i keep my bargains and i wouldnt sit here and banter with your persian fox were i ten times more a mercenary he nodded glanced at niceas if it werent you id be tempted to crucify the messenger to make my point leosthenes nodded soberly i made much the same point to my employer luckily i am me this time kineas said next time you might be mistaken for someone else after leosthenes and his ten hyrkanian nobles had ridden for home in the dark kineas tugged on his cloak niceas and philokles were still on their couches im for the palace kineas said i thought you werent smitten philokles said im not smitten but ill wager that she has excellent sources in this camp or at least in the agora outside our gate and shell know in an hour whats been offered i want to make sure she got the right message and double the guards i dont like anything about this place kineas finished the last wine in his cup and tipped it up on the sideboard was he smitten he certainly had the same urges as any soldier philokles nodded agreement id like your permission to try and place someone in the palace he said slave kineas asked best you not know philokles said kineas could see how uncomfortable this conversation made his friend he desisted with a grunt the ride up the hill in blowing snow and the warmth of the rooms with their hypocaust floors couldnt have been a sharper contrast kineas shed his cloak and sandals in the outer rooms and passed clad only in his tunic to the inner sanctum where the queen sat in state surrounded by her slaves and courtiers you had a visitor she said cheerfully as soon as he entered a very old friend he said i taught him to swing a sword banugul rose took wine from a naked woman whose pubic hair was shaved to resemble the greek letter alpha and brought the cup to kineas with her own hands the smell of her caught at his breath the hint of a smell somewhere in the arch of his nose a clean delicate smell like mint her head came to his shoulder and from his advantage of height he could see even more of her to admire he raised his cup to her what did he offer you to betray me she asked very close kineas wondered if there was a killer standing behind him he was weaponless and her tone belied the clean purity of her scent she was angry working herself up for murder i refused to hear his offer kineas said really she asked for the first time he had said something that took her by surprise she returned to her throne and sat to kineas her motions seemed to take a very long time really kineas answered she sighed i would like to trust you she said kineas shook his head gently you trust no one he said he looked around may i have a chair she gave him a small smile i can do better than a chair she motioned and a proper couch was brought for him while he arranged himself on it another was brought for her more couches arrived and her courtiers half a dozen men in a mix of persian and greek dress settled on to them uneasily she arranged herself on hers with her usual grace rose on one elbow and toasted kineas with her gold goblet kineas poured a libation to the gods and then toasted her with a line from aristophanes that made her smile she took a long drink of her wine and then rolled on to her stomach if i have you killed right now i can buy your soldiers and fight any campaign i please she said kineass stomach twisted he was not immune to fear and his hands betrayed him he clenched his goblet she was serious my soldiers would storm this citadel and put everyone in it to the sword he said with the best imitation of calm he could muster he could hear the fear in the end of his sentence her guard captain revealed himself standing just out of his line of vision to his right by snorting his disdain try fucking greek banugul gave an enigmatic smile and indicated her guard captain with her chin this is therapon my strong right arm kineas took a deep breath he didnt turn his head although he noted the alcove where the man was standing every one of your men is bribable you have little discipline so little that even now the towers on the citadels north walls are empty because the men dont want to get that cold no one is watching the north wall no one can climb the north wall the queen said but her eyes flicked to the guard captain and he looked away like leosthenes diodorus my second is a childhood friend from athens you could never bribe him lady unlike this dog of a thessalian you keep to bully your guards my men are soldiers fresh from a summer of victory he was beginning to convince himself and his words flowed faster if you murder me all of you will die she met his eye easily and smiled it wasnt a smile of seduction but a smile of pure calculation she was not young nor was she old she was at the turning point of age where the lines at the corners of her eyes did not mar her looks but only added to her dignity what was artabazuss offer she asked for the second time i refused to hear it kineas repeated her eyes opened wider for a fraction of a second and then narrowed why she asked i cannot be tempted by something i havent heard kineas said do you know the famous soldier phocion i know his name and his reputation his honour is proverbial she raised her eyebrows expectantly she smiled and kineas knew that he was not going to die he thought he had her measure he used to tell us that the best way to avoid temptation kineas felt the tension falling away from him was to avoid temptation she nodded eyebrows arched i often seek temptation out she said but i am a queen she looked at the grapes in the bowl next to her every grape she said taking one has been seeded in my kitchens by slaves that is the fate that awaits you if i discover that you have received more messengers from artabazus have i made myself clear kineas held his ground if leosthenes the athenian comes to my camp i will always receive him despoina and i will present myself for examination immediately afterwards strange man she said she looked at him for some time eating grapes am i a temptation yes kineas said she nodded her face serious yet you do not avoid me kineas rubbed his chin and chewed a grape i concede your point she leaned forward interested men do not usually allow women victories in conversation you concede my point but there is a but you are observant my lady but you are my employer and to avoid you would create misunderstanding you are a queen and any temptation you offer will come with enough barbs to hook a euxine salmon she raised her chin and allowed a slight smile to indicate that his point had merit i grew to womanhood at a persian court both of my uncles were poisoned my mother was murdered with a sword my father now seeks to kill me do you understand kineas nodded hands calming gradually you keep your slaves nude to know if they carry weapons she pulled her legs under her and leaned towards him i disarm my enemies in any way i can she said i have few enough weapons if i were a man i would be strong i am a woman what would you have me do kineas shook his head im a canny fish i can see the hook and the bait and even the boat she curled a lip what a very safe answer she motioned past him and a man with a lyre sat on a stool and began to sing he was excellent and his purity commanded silence kineas turned his head to find that the singer was fully clothed not a slave persian he asked after the first performance lycian she answered or carian kineas stroked his chin the words are strange but the cadence is like homer her body faced the singer but she turned her head to him stretching her neck and back her smile was as beautiful as dawn in the mountains and as fresh are all athenians as well educated as you are she asked yes he said he put a hand over his goblet so that the wine slave backed off where did you learn greek he looked away towards the singer therapon glared at him steadily his hate made an emotional counterpoint to banuguls magnetism and kineas steadied himself on it dariuss chief eunuch was a greek and my sister and i were prisoners of alexander for two years she smiled as if they were conspirators while you still served him kineas felt like a fool for missing the obvious connection that they had shared the whole campaign of course you were taken with the women after issus banugul rolled over and kineas was conscious of her body even across a gap of several feet i remember them cheering your name when you won the prize she said we were waiting with the dowager wondering if you barbarians would rape us she managed to make the experience sound lighthearted but you were all too busy slapping each others backs to mind us much it was days before alexander looked at us kineas had been unconscious for days after issus but he somehow doubted that she had heard his name being cheered he frowned at the attempts at flattery it is odd that we were in the same camp for so long hmm she said conscious that she had stepped wrong and waved for the singer to perform not so odd she said if the gods willed it so warm for the first time in days kineas rode down the hill to the neat greek military camp a pair of sentries stood huddled in every tower and there were twenty men in the guardhouse by the gate he inspected every one chatting with the sentries listening to the boredom of the sauromatae and the complaints of the greeks until he was satisfied that they were alert he was cold again cold from a wind that seemed to blow warmth out of the top of his head he swore that he would abandon hellenism and get a sakje cap before he wrapped himself in furs and blankets and shivered he lay for a while trying to imagine srayanka beside him he had a hard time seeing her face and it tended to slide into a narrower face with blonde hair that made him shiver i need to leave here he said aloud the transition from anxious wakefulness to sleep was so sudden that he was taken unawares by the presence of the tree and the pair of young eagles screaming above him they called and swung out over the endless combat of the dead pecking at dead foes ajax and graccus and nicomedes seemed more outnumbered than ever but he was not to be deterred he had to find srayanka he reached out a hand for the branch above swung to gather momentum and reached out a leg to hook and roll in a moment he was surrounded by brambles and bracken thorny stuff that tore at his skin and pricked at his hands his forearms his eyes he was climbing a thicket or crawling through it blind he had to reach srayanka and she was somewhere on the other side of the brambles and thorns and he threw himself at the flexible prickly mass and made no dent on it except to tear his arms and leave ribbons of blood on the trunk of the tree he strove and strove angry frustrated he awoke his cloak wrapped in a tangle around his legs his heavy hyrkanian blanket pulled up between his legs the hairy wool scraping at his flesh he was cold he got up moving carefully in the darkness and remade his bed adding another blanket from his pack roll on the floor then he lay in the new warmth of his blankets and waited to fall asleep whatever thought he summoned whatever plan he touched in his mind the image before his eyes was of banugul turning her head to smile at him he eventually defeated her smile with a tally of the grain wagons his army would require in the spring and he fell back to sleep warm and frustrated t heir sport that season was archery hyrkania had a crueller winter than the euxine cities ever saw with snow in drifts more than once and freezing rain every week but it was still clement enough to exercise horses and shoot the sauromatae bows lot and ataelus started it setting up straw bundles against the earthen walls of the camps citadel and shooting for wagers kineas knew a good thing when he saw one a sport that benefited his troops and cost very little passed the time maintained discipline perfect he offered prizes at a weekly competition good prizes and he competed himself the first weeks saw ataeluss prodromoi and all the sauromatae gathered to laugh at the sight of greeks shooting the bow some were either natural shots or had practised especially the gentry from the euxine cities heron was a fine shot as were several of his riders eumenes shot with a sort of weary acceptance as if his apollolike skills were a curse and not a gift but others were not so fortunate one young man from the phalanx somehow managed to snap his bow while stringing it the resulting lash of the bowstring drawing blood many of the tribesmen thought this the finest jest theyd ever seen which didnt do much for the daimon of the whole corps and led to two nasty incidents other men simply missed the targets week after week diodorus threatened to stop competing on the basis that his exceptional ability to shoot arrows over the top of the straw was undermining his authority didnt you learn to shoot as an ephebe kineas asked wickedly in fact he could remember taunting diodorus as the luckless seventeenyearold failed to hit the target again and again diodorus responded with a grunt but when they wrestled later in the morning kineas noticed that he was being dropped in the icy mud with a certain annoying regularity diodorus was angry kineas kept his taunts to himself after that six weeks of constant archery meant that the meanest of the hoplites could hit a bale of summer straw and the best were becoming quite proficient kineas placed orders for bows and arrows with the local craftsmen he knew his anabasis well enough to appeciate that arming all his troops with bows even if they were merely carried in the baggage would make them more capable of dealing with the threats they would face in mountain passes and high valleys where the battlefield tactics of the phalanx and the cavalry rhomboid didnt apply some men preferred the sling and diodorus convinced kineas that slings were an acceptable distance weapon so that some dozens of the euxine greeks could be seen pounding at the straw bales with long slings and heavy rocks they lacked the range but had enough hitting power to drop an ox a demonstration that diodorus performed to the applause of all the slingers on the winter feast of apollo the barbarian sauromatae were far more of a leadership challenge than the euxine greeks they were a long way from home wintering in a military camp subject to regulations that they barely understood and seldom respected but the military successes against the bandits and the willingness of the greek officers to lead by example and be seen to fail at archery and other contests narrowed the gap the greatest difficulty concerned breaches of discipline and how they should be punished kineas could remember quarrelling with srayanka about greek notions of punishment she had maintained that she would have to kill a tribesman to enforce greek discipline because anything else would lead to blood feud memories of srayanka and a growing understanding of tribal custom made kineas careful he couldnt be seen to favour the barbarians but he had to make his judgments fit their own notions of fairness kineas was never bored the army had suffered through two snowstorms and had camped in hyrkania for eight weeks when kineas held his second court and various units brought their offenders to him to be judged sometimes the local hyrkanian authority demanded to have the man sent to the citadel which kineas always refused each refusal required a visit to the citadel the sauromatae with their arrogance and their lack of interest in the niceties of trade and purchase were frequently hauled before the court as thieves an accusation likely to cause even the laconic lot to lose his temper sauromatae gentlemen were only thieves in their own tribes if they stole horses a crime only when the stolen horse came from ones own tribe horse thievery was punishable by immediate exile or death the arrest of a sauromatae nobleman or woman for thievery led to openair assemblies for fair prosecution and resolution the euxine greeks viewed these openair assemblies with much the same relish as the sauromatae viewed archery matches the entertainment value helped them deal with the snow the merchant says that you stole the value of the girls bond kineas said in passable sakje the sauromatae trooper a lord among his own people dressed in a purple tunic with gold plaques over fine caribouhide breeches worked in deer hair stood straight as an arrow his demeanour was respectful but proud his name was gwair kineas thought of him as gwair blackhorse to separate him from the other sauromatae gwair also a lord who rode a grey horse even with a foundation in sakje the sauromatae clan names defeated him no lord the man said standing tall his eyes met kineass and he smiled i liked her and she liked me the man shrugged we fucked she warmed my bed he smiled we please each other so she can stay with me kineas sighed she is a slave at this mans brothel he said he indicated the hyrkanian merchant next to him a big man in his own right beside him stood banuguls captain of the guard therapon gwair grinned he wants to fight me for her kineas shook his head you know better than that gwair blackhorse grinned again stupid merchant cant keep a girl like that girl like that is for heroes you know that therapon rolled his shoulders ill fight him he said and when i kill him the queen will be satisfied not so fast kineas said the problem was that kineas knew that among the sauromatae slave girls went to those who could hold them until the women stepped in sauromatae women fought with the lance and bow like the men and were not easily crossed and the men who married them had to be heroes kineas turned to lot who was sitting next to him would you be so kind as to send for some of your noblewomen kineas said i think we need their help kineas had to be seen to do everything he could before he ordered a sauromatae to be punished or to fight a duel that he was unlikely to win therapon was a dangerous man and none of the sauromatae would be his match lot raised an eyebrow and rose to his feet kineass initial impression of a slow cautious man had turned out to be the product of the language barrier lot narrowed his eyes at kineas glanced at therapon as if considering the mans potency and gave one sharp nod yes he said although as you must know i cannot summon them i must go and ask kineas nodded should i go that would be better lot said this assembly is to wait my pleasure kineas said and rose get on with it said therapon punish the barbarian and move on im cold kineas ignored the thessalian and turned to niceas who sat on a stool bundled in sheepskins can you deal with the greek defaulters while im gone niceas gave a wolfish smile much more like his old self and bawled out the name of a pair of hoplites who had started a fight with the local mercenaries kineas pulled his cloak about him walked along the main street of the camp past his own log megaron and lots heavy wagon to where the sauromatae yurts lined the streets in greek military order that made them look out of place like regimented kittens most of the women lived with their men but the unmarried noblewomen had a yurt to themselves most were between fourteen and twenty but a handful were older spearmaidens who chose to remain warriors kineas rapped his riding whip against the doorpost and one of the young maidens popped her head out and immediately blushed and bowed her head lord kineas she said kineas smiled no greek called him lord kineas and it was ironic that the sauromatae accounted for most of his discipline problems because man for man and woman for woman they worshipped him a far cry from the views of the average olbian trooper i would like to see the lady bahareh if she will receive me kineas said bahareh came to the door of the tent took his hand and led him inside she was an older warrior with grey in her braids and a face that was more leather than flower petal she was also one of the armys finest lancers and her deep female voice carried over any amount of strife she held no particular rank but in battle she rose to command kineas accepted a cup of her tea i wish you to come and help me with the judgment of gwair blackhorse he said she raised an imperious eyebrow he took that heathen girl from the slaver is this a crime kineas nodded the slave is like a horse a thing of value to the brothel keeper bahareh frowned so he should buy her the sauromatae women smiled she is quite a piece the brothel keeper wants her returned he does not wish to sell the woman thats what i tried first kineas thought bahareh snapped her fingers and a pair of teenaged girls helped her don her long furlined coat it weighed almost as much as armour unlike a mans it fitted her figure a very elegant garment even for a barbarian another girl put her hair up and she pulled on a sakje cap extinguishing her sex utterly she looked like any other welltodo sakje as she rose to her feet she asked is the girl pregnant kineas wanted to slap her on the back i hadnt thought to ask kineas said let us assume she is pregnant they were walking down the street lady bahareh had longer legs than kineas and he had to hurry to match her stride then when she gives birth if she lives she is a free woman of the clan he gives her a few horses as a birth present and the baby is part of his family that is the law kineas grunted i see how to judge this listen lady i wish you to let it be known that tribesmen who visit the brothels must pay every time and that the next man who takes one of these girls to his yurt will suffer as if he stole her from another tribe if you will do this for me he stopped her in the middle of the street because her stride was so long that she was going to walk him back into the assembly before he was ready i will tell a lie and save gwair blackhorse bahareh was tall almost eye to eye with him she frowned it is not for you to punish a tribesman lord kineas that is for our prince to do kineas held her eye lady we will not make it through the winter as friends unless all obey surely it is the same in a winter camp of the sauromatae she toyed with her whip yes she said fair enough save gwair hes a fool but most men are and ill whip the men into line her whip made a sharp whisper as it cut the air lot is right to follow you she said kineas spent the better part of the next hour bargaining with the brothel keeper and the towns selfappointed archon over the value of the woman while therapon balked of his fight stalked off kineas used her pregnancy to prise her loose from her owner he made the whole clan pay her inflated value putting gwair neatly in the wrong with his own people the process took roughly four times the time and money it would have taken him to punish one of his own people this is going to be a long winter he said to niceas thats not good diodorus said pointing to the gate two horsemen came up in a shower of snow riding hard one of their pickets the riders pressed right through the assembly theres a boat down at the beach sitalkes said his breath steamed and so did the breath of his horse whose panting was audible from the fort we built at errymi someone from olbia thats not good diodorus repeated kineas sent a patrol with spare horses down to the water three stades distant with sitalkes in command they came back with nicanor a freedman who was now the head of the household that had been nicomedes kineas had the man taken into the megaron where he stood by the hearth soaking up the heat i thought id never be warm again he said ive been on that boat for three days cold and wet through he sighed he was fat overdressed and very out of place and the whine in his tone was not something often heard in kineass camp thank you for coming so fast you have a message for me kineas asked gently the man reached inside his tunic and drew out a scroll tube even the bone tube hadnt resisted all of the wet but the vellum inside was clear enough lykeles to kineas of athens greetings my friend i received your request for funds and could not fill it the city is near a state of war the factions have twice attempted the murder of petrocolus and his son i dare not send wealth out of the city for fear that it will be stolen and used against us i send nicanor to you that you will see how hardpressed i am if you are not gone too far please come back and together we will crush this upstart i know that i have failed you in this but i cannot see another choice i enclose a letter that arrived at the maimakteria from athens surely if our own city expects you to campaign against amphipolis your duty must recall you kineas read the letter and the enclosed letter from demosthenes of athens or one of his faction with growing alarm he handed them both on to philokles who had been questioning nicanor the former slave was reduced to tears already you were very brave crossing the kaspian sea at this time of year kineas said he flicked a glance at the spartan as if to say look what youve done nicanor shook his head eyes on the ground i had to come he said master lykeles said that i had to reach you and and i did philokles finished the letters and handed them to diodorus theyre not up to ruling the city nicanor said he was still looking at the ground thats what i came to say i served nicomedes for ten years as his chief factor i know how business is done lykeles wants to use direct action he paid for a killing i know i found the money and i paid the killers kineas nodded he had seen this coming he suspected that he already knew alcaeus he asked nicanor started and his hands twitched you knew did you order it kineas shook his head he will make himself a tyrant he cannot bargain and petrocolus is weak kind wellintentioned but weak he is lost without my master that is nicomedes and his friend cleitus he vacillates his allies leave him kineas took a deep breath this is not good the megaron was filling up with his closest officers rumour spread fast in the camp and they were a small community heron was out on patrol and lot seldom showed interest in the politics of the greeks but the rest were there very quickly slipping in past the blankets over the door leon nodded we need money without it were going to be in trouble for remounts in the spring im already worried about making the next payment to the hoplites he had an arm around nicanors shoulders i cant understand why there isnt enough money he said uneasily im making deals here i expect my credit here to be backed in olbia and in pantecapaeum if it isnt well have angry creditors when spring comes and my new business prospects will vanish lykeles is trying to bring us back diodorus said i hate to be the one to say it but someone has got to him hes trying to withhold your money to get you back athens philokles asked macedon asked sappho it is an open secret that you go to fight alexander that woman in the palace still serves him id wager my life on it odd how their interests coincide said philokles he looked thoughtful if you were to return to olbia the army would remain here for the spring would it not he glanced around what do you say kineas kineas sighed if i go back ill never leave again i can feel it in my bones diodorus shrugged have you settled with the queen on a spring campaign he shrugged sorry for asking but it is related if were making a spring campaign we have time to send someone back she wants a great deal more than just a spring campaign kineas said unintentionally setting them all to smirks niceas spoke out his voice rough let diodorus fight the spring campaign youll have the time to ride there whip everyone into line and come back well be moving by high summer diodorus grinned i admit i want to be in command again he looked at niceas i dont think itll be that easy for kineas though if this is what i think it is the powers behind the recall will have various devices all perfectly legal to hold kineas at olbia kineas nodded and looked at philokles the spartan put his chin on his hand theres sense in what diodorus says you might restore order in a matter of days he sat up or not you might get embroiled in months of debate a year of accusations diodorus spoke up again and the cream of the army the votes that will always back you will be here philokles took a deep breath and they might well have you killed eumenes voice could be heard like an undercurrent explaining the politics of the situation to darius whose persian youth left him with no experience of the fickleness of a greek assembly yes said coenus fox youre right for a change lykeles is in over his head thats for sure coenus grinned i guarantee hes not crooked diodorus you know better than that hes been with us for ever but he can be a fool diodorus nodded acknowledging the truth of both statements coenus went on but hes one of my oldest friends send me not that its how i want to spend the winter coenuss chosen method of spending the winter was artemesia the most beautiful of banuguls ladies he shrugged if you go kineas theyll mire you in crap like odysseus there claims if you send me no one will waste a daric on killing me but i can sort out lykeles get some cash from him and move it by ship i probably wont be back until late spring until lake maeotis is open to navigation anyway but no one will hold me and he shrugged i have a certain name no one is likely to fuck with me diodorus glanced at sappho hes right i rather fancied the part where i commanded the spring campaign but hes right philokles nodded agreement he spent the fall hunting the high passes on the tanais he knows the ground hell go the fastest kineas hated giving up any of his closest friends he glanced at leon at eumenes but both were associated with city factions and neither could do what needed to be done youre ready for troop command kineas said do this for me coenus and youll have it bah said the aristocrat i dont need a bribe to make the trip if i dont go lykeles will make an ass of himself and well all lose by it besides im a citizen of olbia now its my duty to the city dont you know he looked around at the command council swear to me that youll all stay out of artemesias bed i may wed her laughing they all swore coenus sailed north with the ten men hed led all fall he sailed on a gentle winters day with a fair wind for the north nicanor stayed to run kineass household he said that hed rather conquer asia than cross the kaspian in winter again it took him a day to purchase four slaves and kineas didnt have to pour his own wine two days later their third snowstorm came with the flakes falling like the white feathers of some monstrous bird just as herodotus described and gathering in drifts driven by the north wind coenus is safe at the mouth of the rha drinking hot wine in our old fort philokles said kineas said a prayer to poseidon and sacrificed a lamb the next day with his own hands at the citadel he continued to refuse to fight a spring campaign a day after the spring feast of persephone despite the blandishments and the gold that the queen flung at him they heard that antipater the ruler of macedon in alexanders absence had defeated sparta decisively they heard that alexander had vanished off the eastern edge of the world or that he was in bactria or perhaps sogdiana they heard a rumour that parmenion was lining up the satraps of the west to destroy alexander if he returned leosthenes had told them that artabazus was parmenions man and that their employer queen banugul was alexanders and doomed to fall and that athens was prepared to throw off the yoke and go to war with antipater leon sat in the market or in the megaron listening to traders speak of the east the trade road that led over the mountains and deserts and plains to a far country they called kwin his eyes burned with something like lust the hyrkanian traders and the steppe nomads wintering in hyrkania told leon that kwin was the source of silk all around them east and west and south they heard the stirrings of revolt and war until the snow came in earnest and then the snow settled like soft fortress walls and all the rumours came to an end until spring part iii land of wolves philotas stood easily under alexanders glare what exactly am i supposed to have done your majesty he asked be respectful when you speak to the king philotas barked hephaestion the kings best friend and sometime lover was dressed simply his bronze hair unadorned but he seemed to have grown in stature overnight and the accusation in his tone snapped like a drovers whip philotas turned his head with exaggerated lassitude as if looking at hephaestion was too much work for him i am respectful he said he shrugged im also busy his eyes went back to the kings and the dismissal of hephaestion and everything about him was palpable the two men had always disliked each other philotas was parmenions son and the best cavalry officer in the army his arrogance was the kind the troopers liked an arrogance born of accomplishment that he was handsome and well born didnt hurt but he hadnt risen on his fathers name alone he was brave calculating and above all relentlessly successful some of the old guard said that without him the battle at arbela might have ended in defeat hephaestions place rested on his relationship with the king keen observers and the military court that surrounded the king of macedon was full of such men noted that whenever commands fighting commands were handed out even the besotted alexander passed over his friend for philotas so despite two days of whispering throughout the camp philotas stood at ease in front of his king ive heard a lot of talk philotas said am i accused of something your majesty you are accused of aiding in a plot to kill the king hephaestion said alexander remained mute philotas continued to look at the king crap he said im utterly loyal and everyone knows it the plotters have betrayed you hephaestion said i dont give a cunt hair for what your torturers dragged out of some peasant philotas said why didnt you come to me with cebalinuss accusation alexander asked his voice sounded tired philotas nodded sharply i knew this was what we were on about look alexander philotas as a noble and a companion had the right to address the king familiarly you know what a bitchy fool cebalinus can be like any boylover and here philotas smiled at hephaestion in obvious mockery he gets all womanish and he gossips so he heard something while he was being buggered i heard him out it sounded like crap i ignored it it wasnt crap alexander said we have full confessions if i was wrong philotas said his tone conveying that he thought the whole thing a set up then i make my most profound apology your majesty must believe that i would never allow a plot against him to go forward on the other hand here he paused because he realized that his arguments were about to cross on to forbidden ground if i reported every plot against you we wouldnt have an army didnt seem like a good thing to say you seem to be comfortable with treason yourself hephaestion spat this is a lot of crap philotas said he was losing patience it was too stupid an accusation to be taken seriously you say in private that you saved the king at arbela that you and your father have won every battle that the king is not competent to lead an army for the first time philotas was alarmed and it showed he raised his chin thinking quickly he decided on utter honesty i may have boasted foolishly when drunk he tried to win a smile from the king its been known to happen with soldiers when no smile was forthcoming philotas widened his eyes you cant be serious ill apologize to the army if you require it your majesty but drunken boasting is not treason your father has been plotting against me for years alexander said suddenly he sounded shrewish what philotas said he was now alarmed no he hasnt ares balls alexander you wouldnt even be king if it werent for my father no sooner were the words out of his mouth than he saw that hephaestion had played him like a lyre he glared at the favourite hephaestion glared back traitor he spat philotas stood tall prove it minion hephaestion turned to alexander hell confess under torture you cant torture me philotas spat im the commander of the companions on the bones of achilles the best of the achaeans i swear i am no traitor and youll never prove it before the assembly he stood there tall and handsome the very image of the dashing officer but the assembly thought differently two days later when he was brought before them toothless with much of his face gone he looked like a traitor with his hands broken hephaestion said that he had confessed his own guilt and the king said the same no one could understand philotas when he spoke they executed him now i can clean house alexander said to hephaestion it was a private council with only a few men eumenes and kleisthenes and hephaestion you have to kill parmenion hephaestion urged when he hears yes patrocles alexander ruffled his bronze hair i know the father must go now that the son is proved a traitor even kleisthenes a sophist and a professional propagandist was cut to the bone to hear the king call philotas a traitor in private the king had convinced himself a dangerous precedent eumenes the cardian kept his face composed spitamenes has accepted our suggestions about negotiation he said eumenes had learned not to use words that the king might take to mean that the macedonians were suing for peace with a rebel satrap the truth was that spitamenes with the remnants of bessuss persian army and the support of the massagetae and the dahae was slowing up their conquest of the north to an unpalatable degree the king drank some more wine when parmenion is dead the areas to my rear will be secure he said ill have all the time i need to conquer the rest of the world i dont need spitamenes tell him to fuck off hephaestion laughed aloud eumenes who had laboured all winter to get negotiations on the table took a deep breath spitamenes is interested in religious issues your majesty he does not desire to be king of kings he got the bit between his teeth and spoke the truth as long as he has the scythian tribes he can cross the jaxartes at will we cannot follow him there alexander turned his head and his mad whiterimmed eyes bored into eumenes head there is nowhere my army cannot go he said eumenes flicked his eyes to hephaestion hoping that the indulgent man would remember his own selfinterest hephaestion swirled the wine in his cup and then leaned forward if we campaign across the jaxartes well lose a whole campaign season from india he ought to have been an actor eumenes thought he wiped his brow alexander threw himself back on his couch fine even achilles listened when phoenix spoke but i want an amazon better yet a dozen tell spitamenes to get me a dozen amazons this was the type of demand that could unseat a negotiation in a moment but eumenes knew his masters voice he nodded yes majesty he said and kleisthenes shuddered the first flowers bloomed through the last snow in hyrkania and the winds coming across the kaspian were still cold enough for hyperboreans and strong enough to discourage even the keenest bowmen kineas felt fat hed eaten too well and exercised too little although theyd built a gymnasium and used it too hed never been so cold in his life as in the dead of winter in hyrkania when the snow hit like hardblown sand and the wolves howled every night and too often his exercise consisted of climbing the steep hill to the citadel where the queen entertained him with stories in greek and persian the questionable antics of her slaves and the sensuous pleasure of her heated floors and luxurious baths as well as the more intellectual pleasures of scrolls and singers and poetry after therapon had presented her with too many coloured versions of kineass law court she asked with a smile to come down the hill and see one and to see his camp he had no way to refuse her and so the next day her cavalcade wound its way down from the citadel a dozen local gentlemen on horseback with some of her guards in hastily polished bronze she wore a furlined cloak over a richly embroidered scythian jacket and wool trousers tucked into small boots with a tall median cap and a veil that covered her eyes without disguising them and a sword the ground was frozen hard and kineass men put on a display on horse and foot the olbian cavalry threw javelins the prodromoi shot their bows and the hoplites marched and countermarched and demonstrated a change of front in the spartan fashion to her beaming approval they shot arrows at targets and she insisted on having a turn shooting competently although kineas allowed himself to note that srayanka would have filled the targets with arrows while riding at a gallop she looked into the wine shops and the brothels of the camps marketplace am i supplying all the women for your army kineas she asked kineas looked away we brought a few of our own he said yes and a hetaira to manage them banugul said she laughed so well organized do the men stand in line waiting their turn when they cant get hyrkanian farm girls or go without then she began to recite baulked in your amorous delight how melancholy is your plight with sympathy your case i view for i am sure its hard on you what human being could sustain this unforeseen domestic strain and not a single trace of willing women in the place as she spoke she deepened her voice because it was the male chorus part in lysistrata and they all laughed with her therapon glanced at philokles perhaps they have no need of women my lady if that were the case she said with a twinkle then why do they hide those lances that stick out under their tunics her wicked paraphrase of aristophanes made them all laugh again philokles stepped closer to the queen looking up at her he declaimed she did it all the harlot she with her atrocious harlotry therapon whirled his face red but banugul reached down from her horse and took the spartans hand i love a man of education she said you are philokles the sophist he laughed obviously flattered i am philokles the spartan my lady i cant remember being called a sophist except by kineas here she beamed if you can call me a harlot i can call you a sophist i will be more careful of my epigrams philokles said clearly stung she blew him a kiss why do you not come and visit my court spartan all the others come save diodorus here who has ceased to visit me but you never come sophistry takes all my time philokles said gravely diodorus went so red that he turned away and even kineas had to stifle a guffaw while banugul blushed a little but she didnt flinch implying that harlotry takes all my time i said nothing of the sort philokles said drawling the words pederasty more like said therapon quietly but his voice carried kineas stepped between them philokles the lady is not a target for your wit i can protect myself kineas banugul said by all the gods i see now what i missed by staying in my citadel and i see now why kineas can parry any little wit i may employ if this is his daily sparring more than sparring therapon said broadly perhaps they entertain each other exclusively he leered philokles seemed to ignore the thessalians jibes until later when the olbians were showing the queen and her entourage around their logbuilt gymnasium philokles had the queens arm and her ear and he spoke of greek wrestling and of pankration their unarmed combat sport until she clapped her hands i would love to see that she said i have read so much about it philokles smiled and the warrior that lurked under the skin of the philosopher came to the surface i would be pleased to show you my lady he said im sure your therapon would be delighted to fight me chest to chest therapon was not the kind of man to refuse a challenge and he stripped im not likely to let you behind me he mocked i know what naked greeks do we fight naked philokles said to the queen by way of apology my harlotry extends to male nudity banugul replied philokles dropped his heavy cloak and pulled his wool chiton over his head exposing the body of a statue therapon was heavier and had the start of a gut although his arms were longer and immensely strong kineas tried to catch his friends eye banugul put a hand on philokles naked shoulder i would take it amiss if you hurt my captain she said her nails brushed philokles chest as she withdrew her hand her smile was a private one for philokles alone and kineas was appalled to find within himself a tingle of jealousy at their intimacy then the two men were circling on the sand bent low intent they circled long enough for the queen to grow bored and smile selfconsciously at her host when suddenly some shift in posture or intent brought the two contestants together arms locked high feet well back as they heaved against each others strength muscles stood out in strain and despite the cold a sheen of sweat covered both men banugul leaned forward her hands on her hips kineas watched her as she watched the contestants philokles changed his weight suddenly as if surrendering to the thessalians embrace but he got his body turned as he stepped in one arm moved and he struck the thessalian in the head with his forearm and suddenly therapon was on his back and philokles landed on him driving the air from his lungs he does that to me all the time kineas said ruefully banugul turned to him eyes alight with mischief the things i could imply she said but she reached out a hand to his chest and shook her head i am too crude for words i mean no hurt it was the first time she had touched him the warmth of her palm on his chest seemed to light a small fire there she withdrew the hand while he was still surprised by its presence philokles swung to his feet and offered therapon his hand but the other man didnt take it instead he stood brushing sand off his sweat glowering philokles held his eyes another throw he asked perhaps another time the thessalian said and reached for his chiton kineas disliked the look the thessalian gave his friend it boded ill the queens tour started a new round of visits between camp and citadel and the new ties between them did not make kineas entirely happy the first thing that annoyed him was darius whose skill with the bow and willingness to learn had endeared him to the olbians kineas was becoming used to seeing his officers in the corridors of the citadel from time to time banugul had made it clear that they were welcome but kineas saw darius too often almost every day and kineas worried both for the persian boy and for his loyalties you spend a great deal of time here kineas said several weeks after the queens visit to the camp embarrassed the young persian shrugged he smelled of perfume i like to hear persian spoken sometimes he said they are not unlike my people he went on in the tone of outraged adolescence despite his upright carriage he had the whine of the young to him when he replied and it annoyed kineas still more you are on the duty roster today kineas said only for the reserve darius said he shrugged they wont be called out what is alexander coming through the snow kineas tried to decide whether what he felt was jealousy at the smell of her perfume or annoyance at the tone of bratty innocence and justification why dont you make your way down to camp and take a spell on the walls while you consider the difference between insolence and disobedience kineas said darius was not a fool he saluted and left later inquiry showed that he had spent the entire shift on the walls kineas dismissed the incident four days later darius was in the citadel again on his duty day and kineas barely restrained his temper he felt that his orders were being flouted worse he suspected that he was himself being unjust he visited the citadel and he was the commander the most responsible man of all a poor example however despite his own transgressions perhaps because of them kineas lost his temper march your arse down to the duty office and wait there kineas barked later that evening kineas found darius sitting in his megaron you are banned from the citadel until further notice kineas said oh thats fair darius said with fluent sarcasm one more word and you can shovel snow for the rest of the winter kineas said darius looked as if he wanted to say more a great deal more when the persian marched out his silence made kineas feel like a bully the more so as darius cast such a look of supplication at philokles who was just coming in that philokles put his arm around the young mans shoulders and stepped out into the snow to talk to him when philokles came back in he was shaking his head you go to the palace strategos philokles said i am the commander and responsible for our relations with the queen kineas offered the spartan a cup of wine ares and aphrodite and you call me a sophist philokles grinned then he stopped smiling listen im here for something serious have you watched leon and eumenes together kineas made a face and shook his head should i what are they lovers ares youre blind as a bat no much the opposite theyre facing each other like armed camps on a plain philokles drained his wine you need to keep them apart whats it about kineas asked philokles narrowed his eyes and frowned i may spy for you from time to time or for my homeland i dont carry tales about my comrades he turned the cup upside down and stomped out alerted kineas couldnt miss the growing competition between eumenes and leon kineas didnt know where it had started or what it was about but it was out of hand the incident that brought their misdeeds to light for kineas was a torchlit horse race on the snow where the riders competed to bring fire to the altar of demeter at the spring equinox a tradition that olbia shared with athens the competitors raced around the circuit of the camp and finished at a gallop down the main street riding flat out for the building that served as a temple for all their gods eumenes lost when his horse tearing around the corner of one of the soldiers cabins slipped and fell the young man broke a rib and walked with a limp for two weeks and his horse slid on the ice limbs flailing and ended up injuring a dozen bystanders kineas saw the turn and saw the rough play between leon and eumenes in the moments before the fall when kineas inquired he received the kind of knowing looks that told him that most of his commanders already knew that something lay between the young men and werent going to inform on them when kineas confronted the two combatants they glared at each other like a pair of fighting cocks when he upbraided them in private they wore looks of humiliation and apology it was a week later when he saw leon talking to lots surviving daughter mosva that kineas began to see how the winter wind blew because even as he watched leon who lost all of his courtly polish in her presence and had the body language of a young dog shifting shrugging rolling and hanging his head he also saw eumenes watching the two of them his face a thundercloud aha he thought but it didnt resolve the issue it was about the same time that kineas went up the hill to see banugul about a matter of logistics and found she was not available to receive him dariuss pale roan horse was in the citadel stables kineas rode back down the hill in a foul temper he called for diodorus have the fucking persian dismissed he has disobeyed me for the last time kineas was so angry he spilled wine philokles came in through the multiple blankets that now made the doorway problems kineas was silent diodorus raised an eyebrow kineass persian boy has become a little too popular in the palace diodorus said he made a face fuck you kineas said i gave him a direct order and he disobeyed i am ordering him dismissed youre overreacting diodorus said hes an excellent horseman and a topnotch fighter youve said yourself hes a better swordsman than you and youre the best i know im ready to put him up for phylarch dismiss him kineas said voice hard dont be an ass diodorus said philokles shook his head probably better if you dismiss him he said after a moment diodorus looked hurt the strategos is thinking with his little head he said philokles raised an eyebrow i say that it is for the best fine diodorus said ill obey i think youre both idiots though kineas didnt see the persian again but the rumour mill said that the young man had immediately taken service in the citadel with the queens guard kineas felt like an idiot but it didnt cause him to apologize winter was taking its toll and despite his best efforts he wasnt able to stop his own visits to the citadel kineas tried to limit them to matters of business but he was aware that he stretched those boundaries to fit his needs as winter howled outside his megaron he admitted to himself that like a winebibber denied his tipple four days of snow had denied him his addiction and he was growing fractious he decided to punish himself for the dismissal of darius by avoiding the citadel he snapped at philokles on the fifth day of imposed abstinence from banuguls charms and the spartan grinned i can find you a nice clean hyrkanian girl wholl reduce that swelling in no time he quipped keep a civil tongue kineas barked the situation swells to greater tension something will explode soon philokles quoted laughing aristophanes covers almost every sexual situation i find go fuck yourself spartan kineas said the same might be suggested to you strategos philokles ducked a blow and slipped out of the door two days later leosthenes the athenian paid another visit and kineas felt himself excused to climb the hill it was early evening by the time he was admitted and banugul was reclining on a couch alone with a dozen guests on couches eating a banquet darius was nowhere to be seen dear kineas she said i would have invited you but i feared your rejection please join us she was modestly dressed in an ionic chiton that left her shoulders visible the wool was fine and pure white and her skin stood the comparison she rolled from a reclining position to sitting and clapped her hands and a pair of male slaves rushed from the room sit by me strategos she said patting her couch she waved a languid hand at her guests do you all know kineas of athens she asked sartobases was a loyal officer of my mothers family and has followed me here the persian obviously uncomfortable on a couch rose to a sitting position and bowed from the waist philip serves in the household of my sister barsine she said indicating a macedonian just out of boyhood alone of the men in the room he seemed comfortable on his couch i congratulate you on crossing the passes in this weather kineas said i had good guides sir the young man said with enthusiastic courtesy and every reason to reach my goal kineas smiled at the young mans earnestness well done he said you came from ecbatana he asked as if uninterested oh no philip said the king is at kandahar and so is my mistress parmenion holds ecbatana kandahar in sogdiana kineas said perhaps you could show a little more interest in your hostess and a little less in spying on alexander banugul said lazily to philip she said my good strategos is taking a small army east to make war on your master philip looked as if a wasp had stung him then his face relaxed my lady is pleased to make light of my youth no greek would dare to make war on alexander the slaves returned with another couch and placed it by the queens kineas didnt notice how close she had been until he was alone on his own couch and the distance seemed like a gulf of stars but the analytical soldier in his head was already measuring the stades to kandahar the king has made peace in sogdiana then kineas said drawing a glare from banugul philip shook his head making a face to indicate that he was a man of the world the rump of the persian empire continues to rebel spitamenes a rebel against darius and now against my lord is in league with the scythian barbarians on the sea of grass my lord will punish them soon none of the persian men were pleased by this speech and sartobases who had a strong face and might have played old nestor in a tragedy made the motion of spitting listen boy he said your master may have won syria and palestine and egypt by his spear but the land of the bactrians and the medae is not conquered hush uncle banugul said we are all friends here kineas didnt think so he looked at banugul with new understanding how many plots were in this mosaiced room tonight do you wish to ask me about leosthenes kineas said quietly why did he visit you again she asked her voice light wait until we are private they were educated men and they spoke of astrology at her bidding of signs that they had seen come to pass portents and dreams kineas admitted to having godsent dreams and philip listened with wide eyes as the youngest persian told a story of intrigue and murder based on predictions drawn from the stars then she had her carian singer perform he sang in his own language and then with a bow to kineas he sang the choice of achilles from the iliad and kineas applauded him and then the carian sang in persian a simple song of forbidden love kineass persian was good enough to catch the illicit nature of the love but not the details he was more interested in watching old sartobases look disapprovingly at banugul it was nothing like a symposium no ceremony with the wine which was served by slaves no contests and no performances by the guests philip watched the darkhaired slave girl who poured his wine like a falcon with a piece of meat and began to stroke her at every opportunity until his hostess made a sign and she was replaced aside she said to kineas do greek men really allow themselves to be publicly pleasured at parties kineas felt himself flush young men hmm yes not at nice parties banugul laughed her irritation banished by his embarrassment youre blushing youve done this yourself she laughed aloud i cant picture it kineas sat up dont be a prude its quite a picture banugul shook her head the other guests were disputing bessuss right to be king of kings you are so reserved i was young it was all fascinating and easy and i was challenged is that what you require kineas she asked rolling closer to him a challenge her face was a hands span from his shall i dare you to pleasure yourself on one of my maids she asked eyes sparkling i am out of practice at this sort of banter he replied he rolled on to his stomach for a variety of reasons i can tell she answered casting him a halfsmile of challenge over her shoulder as she turned to address another guest she played the hostess perfectly demure as a persian maiden witty as an athenian hetaira all things to all men kineas thought he willed himself to make his report and go but he did not her guests took themselves off one by one and kineas was conscious that he was not leaving and they were but she had asked him to stay and the matter of leosthenes remained between them or so he told himself sartobases was the last to go and he raised an elegant persian eyebrow at kineas we have unfinished business banugul said indicating kineas sartobases shrugged i can well imagine he said to her in persian he speaks persian banugul said indicating kineas sartobases bowed deeply and flushed my apologies lord kineas shook his head none required lord we are in the land of wolves sartobases nodded his eyes narrow then he was gone and they were alone except for twenty slaves clearing away the food come and lie by me she said lightly as if it were a matter of no importance she patted her couch i think not he said hating the sound of weak prudery in his voice who says you rise to a challenge then make your report and go back to your barracks she sat up i am sorry i mean only dont be weak she smiled dismissively i find you he began hoping to excuse his refusal now you will make me angry kineas do as thou wilt and only as thou wilt that is the law of kings and queens if thou wilt not then so be it it is not my fault that you have chosen so she slipped between formal persian and greek in every sentence stung kineas sat back down on his own couch there is more to virtue and vice than doing as i will he said she smiled at him no she said all your philosophy is merely to cover the weakness of those who cannot attain all the things they desire or master them once attained your virtue is merely abstinence and the avoidance of your vice is merely the cowardice of fear of consequence fear of consequence he asked she was angry and she was no longer all things to all men alexander has found the philosophy of kings i learned it from him perhaps he learned it from your aristotle there is no law that is the only law she was serious you will not debate me into your arms kineas said standing up will i not i get more response from you like this than with honey she stood too and walked straight to him your philosophy to hades with philosophy kineas she came up close and he could see her backlit by the torchlight from the rooms north wall from knee to shoulder through the thin stuff of her chiton i need you to protect my little kingdom in the spring she came closer and raised her face where flecks of gold sparkled in her mascara her voice was low husky and tired but she smelled like spring in the autumn i was willing to pay the price now i am eager to pay it somewhere beyond her in the torchlight a slave dropped a heavy silver platter with a noise like a man beating a metal drum or like a goddess clearing her throat kineas stepped back and kissed her hand his resolve steadied coward she said i can feel your desire and i am no painted harlot he took a breath and all he breathed was her i am a coward he said he couldnt pull his eyes away from hers you are no painted harlot she shrugged and moved away go she commanded riding down the hill he felt nothing but shame at his own indecision kineas vowed not to return again because his horses were thin and he needed remounts because coenus was due with the bullion because the passes had been closed by snow and they were all worried by the lack of news and because the queen had abandoned modesty kineas felt the urge to act so when he saw flowers coming through the snow kineas summoned his friends he served the last of his good chian wine i want to be ready to march he said he looked around every man met his eye and the grunts of agreement were clear at his elbow philokles nodded niceas who had grown a bushy beard scratched at it fodder niceas said kineas agreed thats the problem we need fodder the fodder has to come in from the queens peasants they hate her for starters and shes none too fond of us right now because were marching away and leaving her to parmenions vultures thats one reason said philokles who missed nothing when he was sober diodorus rubbed his eyes smoke from the hearth was stinging them all and every eye in camp was constantly redrimmed her own mercenaries are ready to sell her to artabazus that citadel wont last a feast cycle when we march away everyone has their money on parmenion kineas motioned to nicanor who signed to a slave who poured wine in kineass cup kineas stood shes intelligent and resourceful and dangerous as a wolf i want the guard led by someone in this room until we march i want to set a date and publicize it then well march two days early in combat formation and i want the prodromoi out as soon as ataelus is willing to go covering the route east all the way to the edge of the desert no one disputed his ideas diodorus held out his cup for wine we should be drilling the combat formation for marching we should do it by sections so that its not obvious to anyone watching kineas frowned thats excellent draw up the plan and lets give it to every officer by tomorrow nicanor can you scribe for diodorus nicanor nodded heron had grown up again during the winter now he spoke out two things sir first do we need an operational plan in case we need to gather the forage ourselves and second if we leave he coloured i hesitate to use the term hostile but if the queen is not our friend when we march away what becomes of coenus and the bullion kineas who had spent all winter worrying about coenus took a deep breath and released it we send a message to the fort at the top of the kaspian telling coenus not to land here and send guides to help him follow us heron jutted out his jaw insistently easier to seize a town on the coast and hold it for him he said with a garrison that can become his escort that silenced the room kineas glanced at philokles i had thought of leaving the infantry behind or sending them home he said lycurgus who had heard this idea all winter shook his head we can keep up if it comes to that but hades strategos the boys plan isnt a bad one march up the coast and seize one of the wolf towns itd take us three or four days theres nothing up there to stop three hundred hoplites diodorus cut in i could go beyond that leosthenes says hyrkania is full of hellenes deserters from one side or another ive seen them there are two groups of men whove sniffed around our camp looking to be recruited we could buy them kineas shook his head my goal is to strike a blow against alexander with srayanka im not interested in the conquest of hyrkania which let me tell you would be a harder nut than you two seem to think leon shook his head cant we keep the queen sweet like heron leon had grown over the winter in his case he was not just older but also more confident of his status as a free man he frowned at kineas i have money tied into this place now so do you if the queen repudiates all the contracts ive made ive wasted the winter kineas groaned listen to me kineas leon insisted theres more to the world than herodotus thought for two years ive heard rumours nicomedes heard them of a great empire in the east beyond the sea of grass the place from which silk comes he looked around at all of them his eyes hot and kineas smiled inwardly because leon was no longer a slave its called kwin or quin he said voice husky with passion i mean to go there good for you lad niceas said with a smile the black man grinned im getting carried away but im telling you if we could open this route if we could manage even a tithe of the trade across the old trade road wed be richer than croesus eumenes frowned i think we need to discuss war not trade trade is for merchants leon raised his chin your father was a merchant shut your mouth eumenes said he rose to his feet and a traitor leon said conversationally diodorus didnt need a glance from kineas to deal with adolescents he put a hand on each combatants shoulder you are both rude and your comments have no place in a command conference apologize or suffer the consequence he said his words were spoken quietly but they carried over every whispered side conversation and the room fell silent i apologize leon said he was blushing so hard that his dark skin seemed to be engorged with blood i apologize for leons bad manners as well as my own eumenes said he spent too much time as a slave and cant help himself eumenes spoke rapidly still enraged and then looked stricken when he thought about what he had said aloud kineas raised an eyebrow you may go to your quarters eumenes do not communicate with any other person i will come and pay you a visit he waited a moment as the stunned young man stood frozen now eumenes eumenes walked from the smoky hall in a daze when he was gone kineas found himself stroking his beard and made his fingers stop he sipped his wine excellent stuff with a smell like wild berries dark as ox blood and nodded were not here to open a trade route he said he raised an eyebrow at heron were not here to give you a base against pantecapaeum either but if you lads can accomplish your dreams while obeying the orders of this council im not against it herons family had provided generations of tyrants to pantecapaeum and he was currently in exile heron made no secret of his ambitions to be tyrant there perhaps king of the bosporus as well he gave a careful smile i appreciate your help when im king niceas laughed heron the first philokles laughed eumeles i suspect the melodious one wont that be your reigning name heron gave a wry smile you learn every secret philokles shook his head not much of a secret so were to be richer than croesus niceas laughed richer than croesus is good he said giving leon a smile he winked at heron your parents actually called you eumeles they hadnt heard my voice yet heron replied in his usual croak diodorus leaned forward cutting back to the matter at hand you really think we can live without the infantry he asked his face was burning he was in the grip of a grand idea kineas answered yes he tried to sound cautious diodorus turned to the rest of them we leave lycurgus he starts recruiting tomorrow he can keep the quality high get a thousand hoplites and train them to our standard the queen is saved no force in hyrkania can evict a thousand hoplites from this fort and the citadel were saved we have a secure town in our rear coenus can come here our contracts are safe until artabazus sends the whole levy of the satrapy kineas glanced around and shrugged its not bad lycurgus the old mercenary shrugged big command youd have to leave me another officer he shrugged i came out here to follow kineas not to garrison some barbarian hill town he shrugged again but i obey orders he grinned make her pay through the nose heron stood ill stay he said it was clear to all the gentlemen present that heron saw the town as a springboard to recruit mercenaries and go back to seize pantecapaeum just as kineas had said but being heron he didnt hide his motivations he just bulled towards them regardless of consequences kineas suspected that he shared banuguls philosophy do as you will a suitable virtue for a tyrant kineas was not slow to realize that many of them were not as keen to march away to fight alexander as he was theyd had a winter to hear tales of the eastern deserts and the impassable mountains that ran to the edge of the world but diodoruss plan was sound ill think on it kineas said dont forget the fodder niceas said and coughed red sprayed his fist he tried to hide it and diodorus and kineas exchanged a look of shared concern the next day the sun came up and stayed and no rain fell on the fields of mud beyond the town and the citadel diodorus leon and nicanor were hard at work behind him scratching out rows of greek characters to represent every man in the line of march and to give the officers a manual on which to drill their men across the drill square by the gate lycurgus was recruiting and drilling men that he had turned away all winter wolfish greeks and nondescript persians beside him temerix the smith stood bundled in sheepskins also recruiting from the brigands who came to the gate as soon as they heard that kineas was paying silver for service he didnt want to go to the palace they had nothing to say to each other except as a mercenary and his employer he glanced around the smoky hall looking for a man he could send in his stead diodorus was busy and besides sappho would not forgive him for sending her man eumenes was under house arrest and kineas meant to let him stew leon might do except that he was busy and sending him would expose kineass unwillingness to do what needed to be done do the thing men said it when they asked for death or when they sealed a deal in the acropolis he was evading responsibility facing the queen was his job he knew with the finality of oracular prophesy that if he climbed the hill again he would fall into her arms vulgarity or none she would think that his offer of service by his infantry was a concession to her charms and he was not made of wood or stone cowardice a gust of wind picked up dust and dry snow from under the eaves of the huts and brushed it across the parade ground in a long swirl of dirty white and when it was gone nihmus slight figure could be seen riding across the drill field do you never appear as other people do kineas asked by way of greeting she laughed and lifted a leg over her horses head and slid to the ground all in one elastic motion the world is about to change she said her face suddenly serious i rode to tell you kineas nodded the woman in the palace the sorceress she is very dangerous to you today and tomorrow and tomorrow again after that be on your guard nihmus odd eyes met his square on kineas nodded again i was just thinking the very same thing as you rode up sometimes when dealing with nihmu it was possible to forget that she was a child at other times it was painfully obvious i have not had as much time for you this winter as i ought nihmu nodded you are often at the palace all the sakje fear me i long to talk to you and my father orders it she looked around i like your nicanor he is funny and he makes good cakes im sure that nicanor doesnt make cakes himself kineas couldnt imagine the pompous and rather staid nicanor amusing a child nihmu made a face fat lot you know strategos she laughed behind her in the drill square lycurgus dismissed the twenty files he was drilling and they broke up into knots of men talking and shouting another group mostly olbians were heading out to the brothels of the agora and they were shouting at a third party that was returning the noise level swelled suddenly all the voices in the drill square shaped themselves into one voice your blindness will kill as effectively as your sword it said in the tone of a god kineas fell back a pace nihmus eyes were wide and her face was contorted not the face of a child but that of a priestess and then she grabbed at the bridle of her horse and ran away crying he sent for ataelus when he gathered the tangled skein of his thoughts ataelus rode up looking at the sky sun again tomorrow he said for drying earth kineas nodded i need you and the prodromoi to start making a fodder inventory he said ataelus shrugged huh he asked kineas started again i need you and the scouts to go out every day and give me a report on the farms within a days ride the number of wagons the amount of fodder they have in their barns and stores ataelus grinned for counting wagons and for scouting trail to east anything else for scouts kineas spread his hands ataelus leaned down from his horse temerix for counting barns and wagons ataelus for scouting east ataelus never cut corners and he never feared to argue with his leader which was welcome even when the news was bad you are right ataelus nodded yes he said if sun is for shining scouts ride tomorrow back when moon is full he shrugged unless for dead always unless kineas pointed at the throng of wouldbe warriors at the gate anyone worth recruiting for the prodromoi ataelus didnt turn his head no he said having dismissed centuries of hyrkanian horsemanship in one word ataelus grinned anything else strategos it was a word ataelus relished he trotted it out too often you taking the girl lots daughter mosva when for riding east no stay with father last child not for scouting kineas rubbed his beard and then snatched his fingers away id rather she went he said oho said the scyth he nodded and gave a big grin good i for talking lot go with the gods ataelus go with horses for coming back with gods ataelus grinned then he wheeled his horse and rode away kineas went to finish some discipline he slipped through two layers of hanging cloaks and blankets to enter the hut that eumenes shared with andronicus and six other gentlementroopers the hearth was cold and so was the room and the whitewashed walls served only to make it colder there was no table and no chairs and no couches only a rack of beds made by local craftsmen and covered with piles of blankets and furs and sheepskins at the far end of the dark hut one of the troopers a kelt called hama was ploughing a local girl moving slowly and rhythmically under a tent of blankets they whispered to each other moaned and giggled together eumenes sat in misery trying to pretend he was not there lets walk kineas said to eumenes eumenes took his cloak from the doorway and followed kineas into the sunshine kineas walked them up the snowdrifts to the walls troopers were punished with snowclearing duty outside the walls where a beaten zone was maintained inside the snowdrifts sometimes added to the height of the fort you and leon are competing for mosva lots daughter he said when they were out of the wind eumenes nodded i have sent her off east with the prodromoi i suggest you apply yourself to your work as a professional soldier buy a girl if you feel the urge that outburst in the meeting was illmeant and bad for discipline and you started it i hope you understand me eumenes flushed despite the bite of the cold its not fair he called my father a traitor kineas put his hands on the boys shoulders what you mean is that its not fair that your father was a traitor he was and leon was a slave and both of you are important officers in this company and we need you to function as adults and not as brainless children not fair muttered eumenes he was weeping kineas embraced the boy who had suffered so much in the last year and was now weeping for the loss of a girl and some prestige his embrace obviously comforted the young man and kineas thought of mosva crying in his arms after the fight in the high ground to the west and how useless he was at comforting anyone he did his best without really intending it kineas didnt climb the hill to the citadel that day or the next ataeluss twenty riders trotted out over the mud into a sunny morning and vanished into the eastern hills before the sun was a hand high in the sky the mercenaries new and old drilled on the parade under lycurguss eye with diodorus watching and leon taking notes eumenes had the cavalry out all day conditioning their horses walking them up and down riding for brief stints and the young man was merciless in working himself and every trooper under him temerixs men went out in twos and threes unarmed and began the long job of locating fodder kineas watched the kaspian for ships from the north and the mountains to the east for a rider from ataelus another day passed and kineas failed to climb the hill towards evening on the third day philokles joined him on the porch of the megaron it was spring unseasonably warm in fact and three days of sun had caused avalanches on the hillsides and probably opened the hill passes south crocuses pushed up through the rubbish and the tree bark that had accumulated along the foundation of the megaron and kineas marvelled at their colour as only a man who has survived a long winter can do outside the gate he watched a mounted man gallop past his sentries straight up the hill to the citadel there is much beauty in the world philokles said kineas grinned he put a hand on philokles shoulder he loved it when the philosopher ruled and his friend made statements of this sort there is kineas said and then more soberly and much cowardice philokles sat on the step of the megaron he stretched his long legs in front of him and took a sip of wine before handing the cup to kineas the queen he asked his voice was carefully neutral i lust for her i marshal a thousand arguments against her all excellent i might add srayanka the men her own bah i lack words to express it and yet i fly back to her like a moth to an oil lamp and then i resist he shrugged it is like a contest philokles raised an eyebrow you do love a challenge he said its more than that kineas said philokles rested on an elbow do you think i might have a sip of the wine i brought out to us thanks is it more than a challenge the camp is full of whores you could have any one you liked and no diplomatic incident need follow you could fuck ten of them and no one would tell srayanka indeed i wouldnt think it srayankas business but instead of a little helpful penetration of a whore to work off your male humours you wander off into a game with a queen the game is being played about dominance and submission sex is just a piece on the board stop dramatizing in a few weeks were riding away fuck her and leave her or dont fuck her and leave her neither one of you will ever submit kineas laughed ruefully when you came out with the wine i was remarking to myself what a pleasure you are when you are in a philosophical frame of mind he took the cup and drained it i forgot that your philosophy often kicks like an army mule kineas took the cup back and finished the wine she says all our philosophy is cowardice and every man should do what he wills philokles nodded thats the philosophy of a despot or a woman trying to seduce shes wrong though kineas wasnt sure whether that was a question or an answer philokles looked into the empty wine cup and frowned you drank all of my wine he looked hurt the good wine that tastes like berries kineas nodded and now im going to ride up the hill and see the queen philokles nodded i find it very much in keeping with the way the gods drive men to action that i began this winter begging you to avoid her and tonight i use my tongue as a lash to push you up the hill he held out the cup since youll go inside to change bring me out another cup of wine theres a good fellow he waited until kineas was halfway in the door shes not wrong nor right this is not about her but about you kineas stopped for a moment and then nodded when he returned in a fine woollen tunic and cloak with a bronze ewer of wine philokles had been joined by nicanor and diodorus nicanor served wine and took a cup for himself so youre taking the bit between your teeth diodorus said sappho says to take care kineas curled one corner of his mouth i will he said he slammed back a second cup of wine causing his friends to look at each other lycurgus raised an eyebrow he was leaning against a column watching the agora lot of messengers moving around he said sitalkes brought his horse one of the royal stallions that he rode to rest thalassa beyond the gate the rest of his escort waited the evening was calm and warm and curiously quiet except for the messengers kineas listened for a moment and diagnosed the problem it was warm like spring but there werent any insects yet in the west the sun slid down towards the cold blue waters of the kaspian kineas got a leg over his charger settled himself and turned back to lycurgus and diodorus double the watch and have the quarter guard stand to arms he said im scared of shadows he hated to be like that in a sentence hed condemned forty men to lose their evening of rest diodorus shook his head no i feel it too all the beggars are gone from the gate stay here lycurgus nodded agreement something has changed i dont like it kineas shrugged after two days of screwing up my courage to hades with that philokles came up beside diodorus youre both jumping at shadows youre going to give her good news he shook his head im worried too my man in the palace hasnt reported in three days kineas nodded but his mind wasnt convinced you should take a sword diodorus shouted as kineas turned his horse kineas shook his head and rode for the gate the gate to the citadel was heavily guarded there were eight men on duty and every one of them was in full armour they seemed surprised that kineas had come and they sent for the captain of the guard rather than passing kineas first he fumed and then he worried behind him he could hear sitalkes speaking quietly to his men all big keltoi dont be separated from your weapons kineas said something is wrong the captain of the guard came out in a polished iron helmet with a scale aventail and a scale shirt he was armed for war last person i expected to see he said you are awaiting an attack kineas said flatly the captain shrugged not my place to say the queen will receive you if you are coming in your men must wait in the courtyard disarmed kineas shook his head no ive been in the citadel a dozen times and my men have never been disarmed the captain shrugged then they wait out in the wind he said kineas turned to sitalkes im sorry he said itll be cold ill see to it as soon as i speak to her never mind us sitalkes said take carlus at least carlus was the tallest man in the army two hands taller than kineas he rode big horses and men got out of his way wherever he went kineas turned back to the captain one bodyguard he said armed he handed the man a silver owl the captain grunted and took the money whatever the fuck one man its cold lets go kineas gave his horse to sitalkes who threw a blanket over her they waited in the icy wind on the gravel road under the walls and kineas passed inside into the sensuous warmth led by one of her slaves carlus grunted twice once when the warmth of the floors penetrated his sandals and again when he saw his first oiled slave girl other than that he was silent kineas left his cloak and his sandals in the outer rooms carlus followed him silently kineas could see the tension in every visible ligament on the slaves he followed the slave into the throne room it was much the same as his first visit except that she was back to wearing the clothes of a persian matron and most of her male courtiers were in armour they fell silent as he entered there was a man in silvered scale mail standing at her shoulder who looked like a prince his face was covered by the nasal on his helmet he looked familiar you are a fool to come here kineas of athens she said kineas agreed the man at her shoulder was darius kineas felt foolish hed seen all the signs that the persian was changing sides but hed ignored them i come with an agreement about the spring campaign he said still thinking to buy her complacence perhaps it was just another round in their game the fear round you are a fool kineas she said and this time she sounded sad the spring campaign is already over i have need of your soldiers and if i cant have them no one will she looked to be on the verge of tears but she steadied herself she motioned at darius kill him carlus gave his third grunt kineas whirled to see the giant kelt with a dagger rammed through his cloak into the armour on his back he was wearing a heavy cuirass made of layers of linen quilted together half a finger thick and the dagger skidded off the armour and ripped across his neck the kelt grunted a fourth time and ripped his heavy sword from its scabbard he killed two men in as many blows and scattered the guardsmen forcing their captain back as if he was a giant in a riot of children kineas was unarmed and unarmoured but he knew where the alcove was he leaped back from the first rush grabbed a bronze platter and stopped a killing blow from the man concealed there and another from one of the courtiers nearest the throne darius was down from the dais and moving towards him philokles the persian shouted and ripped a sword from another courtier and threw it at kineas kineas rammed the edge of the platter into a mans nose then he took the mans arm whirled him and broke it so that he screamed like a wounded horse kineas swept his feet and pushed him flailing into the line of guards kicked with his bare feet set his back against the wall and grabbed for the sword as it bounced off the wall philokles he thought and his right hand closed on the grip of the sword a backcurved hanger like a small machaira with a heavy guard that completely covered his hand his left hand had the platter by one of its gryphonhead handles and he hurled it like a discus at the crowd by the throne the men facing him fell back a step carlus was bellowing like a bull there were three men in the blood at his feet and two more clutching wounds and none of the guard would come near him darius dispatched one of the courtiers with a thrust to the chest no wasted effort the two survivors by the throne turned to look at him and sartobases yelled traitor at him in outraged persian philokles he shouted again women were screaming and the smell of death and offal carried across the warm moist air he glimpsed banugul moving away from the throne one hand pointing at darius darius cut down another man and joined kineas at the wall i work for philokles he said as if a battle cry and the words penetrated kineass brain he laughed and attacked the men in front of him they scattered and he cut one down in his retreat but then the front of the hall began to fill with the queens guard follow me darius called he slipped behind a drapery kineas would not so lightly abandon his bodyguard carlus he yelled on me the kelt swung his sword wide so that the blade was a blur back and forth and then sprang away the two great swings covering his retreat he knocked a slave girl flat smashed his fist into a mans face scattering teeth and ran across the slick floor a guardsman threw a javelin his aim was true and it struck carlus in the back but it lacked power and the cuirass held it still the giant stumbled a step the guards gained heart and charged kineas ripped the hanging off the wall a persian procession of conquered peoples carrying gifts and ducked through the concealed door follow me he shouted he could feel carlus pushing through the door behind him they were in a dark corridor behind them therapons voice was calling for archers they turned sharply right and the corridor climbed a flight of stairs lit by pitch brands hold them here kineas said to the big kelt who was panting with exertion fear and pain never let their archers get a shot at you use the curve of the wall understand ill be back for you carlus placed his back against the wall he pushed himself to a full standing position aye lord he said he grinned aye his effort to push himself erect left a smear of wet blood on the plaster the whole stairwell stank of burning pitch and the sweat of fear kineas turned and followed darius again where are we going he asked postern gate darius said been trying to tell you for three days she means to attack the camp tonight shes insane wed kill her darius sagged against the landing and kineas could see he was wounded the flowing blood black in the fitful light youd have killed her men except that you came here and she owns some of your new recruits or thinks she does the man was pale with fatigue lets get to this gate kineas said they went through a door into a rich apartment and then down a long curve of steps set into the outer wall the stairwell was pitchblack and cold as the outer wells of hades with a thin cold wind coming in through the arrow slits outside kineas could hear greek voices probably his bodyguard demanding news the sounds of fighting could be heard right through the walls carlus was killing men roaring his challenge they went down and down again and through a door there were a dozen men waiting for them fuck said darius in persian and his sword flashed as he cut at a man run kineas it was too late to run kineas pushed up beside the persian and killed a man with an overarm thrust the blade went right over his shield and into his eye kineas was using the bend in his own blade to baffle his opponent in the torchlit dark the man went down like a sacrifice and kineas sank to one knee and swept his blade under the shield of dariuss opponent even with his shorter lighter blade the cut severed the mans ligaments just below the knee he fell backwards fouling his mates and buying kineas a few seconds kineas was already stripping the corpse of the man at his feet he ripped the shield off the mans arm tearing at the straps hacking with his blade at the dead mans shield arm the shields porpax caught on the dead mans wrist and hand a ring a bracelet kineas pulled shouting curses the shield came free darius backed a step as an armoured man charged him kineas uncovered whirled cutting with his sword still trying to get the shield over his own arm he cut low cut high and met his opponents shield both times desperate he tried a school dodge he backed a step placed a foot on his opponents shield and pushed the man fell back not a gymnasiumtrained man or hed have known the trick kineas pushed back through the door darius was above him on the stairs the shield dropped on to his forearm ripping flesh and the grip came into his left hand when your kelt goes down were finished darius said carlus was three rooms behind them his bellows audible even through the stone kineas heard the tense humour in the persians voice i rather enjoy having you on my side though kineas had to laugh at that stay on my shield side and get anyone who tries to pass me he said none of them are your match well get through this he turned his head and gave the younger man a broad smile darius straightened up he met kineass torchlit glance i was tempted he began kineas grunted and pushed forward through the door ignoring whatever confession the younger man was considering guard me he called the men on the other side didnt expect him to attack he pushed shield in the face cut low push and they fell back his second back cut luckier or more accurate than the others cut a dactylos above a guardsmans shield the point slashing through his eyes and the bridge of his nose so that he fell dead between breaths never seeing the blow that stole his life athena kineas roared with the whole weight of his chest confused shouts beyond the wall athena he bellowed again and cut pushed pushed again darius was covering his side along the wall thrusting with reckless energy to force his shielded opponent back kineas flicked his shield out caught another mans shield with his own rim and pulled then his sword licked out thrusting into the mans chest he thrust too hard and his borrowed sword fouled caught on a rib he kicked pulled pushed with his shield as the dying man screamed the sword broke at the hilt leaving kineas with a handsbreadth of iron too late to hesitate he threw the hilt into his next opponents face then using a pankration move learned from phocion he lunged throwing his shield leg back and his empty sword hand grasped the rim of the next mans shield and used it as a lever ripping the arm in a circle and breaking it he hammered his shield into the mans undefended face as he fell grabbed for the mans sword and missed the mans sword clattered against the cobbles of the floor vanished in the darkness a spear punched into his shield penetrating the bronze surface and embedding in the wood lining kineas used his superior leverage to rip the shield free again the spear came at him this time raking his shin because he couldnt see it coming low he stepped back and the spearman came forward the point of a threeman wedge that filled the corridor darius was still fighting a man from the last rush he gave a shout and his opponent screeched as darius cut off his hand the man backed away blood spurting from the stump and the three spearmen lost several heartbeats as they tried to cover him sword kineas said he put his hand back darius slapped his own sword into the open hand just like that kineas stepped forward took the lead mans spearhead on his shield where he could feel it and pushed fouling the mans weapon the man set his feet and pushed back his mates helping him kineas felt the strain and tilted his shield bent his knees and rolled low passing his shield under the lip of his opponents kneeling on the damp flagstone he cut low felt an impact and stood up pushing with his legs as darius came up to guard his back and the lead man staggered back shouting that he was cut and the rest broke fleeing as best they could from the terror of the darkness and the blood darius rose next to him having found the sword of the man whose wrist hed severed thanks kineas said the daimon of combat left him and his knees began to shake he was alive he almost fell his chiton was drenched in sweat think nothing of it darius said in court persian he was grey but he managed a smile could i have my sword back do you think kineas met his eye they exchanged swords and something more between them with shaking hands they got the postern open instead of fleeing they admitted kineass guardsmen who drawn by his shouts were already tearing at the door from the outside and then leaving four men under sitalkes to hold the gate and sending a mounted man to the camp kineas led the rest of them back into the citadel for the kelt they found him alive cleared the corridor in front of him and retreated from a volley of arrows carlus was wounded in more places than kineas could count in the dark and he was no longer smiling you come he said six or seven times before he passed out he fell a few feet from the postern and no one could carry him so they pulled him to one side and prepared to hold the corridor piling tables and trunks against the walls as cover from arrows you should go sir sitalkes said yes said darius he was still bleeding despite a linen wrap and his pallor had reached a dangerous level he spoke as if sleepwalking kineas longed to go but his own sense of himself as a man wouldnt permit it no he said they waited for a rush of guardsmen twice men peeked around the far corner of the corridor bronze glinting in the fitful light of the cressets the nearest one was burning down past the pitch to the solid wood that burned faster but gave less light pine wood smoke and ordure scents mixed and smoke began to fill the corridor an arrow whispered out of the dark it glanced off sitalkes cavalry breastplate and ripped across another mans bridle hand before embedding itself in an upturned table they all crouched low as much to get their heads out of the smoke as to avoid the arrows get ready kineas said listen darius said and collapsed his limbs loosening all at once so that he slumped forward and his head rang as it hit a table shit said sitalkes he and one of the keltoi grabbed the persian under the arms and pulled him out of the line and back to the relative safety of the door i hear it too said another man fighting now kineas could hear it there was fighting somewhere else ares what in hades was going on he rose to his feet and leaned out of the postern gate there was movement on the slope below him a line of shapes climbing the hill he watched them for a long moment one of the longest of his life and then he identified something about the set of the cloak and the particular movements of the lead man diodorus he called in moments the postern was crowded with armoured men dismounted cavalry andronicus took command of all the keltoi diodorus embraced kineas we heard you were dead he said not dead yet a roar shook the rafters what in hades before we got your message philokles and niceas said that something was wrong theyre rushing the main gate ares and aphrodite theyll be slaughtered kineas looked around wildly even as nicanor pushed forward almost devoid of breath from the exertion of climbing the steepest face of the hill kineass helmet and breastplate clasped against his paunch right said diodorus he looked up and down the smoky corridor andronicus take your troop and push down that corridor eumenes take your troop with me kill everyone kineas got his head into his breastplate diodorus diodorus pushed past him youre done strategos let us do our jobs right follow me kineas refused to be set aside still wearing his captured shield he pushed in behind diodorus they shoved the makeshift barriers out of the way in one long push dont be a fool kineas diodorus said i know how to get to the gate kineas said an arrow came out of the dark shit diodorus said charge he yelled and he was off down the corridor kineas struggled to keep up and a flood of men led by eumenes pushed behind him at the corner eumenes pushed his strategos out of the way and got ahead side by side with diodorus he cleared the corridor killing an archer and wounding another before the mass of them broke screaming in panic the hellenes poured in behind them more men were coming through the postern and they followed their appointed leaders blindly into the smoke and the darkness leon pushed past kineas without knowing him and raced down the corridor to diodorus and eumenes who were ten strides ahead and they went up an undefended flight of stairs kineas could barely make his legs push him up behind them two more men passed him the sounds of fighting were closer were above the gate diodorus said apparently to eumenes in the distance apollo apollo and the screams of wounded men that was philokles roar kineas felt new strength from the gods flood into his legs and he flew up the rest of the stairs and saw eumenes silverchased breastplate glitter coldly at the end of another passageway and leons black legs shining in the torchlight kineas ran his bare feet slapping on stone the stupid barbarian archers were running for their friends and leading diodorus to the gate kineas understood that even as he leaped over another dead archer in the semidarkness there was more smoke than before something was on fire athena diodorus roared difficult to believe that such a thin man could release such a war cry apollo closer kineas was right behind eumenes and another trooper amyntas one of herons gentlemen and leon eumenes and leon were shoulder to shoulder looking like gods in the flickering light diodorus hammered his shoulder into a closed door and it gave as leon and eumenes added their weight the door blew open and all three stumbled an archer shot panicked or not his arrow flew over leons bowed head and punched amyntas off his feet kineas leaped over the falling man and cut the archer down his own sword felt good in his hand he raised his shield and took an arrow and then another and pushed forward a spearhead came past him eumenes covering him he roared his war cry it came out thin and high athena and then he felt resistance against his shield and eumenes was shoving against his back and he cut low the resistance gave way and he felt a rush of cold air there were stars overhead he was standing at the entrance to a tower up on the wall and close to the main gate somehow philokles had opened the gate he stood in the courtyard killing with bodies all around him and the whole mass of the garrison trying to evict him and the men with him apollo he roared and kineas answered athena and the garrison soldiers looked up and saw their doom behind them on the wall with the unanimity of despair they broke and the hellenes hunted them through the corridors and killed them where they found them the citadel was stormed and too many of the olbians had fallen in the taking to allow for any human behaviour by the stormers they were animals and like animals they roared through the rooms and corridors destroying raping killing kineas made no attempt to stop it he could not have stopped it had he wished the law of war was strict and the citadel had been stormed and he lacked any will to resist he came down from the wall with an avenging rush and they cleared the courtyard in moments but the olbian dead were everywhere some burned with hot sand and some stabbed with many spears and between philokles wide spread legs was the body of niceas kineas threw himself on the body of his boyhood friend niceas was burned with sand and had a great gash on his unhelmeted head and a spear in his side but he still had breath in him he lives kineas proclaimed niceas shook his head gently saves you the price of a brothel he said and coughed blood no kineas said no niceas graccus is waiting for me niceas said he smiled like a man who sees home at the end of a long journey and died and kineas held him for a while until the skin under his forearms started to cool lets kill every fucker in the castle philokles said he didnt sound like himself but kineas thought it sounded like a fine plan dawn smoke from burning sheds and the remnants of fires olbians their faces black with soot huddled against the wind their bodies slack from exhaustion and guilt beyond sated no man can survive a storming action and ever forget what he did when he was a beast a carpet of bodies from the courtyard to the throne room the floors were cold leon had saved many of the citadels slaves he and nicanor and eumenes had pushed them into the queens bedchamber and held the door so in the light of dawn eumenes brought banugul to kineas where he sat on her throne the blade of his egyptian sword was clean because he had wiped it fastidiously on the cloak of sartobases just beyond sartobases was the corpse of therapon who had died in the guards last stand cut down by philokles kineas and eumenes and banugul were the only living people in the room the scenes of orgy and debauchery on the walls were sad and pathetic i found her among the slaves eumenes said kineas nodded i heard that that niceas is dead niceas is dead kineas said and tears flowed eumenes joined him kineas rose from her throne and walked to them i came to offer you life he said you stupid bitch the anger in him was great enough to kill her but her death was not enough she met his eye steadily i had no choice she said kill me if you must throw my body to your wolves to rape if that sates you her voice shook with terror and yet through her terror she was in control of herself i did what i had to and failed i will not go down to hell with lies kineas punched her so hard that her head snapped back and she shot off her feet and fell in a heap what could possibly excuse this kineas bellowed she had fallen across the bodies of several of her courtiers and she was fouled with their blood and worse she spat blood and rose on one arm alexander has murdered parmenion she said through a split lip and bruised jaw kineas stumbled back and sat on the throne as if ares had cut the sinews of his legs gods he said my socalled father will be on me in a month with five thousand men desperate to wipe me out before he too is attacked by alexander she held her bruised head high i am not a slave to bow my head alexander is my lord and i will fight kineas didnt want to look at her the urge to kill was not sated every time he thought of niceass corpse in the courtyard he was ready to send more souls to hades but another part of him cried for redemption the part that had roamed the corridors exterminating archers who would have surrendered and joined him perhaps had his sword let them live yet another part accused him of behaving badly seeking revenge on her for her role in showing him weak im sorry that i hit you he said she said nothing her eyes roamed the room looking at the dead go to him then he said take your slaves and go you were right she said her voice dead right he asked what did he expect her to say my garrison wasnt worth a crap she said coldly i wish you had joined me he shook his head get you gone before i change my mind he said in an hour she was gone and he was master of a citadel full of corpses niceass funeral games lasted three days after two weeks of preparations slaves and freedmen and farmers cleaned the citadel and kineas declared that all taxes and tribute would be remitted in exchange for a tithe on spring fodder and wagons nor did he offer any other choice his soldiers collected the tithe with drawn weapons it was ugly like everything about hyrkania in the aftermath of the escalade eumenes and leon seemed reconciled by their shared roles as heroes but their reconciliation lasted only until they wrestled for the prize of the funeral games on the third day with mosva watching them the bout became ugly and all their wounds were ripped open in a single word when leon said something while his opponent had his head down in a hold and then they were fighting like dogs leon won ataelus had returned with the rest of the prodromoi on the third day of games in time to join all the old hands in throwing torches on to niceass pyre he wept with them and threw his best goldhilted dagger on to the roaring blaze philokles had barely spoken since the storming he sat in silence and was drunk most of the time only kineas and diodorus and sappho knew that he had tried to kill himself with his sword sappho had caught him at it and they had all wrestled the blade away from him sappho cut and bleeding until philokles screamed can i do nothing but injure and kill let me go and subsided into weeping that was in the first few days after the action and philokles wasnt the only man in despair at the games he was silent he stood alone and when men went to embrace him he turned away kineas failed to move him it was ataelus who pushed past his rudeness he placed himself in front of the spartan hands on hips weeping unabashedly in the scythian manner when he had the silent mans attention he demanded niceas for killing enemies philokless face was streaked with tears in the firelight yes how many in last fight ataelus asked he didnt seem to know or care what philokles was suffering philokles flinched two he said ataelus nodded two is good he said and you he looked at the spartan curiously for revenge you were killing oh yes said philokles bitterly i killed quite a few six or seven in combat perhaps twice that in cowering defenceless men at least one woman i am very proud ataelus immune to his tone nodded good twenty men good and you kineax kineas shrugged the same ataelus shook his head for thinking my friend goes to hell alone long faces and tears dies like airyanam kills two even for being wounded and friends who love him kill forty mens to serve him in death for what crying kineas took his arm we behaved like beasts he said he didnt know how to explain it to the sakje but ataelus shrugged him off he looked around the ruddy faces lit by the pyre war is for making all men beasts he said he shrugged hunt men kill men act like beast hunt like beast yes he shook his head all war bad all notwar good but when for making war then for fighting like beast yes he shrugged love niceas he said and struck his chest then he embraced philokles who tried to avoid the embrace and was then trapped by the smaller man and one by one all the old hands the men who had ridden north from tomis almost two years before and the men who had followed alexander from granicus to ecbatana and the newer men who had stopped zopryon on the plains embraced like brothers and they all embraced philokles that night for the first time in months kineas dreamed of the tree and niceas stood among the tangled roots with ajax and both of them offered him hands full of sand he wept when he awoke but he began to understand it scared him carlus survived as did darius they each took the better part of the next month to recover and kineas had so many wounded from the storming that he couldnt start his little force in motion as it turned out the weather which had promised an early spring then deteriorated and it wasnt until a week after niceass funeral that they had another sight of the sun the ground began to dry kineas left heron and lycurgus in charge just as diodorus had originally planned with orders to forward some of the bullion and use the rest to pay their garrison and cover leons investments the storming of the citadel had gained them all the queens treasures not the richest hoard in the east but enough to satisfy an army of a thousand men for some months and buy them as many remounts as they could find are we founding an empire diodorus asked first the settlement on the rha and now a town on the kaspian kineas just looked at him not exactly he said the fort on the rha is sakje territory and this is in the satrapy of hyrkania we wont hold either for any time just long enough to secure our retreat diodorus rubbed his beard they all had them now winter had eliminated the last cleanshaven men another hundred mercenaries came in today he said mostly greeks kineas grunted heron is trying to hire your leosthenes to command a thousand hoplites he said leosthenes is ready to leave the satrap mans doomed as long as heron pays with his own money i told him he was welcome to try for pantecapaeum kineas said we have no friends there they exiled demostrate too diodorus whistled heron will make a dangerous tyrant he said nicanor came into the megaron prince lot is ready to ride he said kineas already had his armour on he went out into the weak spring sun mounted thalassa and rode to the head of the parade where all of the sauromatae waited their goods loaded on pack mules and six heavy wagons lady bahareh nodded to him as he rode past and gwair blackhorse raised his lance and gave a ypp of exultation lot rode out to the head of his column im glad to be free of this place he confessed in sakje kineas wrapped his arms around the other man and they embraced breastplate to scale shirt stay safe pick us a good camp hurry along kineas dont dawdle the sauromatae prince reared his horse for show and then they were off riding through the gates of the camp i wish we were riding with them diodorus said at kineass side kineas shrugged me too he said time to do the rotten job diodorus turned his horse and fell in beside him leon kineas nodded fetch him for me will you when the young numidian arrived kineas let him wait on the porch of the megaron while he completed the days reports and a letter to lykeles at olbia then he had nicanor bring the young man you have become a very important officer he said coldly but your behaviour at the funeral of niceas was that of a slave let me be clear when a gentleman competes at funeral games he does so in the memory of the dead man and for no personal gain or glory you dishonoured niceas with your behaviour leons knees trembled and he stood blankfaced he didnt weep he took his rebuke as a slave takes it showing as little as he could the lack of reaction enraged kineas dont you care niceas was always kind to you niceas who was a whore in the agora before he was a man who would understand you and your life better than niceas and you dishonour him at his games nothing leons body betrayed his emotion but his face gave nothing away at all i am tempted to send you away or leave you here speak tell me why i should do otherwise leon raised his eyes no reason he said in a voice bereft of hope will you accept any punishment i offer without complaint kineas asked yes leon said with more emotion than he had shown until then kineas nodded you will shovel snow with the common soldiers until we leave you will make a public apology to eumenes at the head of the parade tomorrow morning and the two of you will clasp hands both of you will go to the shrine of apollo on the mountain together and spend the night in observance offering a sacrifice on behalf of the whole expedition you will keep vigil you will make apology to the shade of niceas you will not sleep nor will you wear a cloak or hat understood leon hid his eyes yes he barked the two men climbed the mountain together the next day what if only one of them returns sappho asked she was standing arm in arm with diodorus and her face looked young and beautiful in the last of the sun cheeks red from the cold and wrapped in a heavy wool cloak her eyes moved constantly from one to the other of the officers since the incident with philokles she watched them all carefully philokles took cups of wine from nicanor and handed them around it was pleasant to stand on the porch in the warmth of evening comparative warmth in minutes it would be too cold to stand outside and kineas secretly pitied the two men climbing to the shrine they will both return he said kineas has the right of it sappho said her hand shading her eyes against the last rays of the sun my heart goes out to leon diodorus raised an eyebrow leon what he did was disgraceful like cheating in a funeral contest sappho nodded when you have experienced slavery write and tell me what you think then philokles turned and smiled at sappho well put he said sappho blushed and lowered her eyes praise from a spartan she said praise from such a great soldier might go to my head philokles took a sharp breath oh yes he said looking at the lees in his wine cup im a great soldier turning to kineas he said speaking of which your persian asked me to teach him the ways of the gymnasium today kineas frowned why he asked philokles drank off a cup of wine in a single draught then he wiped his mouth with his hand he was impressed with how you killed all those men he said he pointed his chin at sappho but he doesnt go to kineas no he comes to me he poured himself more wine from nicanors ewer sloshing some on the floor for all the gods he slurred i didnt mean it that way philokles sappho said touching his arm lightly in thebes no soldier was ever offended he stepped back as if her touch hurt him nor in sparta no a womans praise for ones ability to kill always comes before a marriage offer in sparta sappho slipped out of diodoruss arm and made a sign to temerix the smith the two of them closed on the spartan from both sides why dont you tell me how spartan women live philokles she asked philokles glanced back and forth between the two of them im not drunk yet he said watching them as if they were sparring opponents on the sand temerix smiled at the ground embarrassed yes lord he said spreading his arms dont call me lord philokles said temerix stepped back yes lord he said sappho caught at his arm spartan women she insisted too brave for me philokles said just like you he held out his wine cup and nicanor after a beseeching look at kineas filled it again philokles glanced at kineas a smile on his face he slammed the wine back and grinned wants to be a better killer who better to ask than me eh and the farther east we go the better well be until we can kill anyone we want maybe each other in the end eh he stumbled back and caught himself holding his wine cup out again sappho hauled on his arm you are being rude spartan tell me about the spartan women philokles drew himself up you are not a spartan woman he said you are a woman of thebes hence it is unseemly for you to be out in public discoursing with men hence i do not have to discourse with you as you should not be here kineas tried to think of something to say i am no longer a woman of thebes just as you are no longer a man of sparta she said we are olbians are we not or perhaps we are the people of kineas philokles laughed the kineasae and among the kineasae it was customary for women to debate with men in the agora diodorus stepped up beside the spartan it quickly became customary for sober women to debate with drunken men go to bed philokles youre making men look bad all around them people laughed friendly laughter at a situation diffused and the next time philokles stumbled temerix was there with an arm around his neck the smith had no difficulty lifting the spartan over his shoulder nor did he flinch when the big man vomited wine and bile over his back later kineas heard philokles speaking of the role of women in a wellordered polis and temerix whose greek was about equal to directing a woodcutting party grunting agreement while he washed the spartan their voices went on and on and eventually kineas fell asleep both young men returned from the shrine the next morning and kineas who had not slept well shared wine with them and prayed to the gods with them and then he went back to bed when he rose again it was to the final preparations for leaving with leon and eumenes at his side he picked the best riders from among the hoplites and put them in the cavalry the rest were left as a core of olbians with the mercenary recruits to hold the town two dozen men too badly wounded to march but still expected to recover were left as military settlers the column had food and water for ten days and better wagons and carts than when theyd started already staged over the last of the hyrkanian hills and waiting in a camp at the edge of the steppes more wagons and all the sauromatae had already crossed the desert they were as prepared as leon could manage the same weather that saw kineass column prepare to march against alexander brought the first of the spring traders from lycia just as the spring rains in the mountains washed the stream beds clear and brought old trees down the hillsides so they washed broken men out of the hills and mercenaries looking for employment and desperate men fleeing distant catastrophes before the column rode kineas heard the rumours of a dozen nations spoken in three languages a macedonian deserter bound for home said that old antipater was paralysed by news of the murder of parmenion it was said that he had gathered a thracian bodyguard and went in fear that alexander might order his death too a syrian jew from lebanon told kineas that every satrap west of media was raising an army a cretan who had almost certainly spent the winter as a brigand said that alexander had marched north from kandahar before the snows melted rumours said that bessus was dead and spitamenes was negotiating for a satrapy it was said that he had sent alexander a dozen amazons as a gift and on the final morning when the main column was mounted and the last men were kissing their hyrkanian wives one last time kineas heard from a horse trader that the queen of the massagetae was rallying the clans east of marakanda to fight alexander kineas purchased his whole string of horses diodorus shook his head remember when we were mercenaries he asked wistfully a pale sun rose between kineass chargers ears on his left was diodorus and on his right was philokles the worse for wine but steady enough lets go and find srayanka he said his heart was higher than it had been in a month and alexander diodorus said part iv tree of life your majesty eumenes the cardian was careful entering the inner sanctum where the iliad sat in its golden casket and where the panoplies of alexanders foes decorated the walls alexander was becoming more withdrawn more alien with every campaign crossing the mountains he had shown one of his bursts of superhuman activity even of empathy rescuing snowblind soldiers and speaking extempore to every knot of pikemen coming down the pass but now the godlike energy had passed and what was left was a sullen tyrant sitting amidst his favourite treasures he looked up his mismatched eyes listless what eumenes spitamenes has delivered amazons your majesty eumenes kept his head slightly bowed and barsines sister banugul is here from hyrkania hell to pay in the harem when her sister hears shes with me alexander gave a smile i cant say im altogether sorry shes here but youll have to hide her from hephaestion alexander said why is she here her tale is complex lord she blames her father but also some greek mercenary indeed she hadnt expected to find us here she came over the mountains from hyrkania intending to find us at kandahar greek mercenaries are never to be trusted i thought she had more wisdom than that very well make a note that i will see her keep her from hephaestion anything else alexander was petulant as you say barsine will be angry when she hears barsine like the rest of the women had been left in kandahar barsine means less to me than the lowest whore carrying a bag of millet for the army banugul is at least intelligent alexander rubbed his head im distempered eumenes ignore the womanish spite eumenes shrugged she has a tale of an army lord coming from the euxine alexander glared at him and the cardian subsided the euxine foolishness the scythians would eat their livers now the amazons let me see them are they handsome not really lord ares do they stink alexander rose to his feet stripped off the persian tunic he had on and summoned a slave with a better chiton which he slipped over his head eumenes could see that he was thinner the muscles corded like old rope the mountains had stolen a little more of the kings youth just as they had killed the older veterans and aged the rest the march over the mountains had taken the initiative from the rebels and brought spitamenes the most dangerous of the enemy leaders to the table but it had killed more macedonians than any of the kings victories eumenes shrugged they smell like horses majesty alexander laughed so do we he said he ran fingers through his hair and shrugged off his slaves come he said imperiously eumenes followed him out of the inner tents to his receiving tent as he entered hephaestion sensing that something important might happen without him came through the main door at a rush to one side a pair of messengers waited for the kings attention while to the other side of the main door three barbarian women in tunics of silk and leather breeches looked about themselves curiously under the eyes of a pair of the kings companions what news achilles asked hephaestion alexander for once not in the mood to be flattered shrugged spitamenes amazons he said send for kleisthenes hephaestion sent a slave and then grinned at the huddle of leatherclad women stinking barbarian women you plan to send them to brothels i assume alexander looked at his friend with something akin to amazement these are free plainswomen hephaestion if i mistreat them the massagetae and the sakje and the dahae will come to know of it and they will make trouble what i desire is that they submit as they did to the persians do you understand hephaestion unused to being corrected in public flushed the eldest of the amazons was heavily pregnant but quite beautiful she had heavy black brows the perfect skin of an ivory temple statue and a sense of humour she gave alexander half a smile the massagetae never submitted to the persae and they will never submit to you she bowed slightly lord alexander seated himself on his ivory stool and shook his head you speak greek he said indeed she answered the massagetae submitted to cyrus and to darius alexander said with royal finality you have been misinformed the woman said the massagetae killed cyrus and avoided darius alexander raised an eyebrow that does agree with what herodotus says sire kleisthenes the greek philosopher cut in well alexander looked about him i like that story much better when i conquer them i will be first the woman laughed aloud and translated for her companions they chattered in their barbaric tongue and then laughed with her alexander got up and walked over to them he put a finger under the pregnant womans face to lift it and she slapped it away with the swiftness of a lioness you have the face of a goddess but you are gravid whose child is it alexander asked mine she answered and my husbands a massagetae warrior alexander asked examining the youngest of the amazons pretty but muscled like a man do i look like a massagetae she asked she laughed again all barbarians look alike to me alexander said i am the lady srayanka of the cruel hand sakje we ride the grass where we please but our farmers turn the dirt in the valleys north of olbia alexander looked at kleisthenes and then back at the woman is this true you have ridden all the way here from the euxine this recalled the cardians gossip but he didnt want to speak of it in front of hephaestion so the sea of grass does run all the way from the jaxartes to the tanais she nodded hephaestion came up next to him we have wasted too much time on these barbarians he said he turned his back on the amazons pregnant amazons some horse troopers local trull id say she couldnt fight a child the pregnant woman narrowed her eyes give me a sword and ill cut you boy alexander waved at kleisthenes read me the bit in the little iliad about penthesilea queen of the amazons he said kleisthenes shook his head but went back into the main tent looking for the scroll hephaestion annoyed and used to getting his way leaned past alexander and shot a fist at the pregnant womans face heavy as she was she moved with the blow taking a piece of it on the crown of her head and then she was under his reach inside his arms he grunted and stepped back she had his sword he was purple with rage you will never conquer even the massagetae with soldiers like this she said she held the sword in an easy stance despite her bulk release us o king we have done you no harm and the traitor spitamenes kidnapped us from the sea of grass he is your enemy as well as mine and if you release me my clans will hunt him like a dog alexander glanced at his swordless companion with grave disappointment and then turned back to srayanka when your children are born they will make excellent hostages he said you will live comfortably with my women and when i march into your land in a few years you can help me he turned to kleisthenes ignoring hephaestion the sea of grass is real we can march to thrace kleisthenes was watching hephaestion she does seem to be a real amazon majesty hephaestion calmed himself i want the young one for myself he said srayanka still held the sword she is the lady of the grass cats a war leader and mistress of a thousand horses hephaestions humour was restored by srayankas reaction she can spread her legs for me as well as any woman he said and a few of the soldiers in the tent laughed give me back my sword before someone gets hurt he said in the voice he used to reason with women and animals srayanka nodded as if thinking im sorry she said to alexander and she cut hephaestion across the unarmoured top of his thighs so that blood flowed like water not a deep cut but a painful one then she tossed the sword on the ground at alexanders feet as his guards grabbed her i dont imagine youll spread a lot of legs anytime soon she said into the pandemonium alexander regarded her with a mixture of horror and pleasure i shall call you medea he said srayanka shrugged many men do she said release me or you will suffer by it alexander grinned his first spontaneous grin since his ragtag army had fought its way through the drifts of snow from kandahar i will never release you lady he said behind him guardsmen and slaves were seeing to hephaestion srayanka drew herself up and her pregnancy only added to her dignity we will see she said she flicked a glance at hephaestion who was rising with the aid of two other men you will be raped by dogs and the corpses of your unborn children ripped from your womb and fed to them hephaestion shouted i will have you tortured until you have no skin until alexander slapped him and he subsided but his eyes watched srayanka with feverish hate we will see she said luck good fortune careful planning and the will of the gods got kineass force across the desert in the full bloom of spring with water at every major depression and flowers blossoming among the desolate rocks fifteen days after they marched on the feast of plynteria in athens the army was reunited at the edge of the endless grass that rolled away to every horizon but the one behind them heat mirage and dust devils and a line of purple mountains in the sunset as the last token of hyrkania you make good time lot said clasping kineass forearm you have truly become sakje kineas flushed at the praise we had perfect weather and water in every hole lot grinned in sakje he said thats why you cross a desert in the spring come i have a little bad wine and samahe is reporting on ataeluss adventures in the east you seem happy kineas said im home prince lot said i think i never expected to live to get here and here we are my messengers are out on the grass riding for our yurts and our people well make rendezvous in the salt hills and then we will have such a feast kineas nodded how far to the salt hills lot led on to his tent merely a square of tough linen staked over a pair of lances mosva poured them wine in gold cups the cups are better than the wine he said ten days and well be in the hills ten hard days and then youll have all the fodder you need until you reach srayanka the sauromatae prince sniffed the air which was heavy with dust and pollen like an open bazaar that is the smell of home will you leave us kineas asked never lot said now you are in my land i will keep you as safe as you have kept me he drank his cup and kineas finished his ten days hard riding and then we feast kineas turned to mosva in a way she was a woman and then in another way she was just one of his troopers do you fancy either leon or eumenes he asked she gave the grin of a young woman just discovering her powers both she said and laughed lot nodded they are both fine young men he shrugged among my people women choose their own mates both are rich wellconnected brave and foreign he grinned again my sisters son inherits my tribes no matter what road my daughter takes your sisters son kineas asked upazan lot answered and he frowned as if the name left a bad taste ten days hard riding was repeated throughout the army as they rode east the desert vanished behind them and they rode over downs of new grass green as persephones robe but watercourses were rare and only rain saved them from serious consequences until they came to a great river flowing across their path burbling brown with spring runoff across rocks kineas was on his getae hack and he led the horse down to the water careful not to let the beast overdrink diodorus and leon were doing the same surely this isnt the oxus diodorus asked kineas shook his head we must still be twenty days from the oxus he said he rubbed his beard or more lot he shouted prince lot circled his horse through the drinking animals and splashed up what is this river called kineas asked lot shrugged in sakje it is tanais leon was pulling his gelding clear of the water because the horse wanted to keep drinking and leon had no intention of letting him from the far bank he shouted theyre all called tanais it means river lot shrugged no greek name that i know he said leon who interrogated every merchant and traveller they met went to his pack and withdrew a scroll whereon he made a few marks this must be the sarnios he said at least thats what the horsedealer called it they camped in a bend of the sarnios kineas sacrificed a young calf born on the march to the river goddess and ordered a few of their cattle slaughtered so that all the troops got a ration of meat with their grain later well fed and greasy they sat under the sky wrapped in their cloaks against the cold night air and watched the stars spread above them backlit by the glow of temerixs forge in the bed of his wagon antigonus and kineas worked on tack repairing headstalls kineas saw that the charm kam baqca had given him so long ago in the winter camp on the little borysthenes was fraying and he sewed it down tight antigonus had acquired a bronze chamfron a piece of horse armour but he couldnt get it to fit his horse without troubling the animal every night it seemed he was making adjustments wish she could talk antigonus joked tell me if the cursed thing fits kineas finished his much smaller project and watched darius attaching nocks to arrow shafts in the firelight it was finicky work wouldnt you do better waiting for daylight kineas asked the persian had all his arrowmaking kit spread on a pale blanket yes he said he swore as his hand slipped and a finished nock went sailing off into the darkness but temerix bought charcoal from a trader he has enough to melt bronze and hes casting the heads tonight kineas grinned you could still put the nocks on in daylight he said darius nodded theres never time he flicked a glance at kineas the sauromatae saw deer tracks today i wont be caught unprepared kineas laughed you had all winter to make arrows darius ignored his commander and concentrated on his task uuggh said philokles arriving with a bowl and a slab of meat whats that smell glue darius said he had another nock ready and was fitting it on a neat dovetail into the butt of the arrows shaft where the string would catch it he rolled the nock in glue and slid it home wiping the excess with his thumb then he took three carefully prepared fletchings all cut from heron feathers and glued them in place on the shaft he set the arrow pointfirst in the ground and went on to the next shaft methodically placing and gluing the nock hmm said philokles interested despite himself why not set the feathers straight on what purpose do they serve darius dropped a fletching in the grass by the fire and swore again by the time he recovered it there was glue on the feather itself and darius threw it in the fire in disgust and began to cut another it looks like a great deal more work than my spear philokles said kineas didnt want to speak it was the first time philokles had shown interest in anything much less humour darius fitted a new fletching and put the shaft into the ground with the other six hed made hunting arrows are the hardest he said why kineas asked to keep him talking and to keep philokles interested darius shrugged the shrug of the young war arrows you never get back he said i dont even put nocks on them i just cut a notch into the shaft and wrap a little cord around the base of the notch but hunting arrows you hope to get them back and you shoot them farther at harder targets they need to be well made my father always told us to make our own and not trust other mens arrows philokles nodded why the feathers though darius shook his head you greeks always ask why he said ask a real fletcher i just do as my father taught me kineas laughed philokles looked at him and raised an eyebrow kineas shook his head theres something profound there he said but im too full of beef to get my tongue around it philokles laughed and punched his shoulder across the sarnios flowers bloomed and the sauromatae girls made themselves wreaths and wore them as they rode mosva looking like artemis the hunters shot deer in the folds of the hills and men when they had water sang songs to demeter and her swiftfooted daughter returned from exile darius shot a deer on the first day of hunting and was insufferably proud despite lots prediction it took them a further ten days from the sarnios and it was one of those happy times that soldiers remember when they are old seldom the boredom or the cold or the heat but the beautiful spring on the plains and the sauromatae girls riding along the flanks in fields of flowers meat was plentiful and horses that had been near death suddenly grew strong a month after leaving hyrkania the hills of dahia were visible through the heat shimmer on the eastern horizon men grumbled and openly wondered about their wages and they ogled the sauromatae girls when they stripped their tunics to ride barechested in the spring sun diodorus pulled his horse up next to kineas the troops are better he said ares its good to be clear of cursed hyrkania kineas nodded and looked at his friend recalled from a daydream of worry about srayanka diodorus glanced at philokles who was riding alone lost in thought is he better diodorus asked kineas nodded i think so are you diodorus shrugged im a soldier ive seen a sack before i he began and fell silent seeing them together philokles pushed his heavy stallion into a trot and the horse brought him up level with the other two philokles would never be a natural rider but two years in the saddle had improved him you two look earnest he said were talking about the troops diodorus said and morale philokles nodded theyre back to grumbling the spartan said always a good sign youre better kineas asked philokles shrugged im different he said kineas watched his cavalry riding by theyre all different he said im different too you let her live philokles said i have no moment of mercy to serve as a sop to my conscience i just killed men until my arm was too tired to kill any more i let her live for pretty much the same reason kineas said there was more fatigue in it than mercy this is my last campaign philokles said i love you but i cannot be a beast for ever kineas nodded slowly it was to have been niceass last campaign he said he asked me to buy him a brothel in athens perhaps ill be the next to die then philokles said and laughed bitterly i dont want a brothel though he looked over the plain it was merciful but letting her live will cost us in the end she can tell alexander kineas shook his head you and i have both been spies brother the world is so full of spies he gave philokles half a smile that one more wont be a ruffle on the grass he looked out over the plains the sea of grass almost the same as the sea where he had met srayanka except for the brush of purple brown on the far horizon that betokened a great range of mountains wind whispered in the new blades rippling the green between pale and dark like the footprints of giants racing across the steppe somewhere out on the sea of grass alexander is waiting he said diodorus shook his head whatever hes doing hes not waiting kineas nodded if i dont find srayanka i wont care he thought two days on and they met the outriders of the sauromatae host pickets at the edge of the green hills who watched their approach and cheered their lord home from the wars lot rode at the front of the column and his young women rode along the flanks bragging of their exploits and showing the heads of the men theyd killed the column crested the first ridge and was able to look down into the caldera of an ancient volcano with rich soil to the far wall several stades distant and a camp of yurts and tents that filled the plain on the far side of a small lake then they feasted for a day resting their horses and listened to news of the world truce had failed alexander was at war with spitamenes and spitamenes was laying siege to marakanda while alexander tried to relieve his hardpressed garrisons in the north along the jaxartes all the tribes had been called to gather on the jaxartes to resist him if he tried to force a crossing with midsummer named for the muster and the westerners srayankas sakje were camped four days travel away at a bend of the oxus it was all kineas could do to remain patient in his mind he could see the shape of the campaign the sauromatae chieftains sketched him the lie of the land the hills and the desert and the two great rivers that flowed through the high plains lot and his chiefs drew their world in the soft loam of the caldera floor carefully building the sogdian mountains to the east and the bactrian highlands to the south so that the mountains formed something like a curling wave design or a cupped hand seen in profile at the base of the palm was merv an ancient trade city that lay on the margus river at the edge of the southern mountain range alexander had a garrison at merv at the tip of the curling wave lay marakanda the greatest city of the plains also on the edge of mountains marakanda lay on the polytimeros a river that flowed out of the sogdian mountains between merv and marakanda flowed the mighty oxus the greatest river of the east the valley of the oxus passed between two ranges of mountains rising far to the east in the highlands of bactria and it emptied into the lake of the sea of grass a distant body of water in the far north that lot had seen and of which leon had only heard rumours the far eastern border of the sakje lay at the jaxartes which ran a complex course like a writhing snake rising in the eastern sogdian mountains and also emptying into the lake of the sea of grass roughly parallel to the oxus on a diagonal course from southeast to northwest the land between the two great rivers was the land of the massagetae and the queen was rallying her army north of marakanda on the jaxartes so rumour had it kineas found their descriptions of the terrain bewildering even with leon to help him chart it and sort out the complexities the two great rivers the oxus and the jaxartes seemed to rise close to each other and empty into the same body of water yet they ran hundreds sometimes thousands of stades apart he found it difficult to get some notion of distance out of the sauromatae this was their home and the vast reach of grass here green and deep there patchy like the wool on a sick sheep defined their world they had ten alien words for the quality of grass and none for swimming greek soldiers and sindi clansmen wrestled and rode and ran and shot bows against their hosts kineas gave rich prizes from banuguls hoard and lot did as well temerix the best bowman on foot received a heavy bow with minute scales of gold under a glaze or varnish that somehow did nothing to reduce the flexibility of the weapon his victory brought dark looks from lots heir his sisters son upazan a handsome blond man who seemed to feel that his uncle had already lived too long and that any contest he lost must have been unfair upazan had many beautiful things a gold helmet magnificent scale armour a red enamelled bow and a shield covered in silver that shone like a mirror and had a curling dragon as an emblem picked out in red and solid gold he showed it all to kineas with pride and clearly desired more of the same lot said that upazans bow and the one he gave as a prize were spoils of raids far to the east where he claimed there lived an empire mightier than all of persia with soldiers in bronze armour leon listened with rapt attention lot sensing the numidians interest showed them another bow this one fitted with a shoulder stock and a bronze trigger mechanism kineas shot it for sport and it carried well and punched a bolt through a sakje shield with ease leon listened carefully drew a picture of the weapon on his scroll and added notes he was so distracted that mosva showed her hurt by flirting with her cousin upazan whose desire for her was obvious and drew disapproval from the elders kineas watched upazan upazan was bitter at having missed the campaign in the west more bitter still that his uncle was now a hero and bitter again to be eclipsed in contests by foreigners when he and leon threw javelins and leon bested him striking a hide shield five times out of five at the gallop upazan responded by riding up behind the black man and striking him with a spear sweeping him from his mount with the haft in a heartbeat every olbian was on his feet leon was well liked eumenes no friend of the numidians ran to his side and helped him to his feet upazan laughed it is just play such as men play he said too rough for you westerners lot shook his head and demanded that the young subchief apologize which he refused to do he stood in front of them without flinching and laughed again does the black boy need so many mothers he asked if he seeks redress we can fight i will kill him and then i will own the prize it should have been mine you are all fools under kineass direct order leon turned and walked away upazan laughed at the greeks and kineas let him laugh later that day kineas met lots queen monae who had held his tribes together while he fought in the west a campaign that already had the status of legend among the sauromatae he saw how she looked at upazan with distaste bordering on hate lots sister was everything to him and she died giving birth lot has never put reins on that horse she pointed her chin at upazan he is more trouble than all the rest of the young men and women together and many of them worship him or at least fear him with the young the two are often the same kineas was too old to let one angry young man spoil his pleasure and he was too desperate to see srayanka to mind the young mans passions too much he accepted lots apologies in place of the truculent upazans later around a council fire sitting on the beautiful sauromatae rugs of coloured wool under the canopy of stars kineas listened to lot talk about the politics of the tribes monae was with them along with diodorus philokles ataelus and upazan there was no avoiding the young man he was after all lots heir pharmenax the king paramount of all the sauromatae has made a separate peace with alexander has ridden to meet him lot said kineas was startled so your war is over he said lot looked at his monae who smiled like a wolf no one followed him being king of the sauromatae is not very different from being king of the sakje kineax he has the title but he has made a decision that is unpopular and few of us care to follow him now if this alexander wins great victories and if spitamenes the persian and queen zarina of the massagetae are defeated hmm then perhaps you will see us join king pharmenax we should be riding to alexander now said upazan he is strongest he will conquer spitamenes kineas asked ignoring the boy i heard talk of him in hyrkania refresh my memory one of the lords of bactria he has given alexander the former usurper bessus handed him over for impiety so it is said bessus is a good man and a poor general monae shook her head sadly it has been quite a year husband upazan leaned forward this is not womens talk monae i spoke and i expect to be answered we should go to alexander kineas looked at the boy but said nothing lot put up a hand upazan your time as a hostage with the medae has left you rude women may share in any council pah women warm beds and make babies we are fools to allow them anything else when i am king we will have done with spearmaidens he spoke with the malicious enjoyment every adolescent experiences in stating a view that he knows his elders will hate it was hard to tell if he actually believed any of it bessus was the satrap bessus kineas asked satrap he called himself king of kings monae shook her head he will die badly with his nose slit this alexander has been fast as a snake to adopt the ways of the medae i feel as if i have come out of the oil pot and fallen into the fire kineas said nothing about barbarian life is simple lot said he laughed but there were lines on his face and his glance strayed to upazan who is queen zarina kineas asked a spearmaiden who made herself queen monae said she put a hand to her throat and coughed and then laughed easily the world was a humorous place for her and she showed all her teeth she loves war she does not love spitamenes but she wants to defeat alexander she has called a muster of all the scythians from the euxine to the great mountains sakje dahae and sauromatae and massagetae and kandae and all their kin there has never been such a muster since the days of the great wars against the persae she smiled and they were once one of our tribes as well the persae clan mothers remember she shook her head zarina sees herself as queen of all the people will we have her will we obey she laughed but we will all go even your srayanka if only to see how many horse tails the people can muster and show this alexander what power is kineas caught his breath and then released it slowly lot glanced around and then leaned forward what do you intend lord why do you call him lord upazan asked he is some foreigner not our lord you have never seen him run a battle nephew lot said reasonably foolishness upazan had opinions for every subject and no hesitation about showing them he got up and left the fire rising he managed to kick sand at kineas kineas continued to ignore the boy when upazan was gone kineas leaned forward first i plan to meet with srayanka i understand shes at chatracharta on the oxus lot and his wife exchanged glances thats where we expect to find the sakje he said carefully kineas nodded if i understand it correctly we can move north along the oxus to the polytimeros and then well then im not too clear on the terrain he shrugged but well go to the muster on the jaxartes lot leaned forward and sketched the wave and the two rivers in the dirt all the valley of the oxus is held by iskander he said and he has forts along the polytimeros and the jaxartes that is his frontier youll have to ride around him to get to the muster thats the word on the plains stay north of the forks of the polytimeros and ride well clear of the sogdian mountains kineas shook his head srayanka will understand this better than me he said again he watched his hosts exchange a look that worried him but he was too close to finding srayanka to worry about the campaign that night well fed halfdrunk on persian wine his head buzzing with the gossip of the east kineas threw himself on his old cloak and went to sleep without effort he stood on the field of issus in the dark a flood of spectral persians coming at him from over the river and he relived his last moments at arbela his horse carrying him deep into the median nobles his helmet torn away fighting from habit because he had only moments to live at the ford of the river god and his body shifted uncomfortably as he slept and then he found himself at the base of the tree ajax waited there with nicomedes and niceas had his arms around graccus and the two stood like men who have celebrated a great festival and now help each other home the four of them watched him steadily as he approached not long now ajax said are you ready to join us niceas grunted best find that filly of yours and ride her a few times because theres none of that here the others laughed grimly you know what weve been trying to tell you ajax asked i think so said kineas it was the first time he could remember being able to converse with the dead seeing them speaking with them made him absurdly happy finish it graccus said he was serious dignified just like himself we can hold them until you climb to the top nicomedes nodded alexander must be stopped you will stop him and he set himself to climb above him a pair of eagles shrieked kineas awoke to the feel of rough bark under his arms and thighs and a leaden fatigue in his limbs on the third night in the caldera kineas sat under a rough shelter with a scrap of animal parchment on which hed rendered a rough map of the ground from the caldera to the distant jaxartes philokles lay beside him and diodorus sat on the ground with sappho at his shoulder on a stool eumenes and andronicus sat back to back both of them mending bridles leon was off questioning traders or following mosva they all looked at the map and made plans a quick trip across the dry ground to the edge of the sea where srayankas sakje were camped a grand reunion and then some hard decisions if the pay doesnt catch up with us and even if it does i have to wonder at whether we keep the boys together he said eumenes hitherto silent leaned into the discussion the men complain that they are too far from home and many complain that we are not keeping the festival calendar and that the gods will not be pleased diodorus nodded theres a lot of complaining eumenes but i see it as a sign that the boys are recovering from the march here and the storming of the citadel never worry your head about a little bitching but to kineas he said i dont see what we can accomplish here the massagetae all the sauromatae the dahae theyve got more horsemen than the gods they can bury alexander in a tide of horseflesh what can we do with our four hundred we have discipline they lack and weve faced macedon before kineas said but i take your point he looked out at the rim of the caldera and the deep blue sky beyond the world is larger than i ever imagined diodorus nodded id like to find my tutors and bring them here he said kineas went on as if his friend hadnt spoken but alexander is still the monster however great the world is he seems to bestride it i will go where he goes diodorus shook his head then i guess well follow you there he said he watched the sun for a moment then what happens i mean when we fight alexander then what kineas laughed when we beat alexander i will try to persuade srayanka to ride home he shrugged if im alive philokles shook his head always that old tune what were telling you strategos is that if you want your men to follow you to the end of the world to fight the finest army to stride the earth since the longhaired achaeans sailed to windy ilium you had better have a plan for what we do when we win or lose said diodorus cheerily on the next morning the hyperetes of each troop got the men into column they grumbled and groaned and cursed their sore muscles and their hard lot as they mounted but they did it kineas watched leon embrace mosva and watched eumenes face darken almost to purple and upazans match it but he did not interfere leon made a gesture at the sauromatae chief with his hand a small gesture of two fingers upazan reacted immediately running at leon but leon was mounted smiling he tripped the sauromatae with his spear and danced his horse away an ugly muttering spread among the younger sauromatae kineas thought of interfering but he didnt before the sun was a handsbreadth in the ether their borrowed sauromatae scouts were over the lip of the caldera and the great lake of the steppes gleamed like a flat sapphire on the horizon it vanished as they descended the calderas side but the next day it came into sight again they made good time on the steppe the scouts found water and they slept in rough camps with heavy curtains of sentries kineas drove them hard by the festival of skirophoria they were watering their horses in the oxus and across the river they could see horses and men washing shirts the olbians and the sakje fell on each other like longlost friends and battle brothers and sisters so that discipline dissolved as they entered the sakje camp kineas rode straight for the circle of wagons at the centre his heart slamming in his chest and his tongue thick in his mouth why had she not come out to meet him her scouts must have seen him a day ago he dismounted with ataelus beside him parshtaevalt stood to receive him and the younger man looked tired kineas embraced srayankas tanist who all but sighed with relief where is she he blurted out parshtaevalt hugged him harder taken he whispered she is prisoner of alexander and we have been betrayed srayankas absence was like a black storm cloud threatening to swallow kineas and sweep him away he couldnt think of anything but the void she left and twice on the first evening in the assagatje camp he wept without cause even in his despair he could tell that parshtaevalt needed him the war leader was out of his depth as srayankas tanist and he hovered near kineas and spoke twice haltingly of summoning the council of chiefs until kineas nodded to be rid of him spitamenes betrayal was not the only news waiting in the camp of the assagatje when parshtaevalt summoned the clan leaders to council and all were seated in the fire circle before srayankas wagon kineas saw a stranger dressed in silk he beckoned to parshtaevalt who is that he asked parshtaevalt had the look of a drowning man who has been offered an oar to grab that is qares one of zarinas lords from the east he came expecting to lead us to the muster kineas rubbed his beard his eyes felt full and sore and he didnt want to trouble himself with the leadership of the assagatje indeed for a day he had shunned his own men parshtaevalt threw his hands in the air what could i do i am not the lord of the assagatje he said kineax take this burden from me i can command a raid but where are we to winter shall we ride to this muster how can we rescue our lady he was distraught his arms raised to heaven as if imploring the gods i am not a king he said kineas shook his head despondently nor am i he said but you summoned the council for me when you chose not to do it yourself the sakje chief scratched his head and sighed i am a war leader he said peace councils leave me confused i was waiting and look you came i am not the king of the assagatje kineas said you are her consort parshtaevalt said that is enough and so it proved the council made it clear from their respectful silence that they wished kineas to take command kineas had enough experience with sakje to listen to what they left unsaid he rose angered at their hesitation and their silent insistence i am not your king why do you sit awaiting my orders he asked none of the chiefs said anything several of them glanced at parshtaevalt as if waiting for him to speak finally bain the most aggressive of the war leaders rose lord you are the ladys consort and you led us all through the campaigns last year even if srayanka were here she would share her authority with you lead us kineas took a deep breath i want to rescue srayanka he said is it even possible we need to know what has happened in the world i have heard rumour of betrayal and i have heard that she is a hostage even as he spoke the words he felt a tide of despair rise in his heart for a moment the pain was so intense that he stopped speaking and stood in the midst of the assagatje head hanging kineas had been following srayanka for months and here in the middle of the sea of grass he had lost her again it was too much a strong hand clenched his shoulder warm in the chill of evening courage brother philokles said well find her the spartan was sober which he rarely was in the evening since the storming of the citadel come on athenian head up these people are depending on you kineas swallowed his chin came up right he said lets hear from those who know something of what has passed despite alexanders best efforts there was a constant exchange of men and information between the tribesmen serving spitamenes and their cousins serving the macedonian king so that rumours crossed the lines in a matter of days and each side knew what the other intended and what each had done and the camp of the assagatje had a dozen warriors who knew what passed on the oxus and in the valley of the jaxartes that summer one by one they rose in council or were sent for by their chiefs there were three armies spitamenes laid siege to marakanda fabled city of the trade route and his army was the last persian army in the field against alexander with veteran iranian cavalrymen and hardbitten sogdian noblemen exiles in their own land who had been fighting alexander for three and sometimes four years alexander had a garrison in marakanda fighting carefully and looking east towards the kings army for relief it was in the east that alexander had his field army still bent on rescuing the seven garrisons he had left on the jaxartes and on keeping the third army under observation the third army was the scythian horde led by the queen of the massagetae her force was small just a few thousand riders but she had sent out the call for the full muster and the very grass itself seemed to be moving across the steppe towards the appointed rendezvous when her force had been described by one of bains horsemen qares rose and when he was recognized he stepped forward into the council i am qares of the iron hills massagetae he said and his voice had the singsong quality that ataelus had when he spoke i come from queen zarina to your queen i see a good force here a force that the massagetae need and greater than we had dared hope his voice was strong his hair was in a dozen braids each tied with a gold bell and he was a handsome man i too mourn the loss of your queen but all the sakje must ride together to face iskander queen zarina has a fair host and she will have more with every week but when iskander relieves marakanda and defeats spitamenes for whom we have no trust then he will turn east we must be ready make haste kineas nodded and the man fell silent lord qares kineas raised his whip how far is it from here to the camp of your queen twenty days riding without haste qares replied is there water parshtaevalt asked qares shrugged more now than there will be in a month he said the council came to no decision that night and kineas was bitter when he drank wine with his own officers if i had wanted to be archon i could have stayed in olbia kineas said philokles was deep in his cups the assagatje had a store of persian wine and philokles had determined to get to the bottom of it be a man he said slurring his words these people need you go to bed kineas said hes drunk diodorus said but when temerix and sappho had taken philokles away diodorus said hes right these people need you kineas took a deep breath he thought of saying that all he wanted was srayanka and he thought of cursing but he thought better of it and released the breath unused kineas was silent in the morning having slept in her wagon and having wakened to her smell on the blankets he lay awake in the dawn watching the heavy felt dragons gryphons and running deer on her wall hangings move gently in the morning breeze and when he couldnt lie there any longer he rose and took thalassa and rode away on the plains he rode alone galloping out on to the long grass until thalassa was as tired as he was then he slipped from her back and wove her a garland of late roses while she breathed heavily and then cropped the green grass that still lay under the summerscorched grass that stood in golden waves on the plain her silvergrey coat was streaked with sweat in black patterns he rubbed the sweat off her neck he placed the garland on her head and she sidled at the prickles but then steadied and he sang a hymn to poseidon he stood alone under the bowl of the sky and watched and finally a lone bird rose from the east on his right and turned long circles in the sky it was an eagle and after the sun moved towards the west a second eagle joined it and the two danced in the sky above him and then flew away to the west kineas mounted thalassa and rode slowly across the plains towards their camp that night he summoned the council in his own name and a third of all the people came so that the night was filled with the murmur of their voices the sakje sat in a circle with the olbians as they had the year before kineas rose will you have me as your leader until srayanka is returned to us kineas asked parshtaevalt shot to his feet we will he said very well said kineas he looked around he invited all the chiefs to speak and one by one they rose to demand srayankas rescue and to speak about fodder and grass about infractions of the law about the dangers of wintering on the sea of grass then kineas rose with the whip that srayanka had given him in his fist first he sketched with words what he knew of the great war in the south then as best he could he described how srayanka must have been betrayed he stressed that alexander had no reason to harm any of the hostages neither srayanka of the cruel hands nor her young friend urvara of the grass cats nor hirene her trumpeter young men and women who had ridden abroad rose to tell of what they had heard at the great camp at marakanda and from traders on the trade road they spoke too long as the young often do but despite this the excitement of the circle grew and then diodorus stood his sakje wasnt good and he called on eumenes to translate for him they dont know us here he said he turned to qares the massagetae do not spurn spitamenes for his treachery because they do not know srayanka and how far she has come he turned to darius spitamenes does not know the campaign we waged last year finally he turned to kineas alexander does not know us he looked at the circle sakje faces ruddy with firelight their hair sparkling with gold ornaments and greek faces their beards long and often shot with grey and keltoi with their bronze and gold beards kineas watched them all even without srayanka he felt as if he had returned home these were the comrades of his last campaign and here among them he might have been a few stades from olbia on a different arm of the sea of grass diodorus paused and allowed the pause to lengthen it is too bad they do not know us because if they did none of them would have allowed this to come about he waited for eumenes to finish his translation a year ago i heard satrax say this when macedon drew near he paused again and in good sakje he said let them feel the weight of our hooves around the fire olbian and sindi and sakje shrilled their war cries together diodorus turned to kineas lead us against the foe he said kineas rose i propose that we rescue srayanka he said forty voices bellowed agreement kineas raised his hands for silence it will require patience and discipline like the campaign against the getae and luck like all war the circle of forty bellowed approval kineas turned to qares the queen of the massagetaes messenger we will come to the muster srayanka has given oath to it as has prince lot of the sauromatae but first we must do what we can to rescue our lady qares shook his head you may be too late and come only to see the crows feast kineas nodded it may be as you say but without srayanka we would never have come east tell your queen that we come and the sauromatae come after we have tried our best to rescue srayanka qares looked around the circle and chose to be silent i want to send scouts south kineas said he pointed to ataelus ataelus will go east to the massagetae with qares he nodded to philokles with his chin philokles will take a patrol south to alexander he said and their eyes met in his friends face kineas read distaste and acceptance with his spartan education and his looks philokles could walk right into any mercenary unit in alexanders army and be accepted and i will ask darius to ride to spitamenes he said darius raised his eyes and looked first at philokles and then at kineas he nodded but his nod was hesitant kineass eyes went back to the circle we will move south into the valley of the oxus staying concealed from everyone except the sauromatae to the best of our ability ataelus assures me that this can be done there we will await the reports of our scouts one of the three will get us news of srayanka only then will we act until then there will be no raids no private acts of revenge his eyes left the greeks and went to parshtaevalt and the sakje clan leaders young bain the wildest of the chiefs met his eye i mean you bain kineas said if you raid without permission you will be cast out bain glared will we have revenge he asked kineas nodded i promise it he said bain rose to his feet i bain the bow of the west swear not to raise my hand until the scouts return the other chiefs men and women nodded approval the next morning ataelus philokles and darius all rode forth from the riverside camp with retinues of tribesmen guides and strings of horses kineas was left to sit beside the river drilling his cavalry and gnawing his cheek with worry by day and dreaming of war and disaster and death by night after a week lots outriders came into camp and the two groups merged the grass was too far gone where the sakje had camped and both tribes moved north and west along the river their scouts found swathes of trampled grass and the passage of thousands of hooves on the main trade road which crossed the oxus just north of the polytimeros the sakje were moving east kineas pressed on east for five days and then rested his sakje and his olbians with lot a days march away closer to the bank of the oxus their horse herds were too large to allow them to camp together easily when the grass was sparse although there was a constant traffic both ways a traffic in which leon and mosva played a role the war and the trek had made for intermarriage and friendship bonds and kineas had seen that the tribes were not so much racial as customary and when a family preferred one chief over another they moved their horses to his herd and joined it the next night the whole force was united on the banks of the oxus where their horse herds mingled brown water flowed in a watercourse three times as wide as the early summer stream which divided and then reunited in twenty channels creating thousands of islands some covered in grass others in trees the smell of honeysuckle and briar rose flooded the senses and the sound of ten thousand horses cropping the rich grass of the riverside meadows drowned out all other noise at night tamarisk fires smelled like cedar of lebanon all the water tasted of mud he used his newfound authority with the sakje to select the best warriors from among all the clans and tribes that had followed srayanka he placed them together in a company of two hundred under bain bain was a superb warrior and that made him a sakje leader kineas would rather have had parshtaevalt to command the picked men but he was the chosen leader of the cruel hands and kineas needed him there bain did not take naturally to drill but he did take to command and diodorus who had worked with both adolescents and barbarians quickly let the young knight know that his position of command rested on his ability to keep his riders interested in the greek drills theyll never be very pretty andronicus said he was working into niceass role as the command hyperetes every time kineas heard his gaulish greek at his elbow he missed niceas but andronicus had the skills to do the job but they already use the wedge and they can rally on the trumpet call and those two skills will win battles diodorus had grander plans as he showed kineas the next afternoon two troops of the olbians formed up with bains sakje in line behind them at a trumpet signal the sakje began to fire arrows over the olbians who lunged forward into a charge supported by the volleys of arrows coming over their heads diodorus rode back to kineas and pulled off his helmet what do you think he asked like the hippotoxotai in our fathers time kineas had noted that barzes a hyrkanian they had picked up at namastopolis had lost his horse to a friendly arrow he pointed this out if the sakje get a surprise if you slam into an unexpected obstacle or your charge falls short you get to eat a lot of your own arrows dont be a stick diodorus said itll change cavalry warfare kineas shrugged youre wily odysseus he said then he grinned looks good to me diodorus smiled if im odysseus he said i suppose youre agamemnon kineas made a face ouch he said with lots picked men and his own cavalry he had almost eight hundred veterans of last years campaign he drilled them amusing the sakje and boring the sauromatae teaching them a few simple trumpet commands wedge and rhomboid how to charge and how to rally quickly until they were all on the verge of revolt and then he gave them two days of feast and squandered the remaining grain on feeding the chargers samahe came in with word that lots western scouts had made contact with coenus he was far away beyond the salt hills but he was across the desert and he already had an escort of sauromatae word of his approach did more for the olbians than a hundred speeches because he brought gold for their pay and wine as well as news of home samahe was covered with dust and the smell of horse sweat preceded her into srayankas wagon by several heartbeats kineas gave her a cup of wine which she consumed with the satisfaction of a connoisseur summer on the plains she said stinkfucking desert she tossed off the rest of the wine not like home where grass stays for summer high grass is gone ataelus will be back soon kineas said and she smiled i stink like dog she said bath in roses for him her pleasure at the imminence of her mate made kineas feel as if his heart was opening inside his chest he smiled at her but his mind called out srayanka he worked to prepare to rescue her but he didnt believe in it kineas sacrificed to the gods and prayed and on the eighth day he was standing in the brutal sun wearing a straw hat as wide as his shoulders and grooming his horse with a sakje brush a marvellous tool woven like rope from horse tail with bristles of a mysterious animal that apparently lived in the far north he had groomed four horses for thousands of stades and the brush remained as stiff and fresh as the day urvara had given it to him in the hours before the great battle at the ford he treasured it now he was thinking of her and srayanka when he heard voices calling from the main camp he saw a rider coming out of the sun with pickets calling for him on either hand and he ran up the riverbank to his camp still holding his brush nihmu rode out of the sun she was exhausted her eyes set deep in her head with dark smudges under them as if shed been struck she was as thin as a stick of tamarisk and when she dismounted by kineas she drank all the water he could give her the water seemed to make her grow a little and suddenly she grinned like the sun bursting forth from a sky of clouds ready your horses king ataelus says and philokles says that they have found a way to rescue the lady kineas felt his heart begin to pound in his chest its pressure so great that it might not have beaten for days or even weeks before that moment how he asked seizing her hands nihmu flicked the hair from her eyes her braids had decayed in hard riding and she had a halo of bronze hair around her face she gave a weary shake of her head not for telling me gods i sound like ataelus she smiled havent thought in greek for many days lord i was told that you should bring the people along as quickly as you can to the forks of the polytimeros thats all i know and i am to tell you that iskander is in the field that craterus is on the polytimeros that spitamenes lays siege to marakanda she repeated these last in her singsong voice of rote memorization go to bed girl kineas ordered he turned to diodorus send eumenes to lot with the news tell him well ride in the morning diodorus nodded where exactly are the forks of the polytimeros he asked quietly kineas rubbed his chin best get some guides from lot too then he lay down in his cloak out under the stars instead of in her wagon and he waited for the veil of sleep to come over him he laughed because no spray of colour no cacophony of unreal sounds no bestiary of dream monsters could move him as his dreams had once moved him in fact he was angry kam baqca settled on the branch opposite him her skeletal back nestled against the bark of the trees main trunk you are almost there she said kineas sat with his legs dangling down above him a pair of eagles flew in growing circles around his head and cried kineas shouted you the gods have made me into an arrow and shot me from your bow any day now i will strike the target and shatter and my day is over for you the arrow will have done its work for me there is only srayanka and life the honeysuckle is sweet the briar rose smells like love and the sakje women roll in the petals and sweet grass to prepare themselves for love and i will be dead without seeing her again kam baqca raised her head so that he could see that most of the skin had flaked away from her face leaving the skull she was hideous yet somehow comforting another part of his mind wondered why ajax looked uncorrupted by death while kam baqca who died the same day had rotted are you a boy to whine to me of how unfair it all is she asked with arch contempt i am already dead no lover will take me in his arms she looked at her own arms bone and withered sinew how lovely i am if i roll in rose petals will it cover the stink of corruption he glared at her you chose your path she smiled her jaws hideous you chose your path too king archon hipparch you came east now finish your task like a craftsman go and fight the monster he awoke to the sound of ten thousand strong jaws cropping grass he lay in the grass and despair rose around him like early morning mist and settled on him until he choked and wept but when he fell asleep again he passed his dead friends and jumped into the tree again and climbed without much interest he saw the top above him and marvelled at how far he had come he looked down and saw a plain below him stretching away to mountains that rose like a wall and went on for ever and he knew awe and then he stretched forth his hand to climb if you cant control yourself better than that phocion said i will not bother to teach you any more kineas was standing in the sand of the practice ring his arm numb and his eyes stinging with tears its not fair he whimpered phocions wooden sword slapped him on the side of the head beasts fight with rage he said greeks fight with science any barbarian can outrage you boy i am not a boy kineas bellowed he meant it as a bellow it came out as more of a squeak the other young men waiting their turns tittered and giggled or stood in embarrassed silence kineass crime had been to state as a matter of fact that he was the best of phocions pupils phocion had responded by disarming him repeatedly and beating him with souldestroying ease not once but ten times running he used the same simple move over and over again moving with lazy elegance and kineass responses grew more and more foolish with each engagement until kineas burst into tears phocion stepped back if you are a man then pick up that sword and use your brain kineas walked across the sand to his fallen sword and retrieved it his mind hot with the desire for revenge but he thought of niceas and graccus and the fight in the alley and the pain and the blood and how much he owed phocion he stood straight despite ten new bruises he pushed his brain to consider phocions attack something subtle in the feint he decided on a simple solution i am ready he said settling into his stance shield forward sword back he moved out cautiously and phocion danced around him but this time kineas didnt offer his sword he stayed behind his shield accepted a light blow on his hip and a stinging cut that drew blood from his shieldside knee phocion made a back cut and kineas exerted the full force of his will to avoid the response he had been taught a cut at the opponents wrist instead he simply stepped back and blocked with his shield it was dull and the weight of the shield pulled at his arm and after some minutes phocion feinted low and thumped him on the head and he fell phocion extended a hand and drew him to his feet you are a man he said he grinned i suspected as much kineas nodded his head hurt phocion smiled at him what is my new feint kineas he asked kineas rubbed his head no idea master it starts with a faked sloppy back cut he smiled wryly it only took me ten tries to establish that phocion nodded and how do you defeat it he asked kineas shook his head no idea master phocion grinned looking much younger you may yet be the best of my students young blowhard go and oil yourself and get a rub graccus shook his head i dont understand master he said phocion shrugged you will he said kineas smiled at phocion i understand he said and then he was on a branch of the tree higher than he had ever been and then he dreamed that he was a god zeus incarnate and that in his hand he held the thunderbolt which gleamed with white fire and jumped in his hand and yet seemed to be composed of men and horses and he awoke with the taste of hubris in his mouth in an hour the whole column was moving they rode north and west along the oxus with mosvas brothers hektor and artu as well as gwair blackhorse all out front guiding the column they had ten thousand horses and the combined force was four stades long from kineas at the front to the last sauromatae maidens wreathed in scarves who rode in the dust clouds at the rear herding the cattle twice they saw distant figures on horseback kineas ordered the scouts not to pursue but he put more sauromatae out as a screen he didnt want every tribal chief within a thousand stades to know the makeup of his column now they were at the macedonian frontier the polytimeros was the edge of alexanders lines late in the second morning since nihmus return scouts reported that the forks of the polytimeros were ahead and an hour later as they ate their cold porridge while their horses cropped grass ataelus returned he kissed samahe the two entwined like two trees on a windblasted island in the aegean and then ataelus wrenched himself from her and turned to kineas he grinned philokles say come now he said luck for standing at shoulder more stuff like philokles for saying ataelus shrugged grinning kineas gestured at the column here we are he said come now said ataelus i told you said nihmu ataelus ruffled her hair and she grinned how far kineas asked two days for riding like sakje ataelus emphasized this with his fist like sakje he grinned again come for rescue lady srayanka strike blow against iskander his fist smacked into his open hand with a noise like a breaking gourd hurry philokles says for the chief of the prodromoi scrunched up his face remembering utmost hurry yes he looked around at his friends ride like sakje kineas turned to diodorus water the horses every man to have his remount handy diodorus saluted ride like sakje he said with relish philokles met them in a grove of willows four hundred stades further east on the banks of the polytimeros which swelled there to be more than a stade wide and flowed just dactyloi deep the willows were ancient and there were three different altars arrayed beneath the canopy darius was asleep under an awning of cloaks held on spears kineas dismounted in the cool shade and they embraced i have seen her philokles said kineas felt the slow flame of hope rekindle in his heart get your column under cover of the trees and lets talk he said he looked thinner and beneath his eyes were circles of darkness like a mask of despair eight hundred warriors with ten thousand horses are difficult to hide but diodorus and andronicus and bain did their best while kineas drank water and darius roused himself from sleep he looked as wrecked as philokles when he was seated philokles began we were lucky he said and i disobeyed you i convinced ataelus to stay with me and let the queens messenger find his own way home i took darius to alexanders camp alexander has so many stragglers since the massacres on the jaxartes that i walked straight through the sentries without a question he shrugged i wont make an epic of it darius found the women by posing as a slave i learned almost without effort i must concede that a column of mercenaries was to march to the relief of marakanda darius nodded i learned that alexander ordered the amazons to kandahar one of them is pregnant and alexander wants her to deliver among his women she is to be escorted by the relief column for marakanda he gave philokles a smile it was as if the gods intended us to know the amazons are a threeday wonder in the camp and there is no security tribesmen come and go alexander is recruiting sogdians and any barbarian with a bow can ride in through the gates kineas shook his head this is so much like a miracle that it seems like a trap how many in the column two thousand men greek mercenary infantry and a more polyglot crew of scum you cant imagine id have been decarch in another day i had to leave before they placed me in command of the whole expedition he gave a tired smile four hundred mercenary cavalry under an officer i dont know he shook his head listen kineas alexander is mad worse the distrust and the politics of that camp are as bad as anything ive ever seen it is not so much an army as a collection of factions the death of parmenion has cut them hard kineas nodded he did a lot of the work he admitted and a handful of hetairoi with some mounted macedonian infantry as prodromoi and a hundred macedonian cavalry under andromachus darius said completing the report he jerked a thumb at the men in column picketing their horses we can take them kineas winced companions he asked his tone reminded them of what a tough proposition a few hundred companions on wretched playedout horses had been a year before philokles rubbed his beard you are right to be cautious the macedonians are dangerous every one of them is as good as a spartiate theyve been out here so long that war is the only life they know his tone was frankly admiring so much for the philosophy of peace kineas said mockingly i was born a spartan philokles said with slow dignity philosophy was learned later yet you think we can take them kineas started to ease himself out of his breastplate philokles stood right here he said theyll be here in two days i sat in the command tent and listened to cleitus tell pharnuches their commander his march route i sent ataelus north and waited until the column marched theres not another crossing this easy for a hundred stades darius chuckled we even marched with the column he said the amazons have a cavalry escort a dozen of hephaestions own companions he commands the companions now philokles put in as diodorus came up with the other officers who does diodorus asked his armour was off and he took a helmet full of muddy water from ataelus and poured it over his head damn thats good ataelus grinned for sick making too much water he said hephaestion commands the companions philokles said fucking catamite diodorus said alexander must be hard up for cavalrymen philokles shrugged and darius flushed diodorus raised his hands to mollify them well he is a catamite he manipulates alexander always has hephaestion couldnt command a squadron of cavalry in a religious parade philokles raised an eyebrow at diodorus the two men fell silent and something passed between them philokles rolled his shoulders as if he had been carrying weights and they had finally been put aside have it as you will you two know these people better than i but the troopers guarding srayanka are the best of the best theyre right in the centre of the column kineas nodded then thats where the blow needs to fall he said he put out pickets a few of the sakje riding as much as fifty stades south and east and then he and his selected officers rode the banks of the river for twenty stades north and south but philokles ambush site was the best to the north of the island of willows was another island covered in poplar and to the south was a third island covered in rose bushes and tamarisk more tamarisk grew in a shieldshaped tangle to the north and east along the bank and spreading away south blocking the line of sight of the approaching force that night he gathered all the officers down to the lowliest file leader and drew a map in the sand he oriented them on the island of willows where they stood here is the river he said showing the course of the polytimeros here is the trade road they will come up the trees from the spring banks shade the road and offer cover he allowed the tip of his stick to follow the road just south of here is a stand really a thicket of tamarisk and poplar the road winds between the trees and the river kineas indicated the riverbank and the current river bed the battlefield will be shaped like a diamond they enter the diamond here when they begin to pass between the woods and the river their scouts will not find temerix in the tamarisk trees a ripple of laughter for the pun and will pass down the road if any of them are really professional theyll ride right around the trees to the south if so we can forget them the bulk of the column will enter the defile here he indicated the top of the diamond and march along the road there will be eight hundred of them in the front division and theyll cover two stades of road when the head of the column is ready to cross the polytimeros here and he indicated the island of willows where they stood the middle of the column will be passing temerix understand he received a chorus of nods and grunts ill show you in the morning in any case unless some hothead screws it up the column will keep marching across the polytimeros the infantry in the first division will either cross and keep marching if theyre idiots or theyll cross and form in battle order to cover the second division if theyre acting like soldiers eumenes translating at his side paused kineas understood him to be explaining to the sakje why the greek mercenaries would form a battle line on the other side kineas waited for him to finish the sakje nodded and pursed their lips in approval of such a professional move the assumption that every river crossing was an ambush impressed them the sakje squadron will be behind the island of poplars here he said theyd be well down the river bed hidden by the next island to the north and by the habit of scouts to get across watercourses as quickly as possible the notion that the watercourse was itself a highway might not occur to them even if it did few of them would ride two stades off the line of march to check out an island he hoped when the signal is given the sakje show themselves and attack the rear of the first division harass them shower them with arrows but do not close all i require is that the first division be unable to fall back to support the second division bain agreed but the gleam in his eye told another story kineas resolved to send eumenes to keep him in check the olbian cavalry will be here kineas indicated the base of the woods just a stade from the crossing the woods will screen us until it is too late if they see us early kineas shrugged we fight it out but if they dont see us we charge straight for the prisoner escort if they run back along the road theyre meat for temerix if they flee into the river well hunt them down remember that srayanka and urvara are waiting pray for some luck he paused at the same time temerix starts punching arrows into the second division they either counterattack into the thorns or they flee down the sides of the watercourse into the stream bed kineas pointed at the far side of the diamond the sauromatae knights are here behind the island of roses if the macedonians come down into the river the sauromatae deal with them again and here kineas turned to lot we are not here to fight a battle we are here to get srayanka and urvara kill some macedonians if you can but listen for the second trumpet he looked around them sakje and olbians and swarthy temerix again in the position of maximum danger when the second trumpet sounds you break like a cloud of swallows fleeing a hawk on the plains and vanish like morning mist we rally at the last camp on the oxus unless we fuck up massively there will be no pursuit because they dont have the horses to follow us across the plain right nods and grunts sounds beautiful said diodorus he was grinning what do you think will really happen kineas couldnt help but grin back because the dream of the thunderbolt was still with him and because the power to see srayanka and hold her in his arms again lay in his own hands and he was not a boy it will all go to shit and well fight our way through it he said look friends if all else fails cut your way to the middle of the column and get the girls unless the gods are against us theyll get free of the escort on their own philokles leaned in srayanka is heavily pregnant he said he looked around with the embarrassment most men kept for discussions of sex and womens matters i may have forgotten to mention this a thunderbolt kineas looked at his friend with his mouth gaping like a landed fish philokles cocked his head to one side i did forget to mention it he said she told darius that if she werent so heavy theyd all have ridden free weeks ago they may not be able to escape on their own kineas took a deep breath he had known in a vague way that she was pregnant this was more real he felt a blow in his gut and the sudden pierce of anxiety like an arrow in his side but he thought of phocion and refused to bow to fate cut your way to the middle of their column get the women and then run like fire on the plain he pointed at temerix as soon as they try for you you run down the trails youve cut and out of the back of the woods right past us and on to your ponies understand temerix never smiled he gave a curt nod like a man given unnecessary and patronizing instructions hey ataelus said he rattled off some rapid sakje to the chiefs and they all grinned together he turned back to kineas if the wind for us give them fire in the faces kineas pursed his lips and nodded yes he agreed in the morning he led them on a ride around the invisible boundaries of his diamond until every man understood his orders at nightfall samahe came to tell him that the macedonian column was camped eighty stades up the polytimeros that night he dreamed again of the thunderbolt in his hand and ataelus awakened him before the sun with a report from the outer pickets the macedonians were moving it was difficult to hide eight hundred men teams of sindi brushed the main road clear of tracks while the little army set itself in its positions men hurried unnecessarily and were injured a horse fell down the spring bank of the river and had to be killed and the process of butchering and disposing of the horse took so long that kineas was close to screaming with frustration even after a hundred helmets full of water the place where the horse had died was a mass of blood and flies kineas clamped down leave it he said his teeth clenched glaring at the miserable sakje rider who had caused the disaster to your places kineas was mounted on thalassa it was the mares first time in combat and she stood tall and firm as kineas mounted she snorted raised her head and then settled herself you are quite a horse kineas said he clucked his mare into motion and played with the catch on his breastplate a fine piece of work last spring the piece of armour had taken so many blows that it was misshapen and the shoulder catch no longer seated firmly in the back plate when it popped the two moving plates rubbed his shoulder raw he determined to get a new one where in hades would he find a new greek breastplate here on the edge of the world on the corpse of a macedonian of course except that he couldnt see this fight leaving him time to strip a corpse thalassa fidgeted diodorus had all the olbian cavalry in place behind the thickets and four of temerixs sindi were sweeping their back trail one of them had a wicker case strapped to his back theyd caught a young hawk and theyd release her to signal that the enemy was in sight an old sindi trick so he was told in the river bed clouds of flies plundered the rocks where the horse had been butchered and the sound carried up and down the river bed like a manifestation of some evil god otherwise there was silence punctuated by horse noises bits on teeth cropping grass reins creaking or snapping gentle whickers and snuffles and horse smells the gelding behind kineas defecated and the clod fell to earth with a heavy plop kineas had waited in a few cavalry ambushes this one was too large the sheer number of men and horses involved raised the likelihood of discovery he tried to decide what he would do when they were discovered sweat ran down his face and neck and down the hollow of his back where armour and tunic didnt quite meet to be so close to srayanka without saving her he banished that thought but when he glanced over his shoulder he couldnt make himself think of sacrificing his friends to rescue his wife he farted long and low and the men around him laughed his hands clenched and unclenched on his reins and he began to tap his whip against his thigh diodorus came up beside him we should dismount he said quietly well tire our horses kineas bit back a retort yes he said and suited the action to the word thalassa grunted as he slipped off her back philokles tied his horse to a flowering bush with shiny leaves and lay down as if to sleep kineas hated him for the ease with which he went to sleep dismounted he could see nothing but three hundred horses and their riders and a wall of poplar trees i should have arranged my position with a clear view of the enemys approach he thought his knees were weak he looked at the sun which hadnt moved a fingers span against the branch he had chosen as a marker he glanced around at diodorus he was flushed and fingering the edge of his machaira when their eyes met diodorus walked his horse to where kineas stood i feel like a virgin looking at his first girl diodorus said philokles stood up from his nap the olympic games will be next year he said as if this was news i imagine the athletes have already left their homes for the games at eleusis kineas looked around mystified that was two weeks ago he said hmm philokles looked around as if noticing all of the cavalry for the first time they go to win immortal glory in the striving of peace all were going to do is rescue some barbarian woman from alexander why are you two on edge he grinned you have chosen an excellent site for an ambush and arranged your troops all else is with the gods diodorus put his sword back in its sheath sure fucking spartan kineas took a steadying breath we take a great risk here he began and philokles smiled friends he said holding up his hand and the hand shook i merely hide my fears better he said kineas performed a quick calculation i am in the grip of blind fear he said we must have at least an hour i am as stupid as the boy who let his horse roll down the riverbank i should go and see to my men he dusted his hands then he went from man to man throughout the olbians clasping hands with every man and saying a few words he teased he mocked he complimented and behind him three hundred greeks and keltoi and assorted professional cavalrymen breathed easier and smiled as he moved among them a breeze came up like the caress of a friendly goddess kineas too breathed easier it took him an hour to circle his troops constantly on the lookout for the appearance of ataelus or the sight of a bird rising over the woods in front of him it kept him busy and he only thought of srayanka fifty times when he came back philokles was making water against a stone and diodorus was staring at the line of tamarisk trees as if he could bore a hole through them with his eyes kineas made a show of fastidiously avoiding the spartans rock and then he lay down in the shade of a silverleafed poplar and pulled his broad straw hat over his eyes his stomach roiled and he could feel all of his stress pushing at his colon his feet felt as if worms were crawling over them and his hands shook hes over it diodorus said with irritation now hell take a nap kineas smiled under his straw hat over it he thought despite the growing heat he was chilled to the bone over it ambushes are different in a field action the commander and the trooper can watch the enemy deploy can track the enemys countless errors and take comfort can lose himself in preparation giving orders or taking them in an ambush he can only wait and the only two options are victory or disaster no one will stay safely in reserve no one is likely to escape from the grip of war sakje and olbian and sauromatae most of them were in the grip of fear and panic and the trees and bushes moved with the quivering of men still all things considered they were better off than the macedonian column it was closer to noon than to morning when the hawk burst into the air over the thorn wood to their front her flight so loud in all the silence that men who had achieved some sort of uneasy sleep were startled awake all their fears returned drink water and mount kineas said in a fierce whisper the whisper was passed back horses whickered despite the best efforts of their riders and for a minute the olbians made as much noise as a bacchanal kineas glared at them a vein throbbing at his temple but it couldnt be helped were fucking doomed he said to philokles the spartan shrugged and drank water from a gourd marching men hear nothing he said and were fucking doomed is not a statement to inspire confidence in a commander teach that in sparta do they diodorus asked oh for the benefits of your education philokles shut up both of you kineas pushed forward to the very edge of the trees he handed philokles his reins and waved at diodorus lets go you know how to hold a horse right diodorus asked the spartan if i forget ill just run in circles flapping my arms and screaming at the top of my voice until you athenians come and rescue me he replied in a harsh whisper kineas bellycrawled forward under the branches of the poplar his forearms abraded by rose stems he pushed forward until he could just see over a low ridge of earth his line of sight was limited to the ford the island of willows and the far side of the spring banks philokles is better diodorus said and kineas glared him to silence the damned hawk was now circling the tamarisk wood screaming her head off remind me of this the next time the sindi have an old trick kineas said diodorus gave him a sharp nudge the head of the macedonian column was emerging from the gap between the spring bank and the tamarisk wood either they were moving very fast or the thricecursed bird had been released late there was an advance guard of macedonian infantrymen mounted on nags they had javelins instead of their pikes but their corslets and short guardless helmets marked them their horses were moving carefully clearly tired even as he watched the scouts horses became restless with the discovery that there was water and they began to neigh a man rode up the gentle slope from the ford towards the olbian ambush he was humming to himself and looking at the ground with professional curiosity another flanker joined him behind the two scouts the rest of the advance guard passed riding quickly and turned due north to cross the ford heading for marakanda men fought to keep their horses from drinking and suddenly the advance guard was thrown into confusion orders were shouted and any man who stopped lost control of his horse as it started to drink more fucking dahae asked the first scout he was pointing at something in the dust somebody butchered a horse in the stream bed said the other scout i dont like it if they passed that close to us we should see their dust he looked up his eyes searching the very ground where kineas and diodorus lay fuuck he said his thick macedonian accent and his illyrian hill drawl exaggerated by fear unless theyre right here the first man struck him lightly get a grip he said the second man shook his head fuck yourself whoreson puppy look at those prints erased no dust cloud dead horse behind them the last of the advance guard turned and headed across the ford the horses complaining the last of their horses splashed into the shallow brown water and the smell of mud carried back to the two men lying in the briars pharnuches is a useless fucking cunt the first scout said his voice had a hard edge of fear now too even if youre right the second rider turned and dashed for the trade road behind him a full squadron of mercenary cavalry rode down the defile two by two moving fast the men had their helmets on and their armour and they were looking to the left and to the right their horses were just as eager for water as the last units cavalry is in front diodorus whispered kineas grunted in reply his voice now covered by the trotting cavalry that meant that the infantry would be in the second division almost immune to temerixs arrows if they had their armour on nothing he could do about it now a large group of riders halted in a tangle at the edge of the ford with the two scouts shouting at them hetairoi kineas said he began pushing himself backwards as fast as he could five royal companions in duncoloured cloaks and white tunics with heavy armour a richly dressed man in a purple and yellow cloak and a breastplate and another in a red cloak three women in sakje dress on good horses one bent over her saddle face grey with effort srayanka and another clearly urvara flirting with the royal companions diodorus crawled backwards doesnt matter kineas said he was in his nerves answering his own question unvoiced it no longer mattered if the ambush was discovered as if on cue he heard the shrieking cry of bains elite sakje and the ground shook with their hooves kineas threw himself up on to his tall charger he glanced back they were all there walk he ordered and they started forward without andronicuss trumpet they were in a tight column of fours thats what they had cut a path to fit the path that the scouts had no doubt noticed he had traded rapid deployment for perfect concealment as soon as his horse emerged from the gap into the clear ground just south of the ford he called form front and the column began to knit itself into a rhomboid behind him as the head continued to ride forward at a walk he turned his head in time to see bains sakje loose a flight of arrows into the mercenary cavalry they were caught facing the wrong way with many of their horses headdown in the water drinking deeply and their horses suffered terribly in the first volley their unarmoured rumps feathered like hedgehogs two dozen horses went down and the mercenary cavalry behind dissolved into chaos as the sakje galloped past along the river bed now every warrior shot for himself and some rode ridiculously close bain himself wearing the transverse plume of a longdead macedonian officer leaned so close to an armoured officer waving a sicklebladed kopis that it seemed that his arrowhead brushed the mans cloak before he loosed with a whoop that sounded across two stades and hundreds of men kineas took in bains attack in a glance he pulled his helmets cheek plates down on his head and fastened the chinstrap the enemys command group was now cut off from their cavalry the thing could be done the command group and the hetairoi had not failed to note that hundreds of welltrained cavalry were emerging from their flank their commander in the purple cloak gesticulated turned and yelled kineass men were less than a stade away srayanka appeared injured he could see something terribly wrong in her body language he raised his right fist holding a javelin trot he shouted urvara ripped a macedonian kopis from the scabbard of one of the royal companions she removed one of his hands on the back cut and reared her horse behind her a second hetairoi trooper drew his sword and moved to execute srayanka hirene srayankas trumpeter her grey braids flying tackled the macedonian wrapping her arms around him to pin them they fell to the ground together and vanished in the rising dust srayanka free cut at a third royal companion with her riding whip whirled her horse and rode for the willow trees on the island the command group was in turmoil urvara cut at a second man her blow sheering through the layers of leather on his corslet and drawing blood macedonian contempt for women was costing them heavily charge kineas roared his horse flew like pegasus over the gravel and sand the generals bodyguards were both brave and skilled they formed well even as urvaras brilliant riding and frenzied sword cuts were bringing chaos to their rear ranks and they launched themselves all fifty of them in a countercharge but the front rank had only ten strides to gain momentum and kineass olbians had the whole gentle slope behind them and half a stade at the gallop and they threw the bodyguard flat at the impact their horses smashing chest to chest with the macedonian chargers like warships using their rams bearing them over kineas didnt throw his javelin he used it to parry the xyston of a companion and got himself a painful thrust at his badly protected left shoulder from a lance as he closed but thalassa did the work and his first two opponents didnt stay upright to face him only when the mares momentum was spent climbing the shale on to the willow island did he have to fight hand to hand a royal companion his helmet gone stood his ground on a heavy gelding and struck out hard with his long xyston rising and thrusting twohanded kineas parried and got his helmet under the point and let his charger carry him in close up belly to belly the two horses reared their hooves milling kineas caught his own spear up in two hands left hand near the head and right hand on the butt and thrust his point ripping at the mans arms cutting his reins punching in over the top of his bronze breastplate and into his throat and then another man with a red cloak kineas tried to sweep him out of the saddle with the haft of his spear and the man cut the shaft in two with a powerful sword cut kineas leaned out to avoid the mans back swing and thalassa backed away kineas got his egyptian machaira clear of the scabbard in the pause and then the two men closed their horses whirling around each other like fighting dogs red cloak was no master swordsman but he was strong as an ox heavy tough well armoured and even when kineas landed a heavy blow on the point of his shoulder the man only grunted he had a short dagger in his off hand now and he leaned in close and punched the dagger at kineass midriff but kineass bronze corslet turned the stroke kineas cut again a high feint that he turned into an attack using the mans strong parry against him and reversing his cut so that the egyptian sword went in under the mans sword arm but red cloaks corslet held thalassa was backing away kineass eyes were full of sweat and he ducked his head and launched a flurry of blows red cloak took a cut high on his arm and then cut back hard and kineass parry wasnt strong enough to stop the blow from shearing his plume and ripping the helmet free against the chinstrap snapping kineass head back he saw white and again thalassa saved his life he felt his mount rise up and thrust with her legs as the horse fell forward on to its front feet kineass vision cleared and he parried high and the two blades locked the hard edge of the egyptian sword biting into the soft iron of the macedonian kopiss forte and the two riders came together the bigger man tried to grapple with his dagger coming in at kineass thighs and kineas ripped his whip from his sash and slashed the mans reaching arm lefthanded and was rewarded with a grunt of pain and then both horses tumbled together and righted themselves with scrambles and kicks that pushed them apart kineas was past red cloak free of the melee he looked back and diodorus was thrusting at the big man repeatedly with a javelin keeping him at arms length red cloak was yelling in macedonian greek for some help kineas turned thalassa with just his knees intending to finish red cloak he wiped at his eyes with the back of his unarmoured arm feeling the pain in his left shoulder for the first time and came face to face with purple cloak who had only a short sword and was fully engaged with urvara she threw kineas a look exasperation or desperation and kineas rode into the enemy generals flank tipping him to the ground without a blow where carlus finished him with a spear thrust legs locked on thalassas barrel kineas found himself in a knot of desperate macedonians in dustcoloured cloaks probably purple cloaks bodyguard he cut right and left took another blow on his left shoulder that cut the leather straps on his armour and kneed his charger into a run bursting through the enemy and into the clear blind with pain he grabbed for his lost reins missed them but thalassa turned under him like an equine acrobat wheeling so sharply that kineas almost lost his seat the three bodyguards were locked with carlus and sitalkes kineas could see the blue plume on diodoruss helmet beyond carluss giant form he leaned forward on his mares neck gasped a gulp of air and glanced at his left shoulder which appeared uninjured despite the pain then he tapped thalassas barrel with his heels and the horse responded with another powerful lunge forward so that he crashed full into sitalkes opponent knocking the mans horse back and losing the enemy rider his seat sitalkes put the man down with brutal economy while kineas engaged his other opponent trapping his sword in a high parry cutting his bridle hand with a circular overhead feint and then killing him with a blow to the neck he had been riding for almost a minute with only his knees his charger responding magnificently but now kineas reached again for the dangling reins looking right and left exhausted by the intensity and the exertion his breath came in wracking heaves and his knees threatened to lose their grip on his mount his right wrist barely responded diodorus smacked red cloak in the side of his helmeted head with the full swing of his cornelwood javelin and the man went down unconscious or dead diodorus immediately began bellowing for the olbians to rally eumenes met kineass eyes hed downed his man and was also looking around in the river bed the big keltoi on their heavy chargers had blasted the rest of the bodyguard to shreds and were cleaning up carlus was already off his horse stripping the corpses of his victims sitalkes gave kineas a satisfied smile not bloodlust but pleasure at being alive the shattering noise of the melee died suddenly to horse sounds and human agony diodorus was everywhere rallying his men and watching the battle kineas let him do it he was riding for srayanka to the north bains riders were pressing closer to the beleaguered mercenaries and the macedonian mounted infantry firing as they went the whole fight had become a dust cloud and a cacophony of noise horses were dying with screams of anguish to the south something had happened kineas couldnt see any fighting at all but neither was there any sign of the mercenary infantry to the east there was a battle haze rising someone was engaged with the sauromatae in the river bed all of it could wait while he greeted her she was off her horse standing against one of the ancient altars srayanka he said she shook her head i feel as if im going to die she said so very much herself that kineas had to smile despite her words he started to dismount leaving thalassa to crop grass in the middle of a battle fight your battle she said through gritted teeth and then she gave a cry somewhere between grunt and scream you he said and took her in his arms bah she murmured into his cloak youre covered in blood but she smiled behind him andronicus called to him he turned to see andronicus and beyond him he saw ataelus coming from the west riding flat out look yelled eumenes he was pointing west beyond ataelus kineas turned there was a dust cloud a huge cloud that rose like an avenging god over the plains it was large enough to be another army and that army was close athena guard us kineas prayed reaching for his helmet and finding it gone a random arrow fell close rally the olbians diodorus had the task in hand philokles ran up leading his horse he too began to call for the olbians to rally antigonus surfaced from a knot of keltoi and began to beat them into column rhomboid kineas yelled to diodorus ataelus rode down into the ford and his horses hooves raised a crystal spray from the redbrown water his face was a mask of panic time slowed kineas had time to release srayanka so that she slumped by the altar urvara seized his hand and broke the spell shes karsanth the sakje woman wheeled her horse and pointed at srayanka karsanth do you understand kineas didnt understand and ataelus was there and time was speeding along big column ten and ten a hundred times more for coming here he gesticulated wildly kineas took a deep breath the scent of honeysuckle and copper blood mixing like a drug in his nose karsanth poisoned who he asked ataelus macedonian ataelus shook his head big and fast he said for waiting too long he said with bitter selfrecrimination what is karsanth kineas asked ataelus and eumenes they looked at each other while urvara shook her head karsanth karsanth how stupid are you she was as frustrated with herself as with him bains sakje were out of the river bed now up on the bank of the river in the sand and gravel riding in a tight ring around the crumbling wreck of two hundred macedonians and mercenary cavalry even as he watched bain waved his bow and his trumpeter blew a long complex call almost like a paean and the sakje turned inward as one and fell on the macedonians hidden in the dust cloud except that the macedonians werent considered the best cavalry in the world for nothing and even shot to pieces by archery they couldnt answer they hadnt lost their will to fight in the few heartbeats kineas watched he saw bain die on a lance giving birth eumenes shouted shes giving birth shes in labour the young man wheeled his horse and looked at her she was crouched by the altar unable to move her face a rictus of pain kineas looked back at the dust cloud and over at his love and before he even knew what he was going to say his arm came up he turned to diodorus take the olbians straight up the side and over the companions wipe them out take the casualties we need a clear retreat you have to build the road do you understand diodorus slammed his sword hand into his breastplate in salute his face was set i absolutely understand strategos carry on kineas turned to andronicus as soon as you hit the macedonians he said sound the retreat sound it over and over understand the big gaul nodded finally kineas rode to srayanka she had her forehead on the altar and her whole body spasmed urvara rode up next to him and her look at kineas begged him to do something kineas reached down as srayanka began to recover from her contraction their eyes met and then their hands and he reached to pull her across his saddle do not mistake me for some weakling she said i will ride i am the lady srayanka not some greek camp follower we must ride he said patiently behind him his ambush was coming apart and men were dying she bit her lip and narrowed her eyes so be it she said with bitter practicality she said get me on my horse kineas and urvara managed it she was not light but they were strong and behind them the battle exploded into life two hundred paces distant the olbian rhomboid crashed into the fight between the sakje and the companions the macedonians were brave and skilled but they had neither the weight nor the numbers to stop the olbians the crash of the olbian onset was like a hundred maniac cooks beating on copper cauldrons and it carried over the whole battlefield srayanka had a macedonian horse a beauty but not heavy enough for war kineas reached for her reins and she stopped him with a look i have not come all this way to lose you in a cavalry fight he said i have not lived all my life on the back of a horse just to fall off when im pregnant she answered she smiled at him but the edges of her lips were white thalassa bore fatigue without any apparent change of gait she went up the steep side of the ford in two bounds and then urvara was beside him with srayanka a stride behind andronicuss trumpet rang out three clear notes and then again the retreat kineas reined in at the edge of the battle haze and risked a glance back the new dust cloud was closer to the south and east temerixs men were already mounted on their ponies jogging steadily across the last flat ground to the ford from the vantage point of a tall horse at the top of the riverbank kineas could now see the sauromatae their bronze scale armour glinted in another battle cloud half a stade east along the river bed somehow the greek infantry the mercenaries had moved into the stream bed kineas shook his head because this was all taking time and time was something he didnt think they had but even as he watched lot rode clear of the war haze looking for the sound of the trumpet kineas made a sweeping gesture with his arm pointing north and west lot pulled his helmet off and waved it then gave a broad nod to signal assent he was still refastening his helmet when he went back into the cloud an arrow whistled out of the trees on the far bank and plucked one of temerixs psiloi from his pony the man screamed and then temerix dismounted waving his men into formation on the surer footing of the island he already had the golden bow in his fist and he nocked and drew in one smooth motion his first arrow brought an answering scream of pain from the poplar trees along the far bank kineas turned to eumenes and urvara gather up the sakje rally them and cover the flight of the sindi he looked down at philokles are you walking for a reason i fell off the spartan said kineas might have grinned except for the situation then run back to temerix and tell him to stop playing rearguard and get his arse across and then come back no heroics we are not lingering philokles saluted the first time kineas had ever seen him salute srayanka reached out and took his hand in hers her nails dug into his bare forearms and she grunted sweat was pouring off her kineas tried to steady her ataelus was watching the fight in the ford spitamenes he said as if he was pronouncing a sentence of death for fucking persians kineas looked over his shoulder temerix had his sindi formed in an open line and they raised their bows together and loosed a volley that rose high and fell beyond the brush at the edge of the spring bank screams erupted and then a group of iranian cavalry came through the trees and straight down the bank riding like sakje athena stand with us kineas said there were a hundred or more medes more like two hundred kineas looked behind him eumenes had maybe twenty sakje in a clump if the persians came up the bank and into the rear of the olbians it would be over the olbians would never recover bad luck he was so close to pulling this off temerix called another order and his archers formed closer a pitifully small wall at the edge of the island but they had a threefoothigh bank to defend they loosed again and their arrows slammed into the front of the median charge and wounded horses reared tangling the charge in their fall while others baulked the jump to the island philokles arrived running hard and he roared at temerix who ignored him the sindi chief slung his bow and took up his axe eumenes had thirty riders and urvara had another ten im sorry my love kineas said he was the only voice they would all obey and there was no one with whom he could leave her he reached up to pull his cheek plate down and again found it gone sakje come and feast srayanka sang at his side and her clear voice carried where a mans voice might have been lost she reached out and pulled his long knife from the scabbard at his waist more riders emerged from the battle haze behind her she sang again and every sakje in earshot was grinning kineas filled his lungs judging the time as one more rider joined urvara follow me he shouted he pointed his sword down the riverbank and they started to move up behind him he turned his head and saw sitalkes darius and carlus range themselves around srayanka the persian charge slammed into the sindi axes swung against persian swords and philokles bellowed and his heavy spear went through a persians breastplate tearing the man from his horse his war cry sounded over the cacophony of battle like the cry of a hunting cat over the burble of a stream and it froze the blood of more than one enemy the sakje countercharge seemed small and badly organized but the sakje werent greeks they didnt require serried ranks to fight effectively instead of charging the persian cavalry the two groups slipped off to the left and right every man and maid bent low shooting hard the medes flinched away fearing for their flanks and suddenly robbed of their attempt to wrap around the sindi they halted and began to shoot it was a natural decision for asiatic cavalry but it cost them the action kineas felt like an idiot for risking himself and srayanka ataelus at his shoulder was rising and shooting rising again methodically pumping arrows into the persians who were tangled with temerixs men it was too late to halt too late to swerve so kineas allowed thalassa to push up the bank on to the island of willows he was sword to javelin with a persian veteran he parried the spearhead and the man tried to use the haft to sweep him off his horses back kineas dropped the reins again grabbed the haft and cut repeatedly at the mans fingers but his head burst in a spray of bone and blood and worse as carlus struck him with a longhandled axe from the other side an arrow hit kineas in his breastplate like the kick of a mule on his right side and he saw srayankas face streaked with pain and battle joy red and white with exertion she shrieked something that was lost in the battle and the medes answered a trumpet signal and flowed away not broken just not interested in further losses the sindi rose to their feet aside from a handful most had simply lain flat and waited for the medes to ride away and scrambled for the ponies who were dispersed over half a stade of island what are you doing here philokles roared at kineas simultaneously a tight knot of medes lost or desperate punched through the sindi and came at kineas the great royal charger leaped from a dead halt to a gallop in three strides her heavy hooves crashing against the rocky island kineas had his last opponents spear and he whirled it end over end and thrust hard at the first rider a man with a copper beard and in a moment of fearinduced clarity kineas wondered if he had fought this man before at issus or at arbela and then his spear went over the mans parry and under his burnoose and the man flipped back over the rump of his horse all his sinews loosed and thalassa went right through the knot of medes as two weak blows rang on kineass back plate and then young darius was there yelling insults in persian his sword dripping blood on to his hand when he raised it over his head and philokles was standing over a dead mede and the survivors rode across the island and vanished west one of the men fleeing was tall with an excellent horse and gold embroidery on his scarlet cloak and he was clutching his side srayanka sat on her horse she had his knife in her right hand and there was blood on it and she waved it at the retreating medes come back and fight spitamenes she screeched she was laughing with tears streaming from her face and then her arms dropped and she screamed like a dying mare a war cry or a scream of pain or both ares and aphrodite kineas said for the first time in his life praying to both instead of cursing now run temerixs men needed no second urging regardless of the death wish of their captain on the north bank the medes were forming again wary now and pointing downstream where the sauromatae were vanishing into their own dust cloud on the south bank diodorus and andronicus had the olbians in hand or close to it and the bank was lined with horsemen as the sindi scrambled back side by side with temerix and philokles kineas and srayanka crested the south bank together diodorus was in front of the reordered olbians the rear ranks were sketchy and their horses were blown but the olbians were ready to charge again youre an idiot diodorus said cheerily khaire srayanka you hold here until the sauromatae are away then you sakje last under eumenes and urvara kineas thought they were going to live he could feel the loosening in his bowels and the daimon of combat winging away leaving only boneache and heartache but hed seen the medes flee they werent interested in taking casualties to beat up his rearguard i will command the sakje srayanka said her chin high eumenes and urvara may assist me kineas saluted her with a bloody javelin welcome back lady of the cruel hands he said in sakje they were cheering her olbian and sakje together a roar that must have sounded like a taunt to the medes across the river srayanka raised her knife and the shouts came again kineas felt the wind in his hair as he looked around for ataelus the man was stripping bains corpse taking his arrows everywhere sakje and sauromatae were stripping the corpses of the fallen ataelus light the fires kineas called ataelus nodded and one of his scouts galloped off into the dust samahe came up from the stream bed her gorytos empty she reined in next to thalassa and handed kineas his helmet the blue plume of horsehair severed and the plumebox that held it smashed flat thanks he said slapping her back she grinned wordlessly and turned away kineas wrestled with his helmet which was deformed and wouldnt go over his head he tried to bend it between his hands while he watched the persians but the bronze was too tough and he couldnt get it back into shape he tied the chinstrap and slipped it over his sword hilt theyre getting ready to have a go at us darius said at his side the persian had a cut on his face that had bled over his whole front and the linen burnoose he wore over his helmet was cut and flapped like a pair of wings but the medes showed no further interest in them while the first flames flickered in the grass and the olbians reformed a column of fours and retired spitamenes and his bactrians and medes began to press the greek mercenaries to the east poor bastards eumenes said lot grimaced we did all the work he said in his own tongue behind them the slaughter of the mercenaries began srayankas spasms came closer and closer ten stades north and west of the battlefield the column halted where they had left their remounts every man changed horses and drank water behind them they could still hear the fighting and see the dust urvara wept with no explanation eumenes held her shoulders and srayanka between contractions that were sharper and closer now asked for hirene kineas was bent over her holding her bloody sword hand i saw her fall he said srayanka cried out when she was done she said she was my spearmaiden my mentor the greek word made her lips curl i will see that we recover her corpse kineas said he cursed his inability to soften his words but he was still on the battlefield in his mind and srayanka was grey and plastered in sweat her beautiful hair lank and glued to her face she was dying she lay on a horse blanket her only privacy the backs of kineass friends philokles and eumenes and andronicus ataelus and samahe and lot and antigonus clutching at a wounded arm and murmuring charms and the young nihmu as the midwife srayanka groaned patiently and then screamed drank water and the mens faces reflected a kind of fear and exhaustion that the battlefield hadnt wrought nihmu laughed at them come my queen she said push the eagles are pecking at their shells srayanka screamed one more time as kineas chewed his lip and watched his rearguard pickets and hated his life and every decision he had made as his love lay dying in the sand soaked with her own blood she writhed and sweated and he knew she was going nihmus eyes calm and clear met his trust me she said he prayed sing screamed srayanka sing shouted nihmu kineass eyes met diodoruss and together they began the paean of athena voices took it up the circle of his friends and then beyond and to its martial cry his daughter was born and a minute later he had a son he took them in his arms while nihmu did what had to be done and the women washed srayanka the boy howled and the girl looked at him with enormous blue eyes full of questions unmoved even when her cord was cut and tied off unmoved when she was washed then she reached a hand and grabbed for his beard and burbled apparently pleased with the world she saw in his right hand his son screamed and screamed when his cord was cut and then settled against his fathers armour waving his arms blinking at the light they were so small he had never held anything so small in all his life and when nihmu reached out to take them he hesitated but the moment the two of them lay on their mothers breast their faces changed and the girls calm became the boys and they settled men pounded his back and women kissed his cheek he had two children and a wife and he was alive and an hour later they were riding across the sand free behind him samahe carried their daughter and nihmu carried their son and kineas offered a prayer to nike that went as well as could be expected diodorus said that night when they were gathered around a fire of tamarisk they were passing a spartan cup of water because that was all they had kineas was busy sewing at the straps on his breastplate punching holes with niceass awl and thinking of the man while srayanka slept with her head on his lap their children slept in a hastily woven basket that was near enough the fire to keep them warm which part of my plan did you like best kineas asked philokles was lying on his cloak he intercepted the cup i liked how few of us died he said indeed if it hadnt been for the loss of bain and half a dozen sakje when they pressed too close to the unbeaten macedonians the action might have cost them nothing even with the attack of the persians and bains error the ambush had emptied very few saddles someday i intend to plan a battle and have it work kineas said philokles nodded thats when youll realize you are in the elysian fields he answered pah theres nothing in this cup but water eumenes took the cup sipped the water and raised an eyebrow polytimeros he said rolling the water gently in the cup day before yesterday nice silt muddy aftertaste he had to duck as leon swung his water skin the two young men smiled at each other as philokles vanished into the dark urvara came up beside eumenes took the cup finished the contents and raised two heavy eyebrows arent you greeks tired enough by all the gods go to sleep kineas could have sworn she was addressing eumenes after a battle greek men like to gather and tell each other that theyre alive diodorus said he turned to ataelus who sat back to back with his wife both of them were sewing he making a repair to a bridle while his wife repaired her moccasins diodorus asked what do the sakje do after battle ataelus narrowed his eyes so that they sparkled with reflected firelight for lying about how many enemies killed he said urvara sat on the ground as if her knees had betrayed her how is srayanka kineas grinned he couldnt help it the grins seemed to roll out of him despite the fatigue he never wanted to go to sleep he wanted to stay like this for ever triumphant exhausted drunk on joy with her head across his lap shes asleep tough as a tenyearold sandal urvara looked at the children i thought we would die she said hah im alive eumenes usually so silent gave her an approving grin i think youve got it exactly he said she crossed her legs and put her hand on her chin not the battle fool of a greek any idiot can survive a battle you did diodorus glanced around with a why me expression the capture always srayanka is for saying that we should ride free and leave her and always we are for telling her that we will stay by her but i think in my head i must ride or die and hirene and here she looked into the fire for a moment samahe spoke hirene died a warrior death she was a spearmaiden urvara acknowledged samahes statement with a nod but still for dead yes but hirene says go urvara the bronze one lusts to hurt you and i feared him and i feared for srayanka she shrugged i cannot tell it much of it was womens fear and no interest to men srayankas belly the bronze ones lusts no exercise and for treating us like grass priestesses eumenes who hung on her every word asked what is a grass priestess when urvara raised her eyes and shrugged eumenes went on my nurse used to talk about them as if they were hmm prostitutes urvara watched him what is prostitute she asked a man or woman who takes money for fucking eumenes said in sakje using the coarsest of sakje words for the act even in firelight he could be seen to be blushing kineas finished his armour strap he really needed a new breastplate but the strap would hold for another action he was laughing quietly at his young cavalry commanders confusion urvara laughed aloud grass priestess is girl who worships grass with her back she laughed not for taking money for taking nothing when she saw that they werent laughing she shrugged macedonians treat us as if we are for fucking she shook her head never for seeing us for warriors kineas found that his free hand was stroking srayankas neck urvara was not telling her whole story she was making light of something that pained her deeply and kineas who knew both warriors and sakje could read her anger and her pain but he couldnt think of anything to say and the moment passed urvara wiped a hand across her eyes and departed the circle within seconds philokles emerged from the dark admit it im the best man in this army he said and produced a skin of wine the resulting cheer might have been heard in marakanda after the first cup had been poured into the thirsty sand for the gods philokles filled the cup and passed it leon sat and sitalkes and darius and then the others and they drank together and nihmu appeared by kineas she looked down at him her eyes dancing she bent and kissed srayankas sleeping brow and then she touched his cheek this is how theyll remember you she said thank you kineas said for delivering the children she smiled i have been trained she said you did well you are growing up he took one of srayankas golden plaques from her dress she had a dozen of them around the neck and kineas cut one away carefully and gave it to nihmu she beamed at his praise thank you lord she took the plaque gave him a shy grin from under lowered eyes and slipped away eumenes drank from the cup and chatted with philokles then left the circle in his turn he returned a little later with urvara in tow and they shared the wine cup hands lingering kineas watched them with a smile but he didnt smile as philokles methodically finished the wine skin silently drinking for oblivion the olbians lots sauromatae and the sakje made camp together at a great bend in the oxus after moving fast for a thousand stades to avoid retribution from alexander they went to a site lot knew on the northern oxus where the river ran deep along the inner bank and shallow on the outside of the curve and there was grazing for ten thousand horses in the belly of the bow grazing already used by other passing tribes but not nibbled flat a thousand lodges yurts and wagons were set up along the deepest water and parties went to get firewood and red deer as far as twenty stades away in this site they were closer to coenus when he came and ready to cross the river and head east to the rendezvous on the jaxartes when their wounded had recovered eumenes and urvara took a party of mixed olbians and sakje back to the site of the ambush they returned with more plunder and hirenes corpse as well as bains the two of them were given a kurgan on the outer bank of the oxus srayanka declined to officiate and kineas urged by nihmu took the part of both king and priest diodorus laughed at him and called him a superstitious peasant and there was a barb to his words but they all brought their squares of turf and the ceremony and the feast helped to settle something intangible well all be sakje in a few years at this rate diodorus said like a man scratching a scar kineas likes being a sakje philokles said kineas started to react angrily but he bit down on his first reply and thought for a moment instead i like their freedom kineas said philokles nodded yes he said and the way they worship you like a god what are we doing diodorus asked ive bitten my tongue long enough youre a brilliant strategos kineas i for one would follow you anywhere that last was your best work we routed twice our weight in macedonians and slipped away from another army by ares i love to follow you he looked at the ground between his feet and then slowly raised his head again but theres too much kineas most of our troopers have fought four heavy actions in two summers you need to tell them when they can go home philokles nodded its true my friend we saved srayanka and we struck a blow against macedon as far as most of your olbians are concerned the war is over and it is time to ride home and tell a lot of lies these arent spartans they arent even macedonian peasants to whom weve promised the world these are men with lives and theyd like to go home kineas sighed i know i see the same fatigue in the keltoi that i see in eumenes diodorus went back to watching the ground between his sandals whats next kineas shrugged when srayanka is ready we ride east he frowned the sakje are in much the same state as our olbians but they have nowhere to go and they have come all this way we have all come whats one more desert to cross diodorus looked up his head to one side like an alert puppy its not the desert its the battle afterwards he said and then the road home some of our wounded wont recover in time for another action some of the troopers are getting what can i call it if we had more wine philokles wouldnt be the only one drinking all day philokles looked at diodorus in surprise i drink no more than any other man he said diodorus shrugged whatever you say spartan so the desert the battle and afterwards whats the story it is my problem kineas said he sighed and my doom awaits me in the east philokles rolled his eyes oh really he barked are you some superstitious barbarian or a man of athens doom my arse you are what you are and i accuse you of making your dreams an excuse to follow alexander to the end of the world kineas snapped to attention stung by this rebuke like hades spartan he spat youve wanted this war against alexander from the first it suits sparta it suits athens and now you want to call it off here in the middle of the sea of grass very much in the panhellenic spirit well just ride home philokles pointed both hands unsteadily at kineas keep us out here for your own glory if you must ask us to fight to avenge hirene she was well liked for all her fisheating ways but spare us your doom you are a greek not some tabooridden savage their slavish respect goes to your head baqca kineas found himself facing the spartan with his hands sealed into fists i know my dreams i do not lie about them philokles leaned in close threateningly close when i met you you were the sort of man to laugh at such dreams now you are ruled by them the spartan was breathing hard are you a barbarian or a man kineas stood his ground he could smell philokles breath and feel his spittle when he shouted fuck you he said since when is moira not greek what price your precious panhellenism now spartan brilliantly reasoned athenian philokles spat back is that the best your schools can produce any spartan can do as well you are going to wake the babies srayanka said she emerged from her wagon with a shawl around her are you two going to fight many sakje will pay good wagers to watch i will fetch them but move away from the wagons and do not wake my children kineas felt himself straightening up philokles gave a drunken smile and waved his open hands oh srayanka said with mock disappointment so you only she was at a loss for the word and she did a credible imitation of a stallion rearing like horses eh but not fight she smiled a halfsmile and then her humour turned to anger and she was livid listen to me king of the sakje and spartan the sakje go to the muster on the jaxartes greeks are free no man of olbia owes me service and here she glared at kineas but my people will go to the muster because we said we would be there six moons we ride the sea of grass and still we will be there then she deflated like a tent with the poles removed and you are right spartan she said we have nowhere else to go kineas took her shoulders rather than spurning him as he feared she leaned back into his embrace they only called me king while you were missing he said she whirled out of his arms and her eyes searched his face as if shed just discovered a hidden flaw in a pot no you are king nihmus horses and my womb make you king and yet you owe us nothing she frowned satrax warned me of this moment i am barbarian and you are greek diodorus had gone back to staring at the ground between his sandals but now he looked up again be fair srayanka the sakje have had their fair share from this army we are barbarians to you she said just like we are to alexander she spat in accurate mockery imitating diodorus she said well all be sakje in a few years at this rate she hugged her belly no fate could be more cruel she mocked diodorus winced listen lady he said with his hands on his hips ive been at war for years im tired of it i want to settle somewhere and have a wife and a future the sakje are like brothers to me but i crave the world of the palaestra and the agora how happy would you be if we made you live away from the grass srayanka hung her head kineas cut in srayanka they can go home if they want but they wont theyll posture and get drunk he glared at philokles but he looked down into her eyes their startling blue almost black in the firelight but you do have other choices you can go back and when this is over the bit in his teeth he went on the high ground between the tanais and the rha whose tribal land is that srayanka used a hand to pull her hair back from her face maeotae land and no mans land these last ten years and more kineas nodded leave the farmers to their own he said the high ground is wolf land worse than hyrkania we cleared the road and made some peace drove the worst of the wolves off theres rich pasture there enough for ten thousand horses and as soon as you were there to protect it the maeotae farmers and the sindi would return to their farms on the lower rha diodorus pursed his lips and looked at kineas with a different kind of respect youre smarter than you look he said philokles raised an eyebrow and looked like a comic satyr so you have been thinking of other endings he said kineas nodded i had all winter to listen to what was said in hyrkania and to leons views on eastern trade he said many of the olbians will go home but if we declared that we were founding a city many would stay philokles beamed you have said nothing of this he proclaimed this is brilliant diodorus grinned too a city of mercenaries and sakje he said i imagine well have a fair number of curious travellers srayankas eyes went from one to another the sakje go east to the muster of the tribes she said king or no king but her look at kineas was happier but the high ground between the rha and the tanais is a good dream and a dream can keep the people alive she shrugged a curiously greek gesture on her who knows perhaps it will even come to pass kineas looked down at her perhaps we should be married he asked her husband we have been married since first we played stallion and mare she said sakje people do not worry about the fanfare when we can grasp the trumpet but she smirked i like a good party and all our men and women need something to hold in their minds that is not fear and death in the wagon there was a stirring a distant thump and a hearty wail oh goddess srayanka swore and she raced kineas for the wagon bed by kineass calculations the feast to mark their wedding and their victory would fall on the panathenaia a festival that celebrated both athena and eros he calculated the date with an eye to the grass on the plains and the speed with which his wife and his wounded could recover nothing could be more fitting said diodorus with a twinkle in his eye he and philokles could be seen plotting in all corners of the camp coenuss arrival made the celebrations possible scouts foretold him and then samahe located him and brought his column into their camp cheered by sakje and sauromatae and olbians alike coenuss column arrived with twenty fresh troopers to replace losses a hundred heavy chargers from the plains of southern hyrkania forty talents of gold his new bride artemesia and news and wine wine flowed for a week as if they were sitting on the plains of arcadia and not those of sogdiana olbians paid sauromatae maidens to weave garlands of the shiny leaves that looked most like laurel and they celebrated the midsummer feast of aphrodite a few days late and no man or woman was altogether sober coenuss lady sat with sappho modestly dressed the two of them had been sewing and embroidering for two days without cease washing their hands frequently and hiding their work from all comers youve shared the plan with the gentlemen i take it coenus asked kineas nodded chewing on some unleavened bread made from proper wheat i proposed it to srayanka and diodorus as well philokles waved his bread at them me too he said with his mouth full coenus waved his arms at the west its becoming a reality already he said heron put a hundred men into the fort on the rha under crax and then sent his troop of horse to clear my way crax is the lord of all the rhas mouth and he has recruited men in your name coenus gave a wry smile i also recruited some men in olbia and pantecapaeum and i added mine to his rather than ship them across the kaspian many of them had already guessed how much bullion i had he shrugged and lykeles kineas asked not a complete fool coenus said fondly he had no idea of how he was being used i set him straight but mark my words there will be war in the cities before next summer heraclea the strongest city on the euxine is making noise of grabbing at the eastcoast cities and neither olbia nor pantecapaeum are ready heron heron is slowly gathering and training an army of the trash of hyrkania with leosthenes as his captain and lycurgus as the governor of namastopolis coenus smiled hes not hurting anyone and his gold is keeping the best men for us the rest have already gone south over the mountains to parthia the knives are out there and everywhere that alexanders writ runs hes a fool to stay in the east his western lands are going to desert him coenus shook his head and on top of all that hes recruiting greeks himself kineas shook his head im not one of alexanders worshippers he said but a year ago the tyrant of olbia was telling me that parmenion would bury him now parmenion is dead alexander may be mad he may leak hubris as most men bleed but he is canny when it comes to ruling men he paused he needs those greeks hes bled a lot of men diodorus gave a hard smile we helped coenus nodded i wont argue with you antipater walks in fear olympias is a force to be reckoned with or so they say he drank wine ares but that all seems so distant here diodorus gave a foxy grin the politics may be distant but the godking himself is just a thousand stades that way he motioned to the east probably less coenus sat up as if stung by a wasp thats less than the distance from athens to sparta just so diodorus reached past his friend and poured wine into his cup his patrols and ours are already on the same ground if he werent so focused on spitamenes hed be after us already so crax is in the fort at errymi kineas interrupted coenus rubbed his beard hes a good lord and the maeotae like him his patrols keep them safe there are already new farms on the rha i rode over the divide to the tanais there and back if you know what i mean i talked to the farmers on the tanais they know we cleared the bandits unless we overtax them theyll be satisfied to have a lord and a town kineas shook his head again i havent sworn to it yet coenus drank off the dregs of his wine nonsense the thing is as good as done sappho smiled and so did artemesia and srayanka laughed all three of them watching the two babies philokles slapped kineas on the back will you be a king he asked kineas was still laughing when upazan rode by and something in the set of the mans shoulders killed his laughter i would rather found a city with an assembly srayanka shrugged we have assemblies too but we have lords for war if we do this thing i think we should have a king nihmu reached into the circle of adults and took a warm round of bread the time of kings is coming she said she smiled apologetically either for her words or for her theft of bread the time of assemblies is almost past she smiled timidly that is what the priests said in olbia philokles looked at her and frowned he was bleary with wine why must it be a time of kings child sparta has kings and this is scarcely her finest hour he said and why must you play the barbarian seeress all the time sappho shook her head the girl speaks only the truth philokles and wasnt cassandra a greek woman and no barbarian kineas nodded nihmu your priests are aristocrats to a man and they desire a time of kings bad prophets predict futures that they desire good prophets speak only what the gods send oh aristocrats are at fault are they philokles asked go to bed sappho said you are arguing not debating she sent nihmu away with a whisper and kineas knew that she had sent the girl for temerix philokles resented her tone he drew himself up im sorry if my wit is not up to your standards madam he said and walked off into the night sappho after a worried look took diodoruss hand and led him off off srayanka put her daughter to her breast if that girl is kam baqcas daughter she asked who was her mother kineas drank wine and shook his head she told me i cant remember some lady with your name was her grandmother really srayanka asked srayanka the archer that would make us cousins why dont i know her no idea my dear i didnt grow up here kineas stroked her hair and then took his daughter and held her marvelling again at the tiny hands and feet and how it all worked and how holding a child made him feel she frightens me srayanka said and if kam baqca ever lay with a woman i would expect to know kineas raised an eyebrow i like her even when shes a cassandra srayanka took her daughter and put her back to the breast greedy beast she murmured i may be wrong love kam baqca was the oddest of beings and he sacrificed his manhood hmmm seven years ago or perhaps eight so the thing is possible kineas could understand many things of the sakje but kam baqcas exchange of gender made his stomach turn and he changed the subject you are ready for this wedding he asked she switched breasts while samahe came and took the boy from his basket and began to change him we are already wed husband but it will be good for your greek men to see the ceremony performed and all our people want to drink wine she smiled and changed the subject herself i like lots wife kineas allowed his eyes to follow upazan i wish she would bear him a son he said srayanka made a chucking sound with her tongue stop thinking like a greek his son will not be his heir that is not the sauromatae way or the sakje way or the massagetae way his son might be his heir kineas said she nodded less likely with the eastern clans than the western but possible but upazan is his heir and no child of monaes will change that but they are young yet and lot is in the full flower of his warrior life what concerns you upazan wants him dead upazan hates us for whatever reason no reason but the folly of youth she smiled lot should have brought him west samahe got up her sewing rolled away in a sheet of linen thats enough milk for any child she said she reached out and took the girl who cried and had to be shushed by kineas kineas played with her while his son latched on to srayankas nipple in moments when will we name them he asked holding his daughter we will name them at the ceremony they will be a month old and that is a good age greek names or sakje names kineas asked trying to sound light both i think she answered satyrus satrax for our son and melissa melitta to kineas for our daughter kineas bowed well chosen he said just as well i wasnt involved he smiled at his daughter and gently touched her cheek little honey bee he said the babys eyes snapped open and her tiny hand grabbed his finger she has you already srayanka laughed and what would you know of choosing sakje names she asked him but her eyes danced they kissed your gown is almost finished samahe said srayanka laughed she loved looking fine and she was delighted by the idea of a silk gown i cant wait she said ill have to bind my breasts or theyll leak kineas handed his daughter to samahe some things are better for a man not to hear he said all the world it seemed attended their feast sauromatae and sakje olbians persian traders and even a western kwin the purveyor of the silk that made srayankas cream persian gown embroidered around the hem and all the seams with greek and scythian animals and designs depending on which woman had been available to put her hand to the work she wore the heavy gold collar of her rank and the high headdress of a priestess with the greenhilted sword of cyrus in a gold scabbard at her side to kineas she looked like one of the ancient goddesses he had seen in ecbatana kineas awoke on his feast day to find that he too had a magnificent gift first a wool tunic of the finest sogdian work made from a pair of matched shawls and decorated more fancifully than an athenian gentleman would think quite right for everyday wear his greek friends had refurbished his red sandals and produced a gold laurel wreath for him to wear in his hair but the most magnificent gift sat in front of their wagon on an armour stand for all to view a sauromataestyle scale hauberk the scales in alternating rows of silvered bronze and gilt and blue enamel carefully fitted with dozens of differentsized scales to cover his torso and shoulders perfectly the scales sewn to a new leather thorax the resulting cuirass was heavy but no heavier than his damaged athenian breast and backplates and it glowed in the summer sun with gilded greek leg armour and a matching bridle gauntlet produced by temerix in secret his helmet refurbished had a new blue plume diodorus fondled the gauntlet as if it was a womans arm they wear them in italia he said craterus had one at arbela kineas said we all admired it he laughed i dont suppose it would do to wear armour for my wedding soon enough nihmu said doing a handstand nearby there were games sakje games and greek games with horse races and wrestling and shooting bows for distance and accuracy but once the wine and fermented mares milk began to flow the contests ran their courses and the contestants hurried to get their share of the drink kineas and srayanka gave prizes to the winners sitting together hand in hand on a pile of skins in the red sunset their children in baskets at their feet do you remember kineas asked on the sea of grass riding to see satrax she laughed with him i didnt have ten words of greek she said but oh how i wanted you she looked at him under her lashes a look that was the more beautiful for its rarity because she was more frequently the cavalry commander than the lover we held hands i think they danced and ate and drank wine until the sun set and then they danced and sang and drank more strong red wine from chios that was like berries in the mouth and they ate venison seasoned with pepper which was too strong for some of the greeks but delighted others they had bread rich strong greek bread because coenus had brought olbian flour all the way across the sea of grass and the olbians had strong maeotian fish sauce three deep amphorae to season their bread and olive oil for the first time in three months while the sauromatae and the sakje tried the greek foods and passed around their own rich and heavily spiced mutton and foal with flatbreads and honey i brought cider coenus said but it was already turning by the time i reached crax on the return trip and we drank it to save it he grinned and spoke slowly the perfect aristocrat even staggering drunk we toasted the two of you of course they had built a bonfire that towered to the height of three tall men tamarisk and willow and poplar on top and the fire took with a rush after it had been blessed by a persian fire priest who had come with the traders and roared to life so that you could feel it on your back ten horselengths away the burning cedar smell of the tamarisk mixed with the late honeysuckle and the briar roses that bloomed over every thicket in the river valley they were toasted and gifted and they named their children in the last light of the sun at the top of hirene and bains kurgan so that the swords of the two dead heroes caught the light and seemed to anoint the heads of the two infants unmoved by all this spiritual glory the babies roared against their hard fates in being kept up late and received the plaudits of the crowd despite their ill manners they were after all only a month old and then many of the greek men appeared drunk singing obscene songs that srayanka could only guess the meaning of not that the guessing was hard as most of them wore giant erect phalluses strapped to their groins and they had convinced several young sakje girls to be lewd battering pans and kettles slobbering wellmeant kisses this raucous crew escorted them to their wagon the serenade went on until srayanka said they were waking the children dont hear that every day at a wedding in athens diodorus called and then they were gone there will be more wine than milk in these breasts srayanka said when finally they were alone no reason they shouldnt share the feast kineas said at home you would have a wet nurse at home in greece a wet nurse and slaves and a life in a few rooms she frowned im afraid you are wed to a barbarian well barbarian queen what will you have as a wedding present he asked kissing the side of her neck hmm she said mmm she whispered she laughed at him and pushed him away remember what happened the last time killers coming through the side of the wagon by zeus that seems a long time ago he laughed and snuggled next to her even then what i wanted was to take my people to war with alexander she said that is still what i want and when we have fought him win or lose then we can return to the high ground by the tanais we will be king and queen of a united people our children will rule after us she kissed his hand i want you to bring your people to the muster king kineas that is what i want kineas knew what keeping that promise would mean he dreamed of the tree and the river almost every night but he looked into her eyes and thought that some fates were not as bad as they might seem to alexander then he said part v achilles choice m i surrounded by fools alexander asked the assembled officers silence this country is not subdued alexander said carefully we are at war with every rock and tree there is no room for weakness or doubt or slovenly soldiering the macedonian officers were red with fury and embarrassment the cadre of persian and sogdian officers who were present deepened their humiliation alexander had little time for panhellenism but it had its uses two thousand hellenes died at the hands of barbarians they were not even outnumbered they were merely careless craterus a companion officer and ptolemy the youngest of the phalanx commanders exchanged glances alexander watched them they looked as if they might voice some dissent he was prepared to crush them but after one exchanged glance they subsided alexander raised an arm if you gentlemen will turn your attention to the stream bed just to the north a tributary ran down out of the sogdian hills into the jaxartes the stream bed was nearly dry with midsummer and forage parties had cleared every stick of burnable brush and every leaf of green forage so that the stream bed looked like an open mine packed into the gully were six thousand blankeyed prisoners leashed by short ropes to stakes driven deep into the sandy soil lining the sides of the gully were soldiers some macedonian veterans and some of the more recent sogdian recruits the sogdians most of them were related to the men in the gully alexander gave a sign and all the men macedonian and bactrian set to work in the mass slaughter of six thousand prisoners for the most part the victims waited fatalistically although here and there men struggled either panicked into a last resistance or too stubborn to go down without a fight their executioners approached with dripping swords and dispatched them those who struggled took the longest to die and those who bowed their heads to the blade went fast alexander watched for as long as it took a thousand men to die i dont want any more mistakes he said nor do i wish to see any softness the evening air stank of blood as if the army was butchering oxen for meat you will all watch until these rebels are dead then you may dismiss he turned on his heel and walked away followed by hephaestion and craterus neither man walked with his accustomed swagger alexander turned before he had gone ten steps eumenes he called and the lone greek on his command staff came quickly in his tent he snapped his fingers for wine i worry that we are teaching the rebels not to surrender eumenes said alexander sat heavily on his couch and swirled the wine in his cup i worry about the same thing but i had to make an example for spitamenes hephaestion asked and alexander shook his head while he narrowed his eyes no he said for this scythian queen zarina and for my own macedonians he turned to eumenes you have all the survivors from pharnuches column isolated yes majesty eumenes could feel the lions rage from across the room like the heat from a bonfire i considered having them executed with the rebels alexander said but that seemed to send the wrong message im still thinking about it tell them from me that if i hear a word of this disaster from the army i will have one man in every file killed if i hear more ill kill them all he took a deep breath understand me he said after a moment i command it he looked at eumenes and we lost our amazons spitamenes must be having quite a laugh at us eumenes avoided his eyes i do not think it was spitamenes who ambushed pharnuches hephaestion spluttered on his wine what he asked dont be foolish i interrogated some of the survivors myself eumenes was tired to death of hephaestion so he wasnt as careful as he ought to have been really and did any of them mention the enemy had greek cavalry whats this alexander asked his voice harsh as an executioners sword hephaestion shrugged diomedes the surviving companion said he fought a greek i think the mans deranged eumenes shook his head hephaestion glared at him eumenes ignored the favourite and looked at the king diomedes says that the whole thing was a rescue of the amazons and it was done by dahae and greeks daring he added i asked kleisthenes to help me with the questioning he thinks that the bestarmoured of the enemy cavalry were sauromatae who we havent encountered before by my fathers thunder alexander cursed the king of the sauromatae sits in my camp and eats my food and his warriors serve spitamenes send for pharasmenes to eumenes he said i curse the loss of the amazons they were something a man could hold in his hand some visible proof of our conquests like elephants something to show hephaestion flushed alexander gave a halfsmile i want them back or replaced with others as fine if i have to take the army across the jaxartes i will not i think the best use of our assets eumenes murmured you are not indispensable greek i command here i have crushed the rebels and retaken all our forts alexander looked off into the distance when i break this queen zarina there will be amazons for every man in the army eumenes knew the storm was coming he raised his head and met it square on you will find it almost impossible to raise more mercenaries he said greek soldiers are like snow in the mountains alexander said contemptuously eumenes wouldnt back down every satrap is raising an army the lesson of parmenion has not been lost and we are a long way from greece majesty we dont pay the most and we kill them like cattle a thousand with pharnuches two thousand in the jaxartes forts and those are just our most recent losses the thessalians are on the verge of mutiny craterus put in thankless bastards bitterly he said and young ptolemy says the phalanxes arent much better eumenes looked around thankless they were our very best cavalry but they loved parmenion better than they loved me alexander said best to send them home and replace them with what craterus said more persians bactrians sogdians these are not softhanded persians these are men of war like our macedonians mountain men like us alexander used much the same voice he would use in gentling a child craterus raised his voice ares balls alexander dont fool yourself theyre fucking persians orientals theyre counting the hours until they stab us all in our sleep eumenes fought back a smile craterus was speaking his lines as if they had been written for him and he not eumenes would now suffer the wrath of the king but alexander surprised them all by remaining calm i understand your concern craterus and yours eumenes but i must have cavalry for this war and to leave the sogdians unemployed would be to invite them to join my enemies he put his leg up hed received an arrow through the leg a clean wound but it kept weeping pus and yesterday a bone fragment had emerged it made the king feel mortal and fallible eumenes exhaled slowly may we at least secure marakanda behind us before we cross the jaxartes he asked alexander nodded ill take a flying column myself he glanced at hephaestion seemed on the edge of saying something and then shook his head no it will have to be me another disaster like the one on the oxus and the whole fabric will start to unweave ill be gone two weeks spitamenes hasnt the stomach to make a stand hell break the siege if i am fast enough ill catch him if not ill come back and well try to wrongfoot the barbarians and have a go at the massagetae he gave them a smile that was meant to be reassuring shell have amazons the next morning brought kineas news of another side to his wedding feast words had been spoken and blows exchanged and there was anger in the air sidelong glances trouble on the horse lines voices raised kineas listened to the story from ataelus who had a bad cut on his arm and watched the men and women behind ataelus spreading the gossip with their eyes the prodromoi were a tightknit group who saw themselves as the elite of the whole force ataelus was turning them into a clan of his own a process about which srayanka had warned him kineas had learned enough about scythian politics to know that weak leaders lost followers to strong leaders and that even when a clan had a great leader some men and women would drift away to greener pastures garait for kissing this woman ataelus said derva of the sauromatae you know her kineas shook his head caught in ignorance of his troops no he said ataelus shook his head in turn derva was paradatam to aurvant of the sauromatae but she was kissing garait he shrugged and winced as the wound in his shoulder hurt him so aurvant is for going to upazan who is his chief srayanka came up behind her husband and put her hands on her hips not a good story ataelus she said in sakje he bowed his head but said these young people are my people derva has denied her paradatam for the required number of days and then what happened kineas asked ataelus frowned upazan and garait for shouting he said in greek he met kineass eye upazan hits garait and leon hits upazan upazan draws a sword cuts at garait i step in to stop foolish boytalk and get this he gestured with shame at his wound his bow arm was in a sling what does leon have to do with this kineas asked his temper fraying srayankas eyes narrowed fractionally and she shook her head leon loves mosva of the sauromatae i know that kineas said so does upazan srayanka said as she would speak to a notverybright child what do you want ataelus i ask for killing upazan ataelus said formally at the end of his testimony man to man and horse to horse kineas looked at srayanka who simply shook her head am i your queen ataelus she asked ataelus looked back and forth between kineas and srayanka he had always made a point of his status as a massagetae not a sakje a visitor not a subject but he was thoroughly kineass man kineas had made him this too was scythian politics the day was hot but there was an edge of something on the wind and lightning flashed out over the desert kineas leaned forward to speak but srayanka put a hand on his shoulder to stay him ataelus made a mute appeal to kineas and getting no response he said yes really you are sakje she was relentless yes said ataelus srayanka flashed a smile at kineas as he has declared himself to us he is subject to our justice she nodded it would be bad manners to allow you to fight lots sisters son bring me this garait garait was brought forward his braids carefully plaited in his best tunic how many horses do you have garait srayanka asked i have twenty horses of my own he answered in sakje but his pride was audible to every person in the tent twenty was an excellent score for a man so young but of course he had had two years of war to collect them no ponies no horsesformeat twelve thessalians tall and strong four getae ponies fit for any work four of our own horses for riding srayanka nodded and what is dervas bride price garait shrugged i do not know he said srayanka looked at kineas you trust me to handle this she asked him in greek you do know the customs better than i kineas said i will speak to prince lot in the meantime she turned back to garait you are forbidden to be within twenty horselengths of her you may not speak to upazan nor accept or deliver a challenge in every case you will refer him to me yes lady garait nodded the equivalent of a deep bow among persians then she summoned leon who was suspiciously close by and also very clean and in his best tunic he looked as if he had a major bruise forming around his left eye his dark skin almost purple in the sun do you intend to wed mosva she asked the black man nodded gravely if shell have me he said arrange a bride price and pay it she said and be quick about it your flirtation is hurting us leon leon smiled im not usually slow to close a deal he said i had only thought to wait until the campaign was over listen numidian if i were to offer you advice id say this learn her bride price tonight make talk with lot ask obliquely buy the horses you need and picket them with his herd and steal mosva from her tent and put her in yours do it now leon bowed i live to serve you lady he said but srayanka looked troubled when they were gone kineas turned to diodorus this is what comes of too much time idle i want more patrols south towards alexander and east along our march route and a scout not ataelus hes hurt east looking for waterholes and fodder we need to move diodorus scratched under his beard a beard that was showing a surprising number of grey hairs you know that we bumped into some of alexanders scouts three days back down by the oxus kineas had heard as much in the last rush of feast preparations the encounter had been two days ride to the south not close enough to threaten his camp but close enough to get his attention i know get the scouts out most of our wounded are able to ride id like to be out of this camp in two days diodorus nodded cant be too soon diodorus and parshtaevalt organized a string of running patrols well to the south covering a crescent of possible approaches between the macedonians the persians and their camp with the help of lots sauromatae they had plenty of warriors to cover the patrols and the rotation helped relieve the punishing toll of ten thousand horses on the local grass as well as the boredom kineas and lot and srayanka had much to arrange before they could make the final push over the sogdian desert to join the scythian muster the next day diodorus and ataelus pushed the eastern patrols out farther clearing their route to their next fixed camp they needed grass and water and a path free of enemies it took a great deal of scouting on the second day after the feast kineas summoned the officers and clan leaders to council in the cool of the afternoon then he sat with leon calculating supplies and fodder and getting answers he did not like diodorus arrived in camp at midday well before he was expected he had a patrol of olbians his own troop with twenty ironfaced keltoi surrounding a group of dusty riders who appeared at first to be prisoners kineas began to approach and diodorus waved him off so kineas went to the shade of the felt awning projecting from the rear of srayankas wagon and poured himself a little wine he poured more for diodorus as he came in this will cut the dust kineas said im bringing trouble diodorus said did you see who i brought in upazan kineas said the very same riding south with a war party not in our scout rotation and frankly he needs a hiding hes a bully and hes bad for the discipline weve built among the sakje kineas shrugged bring him he sent samahe for srayanka she came with both children and sappho and they all took seats on the carpets of the tent by the time they were settled upazan was brought in he stood straight his face had the natural sullenness of the adolescent more out of place on an adult he wore a magnificent coat of bronze scales plated in gold and wore a golden boar atop his goldcovered bronze helmet kineas nodded i greet you upazan may i serve you wine i want no wine upazan said i want to ride free blood will flow for this insult kineas nodded and turned to leon send sitalkes for prince lot with my respectful wish that he will come and help me deal with upazan leon nodded and left turning to upazan kineas shrugged you spurn my courtesy so i will waste no more time on it you left camp without permission i am upazan of the sauromatae and i need no permission greek i may ride where i please raid where i please release me or there will be blood kineas sipped his own wine and then walked up close to the young man upazan was a fingerswidth taller but they were of a size kineas stepped in close whose blood yearling you cannot mean to threaten to bleed on me the roar of laughter did nothing to quench upazans temper even his own followers laughed srayanka handed lita to sappho and rose upazan it is agreed by all the people who follow kineas that they will accept his guidance on matters of war prince lot has accepted i have accepted upazan shook his head i have not accepted i have not seen any of his great skills he spat and smiled uncowed by kineass nearness i will fight you old man then perhaps i will take your horses i need horses to buy the love of a grass priestess she does not want you upazan srayanka said as lot pushed in under the canopy it is of little matter to me i will have her upazan raised his chin srayanka spoke slowly and clearly the woman you are speaking of is your mothers sisters daughter she is not for you she will go to be leons wife lot interrupted your time with the medes has made you forgetful of our ways boy no woman goes anywhere against her will lot gave a grim smile she might hurt you upazan looked around you are all against me very well he crossed his arms he had dignity for a man so young and with so much anger will you fight me foreigner leon shot to his feet i will fight you kineas handed his wine cup to leon this is a matter of discipline not of revenge he said to leon and then to upazan are you ready the stakes are that when i win you will swear to honour my orders if you win you will still follow my orders upazan spat if i win i will be king of the sakje he said kineas shook his head it doesnt work that way boy are you ready are you ready to be a widow upazan asked srayanka kineas laughed no one is going to die boy ready for the first time upazan hesitated a tiny crack in his facade ready he asked the time is now kineas took off his baldric and handed it to leon stripped his tunic over his head and stood naked upazan stepped back i have no weapons he said kineas grinned you challenged me among greeks and sakje that gives me the choice of weapons and i warned you boy that the next time you crossed me i would beat you like a child now are you ready upazan narrowed his eyes while the women tittered at kineass nudity samahe demanded that upazan strip too there are things mosva needs to know she called in a voice of brass this is not the fight i want upazan said this is the demeaning squabble of slaves kineas nodded it is not the fight you want i agree so you may apologize and retract your challenge or fight upazan looked around for counsel for the support of the men who had ridden with him a few of them had come up watched by the keltoi but their faces were carefully blank upazan opened his tunic and dropped it to the rugs he had thick cords of muscles even by greek standards he had a good physique he raised his arms i am ready he said upazan didnt lack courage and he was strong but he was a poor wrestler and he had never even seen boxing kineas had almost finished before philokles a late arrival finished his wine kineas took his time trying to teach the boy how powerless he was a life lesson the boy clearly needed he took a blow powerful but untrained on the muscle of his arm and then locked the sauromatae in a hold around his neck turned his body so that the younger man had no purchase and then hit him once with his fist on the temple upazan fell unconscious from his arms the sakje and the sauromatae joined in their applause and kineas was human enough to enjoy their praise while he strigilled with philokles help enjoying the clean smell of olive oil on his flesh srayanka watched him thoughtfully you are quite handsome she said with a halfsmile and the oil is strangely attractive her eyebrows drew together as she frowned but you would have done better to kill him kineas shrugged i cant kill him and keep the sauromatae as allies srayanka raised an eyebrow you cant keep them anyway my husband and now now he will be like a serpent she frowned her eyebrows a single line over her nose we had this conversation before i was right then and i am still right kineas shrugged sometimes you are like a greek wife he said philokles strigil found the bruise on his arm where upazan had landed a blow and he winced nihmu watched with illconcealed glee your mercy is wasted on him lord she said he has none for others all the more reason for the strategos to show some mercy to him philokles said the council gathered as the sun began to go down in the west the air was almost cool and the dust of the day had settled kineas had nicanor build a big fire in the clear ground behind srayankas wagon and he arranged as many stools as he could find the tribal leaders came in little knots gossiping about the feast and about upazan kineas noted that parshtaevalt came with ataelus and leon while lot stood apart with monae his wife upazan did not attend the olbian officers were all there kineas rose after nicanor had poured wine for them all he made a libation pouring the whole cup of good wine into the fire so that a cloud of fragrant steam rose around him in the dark i begin to sing of pallas athena the glorious goddess he said brighteyed inventive unbending of heart pure virgin saviour of cities courageous tritogeneia wise zeus himself bore her from his manful head already armed in bronze and gold and awe seized all the gods as they looked at her but athena stood before zeus who holds the aegis shaking a bright iron spear olympus shook at the warlike ardour of the bright grey eyes and the earth all around the mountain cried fearfully and the sea rolled and spat dark waves and foam in sudden torment until the maiden athena stripped the glorious bronze from her lovely shoulders and wise zeus was glad and so hail to you daughter of zeus who holds the aegis now we will remember you then he turned to his council it is time for us to go and fight alexander he said we are here to discuss who will go and how we will go were best off where we are lot said theres no grazing east of here and ive heard that the massagetae camp and all the scythians fill the vale of the jaxartes eating all the grass let us wait here until she summons us again we wouldnt even know if a battle took place srayanka shot back zarina and the jaxartes are ten days ride from here or more said ataelus were running out of grass already parshtaevalt said he had aged quickly during srayankas captivity and unlike upazan he had never had any interest in rulership beyond his own concept of duty already the herds are twenty stades from the camp he gave a bitter smile i send my daughters to fetch my mounts every morning srayanka nodded the grass is not of the best lot glanced at his wife we are thinking of leaving our young and old with a guard and sending them back to our summer pasture he said he sounded apologetic srayanka surprised her husband by agreeing immediately we should do the same we should transform ourselves into a great war host and not a movement of all the people the warriors left behind will be bitter parshtaevalt said they will miss the great battle srayanka shook her head let every warrior left behind be one who served at the ford of the river god she said and let them console themselves with remaining alive kineas approved but he leaned over to her and whispered so we leave our veterans and take only the young she shook her head we take our best and then leave a tithe of our best as guards it is the way those who stay behind are chosen by chance from those who are picked to go do you understand she looked at him gravely and if we are badly defeated the people will yet have an army of proven warriors kineas nodded a very good system yes i understand he smiled i understand that i have much to learn if i am to act as the king srayanka shrugged no more than any man she said or woman lot rubbed his beard i fear we cannot host you on our summer grazing he said i am sorry there is hard feeling because of the boy upazan despite his hot head has many friends but more we have many horses more than i can ever remember he rocked his head back and forth in selfmockery i must be a good prince srayanka looked at kineas kineas took a sip of wine it was almost gone and nodded i think our own people should start west kineas said there was murmuring from all around the fire srayanka looked surprised now she asked kineas nodded now if they go soon and stay on the move theyll have no fodder problem three months will see them at the fort on the rha messengers can tell crax to buy grain against the winter and the high plains will have abundant grass in the spring he looked at lot i think we should travel separately not because of your foolish nephew but because thats the way weve crossed the bad ground to get here i want to talk about the route lot nodded kineas went on as i see it there are two routes and two sets of risk if we go straight east we cross the desert and crossing in midsummer will be very different from crossing in spring together we have ten thousand horses perhaps after we send our people to their winter grass well have four thousand horses he shrugged thats a lot of water all around the fire men and women nodded picturing the desert crossing if we ride south for two days well be back at the forks of the polytimeros as i understand it we can follow the polytimeros into the valley of marakanda and then go north through the sogdian gap to the jaxartes and never spend a night without water there is alexander diodorus said both routes have risk kineas said alexander will have outposts on the polytimeros the closer we go to marakanda the more dangerous it will be but if we move like sakje we could be with queen zarina and the massagetae in a fortnight if alexander catches us in the valley of the polytimeros well be in a lot of trouble we scout carefully and move fast kineas looked around weve left it late friends if we are agreed that were going to zarina that well help her stop alexander this summer then we must go now and we must go fast people were nodding kineas continued i have one more argument to make theres no point in riding to the jaxartes only to arrive on blown horses who need a month on the grass to fight the desert is certain we will take losses the polytimeros requires that athena and tyche smile on us lot rose to his feet you are persuasive he said and i will follow you in battle but in this thing i must go my own way the desert is the surest way beasts will die but unless were unlucky no man or woman will die the sauromatae will cross the desert srayanka rose in turn the sakje will ride the polytimeros if the olbians will go that way diodorus looked at kineas do i actually get a vote kineas nodded diodorus scratched at his beard if we have to fight id rather fight in the condition were in right now im with kineas i think we can brush the macedonian outposts aside and move three hundred stades a day unless they have a force prepared well be past their outposts before they can catch us kineas looked around he saw no outrage and sensed that enough had been said then let us divide those who will go to zarina from those who will go to the winter grass say your farewells because i mean us to ride the day after tomorrow to diodorus and philokles kineas made another argument ladling mutton stew at the mess fire later that night were going to the muster of the scythians kineas said our greek cavalry will be out of place and in action they might be mistaken for foes nihmu not a member of their mess and not an invited guest plopped down with her riding blanket smelling of honeysuckle and horse sweat and neatly intercepted the bowl of stew thanks strategos she said i dreamed you were to cook and so i came kineas glared at her and the other men laughed philokles laughed with the others mopping the bottom of his wooden bowl with flatbread after he laughed he looked thoughtful his blond beard seeming alive in the firelight nihmu put her back against his while she ate diodorus shook his head they dont look like the boys who rode out of olbia kineas look at them on parade in the morning youre not the only man in sakje armour we have greek helmets so do most of the sakje eh hard to find a man who doesnt have a grass wife to sew for him leather tunics on most and some in barbarian leggings they still look greek to me philokles said he raised his bowl to kineas good mutton he said on his grave stele we can put kineas strategos and cook diodorus laughed even the keltoi kineas asked trying to get back to the subject at hand hed meant it as a joke but it made the other two thoughtful no philokles said no the keltoi dont look greek it is a way of sitting or perhaps it is the tattoos diodorus gave a wry smile and held out his bowl for more i long to see your carlus recline at a symposium hah hed break the couch kineas smiled i suggest we send the olbians back to hyrkania under eumenes with orders to take command from lycurgus and heron or and here he found that his voice faltered or under one of you diodorus narrowed his eyes making him look even more like a fox than usual this is your revenge for all my carping no i wont miss the battle kineas shook his head there may not be a battle philokles shook his head in turn where you go i go if only to keep you from your wifes foolish superstitions he strained to see nihmu and yours eumenes kineas looked at them hell obey diodorus said it will depend on what course urvara takes philokles said he loves her kineas realized that as usual philokles was awake to signs that he kineas should have noted of course he said and thats why he and leon are friends now he laughed diodorus rubbed his beard i suspect the barbarian lottery is less fair than it appears he said shall i fix it kineas nodded excellent idea but let srayanka do it diodorus nodded let srayanka do what she asked walking out of the darkness and into the firelight kineas pointed at philokles he says eumenes and urvara are together srayanka pretended to inspect philokles empty bowl by firelight not too foul may i have some of this mutton she held out her bowl to her husband then she said they are not together yet she grinned kineas handed her a full bowl from the bronze kettle at his feet it was wearing out the two cast gryphons that held the buckets bail needed new rivets and if his cauldron needed a bronze smithy then every cauldron in the army was in the same shape one of thousands of things they needed his eyes met hers and they shared something about food and cooking quartersmiles that agreed that there was nothing remarkable about a wife returning from setting night patrols to be fed by her husband the general the children surprisingly asleep kineas said they were so quiet i had to look at them twice to be sure all was well srayanka walked away with her mutton heading for the wagon to see for herself so were settled kineas said we send some olbians home as insurance for the sakje the keltoi and the mercenaries and any volunteers from the former hoplites may stay under diodorus and andronicus the men who stay get the pick of the horses and are to do their best to trade for barbarian armour philokles raised an eyebrow what of temerix kineas winced easy man to forget when hes not in combat i assume hell come with us to the east diodorus nodded he pursed his lips and then said all of those sindi can ride like centaurs lets get them all decent horses we have the stock not much use for psiloi out on the plains kineas ate his own mutton and drank an infusion of herbs in water rather than wine which was in short supply philokles chewed bread and diodorus looked at the stars until srayanka returned nihmu sang a little song to herself and then fell asleep her head in philokles lap they are fine srayanka said returning wed like to mount the sindi on sakje remounts kineas said srayanka nodded how many two per man she asked at least diodorus answered like all the greek officers diodorus had become addicted to the sakje system of having three or four remounts for every rider it made the army virtually tireless two hundred horses i have as many she said and more i will ask certain sakje to give a horse many have been served by the dirt people and this should be a reward diodorus nodded thank you srayanka they deserve it he sat back since niceas died temerix has not received the consideration due him im trying to fill the gap im embarrassed to be so reminded kineas said and the twins woke with one voice and all conversation was at an end craterus is at the forks of the polytimeros coenus reported the sun was rising on a new day and kineas was already hot and sticky he wore only his tunic pulled on hastily when he heard that there was a scout coming in coenus was covered in dust his usual foppishness ruined his face a comic mask where runnels of sweat had carved lines across the coating of greybrown grit he had insisted on leading a patrol because he was he felt out of practice kineas sent nicanor for all the leaders you saw him in person coenus gave a dusty grin hes not somebody you soon forget a thousand cavalry perhaps some mounted infantry as well i didnt stay to scout the whole column mosva had just come in with another sauromatae girl to tell us that spitamenes was moving north they found his camp and the next thing i knew my outriders were shooting arrows at his outriders he came up in person while i was still trying to guess their numbers kineas rubbed his beard hell block our way diodorus came running up with philokles and eumenes close behind hell be in among our wagons in a day what the hell is he doing here coenus shook his head hes fast but ill wager a daric to an owl that hes after spitamenes trying to cut him off from the sea of grass diodorus started buckling his cuirass you are ready to command armies coenus the problem is that he must have taken your scouts for spitamenes kineas found that nicanor was bringing him his armour he stuck his arms up while nicanor lowered the linen and scale cuirass over his head as soon as the shoulder flaps were fastened to the breastplate he started drawing lines in the dust if you were craterus in pursuit of spitamenes he said id have wine coenus said hefting an empty amphora nicanor brought him a towel and a clay bottle of water nicanor enjoyed serving coenus because coenus had the kind of standards that nicanor liked to live up to unlike kineas who didnt feel the need to dress to athenian fashion in the midst of the sea of grass he wiped the dust from his face and started to towel his hair if i were craterus id break off and go home if i hit resistance on the oxus i would think that spitamenes was ahead of me or id press the pursuit hoping to hurt his rearguard diodorus said lets face it thats more like craterus hes a terrier once he gets his jaws on something he never lets go when have you ever known him not to press a pursuit until his horse fell you all know this macedonian philokles asked hes older now kineas said by way of an answer alexanders left fist we used to call him he doesnt have parmenion to hold his hand either diodorus shot back so it could go either way he could turn back or he could be on us in what four hours kineas looked at coenus ataelus came in his bow arm still bound in a sling the wound had infected and bled pus constantly ataelus looked like a man with a fever and he walked unsteadily youre not fit to ride ataelus get back to your pallet and your wife kineas saw samahe behind her husband take him away alexander is coming and you for sending me to bed ataelus stumbled and caught himself on the tents central pole need scouts need for seeing over hills prodromoi go ataelus struck his chest samahe go ataelus go coenus who had always got on well with the scythian shook his head we did do a certain amount of scouting before you came on the scene brother ataelus grinned no little cut for keeping me from this alexander comes coenus cleaner now tossed his towel to nicanor its not alexander ataelus its just craterus we can handle him without you diodorus was looking at kineass marks in the dust wheres spitamenes he asked ares lets not make that mistake again kineas said diodorus picked up a stick he threw a glance at ataelus who stood by his shoulder to correct him if he went wrong i think i understand lets say this anthill is marakanda lets say this line is the polytimeros and this is the oxus diodorus drew a line from the anthill that represented marakanda and then a second at right angles to represent the oxus if alexander has raised the siege at marakanda thats my guess then craterus is pursuing spitamenes west right at us diodorus moved the stick along the line of the polytimeros and stopped at the oxus the cross of the t if spitamenes went straight across hed vanish into the sea of grass south of us but not by much if the girls saw the camp right the persians are west and south of us he drew another line if craterus is at the forks of the polytimeros he went on stick pointing at the place where the polytimeros met the oxus then were three points in an equilateral triangle were at this end of the t spitamenes at the other end of the crossbar and craterus down here on the base and if spitamenes chooses to try to link up with queen zarina he continued his line hell go right through here following the crossbar with craterus right behind him and he cant miss us coenus said and if craterus mistook our sakje for spitamenes sogdians hes already on his way and then hes between spitamenes and us srayanka rubbed the bridge of her nose we have to fight lot came in flanked by two of his knights alexander is here he asked he may be less than a days march away kineas recapitulated the crisis it is alexanders general craterus the king himself is at marakanda kineas shrugged or so we think our people must march north lot said most of us are packed the wagons of the sakje will slow us without them many will die this winter srayanka shot back kineas looked around catching their eyes get the prodromoi out well make a stand here perhaps even try a little negotiation diodorus raised a red eyebrow but then he hurried out philokles stood by which one would you negotiate with he asked kineas shook his head staring at his map in the dust alexander is the enemy we came to fight he said spitamenes sold srayanka to macedon philokles stroked his beard im tired of war he said neither of them seems so very bad to me alexander is a tyrant but a hellene spitamenes is a mede but a patriot he shrugged who is the enemy kineas looked at his map craterus will be here first if hes coming he said if we held him and sent a messenger to spitamenes we could defeat him here kineas looked around philokles waved a hand dismissively do we need to fight kineas nodded the wagons will roll in two hours he said we need to hold here at least until darkness or we could have crateruss outriders in among the columns scythians travelled the sea of grass in two or three parallel columns of wagons with the herds penned between them and watched by a vanguard and a rearguard of young riders the columns raised so much dust on the summer plains that they could be seen for fifteen stades and the rearguard was often blind owing to the dust raised hell push his men after the columns of dust coenus added may i speak frankly friend kineas was surprised by his tone of course coenus finished his water do you really want to ambush craterus to what purpose philokles nodded as if in agreement but after a pause of shocked silence he said for the liberation of greece he stood up like an orator any defeat alexander suffers weakens his choke hold on greece if he is beaten out here all the states of greece will rise up and be free sparta athens megara coenus laughed dont you believe it philokles theyll find a way to fuck it up trust me theyll fight among themselves he shook his head sadly im not much interested in liberating greece im a gentleman of olbia now srayanka licked her lips and then smiled we should defeat alexander because he is dangerous she said because he is like a wild dog and if he is not killed he will savage our flocks craterus is the enemy spitamenes is a possible ally otherwise just an interruption spitamenes poses no threat to olbia kineas looked around and got nods of agreement glad thats settled kineas said he was armoured so were most of the men he could see lets move the columns rolled off before the sun crested the sky the sauromatae led the way although lot and his best warriors were left behind with kineass force holding the high ground just west of the oxus the sauromatae held the right of the line hidden in a fold of ground behind a low ridge that ran parallel to the track of the trade road kineas placed the trained greek horse in the centre under diodorus with the olbians on the right under eumenes and antigonus and the keltoi on the left under coenus and andronicus on the right srayanka led the sakje with parshtaevalt and urvara kineas kept a reserve of mixed sakje and greek cavalry men and women who had trained together for a month under his own command in the rear the total force was a little less than eight hundred because more than a third of their strength was guarding the columns and herding the animals darius was off to find spitamenes and if he could persuade the partisan to alliance or at least tolerance over srayankas objections ataelus and his prodromoi with coenus and his picked men were out in the trough of the oxus valley and farther south and east it was noon before the battlefield was prepared and all the men in place kineas sat atop the ridge with leon philokles diodorus and a handful of sakje maidens as messengers there was no shade and the sun painted them in fire not a breath of wind stirred the dust anywhere that the casual exercise of riding caused bare skin to contact armour all too common left a line of pain kineas used his cloak to cover his armour and then sweltered in the gritty heat of a wool cloak his mouth was so full of dust that even after he rinsed and spat his molars ground together as if he was chewing pottery leon watched the wooded ground in the valley with all the stress of a lover worried for his friend which he was mosva was down there with ataelus instead of back behind the ridge with her father an hour passed and then a second hour a third hour a fourth hour the sun was sinking appreciably the day was cooler the horses were restless eager for the water they could smell in the bed of the oxus signalling their displeasure with shrill calls and a great deal of stomping and reinchewing kineas watched it all in an agony of indecision and doubt if i water the horses and he comes if spitamenes refuses to cooperate if spitamenes comes first if craterus comes from the east on this side of the oxus if the horses require water now now now where is he where is he where is craterus they saw the dust cloud before they got a report the cloud looked to be forty stades distant or more but distances could be misleading on the plains while all his friends debated its meaning samahe rode in the cloud towering over her shoulder like a thunderhead her red leather tunic was almost brown with dust but her chain of gold plaques glinted in the sun craterus comes she said for killing one enemy i shot she mimed her draw and release ataelus for saying ride and tell kineas he comes and ataelus say word say iskander deploys she pointed and for dirteating sogdii fight for iskander fight for spitamenes same kineas leaned forward samahe are you sure these are crateruss men not spitamenes sogdae greek men in bronze with cloaks like yours she said nodding she pointed kineas looked around time for the army to water their horses he asked easy she answered hour maybe more kineas nodded water the horses he said craterus is on to us we have about half an hour bring the whole army down give the beasts a good drink and then straight back to your places push the prodromoi right across to cover the watering tell eumenes to have a section ready to reinforce the picket line at need and he watched in agony waiting for the macedonians to come and crash into his horses as they drank no macedonians appeared but there was someone out in the tamarisk scrub on the far side of the oxus and there was more and more dust above the flood line and glints of colour flashes of steel movement after half an hour ataeluss prodromoi were under constant if inaccurate arrow fire from the high ground of the opposite spring bank nihmu came back walking her royal stallion which was calling loudly in pain with an arrow in his withers nihmu was bleeding from her shoulder she was pale but she came up to kineas ataelus asks that you send him some force we are hardpressed kineas nodded get that wound looked after he said the girl was at most thirteen years old to kineas too young to be in battle but as he watched she was taking the arrow out of her horses rump crooning to the beast while she used a tiny knife to slip the barbed head free he never kicked when she was done the work of a moment she vaulted into the saddle ride down to the river and tell eumenes to take his sortie across kineas said the watering was taking too long and sending olbians to clear the sogdae would only slow it further eumenes took almost half his troop across the oxus kineas watched them trot across at the main ford and turn south in the tamarisk scrub in the valley spreading out in a skirmish line every man had his javelin in his fist ready to throw they swept south and east and suddenly there was a swirl of dust and a keening yell and kineass guts clenched there were sogdae riding out of the brush at least forty of them he couldnt hear eumenes and he couldnt see what was happening and his imagination was worse than the reality as the dust swirled and thickened he clenched his reins and worried riding back and forth on his ridge he watched the people watering their horses and tried to urge them to go faster to cut through the crowds on the riverbank to get back in battle order eumenes can handle a fight with barbarians philokles said not if hes badly outnumbered kineas shook his head athena be with us in our hour of need kineas turned to diodorus should we send him reinforcements diodorus shook his head lets wait for his report ares im getting sick of this just when kineas was preparing to order diodorus into the scrub eumenes returned riding across the ford with six empty saddles he was injured blood all down one booted leg and his face was pinched with anger and pain the scrub is full of them he said hundreds of them sogdians i think i dont know whether theyre crateruss or spitamenes who in hades can tell he shook his head we rode into an ambush im sorry it is my fault kineas watched samahe says theyre from craterus the sakje their mounts watered were already clearing the oxus and returning to their positions the olbians were slower and the heavily armoured sauromatae were used to having maiden archers to do this sort of thing while they baked like ovens they were slow kineas cursed the bad luck of it all and the loss of the remounts and manpower that the horse herds and the wagon columns had taken then he reached out and clasped eumenes hand in war we lose men we carry the responsibility in his head his words sounded unbearably pompous you did the job i sent you to do did you hurt them eumenes shook his head at the edge of a sob i walked into the ambush he said they were waiting in the scrub i should know better sullenly he said i hurt them i pushed them out of the scrub and back up the bank but theyll be back he looked across the river where the dust of the skirmish hung in the still air and wiped his brow hed lost the brow band that held his hair philokles reached into his shoulder pack and produced another let me tie your hair lad he said kindly eumenes continued to slouch looking at the ground in misery i should have done better he said again kineas rubbed his chin sit straight and suck it up he said stung eumenes sat straight thats better kineas said he nodded let philokles look at your wound and then back to your troop and get the rest of the horses watered mourn the dead later help me win this thing now eumenes saluted he dismounted and let philokles tie his hair and look at the cut on his thigh before he could ride away srayanka rode up let me send parshtaevalt she said we need to clear it before the fucking sogdae make attacks on our sauromatae kineas started to refuse then he looked at philokles and diodorus i dislike breaking up my force he said eumenes pulled his helmet off his face red with exertion he spoke cautiously conscious of his defeat i took casualties trying to rattle them he said i think that he hesitated and then drove on i think srayanka is right diodorus nodded it wouldnt take many of their arrows falling on the sauromatae to cause trouble he said theres something going on with them that i dont like kineas waited another moment thoughts racing like a galloping horse and then exhaled go kineas said to srayanka she turned and waved to parshtaevalt who raised his bow and pointed one end of it at certain horsemen and they were away a hundred riders vanishing into the tamarisk scrub in the oxus valley they seemed to ride impossibly fast for the broken ground passing through ataeluss prodromoi in their picket line samahe visible in her red and gold raised her bow in salute as the sakje rode by and parshtaevalt whooped a flight of birds burst from the foliage on the far side of the river and then ten sakje were up the bank they were hunkered down on their horses necks and they were fast flowing over the ground more like running cats than men and women on horses what if the scrub was full of sogdae where was craterus was he already scouting another ford on the oxus indecision or to call the cat by its true name fear moved through kineass guts like the flux sweat from his helmet dripped down his brow and then down his face like tears and he could smell the dirt on his chinstrap which stank like old cheese he prayed for wind he prayed that he had guessed well he peered into the gathering dust the light was going as the afternoon grew old a chorus of thin shouts on the afternoon breeze and riders swept out of the farthest foliage two stades away across the muddy river firing as they came ripping shots at the sakje who turned and fled as if their horses had neither momentum nor bones they fled like a school of aegean fish before the onrush of a predator a porpoise or a shark the leaders of the sogdae pressed the handful of sakje hard and one man mounted on a big roan rode flat out for parshtaevalt visible because his horse harness was studded with gold the sakje chief turned his body an impossible threequarters rotation and shot straight back over the rump of his horse into his pursuer catching him in the belly and robbing him of life parshtaevalt then slowed his horse and caught the dead mans reins shouting his war cry he brandished his bow while a dozen sogdians bore down on him and another handful shot at him he grinned waved his bow and rode off again shrieking his war cry so that it rang off the sides of the oxus valley while arrows fell around him and all the ridges rang with cheers the sogdians angry now pounded after the handful of sakje more and more riders emerging from the brush to avenge their fallen warrior they were close on the tails of the scythian horses when the other seventy sakje appeared out of the river bed and fired a single volley of arrows and charged home under their own lethal rain emptying a dozen saddles in as many heartbeats shattered the sogdians broke and ran the sakje pursued them hard right up the bank and dust rose around them as their hooves pounded the dry earth after a few breaths they came back whooping and waving their bows and spears parshtaevalt rode back to where hed dropped his man and heedless of the stray shafts of the remaining sogdians slipped from his horse and cut the hair and neck skin from his downed enemy before leaping on to his pony he collected his riders with a wave and then they were back among the officers in the river bed parshtaevalts hands were bloody to the elbow and rivulets of blood had run all the way down his torso where he had raised his arms in the air to show his trophies too long have i been the nursemaid he said in his excellent greek aiyeee srayanka kissed him and most of the rest of the sakje pressed forward to touch him kineas was grinning was that achilles he asked philokles met his grin with one of his own i have seldom seen anything so beautiful philokles said he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand praise to ares that i was allowed to see so brave an act ah he sang ares exceeding in strength chariotrider goldenhelmed doughty in heart shieldbearer saviour of cities harnessed in bronze strong of arm unwearying mighty with the spear o defence of olympus father of warlike victory ally of themis stern governor of the rebellious leader of righteous men sceptred king of manliness who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven hear me helper of men giver of dauntless youth shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life and strength of war that i may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul restrain also the keen fury of my heart which provokes me to tread the ways of bloodcurdling strife rather o blessed one give me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of peace avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death the greeks took it up and the olbians had good voices they sang roaring the lines as if every man of them was a champion and the sound carried over the cropped dry grass and the sand to the sogdae who were gathered on their bank no longer willing to push down into the flood plain and the tamarisk scrub just visible in the rising column of dust and sand from the fight their horses were fidgeting and calling for water when the song was done the greek horse gathered their mounts and dragged them from the water and up the bank to their ridge concealment was now purposeless but kineas sent them back over the ridge anyway easier than giving them new positions and some shade to protect them the shadows were long but the sun still had power out on the plains the sauromatae were still watering their horses kineas rode over in time to hear lot cursing at some men who were still in the stream one of them waved his golden helmet and all fifteen of the men in the stream mounted the man in the golden helmet turned his horse in a spray of water he had his horse at the gallop in just a few strides and he rode straight for mosva who was watering her fathers horse she looked up and grinned clearly thinking it a game she called something and she died with that smile on her face as upazan cut her head from her body in one swing of his longhandled axe then he turned and rode at lot now fight me you old coward he crowed riding at the prince leon at kineass side put his head down and pressed his heels to his mount he had a small mare with a deep chest and a small head a pretty horse that leon doted on she fairly flew across the water her hooves appearing to skim the surface too late to save mosva leon rode in upazan his whole charge aimed at lot pushed for his target and ignored the numidian but the smaller mare rammed the bigger sauromatae gelding in the rump forcing the horse to stumble and sidestep almost throwing his rider upazan took a cut at leon with the axe leons mare danced back and the axe missed and leons spear licked out pricking upazan in the side kineas still stunned to see two of his own men fighting had time to be reminded of nicomedes fastidious fighting style the numidian used his mare to avoid every cut and he landed two more blows that drew blood upazans companions were milling in confusion and then one of them left the others and rode at leon lot was frozen in disbelief bastard he called pressing forward another of upazans men drew a bow and shot the arrow passed between philokles and kineas a second arrow rattled off lots armour upazan stood up knees clenched on the barrel of his horse and leaned out whirling his axe on the wrist thong for more reach it caught leon on the bullshide shield he wore strapped to his left shoulder in the sakje manner and skidded up ringing off the numidians helmet at the same moment leons spear licked out again this time passing under the bronze brow of the sauromataes heavy helm and entering the mans face blood flowered from under his helmet and upazan folded leon fell into the river and philokles and kineas raced to reach him while upazans friends dragged him free of his horse and bolted for the far side of the stream arsecunts bellowed philokles struggling with his horse and trying to get an arm under leon traitors lot was still cursing the ranks of the sauromatae were moving like a corpse full of maggots i must calm my people he said his voice was dull he looked like a man who had taken a wound his daughters headless corpse lay at the far edge of the river and the water was a sickly redbrown where her blood mingled with the silt several of ataeluss scouts surrounded her others rushed to surround leon philokles and eumenes supported leon out of the water kineas laid him on the bank and cut his chinstrap the base of his skull showed blood and his neck was cut so deep that the cords of his neck muscles could be seen there was blood everywhere he killed her didnt he leon asked in a dull voice philokles was off his horse and there concussion he said give him to me you command your army kineas handed over that responsibility with thanks and remounted he swept his horse in a circle another ugly feeling in his gut upazans companions had crossed the river straight south and then ridden east along the water the sakje confused had not loosed an arrow even the prodromoi let them go two stades away to the south and east a man in a dustcoloured cloak with wide purple bands at the edges reined in at the far edge of the oxus behind him was a dense column of purpleblue cloaks and dirty brown cloaks macedonian cavalry and a handful of royal hetairoi trumpets sounded and the blond man waved a dozen troopers forward to intercept upazans friends and then the dust cloud of the column settled over everything kineas turned to diodorus that is what we call a bad omen he said he couldnt take his eyes off the blood in the water when he did all he could see were the sauromatae trickling back over the ridge diodorus made a sign of aversion if spitamenes comes now and decides to take our side he said kineas rode back up the face of the ridge that concealed his cavalry he stopped at the top the sauromatae were spread in groups over several stades of the rough ground and all could be seen to be arguing kineas rode down into the valley beyond looking for lot when he found him in the middle of a dozen furious warriors he rode straight in will you hold kineas asked or do i have to retreat stung lot drew himself up well hold he said kineas looked around at the sauromatae warriors who met his gaze steadily kineas pointed up the hill with his sword two summers we have covered each others backs he said no boy no kinslayer is going to rob us of victory grunts and nods wait for my signal kineas said and rode back up the ridge to diodorus feeling far less confidence than he had just expressed were fucked kineas said showing diodorus what he saw if even a third of them decide to support upazan and attack the rest craterus can cross at will diodorus nodded ares throbbing cock he said bitterly we have him craterus is too late to push us and were already outfighting his sogdae look at them diodorus pointed at the far bank the sullen unwillingness of the sogdae troopers there was conveyed through posture and movement but to a pair of cavalrymen it was like a shout kineas waved for srayanka and cantered down over the ridge invisible from crateruss position once out of sight he began to use his hands see that he shouted at srayanka as she rode up she pulled off her helmet and her black braids fell free from their coils see it husband my eyes have seen nothing else for an hour was that mosva she asked yes kineas spat in disgust im betting that they hold but i want you to be ready to cover our retreat if craterus wants to cross i intend to make him pay he hesitated for a moment i may even attack him he pointed across if we leave him here thats the end of our dream of moving on the polytimeros she nodded kineas turned to ataelus who had just brought the prodromoi back across the oxus and was now awaiting orders go north behind srayanka and then back into the scrub cover my left flank ataelus was pale his shoulder and arm stiff with bandages but his eyes gleamed sure he said he turned his horse and waved his whip and the prodromoi all on fresh horses trotted north kineas pointed over his shoulder our wagons are only an hours steady ride north he said a silly thing to say as she would know as well as he we have to fight he kissed her and rode back to the olbians in the centre what the fuck is going on with the boilerovens eumenes asked pointing at the sauromatae and giving them the greek name for fully armoured men upazan made a stab at being king kineas said he killed mosva and probably intended to kill lot as well he loved her eumenes said he swallowed i was quite fond his attempt to remain laconic failed and he sobbed kineas gave him a hug not where the troops can see you my boy he said hiding the younger man with his cloak choke on it there are you ready yes eumenes said he took a deep breath dont let urvara see you sobbing for that girl diodorus said kineas glared at him diodorus kineas said i seem to remember he began and diodorus gave him a rueful smile i remember too he said together they rode back over the crest of the ridge a handful of crateruss sogdians were crossing the oxus in a spray of water well to the west too far west to threaten us very soon kineas said diodorus unslung a water skin mmm he said muddy and warm faint smell of goat too he grinned appreciatively by now craterus has heard we have problems from that dickless arsecunt upazan so hes going to put pressure on the weakness and then come right across into our faces he smiled of course by now he sees all the dust lot is raising he has no real idea of how many we are and he still doesnt know where spitamenes is he pulled off his helmet and hung it on his sword hilt even the dog will take his time since were not spitamenes he probably doesnt need to fight diodorus looked up and down but knowing craterus he hasnt figured out that were not his prey and hes ignoring the fact that his sogdians are already afraid of us kineas nodded and he hasnt watered his horses he said diodorus scratched his chin have to admit i thought you were mad to try it but it surely does give us an edge now kineas sat still thalassa stood between his knees back unmoving head up as if it were a cool spring morning and she was eager for a run hed never had such a horse he patted her neck affectionately have the hyperetes sound advance by squadrons he said were attacking diodorus asked were looking confident the afternoon is bleeding away and we need nightfall kineas pointed with his sakje whip look its the farm boy they had all had an affectionate nickname for the man a royal macedonian bastard named ptolemy unlike craterus the dog whod been hated and feared the farm boy had many friends commanding companions no hes with the sogdians kineas said poor bastard behind kineas andronicus blew the trumpet call the olbian squadrons surged forward across the ridge their line was neat and the afternoon sun turned the bronze of their armour to fire sound halt lets see what they do kineas watched a minute later and there were messengers flying among the macedonians on the other side of the river they only have what eight hundred horse kineas asked eumenes was looking up and down twice that surely diodorus laughed youth is wasted on the young he said kineas is right and half of them are sogdians kineas looked up and down the riverbank a stade from the river on both sides the ground was like desert with sunscorched grass and gravel but the valley itself was two stades wide and it was green sometimes marshy sometimes meadows of grass with stands of tamarisk and rose brush on the far side there were two distinct groups of sogdian cavalry and on kineass far left a pair of tightknit squadrons of macedonian professionals the whole line moved because the enemy horses were restless they were moving so much that they were raising a new dust cloud making it hard to see them im going to go for him kineas said suddenly decisive he felt better immediately his guts settling he saw it weve little to gain sitting in the sun his horses are tired and mine arent if we get beaten we retire into the sunset hes a thousand stades from his camp sound good to you diodorus responded by taking his helmet which hung by the chinstrap from his sword hilt and putting it on he was smiling as he tied his chinstrap kineas looked around for a messenger his eyes fixed on leon who had blood on the white leather of his corslet and a heavy bandage under his widebrimmed boeotian helmet leon ride all the way to ataelus you listening lad you fit the numidian nodded fiercely all the way to ataelus tell him to get across and harass the far left of the enemy line understand say it back leon pulled off his helmet to listen better all the way to ataelus harass the enemy left flank go said kineas he looked around for another messenger he found hama the chieftain of the keltoi hama go to srayanka and tell her to move forward into bow range and start plucking at the macedonian cavalry those right there see hama nodded tell her to support ataelus on her left you understand hama nodded and gave the smile of a man whod captained a few fights tell your wife to harass the horsemen in front and help ataelus turn their flank he said youve got it go said kineas he rode over the ridge and waved his arm at the sauromatae until lot noticed him then he waved towards the eastern bank lot waved back kineas rode back to the top of his ridge took one more look at the macedonian positions and pulled his cheek plates down ready he called slow and steady over the rough ground keep your line and look tough and the sogdians will vanish be ready to wheel left by squadron im going to get us up the bank and turn north into the flank of their real cavalry got it he looked back over his shoulder and the sauromatae were moving lots helmet gleaming as the sauromatae started down the tail of the ridge on kineass right water flashed under the hooves of the lead horses on the far bank the rightmost sogdian group began to mill in confusion sound advance kineas yelled the olbian line moved forward at a walk picked their way down the spring riverbank slipping and sliding on the sand and then reformed neatly on the broad meadow in the river valley kineas took the point of the leftmost olbian rhomboid with carlus and diodorus behind him as soon as they entered the green valley kineas lost his lofty view of the battlefield he gripped his first javelin and rolled his hips as thalassa felt her way across the rough meadow avoiding the clumps of scrub the olbians old hands at rough riding flowed around the scrub and reformed automatically without orders ready kineas called they had the green valley to themselves the sogdians werent coming down off the spring bank they came to the river itself and thalassa splashed across the spray from her hooves felt good he gathered his reins straight up the bank spread out go up that bank as fast as you can he waved his arms spread out double intervals no trumpet call for that but he was obeyed and the other two troops followed suit a stand of tamarisk hid the sauromatae too late to worry trot he put the knees to his horse and wound the throwing strap on his his first javelin antigonus sounded the call and they started up the slope thalassa was up in two bounds and arrows flew by him one hit his helmet he leaned forward and she was up hindquarters surging and he pressed his heels into her sides rose higher in his seat and roared charge a single enemy rider met him his back was to kineas and he was bellowing at the sogdians to stand stand fast the man was an officer with a white sash around some bactrian garment worn over his breastplate he had a shawl over his head but kineas knew him the farm boy kineas grinned and swung his heavy lonche javelin like a twohanded axe blindsiding him and knocking the macedonian from his saddle then he shouted at his hyperetes already reining his mount rally he called and the trumpet rang out kineas nodded at antigonus as troopers fell in behind stay together he ordered lets go the trumpet sounded again somewhere in the dust ataelus would hear it and so would lot and srayanka kineas headed into the cloud following the fleeing enemy the greybrown cloud was suddenly full of horsemen kineas was shocked to see how many bactrians he thought from the heads of the horses and the colourful saddle cloths and then he was on them they didnt stand seemed confused unaware until the last seconds that they were in danger kineas didnt trouble to throw his javelin but simply unhorsed men to the left and the right with the haft behind him the broadening point of the rhomboid blew through their line and it unravelled like a motheaten garment men and horses boiled away from kineas and his escort to vanish underfoot or away into the dust rally rally kineas called and again the trumpet call rang out change face left kineas called to antigonus the gaul raised the trumpet and the call rang out kineas couldnt see past the next two files because now the sand and dust moved like a heavy fog full of spirits but he pivoted his own horse and went from being the point of the formation to being its rightmost flank trust your men if the manoeuvre had been carried out his rhomboid now faced directly along the macedonian flank in the dust he couldnt see anything charge kineas called antigonus sounded the trumpet the formation moved gathering speed and kineas began to encounter opponents confused men whirling their horses in the battle haze the path of the charge and the enemy formation or lack thereof left kineas and his flank without opposition they rode slowly maintaining contact with the centre of the formation which was doing all the fighting samahe knew exactly where to find him reading his mind as neatly as a shaman probably riding to the trumpet sound heh kineas she called as she came out of the dust kineas called out samahe on me for fucking like gods ataelus grin was so wide that it split his round face in two as he cantered out of the dust behind his wife hah i own them all he waved his uninjured arm i ride all the way around their flank craterus is for retreat yes kineas had to grin at that im going to the north he shouted ataelus shouted yes and rode back into the dust halt kineas called to antigonus and waited while the trumpet sang face to the right kineas said and again the trumpets brazen voice carried above the dust he couldnt hear very well and he couldnt see ten horselengths he had only his last glance at the battlefield and his guess to go by he was again the point of the rhomboid if there was a formation at all trot he called putting his knees to thalassa she was calm as ever and she carried him easily he put a knee in the middle of her back and sat up for a moment but could see nothing and almost lost his seat as she flowed over an obstruction when he felt that enough time had passed he began to angle towards the west leading the formation if he had any formation into a gradual wheel along the river but a stade north sweeping for the macedonian cavalry the dust began to clear in as many strides of his horse he could see his hands on the reins see a clump of grass in his path and then he was clear and could see the dust cloud and the squadron of sogdian horse waiting with obvious indecision just clear of the rising column of dust the dust of the battle haze was so thick that it rose into the air as if the grass itself were afire kineas unwrapped the sweat scarf from his throat where he wore it to keep his cuirass from chaffing against his neck and wrapped it again sweat stinging his face around his mouth he kept angling west he looked back the rhomboid was still there carlus and antigonus and diodorus emerged from the wall of sand behind him and then hama dercorix and tasda and behind them four more the spacings were far from perfect and there seemed to be a whole wing missing perhaps ten men but after two blind facings and a charge it was like a miracle the other two troops were nowhere to be seen the sogdians to their left front had only just seen them they were moving the subtle movement of men and horse like a wind through tall grass that betokens indecision and fear kineas whirled keeping his seat straight through them he yelled his men gave a weary shout they gathered speed out of the dust to their left a single rider on a black horse emerged like a dark thunderbolt kineas knew it was leon from the moment he saw the bullshide shield on the mans arm leon shot straight at the sogdians their leader a big man with a grey beard wheeled his horse at the last moment as if he hadnt expected the numidians charge to go straight home and he was too late leons thrown javelin hit him low in the gut and knocked him to the earth and leons big gelding crashed past the other horse and right into the front of the sogdian formation the local men were as stunned as if a real thunderbolt had levelled their chieftain leon vanished into them their standardbearer another big man on a grey horse with a bronze bulls head on a pole shouted shrill orders and the sogdians began to close their ranks arrows leaped out of their formation and fell towards kineas ten strides away kineas cocked his light javelin back five strides out he threw and just as his horses head passed over the corpse of the chieftain he lowered the point of his heavy spear to unhorse the man with the bullshead standard thalassa knocked the mans horse flailing into the sand and sprang over and kineas lost his javelin in the mans corpse the fleeting moments of clear sight were gone and again they were deep in the haze of ares kineas reached for his egyptian sword gripped it and it wouldnt budge from the scabbard he raised his bridle gauntlet to block a blow and took it in the side pain like rage exploded thalassa whirled under him another blow against the scales of his corslet and then he was free in the swirling grit his side hurt but the daimon of combat was on him and he pinned his scabbard between his bridle arm and his side and ripped the sword free almost losing his seat in the desperation of his efforts he was alone he turned thalassas head in the direction he thought was right and urged her forward carlus emerged from the dust his heavy spear dripping gore hah he grunted in greeting behind him hama pressed forward this way lord hama called the three of them rode into the veil of swirling sand a man with a cloth wound around his domed helmet crashed his horse into thalassa and kineas was back in the melee he cut and parried ever more conscious of the pain in his side and the rising tide of sound this was a standup fight not a rout the sogdians were no longer giving ground the olbians werent winning he could hear their calls and the growing shouts of the sogdians he pushed thalassa straight into his opponents horse and cut three times sacrificing finesse for brute force and speed one of his blows got through and the man reeled his hands across his face as his horse twisted all four legs plunging for balance kineas was past him apollo he shouted all around him in the battle haze he heard the shout taken up and ahead of him apollo he could see the horsehair crests on some of his men off to the right just a glimpse as a fitful breeze whipped the flying dust he bellowed apollo again and pressed thalassa with his knees she responded with another surge of strength bulling over another rider without kineas landing a blow then a small man who seemed to be covered in gold landed a spear thrust straight into kineass chest the scales of his mail turned the thrust the man had overreached kineas cut at the shaft failing to break it but swinging the head wide so kineas was in close he grabbed the haft with his bridle hand and pounded the medea head of his pommel into the mans face and their horses engaged so that the two men were pressed breast to breast as their mounts whirled like fighting dogs biting and kicking kineas reached his bridle hand around the mans back he was heavily armoured kineass left hand closed on the mans sword belt and he wrenched the blade of his own sword up from where it was pinned between their chests up and up again with each heave of their mounts thalassa rose on her hindquarters biting savagely at the other horses rump and striking with her front hooves and kineas turned his wrist so that the egyptian blade came up under the other mans jaw a spray of blood and the gold man fell away dead weight that almost carried him off thalassa and a blow against his helmet carlus roaring like a mad bull at his side propping him up apollo hama on his other side and leons shield coming out of the suffocating haze he sat up pain ebbing muttered unheard thanks to carlus and hama hed lost the sword he loved that sword the sword satrax had given him stupid reason to die though antigonus was pressing through the haze rally sound rally kineas said his voice sounded odd hed lost his helmet he glanced down hoping to see the glint of medeas face on the golden grass at his feet instead he saw the blood running over his thigh from somewhere under his corslet the world became a tunnel at the far end antigonus or was it niceas was shouting rally rally niceas turned around as if the world had slid sideways and the ground rose to meet him then there was a skull speaking from a wall of sand listen strategos we will turn the monster south away from the sea of grass let him play with the bones of other men your eagles will rule here and the life of the people will be preserved that is my purpose and your purpose too kineas shook himself i am no mans servant by the crookedminded son of cronus boy you could die pointlessly in someone elses fight a street brawl defending a tyrant who despises you or from a barbarian arrow in the dark its not homer ajax its dirty sleepless full of scum and bugs and on the day of battle you are one faceless man under your helmet no achilles no hektor just an oarsman rowing the phalanx towards the enemy he heard himself a younger and far more feckless man speak the words the skull spoke with the voice of kam baqca as if they sat together in the sundappled contentment of calchuss paddock that would have been your fate face down in the slime of a street brawl the tool of vicious men and you are better kineas found himself stitching away at a headstall dear gods he thought i seem to have spent my entire adult life repairing horseleathers he was facing one of the commonest annoyances of a man sewing leather he was just three stitches from completion and he was out of thread almost out of thread he would have to stitch very carefully taking the needle off the thread at every stitch to get it in again at the end even then he wouldnt make it he could see that the handsome warrior leaned over and pulled at the dangling thread and it lengthened just a fraction you were a mercenary and you chose to be something better go and die a king it was dark he was kineas the babes were crying and srayankas hand was on his hand oh my love she said in sakje she pressed his hand hard so hard that the pain in his bones almost matched the pain in his left side i gather we won kineas asked she kissed him again i almost lost you she said but we won the victory he asked urgently eumenes rallied the olbians and came into the fight on your flank breaking the last resistance my sakje harried the macedonians for thirty stades some of my warriors are still riding well satisfied kineas slumped back into sleep sleep free of skulls or any dreams and the next morning so stiff that he could scarcely mount and needed philokles to get on thalassa he rode to say goodbye to many friends as the two columns parted and their women and children and many warriors turned east or west even without his wounds the partings would have been painful and there were a few diodorus and philokles who tried to argue that he should go west with the column but the wound in his side was mostly just cracked ribs the new armour had held he had cuts on his thigh and cuts on his arms but so did every man who had been in the action and every muscle in his body hurt the same was true of every trooper kineas was not of a mind to turn west rosyfingered dawn brushed every gold trapping and made them kindle silver and steel were stained the delicate pink of new flowers and the grass itself wavered like newforged bronze the wagons of the sakje were already rolling their dust stained the same smoked pink as the sky and the farther clouds above and to the right an eagle of good omen circled searching for prey in the first light at the edge of the last watercourse before the polytimeros kineas stood by thalassa surrounded by his friends srayanka and philokles on either side of him supporting him diodorus with sappho mounted at his side coenus and softhanded artemesia with eumenes and urvara resplendent in her gold gorytos and a necklace of gold and lapis antigonus and andronicus standing silently their gold torcs like bands of lava at their necks sitalkes in his getae cloak ataelus and samahe supporting him and parshtaevalt resplendent in a captured macedonian breastplate of muscled bronze leon quiet and still in an olbian cloak nicanor weeping openly nihmu watched them with a stillness that belied her youth as if her young eyes could record every moment like a scribes wax tablet temerix stood a little apart braiding leather with his fingers even as he accepted the farewells of sappho the sindi smith had been her ally in helping philokles only darius was missing of all of kineass closest companions still out somewhere on the sea of grass looking for spitamenes one by one those who were going west kissed those who were riding east coenus would command eumenes would lead the olbians and urvara the sakje with a tithe of the best warriors with them would go nicanor and sappho and artemesia and andronicus would go as eumenes hyperetes coenus embraced srayanka then he came face to face with kineas my heart tells me that i will not see you again he said kineas wiped hurriedly at his tears no my friend if what i have seen in the gates of horn is true we will not hunt together this side of the elysian fields coenus was an aristocrat and a megaran he stood straight his face unmarked by tears he even managed a grin he took both of kineass hands i honour the gods kineas but after them i honour you may moira see fit to leave the thread of your life uncut that we may hunt the valleys of the tanais together i will dedicate a temple to artemis and i will never cease to think of you and if the thread of your life must be cut let it be a worthy end diodorus spoke as though he was choking at times like this i miss agis the most he said to the others who had not known the gentle theban he said agis was our priest he died at the river gods ford he took one of coenuss hands weve ridden together for years he said i find it hard to imagine a life without all of you philokles cleared his throat i lack the godgiven touch of gentle agis he said but i will attempt his part at length as the morning star was beginning to herald the light which saffronmantled dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea the flames fell and the fire began to die the winds then went home beyond the thracian sea which roared and boiled as they swept over it the son of peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down overcome with toil till he fell into a sweet slumber presently they who were about the son of atreus drew near in a body and roused him with the noise and tramp of their coming he sat upright and said son of atreus and all other princes of the achaeans first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire and quench it let us then gather the bones of patroclus son of menoitios singling them out with care they are easily found for they lie in the middle of the pyre while all else both men and horses has been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge we will lay the bones in a golden urn in two layers of fat against the time when i shall myself go down into the house of hades as for the barrow labour not to raise a great one now but such as is reasonable afterwards let those achaeans who may be left at the ships when i am gone build it both broad and high when he was done they were silent for the space a few heartbeats then sappho embraced diodorus once more and eumenes clasped kineass hand we will build your kingdom he said your city kineas said never my kingdom and then coenus mounted his horse gathered his companions and rode into the sunrise kineass ribs hurt too much for him to ride so he travelled in a litter between two horses for three days as they raced north and east along the polytimeros srayanka commanded he never lost consciousness and there was no fever but he passed the days in a haze of pain by the fourth day he could ride although the pain when his mount misstepped was remarkable if brief cracked ribs philokles said for the fourth time pulling the bandages tight a bronze corslet would have turned that point without a bruise kineas said but the sakje scale is easier to wear all day and covers better each people has its own ways thank you socrates philokles smiled as soon as kineas was mounted srayanka called a moving council all the leaders greek and tribal rode to the head of the column leon handed kineas the egyptian sword i thought youd want this he said we held the field diodorus slapped the numidian on the back leon sent one of temerixs men for me i brought the rest of the olbians and parshtaevalt here his smug smile shattered into a brilliant grin your wife crossed into their flank eumenes rode in on the other side we wrecked em they didnt even stand to fight lot philokles said a very poor showing for macedon kineas shook his head that wasnt macedon he said that was a handful of macedonian officers with a lot of local auxiliaries alexander must be stretched thin he coughed and his ribs hurt antigonus gave a very niceaslike grunt and we took some spoil gold horses and prisoners kineas looked around unsure whether he was delighted at the victory or a little peevish that theyd won it without him how many prisoners he asked a dozen philokles said just troopers except one officer hes not talkative philokles gave a wry grin i like him diodorus pushed his horse in close macedonian bastard all the officers were smiling at some private joke kineas ignored them and dismissed the issue of a prisoner until later i take it there were quite a few more of them than we thought kineas said no diodorus said two squadrons twice your numbers if you toss in ataeluss scouts you rode rings around them he looked around at all the other officers parshtaevalt met his eye and both men gave crooked smiles as if some new understanding had been reached while kineas was wounded we just showed up and pounded the survivors flat and now kineas asked ataelus spoke up iskander holds all the south bank of polytimeros patrols all day but cautious he gave a nod for pissing themselves yellow after fight i think kineas nodded he could see mountains in the distance closer now achievable instead of impossible polytimeros flows out of those yes ataelus and temerix said together and macedonian forts close as teeth in your mouth six forts and a camp temerix nodded i scouted them myself kineas looked at his wife and at diodorus well srayanka said we decided yesterday today we camp early water up and leave the polytimeros out on to the sea of grass north and east around the sogdian mountains and into the desert we must diodorus agreed hes got to have another cut at us kineas and were putting our heads in a noose the farther upstream we go the closer we are to his army his main army he shook his head look we barely hurt him and we see his scouts every day this isnt going to work we have to cut across the desert kineas rubbed his jaw he felt terrible every bone hurt his muscles were sore and breathing caused a steady pulse of pain in his chest his head was surprisingly clear craterus is still on the polytimeros kineas said but alexander is moving east thats what id do hes trying to fight the queen of the massagetae before she joins with spitamenes diodorus narrowed his eyes heh kineas swept his arm out to the southern bank were not even a pimple on alexanders arse he said when the comment was translated the sakje chiefs grinned or laughed aloud alexander is marching east hes contained the problem at marakanda and now hes going to concentrate against queen zarina the plains are dust and dried grass and forage is brutal poor and thin right ataelus nodded they all jogged along for a few strides alexander wont be able to concentrate long not enough food and zarina has the whole plain north of the jaxartes to feed her army and you sakje are much better at living off these plains than the macedonians diodorus nodded i see it he cant turn back to hit us without upsetting his schedule were racing him kineas said my guess is that hes due south not a hundred stades distant moving east behind a screen of patrols a days ride away srayanka shrugged and does this change anything we have settled no he said not in the least it means you were right we must move fast if we are to reach zarina before alexander launches his attack he must mean to cross the jaxartes and make a latesummer campaign against the massagetae srayanka squinted and batted at her braids then hes a fool there is no water on the plains in summer alexander is not a fool my dear he can command man and beast to their limits and beyond he took his army over the height of the mountains yes even the sakje speak of it if he wants them to march out on to the high plains they will he looked around at them after all isnt this exactly what we intend to do we are a few hundred srayanka shot back are you satisfied that we should turn north or should we discuss the flight of geese and the movement of the deer on the plains kineas raised an eyebrow at her yes he said we turn north when the command group had broken up kineas pulled his wife close i wish you would speak your mind in council he said i hate the way you stand silent fearing to interrupt me which side hurts the most she asked aiming a mock blow at his left after the next halt srayanka sent the prodromoi off north leaving parshtaevalt to screen them from the south they made camp early at a bend in the polytimeros where the ruins of a mudwalled village on the south bank spoke an epic about the years of war this area had already seen kineas rejoined his mess group and sat with his back against a sunwarmed rock srayanka leaned her shoulder against him and handed him lita the rock was the sign of a change in terrain the ground was rising to the east they had arrived at the foothills of the sogdian darius squatted on his heels drinking captured wine he was clothed from head to foot like a mede and seemed embarrassed by the nudity of the many olbians bathing in the bend of the polytimeros welcome back you found spitamenes darius nodded kineas put an arm around him i gather spitamenes has sworn to stay clear of us he said ignoring dariuss clothes he is mortified that he has incurred your enmity darius said he flicked a glance at srayanka and then looked away as if artemis had blinded his eyes he claims that he had no idea of what alexander intended with the amazons he was led to believe that the king desired only to meet some he drew himself up he feels his honour is besmirched by what has befallen and he promises any remedy you and your lady require srayanka was well within earshot she handed satyrus to kineas that is as you greeks say the stinking manure of a dog however she smiled it suits all of us if we pretend to believe him darius looked shocked he swore on his honour kineas was surprised at the young mans naivety you liked him he will make a great king darius said seriously he will end with his head on a spike or worse srayanka settled her daughter on her lap i will not forget that he gave me to iskander but i have a long memory and time is short to her daughter she said you may have my dislike of this persian with your milk little sausage darius was wearing a fine sword a straightbladed xiphos decorated in gold like a sakje sword kineas reached out for it a gift he asked yes he was amazed and pleased to find that one of my blood lived he treasures his remaining nobles many men i once knew ride in his cavalry he smiled at philokles who approached from the tamarisk trees on the bluff above them spitamenes sent wine philokles grinned and shouted something that was lost in the sounds of eight hundred horses drinking kineas nodded darius you may go to him if it pleases you you have served me well and you owe me no ransom i killed your cousin it is always between us but i will never forget how you held my side in the castle of namastopolis darius stood silent am i dismissed he asked never kineas said but i understand the ties of common blood and custom spitamenes is a lord of your own people if you desire to ride with him go with my friendship and mine srayanka said darius couldnt meet srayankas eyes but his glance slid to philokles form walking down the last of the slope and he blushed and bowed and took kineass hand i think i will ride with you a while longer he said then after an uncomfortable pause he pointed to the ruins of the town bessus revolted against darius four five years ago theres been no peace on this frontier ever since whichever side holds the upper hand the other side pays the dahae and the massagetae to raid now spitamenes continues where bessus trod you rode with bessus my father did darius said i rode with the king of kings he gave a narrow smile that didnt touch his eyes it is the way among the bactrian nobles one son to each army or perhaps two no matter which side wins the clan remains strong diodorus and philokles came up with a bearded man in a dirty red linen robe over a macedonian breastplate the star of the royal house engraved across his chest the man had a hooked nose and a broad forehead he looked to be forty or perhaps older but well built with an athletes muscles look who the dogs caught diodorus said he was grinning remember this cocksure bastard kineas eyed the man ptolemy he said smoothing his daughters head he didnt get up but he gave the prisoner a smile farm boy the macedonian inclined his head i remember you kineas of athens he said favourite of the gods he inclined his head in mock salutation you didnt used to believe in gods diodorus said poking him ptolemy rubbed his chin and quoted aristophanes if there werent gods i wouldnt be so godforsaken he said and they all laughed philokles gave him a bowl of food mutton he asked horse said kineas im sorry about the fight ptolemy i didnt know you in that getup ptolemy looked down at the linen robe he wore over his cuirass then he glanced pointedly around the fire you dont look much like athenian hippeis yourselves he said where are the flowing locks of yesteryear the fancy cloaks kineas smiled if peace come again and we from toil may be released dont grudge us our flowing locks and skin so nicely greased ptolemy clapped his hands well quoted not that theres a flowing lock in the place diodorus poked him again the spartan here has locks enough for all of us last time i saw you you were modelling a silverchased breastplate youd bought from a looter at ecbatana kineas said were not the only ones fallen on hard times ptolemy shook his head fucking sogdiana he said its brutal still in the hetairoi kineas asked i served with philip kontos before he went back west the man shrugged in the firelight after he killed artemis i left him for the phalanx kineas moved as if his side had pained him she is dead then the macedonian shovelled food with his fingers after he chewed he looked up she was our luck just as she was yours kontos killed her when she chose to stay with us the fucker she wouldnt go west with him diodorus had known artemis as had antigonus but the big gaul was at his own fire diodorus snorted to cover his sorrow artemis had led the camp followers when they were in alexanders army she had been kineass woman from issus to ecbatana no he said glancing at kineas no she wouldnt he raised his cup here is to her memory ptolemy accepted the cup poured a little for her shade aye kineas slopped some from his own bowl and drank i put kontos in the earth he said the fireside fell silent small world the macedonian said surely the gods must have willed it so that you whom she loved best avenged her i doubt that she loved me best kineas said pleased despite his own words i dreamed that she was dead he added you may go in the morning take a horse philokles here will see you clear of our pickets ptolemy stretched his legs out towards the fire the nights were surprisingly cool despite the blast of heat every day at noon i praise ares that i was taken by greeks he said perhaps there is some point in praying to the gods after all i would have expected to have my balls pulled off by now by barbarians you wont ask for ransom kineas looked up at diodorus and philokles they both shook their heads no you may ride clear we took half a dozen troopers as well you can take them with you ptolemy nodded he looked around alexander would forgive you like a shot kineas and hire your whole command sakje with greeks name your price i am not for sale kineas said and i have done nothing that needs to be forgiven macedonian is this some misbegotten athenian plot dont be a fool ptolemy pressed close let me use this godgiven opportunity listen we knew somebody was beating up our pickets ever since early summer weve had reports of mercenary greek horse on the oxus now that ive found you come with me whatever spitamenes is paying you the king will beat it around the fire kineass friends laughed spitamenes has no friends here srayanka said her greek was excellent now youre the amazon ptolemy said he was typical of macedonians kineas could see that having ascertained that she was a woman and a suckling woman he had dismissed her as being of less importance than the saddle blanket on which he sat the pregnant amazon he looked from her to kineas and back your girl my wife the lady srayanka queen of the assagatje kineas gestured towards her she chuckled even as she adjusted her son on her nipple and put a hand under her breast to support him ptolemy looked at her more carefully then he looked at kineas as if seeing him for the first time if you killed kontos then you defeated zopryon didnt you kineas smiled slowly and wickedly i didnt do it by myself he said ptolemy was pale even in the ruddy firelight so he said all friendliness was gone from his voice fucking ingrate alexander made you kineas felt the blood in his face nonetheless he struggled to remain calm if only because his calm would infuriate the macedonian all the more i am an athenian you are a fucking hellene fighting for barbarians ptolemy was livid and like most fighting men heedless of consequence kineas had no trouble meeting his gaze even when the macedonian stumbled to his feet fists closed and twitching you are a barbarian fighting for barbarians kineas said he sat up from his reclining position i owe alexander nothing i was dismissed by him and exiled for serving him my city has commanded my service against him athens has sent an army into this haunted desert ptolemy slumped thats not possible my city is olbia kineas said with pride i am the hipparch of olbia every man at this fire is a citizen of olbia the cities of the euxine united with the sakje the assagatje to destroy zopryon he would have enslaved every man and woman on the euxine ptolemy he wanted it all kineas stood up handing his daughter to darius and spat in the fire we lost hundreds of riders not one macedonian boy lived to see his mother on a farm near pella not one horse trotted across the grass to his pasture in the high hills srayankas voice was angry and arrogant she didnt rise tell your king that if he comes on to the plains we will give him the same the sea of grass is not for macedon my father died teaching philip that lesson and none of us are afraid to school the son olbia ptolemy asked his anger was quenched where the fuck is olbia that made all the veterans around the fire laugh because just two years before most of them would have said the same kineas gave half a grin the richest city of the euxine even as he spoke he could see the city as if he stood on the bluff by the borysthenes looking down at the temple of apollo and the golden dolphins with pantecapaeum richer than all the cities of greece combined ptolemy controlled his anger aware that he was one captured macedonian thats not saying much he said ive seen persepolis and ecbatana greece is poor rich enough with their sakje allies to stop macedon for ever kineas sat again ptolemys long and thoughtful face took on an intense look you may speak your sophistry as you will the king will never forgive you we arent even allowed to mention zopryons name the survivors of the fight on the polytimeros were threatened with decimation one in ten to be executed he actually carried out half a dozen before he ordered them stopped did you know that and we were sworn to eternal silence on the defeat philokles nodded he guards his myth of invulnerability he said and then looking closely at the macedonians face he said you hate him stung ptolemy stumbled away from philokles antigonus arriving out of the darkness with a skin of captured wine caught his shoulders and steadied him careful laddy antigonus said in his heavily accented greek ptolemy looked around and slumped again he sighed we all love him and we hate him he is half god and half monster he raised his head like many men i would like to go home i would like to stop playing the endless game of betrayal and politics and advantage for power and influence in the army i would like to build something something real philokles raised an eyebrow frowned and nodded so stop ptolemy shook his head i cant why not philokles asked because if ptolemy stops playing somebody under him will have him killed and move up kineas said and diodorus nodded agreement we never played the macedonian game were just greeks but we watched kineas looked at ptolemys face and thought about how often philokles had asked him questions like this with the same intensity it was interesting to see him do it to another man to see the effect the confusion the sudden selfdoubt best join us diodorus said weve numidians and kelts and megarans and spartans theres a babylonian jew in second troop or so he claims weve a couple of persians why not a macedonian ptolemy laughed you are he looked around the firelight hah he laughed shaking his head you will actually let me go kineas nodded be my guest ptolemy stood at attention i am honourbound to report everything i have seen and heard he said philokles spoke up again but will you he asked ptolemy suddenly looked younger and more vulnerable than he had throughout his time by the fire ii must he said philokles shrugged except that if you tell the king everything you will never see home first because tyrants always blame the messenger is that not true kineas are you asking me because i know so many tyrants or because i have been one kineas asked but yes which you well know yes philokles in his turn rose to his feet and because if you tell alexander all you know you will change his campaign his amazon his prize is right here and so is the man who defeated zopryon philokles had never looked more like a philosopher despite his stained tunic and dirty legs than at that moment gleaming and golden in the firelight leaning forward like a statue of an orator if you tell him he will drop everything to fight us out on the grass and you will never see home philokles eyes were sparkling and you know it diodorus still reclining said there is a god at your shoulder philokles the others were silent some slurping and gurgling from lita broke the solemnity of the moment ptolemy was gone in the morning with the other prisoners philokles rode with him to the south accompanied by ataelus and returned alone at midday when the whole column was so far out on the sea of grass that the trees of the polytimeros valley were lost in the haze only the mountains to the east marred the perfect bowl of the earth it was not until evening that the desert nature of the ground began to take its toll the scouts had found waterholes and their camps were based on those but no single place gave sufficient water for eight hundred horses kineas had to fragment his command into four groups based more on horse strength than on manpower srayanka and the sakje were at another waterhole he lay awake listening to the restless underwatered horses he was unused to sleeping alone already missing his children he awoke with a dry mouth he drank water from the spring after the horses were clear and there was more silt than refreshment by noon his mouth was like parchment his tongue had taken on a presence in his mouth it had never had before and his clay water bottle sized for greece where dozen of streams crossed the plains was almost dry he had travelled through deserts before in persia and media and west by hyrkania so he knew to put a pebble under his tongue and to ration his water skin and pottery canteen carefully he made sure that antigonus and the underofficers checked the greek and keltoi troopers constantly made them drink watched them for signs of sickness even with a host of water problems they flew released from the rough ground at the foot of the sogdian mountains the four small columns moved at a pace that could only be maintained when every man had at least two mounts their second camp on the sea of grass came after what seemed like three hundred stades of travel an incredible march for one day the prodromoi rode back and forth between the columns reporting on the water ahead and the distance that each troop had left to reach their camp but soon enough the horses smelled the water and then they saw a stream rushing out of the hills hills that had shifted from the eastern horizon towards the south and were closer the stream was still cool and the horses trumpeted when they smelled it and could barely be controlled for worrying ataelus confessed as they watched the horses charge into the stream for one day on great grass he pointed mutely at the chaotic drinking next time four days and one night no water he shrugged his shrugs were so greek now that he could have sat on a wall in the agora of athens well survive kineas said ataelus gave him a look that suggested that no amount of command optimism was going to cure a night without water they all camped together because of the stream kineas snuggled up to srayanka and she snuggled back i missed you she said i know i will lose you so i resent being parted i will yet be a silly girl no kineas said smelling the sweet grass and woodsmoke and horse smell of her how were the children she rocked her hips pushing back against him they were like babies when their mouths get dry they cry worry more when they dont cry she rolled her head back to him most of the women who have borne children are gone the only other women are spearmaidens i wish i had someone to ask ask what kineas said lita doesnt move as much as i am for liking she kissed him i am being a mother pay me no heed kineas lay still for a little while srayanka rolled on to her back what are you for thinking kineas watched her in the starlight im thinking how many things there are to worry about babies and water horses and water alexander death srayanka put her hand behind his head i can think of something we can do to stop worrying she said her right hand already playful but you must be quiet kineas chuckled into her lips he started to say something witty and then he wasnt thinking about much of anything about two minutes later something hit kineass rump keep it down diodorus called and forty men and two women laughed told you to be quiet srayanka said but her chuckles didnt last long part vi the beacon so this party of mixed greeks and scythians just let you go hephaestion was beginning to see ptolemy as a competitor and in his creed competitors needed to be destroyed ptolemy was struggling not to lose his nerve or his temper in his detached commanders brain he wondered that a man could be afraid and enraged at the same time the poet always said that one drove out the other the poet had never been to sogdiana the greeks made sure of it he said there was a spartan mercenary he rode me clear of their lines alexander far from being angry seemed pleased so the sakje barbarians have some greek allies he said he rubbed the stubble on his chin that makes it more of a fight dont you think hephaestion wasnt through yet it might if you believed this halfarsed story alexander looked at his closest companion with a certain scepticism he raised an eyebrow do sogdians take prisoners no said hephaestion of course not dahae sakje massagetae alexander was just like his tutor when he bored in on an argument he was at his most annoyingly superior but since the focus of his superiority was on hephaestion and not him ptolemy was prepared to watch no said hephaestion now surly as he understood the point being made exactly if his story was false he wouldnt be here so craterus lost what seventy sogdians alexander snapped his fingers and received a cup of wine another cup was offered to ptolemy while alexander shared his with hephaestion ptolemy nodded more like a hundred lord alexander rolled the wine in his cup before he raised his eyes craterus needs to be replaced ptolemy shook his head who could have expected a trained commander in this wilderness or an enemy who could make three direction changes inside a few stades alexanders steady and mismatched gaze didnt waver so much for craterus ptolemy thought will you take command of the sogdian cavalry alexander asked no ptolemy said without a moments thought i would like to go back to commanding my taxeis very well alexander said his annoyance was plain blood rushed to his face go back to footslogging with my compliments on your report he made a hand motion that indicated dismissal ptolemy gave a brief bow a sketchy compromise between a macedonian head nod and a persian bow and withdrew as he left alexander turned to hephaestion this greek mercenary has hurt us several times i cant believe hes a spartan they have no head for cavalry agesilaus was the exception not the rule hephaestion was pouting xenophon was a spartan he said alexander laughed what did you do while i went to my tutor he asked xenophon was an athenian hephaestion knocked back his wine and shrugged fine he said i want to command the sogdians alexander looked at him fondly you command my companions he said you need a soldier of proven worth to lead the sogdians and stop the defeats weve taken in the little fights along the oxus hephaestion raised his head alexander met his eyes put a hand on his head and ruffled his bronze curls it is not a job worthy of you he said hephaestion shrugged off his hand i want it alexander shrugged and turned his back no he said i want hephaestion began no alexander said in a tone of command fetch eumenes for me please hephaestion stomped out of the tent and eumenes came in alone great king he asked after an obeisance i need a cavalry commander to cover the movement on the jaxartes who is it to be eumenes shrugged i thought craterus had that job he asked alexanders eyes bored into the cardians but eumenes held his ground not giving a hint that he already knew what had happened after a moment alexander shook his head craterus got beaten he said ill do it eumenes said his tone suggested that he didnt want to do it set a greek to catch a greek alexander said my thought exactly theres a greek mercenary operating with spitamenes take the sogdians a squadron of the mercenary horse and whatever foot you think will help and get him he seems to have about four hundred horse perhaps twice that eumenes nodded where is he now alexander had a rough sketch of sogdiana on his camp table although it showed nothing but towns rivers and mountains and even then most of the distances were guesswork even after a years campaigning up where the polytimeros meets the sogdian mountains hell be on the north bank of the polytimeros shadowing us eumenes looked at the map if hes on the polytimeros well catch him against the northern wall of the valley exactly alexander said he glanced out of the door of his tent checking for hephaestion no doubt if he was smart enough to beat craterus hell be smart enough to avoid getting trapped if hes not on the polytimeros eumenes asked track him but mostly keep him and spitamenes off me while i manoeuvre i have thirty thousand men to concentrate on the jaxartes and if one of these bandits gets into my rear he shrugged morale among the macedonians was low they werent likely to desert or fight poorly but mutiny was always possible when they felt hard done by both men knew it they would march for ever without wine or oil when they were happy so youre going to the jaxartes eumenes asked hed heard rumours but armies were full of rumours now ive already started some of the troops in motion i need to beat the massagetae before they join hands with spitamenes and make themselves a nuisance eumenes nodded the massagetae have made no move to attack us he said except to send their men to harass our outposts and loaning horsemen to spitamenes alexanders tone was commanding when i beat them spitamenes will fold eumenes hadnt risen to power with the king by cowardice i disagree lord spitamenes will fold anyway we have no need to fight the massagetae in fact a message acknowledging their ownership of the sea of grass would probably end their campaign should i offer to pay them tribute too alexander asked his voice was very quiet eumenes nodded slowly very well lord he said your mind is set it is go and punish this greek recruit the survivors and rejoin me i wont move to fight this zarina for twenty days hephaestion wants this command eumenes said not because he had any love of the kings companion but because he absolutely did not want to go chasing a wily greek with sakje allies on the sea of grass alexander nodded i love hephaestion with all my soul he said but he is not suited for independent command and if i ever hear that you repeated those words eumenes cast his eyes down to hide the gleam that must be there ahh he thought now the game is worth playing ill catch this greek then eumenes said perhaps ill bring you an amazon as well alexander sighed i liked the one i had he said even gravid she had a presence and her eyes alexander laughed why do i tell you these things eumenes because you cant tell hephaestion eumenes thought with satisfaction alexander stopped him at the door of his tent take the savage whats his name urgargar upazan lord that one he knows the country and he has a good hate in him let him focus it in our service the king sat back and drank a little more wine theres cavalry behind us diodorus said as soon as he rode up it was four days since they had left the polytimeros to ride north the hills of the abii on their right and the sogdian mountains a smudge to the south diodorus was so covered with dust that his cloak and his face and his tunic were all the same shade his wide straw hat had frayed around the edges phewf riding through our drag is enough to discourage any thoughts of glory how many asked kineas he looked back although there was nothing to see but the tower of dust they were a day and a night north of the last stream and despite the heaviest load of water they could carry the dash across the waterless plains had already brought equine casualties eight hundred a thousand no remounts according to ataelus diodorus used the shawl over his head to wipe his face they were gaining on us but ataelus gave them a sting when they were watering the last water was almost a hundred stades behind them theyll never catch us kineas said diodorus smiled thats what ataelus said he said and coughed and thats before he lifted fifty of their horses philokles pulled the shawl off his nose to speak dont dismiss them they crossed mountains and deserts to get here he nodded if we get into water trouble we cant go back kineas nodded i needed more to worry about he said thats why youre the strategos diodorus said i used to command a couple of squadrons of cavalry but now im a patrol leader he laughed at this rate another few weeks will see me where i started as a gentleman trooper kineas wound his own shawl back over his face was it so bad he asked nope diodorus said that night there was water enough to madden the horses but not enough to fill them there was trouble even with precautions people became surly mounts injured themselves and greek notions of discipline clashed with sakje ideas of horse care kineas tried calm authority and when that failed he punched a keltoi who was losing his head and then yelled himself hoarse angry with himself and with his command he went to his cooking fire and sat holding his children while srayanka checked her pickets with diodorus the one sandy hole in the stream bed emitted enough water to please one horse every few minutes which mostly threatened to keep everyone awake all night srayanka came back after the moon went down she sighed and sank against his back and together they watched the stars they slept she asked yes kineas said he had kept his water bottle for them all day and given them the whole contents before they went down theyd left enough in the bottle to make an attractive sloshing sound he handed it to his wife and she took a sip rolled it around her mouth and swallowed you take the rest she said it tasted like ambrosia and then they were all asleep he was standing at the base of the tree and ajax and niceas stood before him are you ready niceas asked no kineas said niceas nodded get ready he said beyond him on the plain stood thousands of corpses some rotting some dismembered close to ajax stood a getae warrior with a hand gone and a neat puncture wound in his abdomen do the thing he said in greek those had been his last words but they had a certain urgency he cut at a sakje warrior in a fine suit of scale satrax of course but the king broke him with a single swing behind the getae were more men mostly persians dariuss halfbrother was trying to push past graccus these are all the men i have killed kineas said he began to be afraid even in the dream the men he had killed were so many and for what as he stood to lose his own life he found that he had never valued it more and every one of them had valued his life the same now they were trying to push past other shades the rage of combat still fresh on them niceas took his hand and pushed him to the tree his hands were bony go he said climb he looked desperate dont let this be for nothing he shouted and then kineas was on the tree looking down at where a circle of dead friends stood fast against a rising tide of corpses he tore his eyes from the sight and climbed higher swinging from branch to branch at a rate that wouldnt have been possible in the waking world but feeling fatigue as well his mouth was dry he was high enough that the tree itself despite its immensity had a motion to it so that the top seemed to sway like a ships mast or had his thoughts of a ships mast imparted the motion the climb became much harder as he neared the top the immensity of the darkening sky filling his head lightning played on every hand and the top moved like a wild animal under him directly in his way the thin branches of the top intertwined like an old olive tree making a barrier like a wicker wall over his head and he paused trying to push through the branches seemed to push back the twigs whipping in the wind and cutting at his face and hands he pushed using the dream strength against the branches and as he pushed they seemed to consume him he no longer knew in the way of dreams whether he was climbing or falling trapped in a dark tunnel of branches heaving and pressing against him and across the river there stood a tree a lone willow blasted by lightning in some inconceivably ancient past for it was a mighty tree even in death and its cousins lay scattered across the far shore the wreck of the enemy cavalry took cover by the dead tree a warrior in a magnificent suit of armour and a golden helmet tried to rally them pointing his bow across the river a few arrows arched at them and fell short and srayanka smiled a tired smile he returned the smile and motioned to her and she put a trumpet to her lips above the red swirl of dust he could see the last of a blue sky and high in the sky an eagle circled charge he said he gestured and they were in the river bodies piled like gutted fish in the spring run of the tanais their blood making the froth of the river pink in the setting sun they went forward splashing through the river the drops catching the sun like jewels and the cool water a blessing after a day of battle the shattered taxeis the remnants of which had made their way back across struggled to reform with a single officer sword arm hanging useless at his side bellowing for them to rally the man in the golden helm drew his bow even as his companions left him kineas was in midstream his steelgrey charger stepping carefully because of the gravel and rocks and then he felt a blow in his gut sky cold water you are waking the children srayanka said she sounded frightened he listened to her cuddling the two babies and he felt nothing he was a long time getting back to sleep in the morning the horses were weak and difficult there was little water in the camp and two days travel until they could get more the columns set off with a minimum of fuss or orders as if two years of campaigning had been practice for these few days when every minute counted the ground was dry grass and hard gravel and they moved as fast as the state of their horses would allow srayanka looked pinched she was losing fluid in her milk and she was worried for the children this is insane kineas said to her i ride to my death and you follow me to yours the children we must turn back every word was an effort and his mouth felt like a drunkards after a long night drinking turn back she retorted do you think me weak she turned around and waved a hand at the silent figures jogging along through the dust our children are as strong as they need to be she bent at the waist for a moment and then straightened we must find water kineas rubbed his beard four swigs of water later they crossed a low ridge and meeting with nihmu who had been left as a guide they prepared to turn due east away from the sun the mountains remained on their right hand and all that could be seen in the distance was a shimmer of heat nihmu rode up to srayanka and silently handed her a wineskin it sloshed with water the column was halted so that everyone could change horses the only relief any of them had and every eye was drawn to the wineskin as if it glowed with blue gods fire for the children nihmu said her tone was curious almost triumphant or gloating srayanka nodded and accepted the skin then she beckoned to samahe since hirenes death samahe had become her hyperetes everyone take a sip she said ill have whats left she handed it to samahe who tilted it along her arm and handed it to diodorus diodorus looked at it with wonder and at her but he too tipped it back briefly before handing the skin to antigonus who passed it to parshtaevalt on and on down the column kineas could follow the passage of the skin by the disturbance it made among the horses almost as if a camel was walking among them when he changed horses he chose thalassa because she was fresh head high and seemed eager for him it took him three attempts to get his leg over her back he was so tired and his getae hack looked ready to drop he could hear the sound of the skin coming back up the column it filled his mind like something in a dream and the craving for the water drove all other thoughts from him he imagined that the water was still cool crisp from some mountain stream that nihmu had scouted no one will drink nihmu said by his side the girl was so darkly tanned that she rivalled leons looks and she had a straw hat over a linen wimple to guard her face from the sun the water is for the children and your people know it kineas looked at her stunned to silence he didnt think that he had the discipline to pass on a mouthful of water the water skin was already back to carlus carlus looked at it with obvious longing but he didnt put it to his mouth instead he handed it to kineas the skin was more than half full some of the riders had taken a sip but their discipline was remarkable and humbling kineas took enough water to loosen his tongue in his mouth we must have water tonight nihmu said or many will die kineas looked at her why dont you find water he asked i did she said that water the wineskin was still in his hands and he passed it across to srayanka it is a long ride to that water lord i can take you there ataelus will help but you must lead nihmu turned her head away to look at the horizon thank you srayanka said but do you think i could drink when all my people were thirsty all have had their fill lady kineas said now you drink kineass eyes burned with unspent tears and srayanka hung her head but she drank as she drank her throat moving with the gulps of water her drinking noises and the sounds of horses and conversation and nihmus light voice wove themselves like the border on a garment so that in one moment they were disparate threads and in the next the voice of the god the time is soon it is time to be complete kineas stiffened and the hair on his neck rose like the hackles of a dog and his stomach recoiled none of them would forget that afternoon because it seemed to go beyond a tale of hours the sun beat down as if the gods had a burning lens focused on their column and the heat was reflected off the scrubby grass like light from a bronze mirror the horses took shorter strides and the dust of their passage rose to the skies like the smoke of a funeral pyre at the edge of dark kineas called a halt the horses protested he pushed thalassa still as brave as she had been at noon through the throng to diodorus two hours he said then we mount and ride on the thirst he paused to rub his heavy tongue over his throat it will not get any better he said diodorus nodded philokles waited until kineas had dismounted and picketed his charger then he came up to kineas and held out a cup drink brother he said i will not kineas said i will not drink your water you must command and this is watered wine the last from coenus let us pour a libation to the gods and drink kineas took the spartan cup and tipped a healthy portion into the dust by zeus who shakes the heavens and poseidon who shakes the earth apollo lord of the silver bow and hera whose breasts are as white as the snow on olympus athena wise in war ares clad in bronze aphrodite who riseth from the waves and hephaestion the lame smith artemis the huntress hermes god of travellers who might relieve us in this waterless desert and all the gods he said and he drank even as he handed the wine to philokles it went to his head so that he threw his dirty cloak on the warm ground by srayanka and before she had fed lita he was in the mud at the base of the tree amidst the terrifying silence of the dreams battle haze a hundred maimed and bony hands reached for him a knot of dead friends struggled back to back ajax and nicomedes and niceas still stood but graccus was gone he had the sword in his hand and he cut at the hands that tried to restrain him and they flung themselves at him as he backed to the tree and the stench rose through the dreamscape into his nostrils so that all of the foulness of all the charnel pits in the world all of the carnage of every battlefield seemed to fill his nostrils and above the sky was dark like the blackest storm at sea and lightning forked across the dark iron of the heavens something was on his back something too horrible to contemplate searching for his throat and his mind with its tendrils hands claws and then it was gone ripped free like the rising of a veil of mist and he spun and fell to his knees in the muck immediately he began to sink into the foul stuff get up said a familiar voice did i die so that you could fail artemis stood over him her slit throat the least awful of the wounds around him new forces were in the field and the wall of silently screaming dead foes had been pushed back several strides she wore the armour she had worn the night before arbela when she had danced the spartan dances like a man and two thousand soldiers had called her name he rose to his feet she turned her back to him but she looked back as he set his foot on the trunk i had a lot of friends she said with a smile and then he was climbing flying riding a nightmare beast that climbed for him swarming up the trunk like a lizard or a misshapen squirrel right into the top and up to the barrier of thorns and branches interwoven like a farmers wall and then he was mortal no longer flying bereft of his mount he pushed his head into the branches and they fought him but he gave a great heave as philokles might have done against a shield wall the arrow fell from the sky burning like a meteor in the last of the sun and he fell sitting on the ground as the alien spearmen pushed the javelin home in his guts alone in the courtyard cut off from his friends and so tired as blow after blow fell on his head and arms and then standing over nicomedes corpse each blow sending another foe into the dust with a clash of bronze and the cry of the army apollo and he knew that victory an arm around her throat she lashed out with feet hands everything panic not quite winning over cunning but the other hand held iron and it burned across her throat and warm wetness fell on her breasts and she screamed but no voice came and she fell into the dark alone under the standard and all around kin fell protecting covering armour a blaze of gold the shock of the cold iron in his guts killed in a winning fight he might have laughed but there was nothing a childs cry screaming red everywhere and pain like lightning in her flesh waves that came so close that there was no rest and nothing but the lightning and the waves moist waves of pain that carried her closer to the tunnel an answering scream from beneath her feet and the pressure lifted but not the pain and all her life pouring away between her legs a childs cry familiar and death all around him the iron tunnel gripping him with a riders legs on the whole of his body arms trapped a childs cry standing frozen with fear as the man in the redcrested helm beats the fileleader to the ground the sick noise as the mans spear crushes his breastbone and he rips it free gore spraying shield too heavy to lift to parry frozen the sudden a childs cry light three old crones and the end of a thread and the straightlimbed goddess with an owl fluttering by her shoulder and she smiled light he awoke to darkness and children crying by his side nihmu squatted the thin hide of her leggings worked with a thousand animals whirling in a geometric tangle of hooves and antlers and gold cones tinkled at her shins and ankles we must ride lord she said yes kineas said he felt that he was speaking down a tunnel an endless tunnel lined with sound and light and motion and life too much life he turned to srayanka and there were tears in his eyes i have done it he said there was awe in his voice and for the first time in his life kineas felt no fear srayanka rolled to her knees from her cloak she reached out and touched his face ahh she said how the people will worship you kineas held her in his arms hush he said lets get these people to water his mouth was dry but he could speak and he could still taste the wine and he gave the goddess a silent prayer and a smile in the dark they stumbled twenty stades in two hours the worst time they had ever made and then they rode another ten stades in a matter of minutes because the horses could smell the water this time there was no holding them no discipline no attempt to stop the beasts or the people kineas gave thalassa her head and she lengthened her stride galloping the last stades in a few heartbeats even kineas could smell the water it gleamed like liquid pitch in the light of the new moon a broad pond dug by the prodromoi and they stood well clear as the horses rushed upon it and drank more and more of them pouring in behind so that the first comers were pushed right out of the water and the weaker horses were knocked down a mare screamed and her desperation drove other horses back and her rider tried to get her to her feet but the horses were mad with thirst here here for more water ataelus was shouting over and over because there was a second hole just a hundred strides away in the dark kineas had to drag thalassa usually the most obedient of horses by her halter he put both hands on the bit and pulled abraiding her mouth until he got her head up and away from the water and moving and then she finally got the message that there was a second source of water and she let out a shrill cry and ran leaving kineas with his hands skinned raw lying in the sand another mare following her lead stepped very close to him and a third kicked him where his ribs were hurt and he screamed and then ataelus and leon were dragging him clear of the horses as many of the lead stallions and mares dashed for the second waterhole kineas lay on the sand is he hurt badly diodorus asked fearfully he has lost his breath philokles said i think he was kicked both of them were very far away they emerged from the dry grass into the valley of the lake of the jaxartes on the second day after the prodromoi found water they had topped a ridge so shallow that they hadnt been aware they had climbed it and looked down to see not desert but stades of water stretching away towards the mountains that now rose to the south horses had died and more horses were ruined most of them in the last rush to water and the brutal melee that followed but not a man or woman or child had died the horses had suffered and their exhausted riders had to fight them man and woman against horse to drag them from the water before they killed themselves drinking lots people helped having experienced the same just a week before they had waited at the first water hoping that srayankas people would catch up with them lots wife was gone into the high country with all their herds and the young and old and lot appeared older the loss of his daughters and the desert had put white in his hair but it had not robbed him of courtesy i apologize he said to srayanka but she cut him off with a quick embrace and a kiss on the cheek are we greeks you saw to your people and i saw to mine and here we are lot smiled but his smile faded as he regarded kineas who lay rolled in his saddle blanket alert but mute he was kicked philokles said he seems to hear everything we say srayanka said lot nodded we had several in a bad way always the ones who took the least water his tone left something out kineas lay with an untouched spartan cup of water in his right hand did yours recover srayanka asked as if the question were of little consequence one did lot replied of how many philokles asked and then repeated his question in sakje out of four lot said he shrugged i apologize again but for upazan the king would have had iskander at the oxus it is a heavy weight i carry heavier than the loss of a daughter kineas said his head coming up i have seen her by the tree all the commanders greek and sakje and sauromatae stopped talking tears rolled down lots face no lord not heavier than mosvas loss kineass eyes went over lots head off into the blue sky death is not as you think he said and then his head went down and the light in his eyes dwindled and he slept he was aware of the passage of time although his awareness was flawed and he knew it the way a man with a fever is aware that time does not pass for him as it does for his wife bathing his brow and cleaning the bed he heard the reassuring voices of those he loved best friends and wife the babble and scream of his children and he felt such passion for them that it was like physical pain like a javelin piercing his chest straight to his heart he knew that a stranger had come speaking a strange dialect like sakje with many of the same words but in a different tone with more music he listened but he didnt open his eyes for a long time when he did he felt better and he could breathe without wheezing he tried to sit up and gave a cry curling into a ball and srayanka was there hush kineas im better he croaked oh the ill luck of it right where the spear hit me srayanka stroked his hand i have news she said i heard a stranger kineas said a messenger from the queen of the massagetae bidding us hurry to the muster my husband is a famous warrior i find his fame carries even to the queen of the massagetae kineas smiled and fell asleep for a day he was aware of food aware of wine aware of srayankas caress at his cheek he would hold his children and feel the piercing spear of love he saw it all through the veil of dreams and none of it had the immediacy of his thoughts which raced and raced like a herd of deer run by dogs it was not unlike his childhood experience of high fever one night he woke and srayanka was weeping with the children in her arms she looked at him and hissed i am not a fucking greek then she lowered her voice still further come back to me better that you had died than that i have this walking corpse and kineas noted that what she said was true in its way but not important i am dead he thought what did you expect another sun and another day in the saddle his hips rolling easily with the gait of his charger his mind far beyond the clouds around him they all chattered so much talk about him about the weather about the massagetae and the dahae and the tribes gathered in a great horde ahead of them about alexanders army across the river and then it was dark and he dreamed of the assembly of athens and listened to demosthenes and phocion debate further support to alexander reliving the moment when he was summoned by the council to lead the richest youth of the city to support alexander the dream was as clear as the first experience he began to weep because he had never thought to see athens again and because he missed it so much how had he forgotten that the parthenon shone so in the moonlight what is death brother asked a voice at his elbow he was weeping and he could only just remember why but the question was an excellent one it engaged his mind so that his tears were choked off he looked at the heavens and finally he said the cessation of the body and truth what is truth kineas took a deep breath again he was riding and his hips moved with a life of their own damned if i know he said and his ribs hurt like fresh bruises when he laughed and in saying he became aware from the tips of his hair to the aches in his wounds he was sitting on his getae hack legs clamped to its narrow back and around him were thousands of horses cropping the grass of the jaxartes valley and he was kineas what do you say srayanka asked riding up her face lit with hope i love you kineas said he reached for her and winced at the wave of pain she gave a little shriek like the one she sometimes uttered in passion you have returned i was never very far away he said he grinned and rubbed his beard you climbed the tree nihmu asked full of excitement it was night and they were eating dinner in a camp at the edge of the jaxartes valley be gone bird of ill omen be gone with your barbarian notions of life philokles made to shoo the tanned girl away from kineas like a farmer moving poultry in his yard shush brother kineas said he smiled at philokles to nihmu he said i climbed the tree now the tree is behind me he shrugged i do not think that my tree and yours are the same your death nihmu asked is my business girl kineas snapped and iskander leon asked is a very capable commander with a fine army kineas smiled i have dreamed of him and i have thought about his army he shrugged but hes across the river as i understand philokles was polishing his helmet using tallow and fine grit on a pad of linen tow weve had brushes with his pickets every day since you went down brother i threw my best spear at upazan just yesterday philokles gave a mirthless grin i find that all my wineinduced desires for peace vanish when i have a chance to kill he put the helmet down on the ground and put a felt cap on his head then donned the helmet transforming from philosopher to spirit of ares in a few heartbeats what is the point kineas what is the point of all this marching all this striving all this killing did your precious tree tell you he pulled his helmet off obviously dissatisfied with the fit he stared at the lacings kineas often found himself at a loss when debating with philokles but today the answers flowed into his mind like the jaxartes in spate across the plains come brother you know the answer he laughed to see his brilliant and philosophical friend look at him so he reached out and embraced philokles what would achilles say to you spartan what would socrates say philokles drank water from a skin he was blushing they would say that the point was virtue he said kineas nodded just so he took a deep breath like a man who loved the taste of air sometimes we kill because we are men of virtue and sometimes we abstain from killing for the same reason sometimes a man may choose to drink wine and another time he may choose to abstain the doing of things is what earns the glory we should need neither reward nor praise nihmu stared from one to the other what are you talking about she asked with the annoyance of a young woman who thinks that her ignorance is being mocked is this a greek thing kineas smiled and shook his head perhaps and perhaps not child philokles nodded it is the greek thing child the struggle for virtue kineas took the helmet from philokles you are the last man on earth to wear the corinthian helmet brother whats wrong with it the lining is all worn out kineas nodded nothing for it but to pull the leather and sew a new one philokles nodded i was being lazy he took his belt knife and cut the threads and in one motion ripped the liner clear ares help me if we are attacked now he said nihmu shook her head i dont even know what youre talking about she said and stalked off when she was gone diodorus joined them with leon and srayanka ataelus sat heavily on the ground he looked thin queen zarina ataelus said for asking you he waved at the eastern horizon for much messengers diodorus nodded when will we reach her srayanka stretched two more days and we will reach the muster even going slowly the horses are getting their coats back kineas nodded i want to talk to spitamenes first he said he must be close gods is this some baqca thing diodorus asked kineas rubbed his chin and pulled his beard enjoying his friends discomfort no he said its ten years in the saddle think of it friend when we were on the oxus spitamenes was a hundred stades south of us he never caught us on the polytimeros no one has said that alexander caught him we were all going to the same place he cant be far philokles laughed and we call diodorus a fox well reasoned kineas ataelus grunted could have asked me fucktheirmothers persae at the second water today garait said this he shrugged kineas turned to kiss srayanka i want to talk to the old bandit first then we ride to the muster the old bandit sold me to iskander she said i want to settle that before we ride into an alien camp kineas said srayanka rolled her eyes the next day kineas met spitamenes garait located his camp and ataelus led him there darius was the intermediary and kineas rode with a short train of followers to share a meal with the last persian in the field against alexander philokles joined them eager to observe the persian leader was tall and spare with the greying remnants of redgold hair in his beard he was a handsome man despite a great beak of a nose and he had an immediate presence he rode a magnificent nisaean charger and he was deeply religious so that even in the midst of his first meeting with kineas he paused for prayers in his presence kineas knew that the man was a fanatic how could he be else and confronted with the man it was as if his newfound wisdom was being tested against his old hatreds spitamenes had sold his wife to alexander for what he thought of as a higher cause the gambit had failed and now the persian was sorry but his apology had the distant quality that indicated he would do as much again if it would serve to push the hated invader off the sacred soil of persia at his side sat darius translating freely although kineass persian was of a high standard and many other men spoke the same languages but darius did not look at spitamenes with worship or even admiration early on spitamenes pointed out darius who was greeting his friends and filemates among the olbians that one loves you more than his own country spitamenes said we are guest friends and warfriends kineas said he has saved my life several times kineas was watching the persians medes and bactrians around the fires spitamenes had fewer than a thousand men and only the same number of horses he had lost the campaign that summer and his men looked the part dirty tired eyes dead they sat on the grass with only their saddle rugs for seats they had no followers no women and very little chatter they built their fires right on the grass rather than digging pits like the greeks so that the whole camp smelled of burning grass and from time to time the grass would catch again and burn until a tired warrior stomped it out they were dirty and yet they were proud heads high glaring at him as if he and philokles were the personification of the enemy spitamenes turned his head away clearly displeased then he asked where is your beautiful wife when kineas visited the persians srayanka stayed at home as did all of the sakje there was nothing there but blood no sakje could forgive such an affront in camp sharpening her axe kineas said spitamenes nodded she would do better to see to your children surely he asked it was not clear whether the question was honest or malicious you did a foolish thing when you offered my wife to iskander kineas answered he saw no reason to speak honeyed words she despises you and all her clan want nothing of you but your head spitamenes rocked back on his ankles there is blunt speech he said he rubbed his beard i had hoped that we could be friends kineas laughed and ate more spiced mutton with his fingers let me remind you lord that you sold her as a hostage to iskander sold her although she owed you neither allegiance nor vassalage spitamenes shrugged she was to hand he said the god requireth that i make hard choices for my people she is the daughter of foreigners why should i have stayed my hand philokles sitting at kineass side choked on a bit of mutton and covered his mouth with his hand your friend wishes to speak perhaps spitamenes asked his eyes gleamed dangerously philokles cleared his throat again your god should have a better eye to consequences then he said in greek the lady has a sting in her tail and a thousand armoured friends kineas translated do not blaspheme what you havent the wit to understand foreigner spitamenes tone hardened and around him persian noblemen handled their weapons kineas took another mouthful of food when he was done chewing he said either spitamenes is a man of his word in which case this is all posturing and we should enjoy our dinner or he is a treacherous cur and we will die kineas smiled at spitamenes and then spitamenes will die dont you think my wife is out there in the dark kineas shook his head as if he was a gentle father arguing with a favoured child and then he went back to eating spitamenes grew angrier at every pronouncement but he was a man of honour and kineas finished his meal unimpeded i will not ask you to guest again spitamenes said as the greeks mounted to leave as you did not trouble even to apologize for the seizure of srayanka youd be unlikely to get me to come kineas said your time is over the sakje have the power to stop iskander or not as they please when you sent him amazons as hostages you lost them as allies and you have done nothing this summer but lose prestige in every action you are done kineass voice had the sound of doom of prophecy spitamenes started as if he had stepped on a snake be gone before i regret my hosting he said keep from under our hooves persian kineas said if i find you there i will end you myself philokles listened to the bloodless tone in kineass voice not threat but a statement of facts like the voice of prophecy combined with the voice of command spitamenes frowned i had heard that you were a prophet kineas backed his charger a few steps and nodded shall i prophesy for you lord spitamenes said i care not but his eagerness and hesitancy were there in his voice and philokles was left with the impression that kineas was the elder of the two and then the persian asked will there be a great battle kineas nodded yes and will iskander lose will i triumph spitamenes asked kineas was silent for a time an uncomfortable time with dozens of torchlit persians surrounding him in the dark at last he said iskander will not win but you will lose i will die he laughed then as if all of life was a joke your death is coming but mine is near how will i die spitamenes asked pressing closer to kineass horse kineass face gave a spasm of fear or revulsion difficult for philokles to read in the firelight he looked at a man standing at spitamenes shoulder badly kineas said ask me no more spitamenes turned away and growled something at one of his lieutenants the crowd of torches dispersed go before i turn on you spitamenes said kineas nodded then he backed his horse checked to see that his friends were clear and rode away that night they made camp in a stand of old pines at the edge of a high bluff along the jaxartes the grass had been cropped recently and ataelus reported on a dozen sakje camps around them kineas could see their fires and he could see the fires of alexanders army on the far bank and smell the smoke that filled the valley of the jaxartes which hadnt seen so many people since it first rose from the meltwaters of the sogdian mountains when the gods were young srayanka had built them a camp or her household had with a heavy hide as a shelter and a pair of spears supporting an awning of woven branches to give the illusion of privacy right in under the supporting pines it was a far cry from the luxury in which an athenian officer might live and yet it touched kineas deeply no one else had any shelter since the wagons had rolled north and west and it had taken many hands to raise there was even a fire pit with a circle of rocks and a small fire fragrant with cedar she put a cup of wine in his hands after hed seen to thalassa and he drank it in careful sips as he admired the ropework on the hemp bindings that held the spears sitalkes for sure then he took her hand and drew her close and they kissed philokles came into the little clearing that held their camp he looked around as if puzzled and kineas could see he was drunk very nice philokles said he swayed a little diodorus followed him up the trail and behind him came leon and sitalkes and someone else moving in the darkness can i help you gentlemen kineas asked his voice redolent with the irritation of a man interrupted in kissing his wife philokles turned his head away and gave a lurch and a burp excuse me gentlemen not myself he grinned at kineas didnt know you wanted to be alone missed you diodorus came up and put his hand on the spartans shoulder come away philokles says hell be dead soon then well never see him philokles shook his head he raised his cup godlike kineas share this cup of wine he said and spilt some wine on the pine needles though whether in clumsiness or deliberate invocation it was hard to tell diodorus grabbed at philokles the spartan glided out of his hands and sprang back but in his haze of wine fumes hed forgotten the two spears and the ropes and he tripped there was a crash and philokles went down and the whole shelter came down with him he bellowed as he rolled through the small fire extinguishing it hades philokles you fucking idiot kineas grabbed the spartan by the arm and dragged him to his feet sweeping the man with his hand to get rid of coals philokles looked as if hed been hit with a plank didnt mean gods srayanka sorry he pushed kineas away roughly and began to try to gather up the pieces of the shelter he stumbled and managed to pick up a single rope sitalkes emerged from the darkness and temerix temerix took the spartans shoulder come he said in his heavy accent come friend we fix this come philokles wept i only break things he cried as the sindi smith pulled him along i make nothing srayanka grinned sitalkes make this right again she said she turned to kineas hes hurt in his soul husband go and help him behind her sitalkes had his fire kit out and was blowing coals to light and srayankas eyes glinted but dont take too long she said kineas found philokles by his own fire with a clay beaker of wine in his hand and temerix sitting by his side im sorry philokles said he was more sullen than sorry and his eyes were on the fire kineas reached past him and grabbed the wine cup he took a pull and then emptied the contents into the fire hey philokles shouted do you love me brother kineas asked philokles stopped moving then he drew himself up yes yes i do kineas nodded i love you too too much to watch you kill the hero in your breast with wine that was your last cup brother swear to me by all the gods and by my children that you will never drink wine again philokles was aghast never never for any reason swear if we are friends kineas saw an amphora pointfirst in the ground and he plucked it free temerix is this yours temerix spat never bring wine to philokles he said friend kineas tucked it under his arm mine now swear philokles philokles looked sly and sullen two casts for which his face was not naturally formed what if i dont kineas shrugged maybe ill never answer another one of your cursed questions or perhaps ill simply banish you and fight without you but if you dont stop drinking wine you are no companion of mine philokles came up fuck you he said reaching for the amphora kineas hit him on the chin then he put the amphora into the dirt carefully while the spartan backed away kineas raised his hands philokles took another step backwards and stopped he had adopted the guard stance of the pankration hands open held high to guard his face his left hand stretched forward then he came forward fast reaching with his left hand for a grapple kineas stepped forward inside the left and punched one two staggering philokles he retreated a step and kineas let him they stood facing each other philokles bellowed a shout of anger almost the cry of a wounded man and he charged his two feints were not the feints of a drunk and kineas bought the second and in a moment he was on his back in the dirt but he got his legs around philokles knees and rotated his hips tripping the big spartan and pulling him down he got both of the mans hands in his own and they grappled pushing for purchase with their feet and backs covered in dust it was hopeless for kineas to try to beat the spartan in a grapple but he continued to try until philokles had his head and arm locked under his shoulder and the pain was enough to drive the breath from his body and then suddenly philokles who had him at the point of submission sagged away in the dirt and lay on his back as if hed been hit in the head with a plank then he rolled to his feet and held out a hand kineas took it their hands clasped i swear by zeus and all the gods and by the shade of my mother who died to bear me and by the power of my love for you kineas that i will never be drunk again in your presence that i will never drink wine to excess and if i dishonour this oath may all the furies shred my soul philokles spoke in his sober voice may the gods hear you and support you in your oath kineas said but when i am gone you must stay on this path or it will be your death the spartan and the athenian embraced im sorry philokles said and burst into tears you need to stop being a soldier brother kineas said its the killing that makes you drink philokles wept for a while and then he stood straight what do people do when they dont drink he asked kineas picked up the amphora experiment youre the philosopher and at last after a year in the field the army of olbia as represented by the hardiest three hundred men and the western assagatje as represented by four hundred riders culled by two summers of war and the western sauromatae as represented by lots two hundred came to the gathering of all the sakje peoples queen zarina had camped the bulk of her forces in a bend of the jaxartes secure that the water at her back was deep and cold and that the mountains on her flanks were too difficult for any foe in the vale of the jaxartes she had gathered thirty thousand warriors and as many again lived in satellite camps as close as a days ride away or as far as ten days ride so that if the sakje had been grains of sand spread across a parchment it was as if the gods had tipped the parchment so that one corner of it held all the sand tons of it in one small area the grass was devastated and twice the whole army had had to move there were no deer to be hunted for fifty stades no fish in the river no wood for fires every tribe had sent away its weakest to their winter grounds to lessen the numbers and even then the queen had to rotate tribes out on to the grass and back to the river to watch iskander across the river the army of macedon concentrated forces from camps along the jaxartes the polytimeros and the oxus into one single mass of men horses and machines the siege of marakanda had been broken and only the thinnest garrison left oxen pulled the kings siege artillery up to his camp on the edge of the sea of grass the greatest horde of enemies the sakje had ever seen and still the macedonian officers stared at the dust clouds across the river and shuddered even odds against a foe who was mounted throughout her force north and east of alexanders army a smaller force just two thousand men sogdians and bactrians and mercenaries and a handful of sauromatae moved along the southern bank of the jaxartes searching for a ford under eumenes kineas heard it all from scouts from the sakje from srayanka and finally from ataelus himself before the last day of march was done the sun was setting on the valley of the jaxartes and below them twenty thousand horses milled every horse looking for the last clumps of grass along the river young men raced and shot bows women sharpened weapons and repaired tack tents of felt rose from some encampments and others had a few wagons but in the main it was a war camp and the people lay on the ground with the reins of their horses near to hand ataelus waved at the whole sweep of the people who covered the ground as far as the eye could see the power of the massagetae the sakje the dahae ataelus wore a grin that eliminated his cheekbones i was for boying here philokles rubbed his beard and watched transfixed while trying to take in what kineas had just told him so alexander will try to turn the sakje left he asked alexander will come right across the river kineas said with finality but my guess is that he will send a column to wrongfoot the scythians on their left and thats what ataelus says philokles could almost see it ares he said right across the river here no kineas said with a smile theres no ford here the queen chose her camp well upstream ten stades is where he will come he spoke with conviction and ataelus nodded the sakje screwed up his mouth short ride he said to battle he added after a pause if you know all this surely you can defeat alexander philokles asked kineas shook his head do i look like a sakje chief i will not command here spartan i can only share my views with queen zarina lets go and meet her but we may defeat him philokles asked again kineas halted his horse and leaned close i have no idea brother im not a seer im the commander of half a thousand cavalry so perhaps despite your concern for the triumph of panhellenism you could shut the fuck up about the battle philokles laughed youre nervous id never have believed it kineas glared but held his tongue philokles laughed again lets go and meet the queen of the sea of grass when the column was halted they had to camp on a site that had already been used and abandoned by other contingents and it took time to wedge eight hundred people and four times that many horses into the edge of the sprawling camp the site was good and water was plentiful but the grass was cropped to the roots antigonus laid out the horse lines almost in the bed of the river the only place where there was any grazing not already taken by other groups and he doubled the horse pickets because macedonians could be seen just a pair of bow shots away across the river lot rode up from the sauromatae at the back of the column with lady bahareh at his side he clasped hands with kineas she and zarina are old friends we zarina and i have traded some sword cuts good philokles said we can all hide behind bahareh the sauromatae spearmaiden grinned she was as thin as a tree branch and her hair was the colour of iron ill protect you little prince she said greetings lord kineas srayanka took ataelus and parshtaevalt and kineas took leon and diodorus philokles never required an invitation they took no escort and left their people cooking dinner they rode hard for the queens tent just a dozen stades away around the next bend in the river after travelling more than four hundred parasangs from the ford of the river god on the little borysthenes to the upper jaxartes queen zarina was almost a disappointment qares zarinas messenger earlier in the summer was the first to recognize them he ordered a group of adolescent girls to hold their horses and ushered them into the queens tent a magnificent construction in red and white there were no guards and the tent was full of tribal leaders and sakje knights as well as other massagetae in simpler dress and a dozen slaves if qares hadnt been standing in respectful silence next to him his whole attention focused on a short woman in a simple dress kineas might have mistaken who among the assembly was the queen there were several women with regal bearing two of them in armour but the queen stood towards the edge of the group looking at arrow shafts one by one she looked down the shafts making quiet comments to a child who stood by her with her goldcovered gorytos until thirty were chosen the discards were carried out of the tent kineas had time to observe her as she spoke in quiet tones to the child and to a man of her own age who stood at her shoulder zarina was a short woman with irongrey hair in straight braids woven tight with gold foil the only sign of her royalty that she wore on her person on a lacquered armour stand behind her sat a coat of iron scales with alternating rows of gold with a golden gorget as rich as srayankas and a golden helmet surmounted by a gryphon whose eyes were picked out in garnets the child clearly her squire replaced the gorytos on the armour stand and brought her a longhandled axe with a double blade she rubbed her thumb across the blades first one and then the other and smiled as she smiled she raised her eyes and in one glance took in qares and then the group with him you found them she said stepping forward the tent fell silent as she raised her voice and every head turned srayanka went to meet her she inclined her head the closest any sakje managed to a bow zarina took both of her hands you must be the lady srayanka of the cruel hands she said in sakje she had a deep hoarse voice for a woman but her tone was warm i am lady srayanka i have brought four hundred of my people to the muster and my husband has brought two hundred greeks who are our allies and prince lot she turned to invite lot forward and the sauromatae lord bowed his head with a smile zarina and i are old friends he said and bitter foes zarina said sometimes their eyes locked and the tent was silent zarinas tent the entire tent was alternating red and white silk panels heavily oiled and almost translucent the light from the coloured panels fell differently on the people in the tent the queen was brightly lit under a white panel while lot was covered in red like blood he bowed again so you have not followed that charlatan pharmenax she said to lot does he still call himself the king of all the sauromatae prince lot has been fighting iskander all summer qares put in kineas could see that the claim of an old enmity was founded on something there was tension in her stance and lot was stiffer than usual only a fool would follow pharmenax lot said i forbade you to go west zarina said i said i would return with allies lot shot back and i have bahareh stepped forward distracting the queen and the two embraced but i forbade it zarina said kineas thought that she was speaking to bahareh alone the sauromatae woman punched the queens shoulder he did as he said he would eh zarinas brows narrowed but then her face cleared so you have welcome as if every breath had been held there was a sigh throughout the tent and then conversation started again queen zarina beckoned and kineas stepped forward in his turn close up he became aware that she had the darkest green eyes that kineas had ever seen on a human being her hands were as hard as a woodcutters you have truly come all the way from the sea of darkness she asked mother of the clans we have indeed ridden from the western sea srayanka responded i promised to come and i am here though less than a tithe of our strength has come with me zarina waved her hand as if this loss of strength was of no import and the cities of the western sea sent a contingent so that greeks will ride to fight greeks this has been reported to me all summer and still i find it a wonder zarinas gaze returned to kineas and gave him the sort of careful examination that a sakje gave a horse she considered buying or stealing you are baqca she said this i have heard kineas bowed i am the strategos of olbia he said a war leader hmm zarina replied then she dismissed kineas as other leaders were introduced by srayanka diodorus whose red hair and beard made the queen laugh and parshtaevalt and leon whose dark skin she touched several times next came ataelus she raised an eyebrow surely you are of my people she asked ataelus gave his greek shrug many years ago i rode west lady he answered now i serve the lady srayanka zarina pursed her lips and motioned for the next man to be presented and philokles stepped forward she looked him up and down you are a zpartan she asked i am philokles answered obviously pleased that here at the edge of the known world the barbarians still knew the word spartan hmm she murmured the two women in armour laughed a toughlooking pair one of them pushed past to feel philokles arm muscles she nodded approval thats what a man should look like she said to srayanka why didnt you marry that one srayanka snorted he didnt know how to ride she laughed zarina laughed so hard she had to cross her arms on her gut when she recovered she was still smiling broadly i welcome all of you to my camp she said ill see if my slaves can find space for you for dinner tonight we set the battle order are your horses ready to fight srayanka nodded ready enough we miss the grain of home none of our chargers are at their best zarina nodded were at the end of the grazing iskander is at the end of his the fight must come soon dinner was simple and reminded kineas of dinners with satrax spiced mutton served in the same bronze cauldron in which it had been cooked and every man and woman dipping their flatbread into the pot the mutton was delicious but there was no wine and no oil no one spoke the gathered guests ate quickly and efficiently and then sat quietly until zarina rose to her feet now she said to her guests we will discuss how to show iskander our strength the meeting of the chiefs of all the scythians reminded kineas that he was truly among barbarians everyone spoke at once on and on no considerations of tactics ever rose to the surface of the meeting but rather chieftains demanded precedence in battle the left of the line the right of the line the position guarding the standard based on ancient custom or hardwon privilege shouted and debated from one bearded warlord to another queen zarina appeared indifferent watching her tribal leaders with obvious pride sure of her strength kineas stood silent with diodorus srayanka and philokles around him whispering from time to time in disgust at the chaos and the arrogance lot gave a wry grin id forgotten what it was like he said ataelus shook his head fight for too long with greeks he said sakje for talking do they know who alexander is diodorus asked do they think they can just ride around the plain and shoot arrows and call it a victory philokles had remained silent for over an hour i admire these people he said but no one here has proposed that we simply ride away and leave alexander to starve on the high plains where is the wisdom of the assagatje where is their satrax srayanka pulled on a braid fretting for her children i had forgotten what we were like in my fathers time she said truly kam baqca and satrax made us something greater and you my husband the three of you made each leader see his place perhaps if you spoke to the queen diodorus said to srayanka srayanka shook her head i am as much a foreigner here as any of you greeks i will go and see to our children my breasts are heavy she kissed kineas lightly lot made a face as if he smelled something foul i know zarina of old he said you wont find it easy to tell her anything she esteems women above men but not as much if they bear children he looked at srayanka who nodded agreement she esteems men but only for their strength not their wisdom even in war lot glanced at philokles the spartan might approach her with a message she was impressed by his size and his name and lady bahareh has known her for years the chieftains went on shouting until the sun had set and scouts came in to report that iskander had moved boltshooters up to the banks of the river and was assembling bladders and rafts srayanka rode away kineas rubbed his beard and listened to the growing excitement rumours of alexanders imminent attack only fed the shouting and the queen watched with a tolerant amusement that proclaimed her more interested in being the warlord of these chiefs than in working to defeat the common foe diodorus shook his head theyre going to get their heads handed to them ares balls kineas have we ridden fifteen thousand stades so that we can watch alexander dispatch another horde of tribes the way he did the thracians let us be gone the rout will be ugly kineas was tired of standing there is some godsent irony he said that we can all but see how alexander will attack and no one here cares to listen to us he shrugged and took his companions out of the great tent and into the gathering gloom of the sakje camp where three thousand fires twinkled along the curve of the river the air smelled of horse and burning wood we should ride back while the sun gives us a little light kineas said i would try to speak to the queen if you gave me leave philokles said he glanced at bahareh and ataelus when have you ever needed my permission kineas slapped the spartan on the shoulder this is not as bad as you all seem to think their very chaos will serve them against alexander it is almost impossible to plan a battle against a hundred generals new forces will ride on to the field all day and each will commit themselves as they see fit unbound by precedent or structure what would you have the queen know bahareh asked kineas was looking for their horses tethered in a herd of magnificent horseflesh brought by two hundred chiefs he was pleased that thalassa held her own surrounded by admiring massagetae children and a dozen respectful adolescents a severelooking young woman handed him her reins and nodded that is a horse she said you sell her kineas grinned his thoughts suddenly infected with an image of thalassas foals never he said in sakje but i wish you may find as fine a horse they nodded to each other and kineas used his spear to vault into the saddle showing off for the children like a much younger warrior he leaned down to bahareh ask the queens permission for us to ride north along the river to the next ford to guard against a flanking move tell her we think that alexander will send his best cavalry and his hardest infantry across with the dawn tomorrow or the next day and that he will send a force to cross upriver to the north ask her to allow us to stop the northern thrust he caused thalassa to circle to the admiration of all thats all philokles asked alexanders coming across and well hold the northern ford kineas nodded thats all trying to tell these people how to fight alexander would be like trying to tell an athenian how to argue any halfmeasures we push on them will only impede them bahareh looked at kineas with respect you are wise i expected you to tell the queen how to fight philokles nodded wait for us either she will see us or she will not either way we will be brief diodorus smirked show her your muscles and you wont be so brief spartan all night maybe philokles punched the athenian in the knee just hard enough to hurt she values men in her bed to just the extent that i value women the spartan said bahareh coughed in her hand philokles waved to ataelus who shrugged at kineas and followed philokles and then his faded red cloak swirled and he was gone in the dusk kineas rode his charger up and down a boy came up on a tall horse a captured nisaean of which he was justly proud and kineas in the grip of some daimon accepted his offer of a race torches were brought and ten more riders materialized from the gloom while diodorus cursed him for a fool are you a boy with a battle tomorrow hush kineas said i am making a sacrifice to poseidon diodorus pursed his lips as long as you arent just showing off he called as kineas rode to the starting spear the race was like swimming in darkness and fire from the first surge of thalassas hindquarters to the last pounding moments as the leading knot of them burst through the circle of light by the finish to a roar so loud that it rose above the debating in zarinas tent like an offering to the horsegod to whom kineas sent his prayer winging while the sakje embraced him for his victory diodorus sat on his charger shaking his head are you twelve years old he asked kineas shook his head let us make that sacrifice to poseidon kineas managed to convey that he wanted to purchase a goat and the animal was brought a massagetae baqca resplendent in caribou antlers and a silk robe led them past zarinas tent to the camp altar kineas sacrificed the animal himself slashing the beasts throat and stepping free of the blood with practised ease he raised the hymn with leon and diodorus poseidon lord of horses thou lovest the clipclop beat of hooves in hardfought battle and neighs to thee sound sweet and when our blackmaned horses the winning vase may gain their swiftness cheers the ruler of the wildly tossing main they sang to the end kineas grinning like a man half his age philokles came up singing the hymn and with him were many of zarinas commanders and at the back of the group zarina herself talking and waving her hands at ataelus who wore a deep frown kineas stood by the altar with thalassa beside him surrounded by massagetae and dahae warriors many of whom reached up to touch his horse he saw a girl clip a few hairs from her tail and he was about to step in when he found himself face to face with zarina now i see how my young cousin could marry a greek she said she nodded go north if that is where you see the enemy kineax i have heard the spartan i have understood she shrugged no queen has ever faced a battle this great with the whole might of the people i am not a persian to kiss and cuddle my chiefs until they go sullenly to some carefully ordered place in the battle line nor am i the quin with chariots and horses and lines of men like pieces on a game board i am the queen of the sakje and my chiefs will fight like dogs for a place in the line do as you will you are a man of war those are my orders to you as they are the orders i give to every chief you are a free man do as you will as they rode back philokles rattled on about his time with her very much the sort of barbarian that solon or thales might have admired utterly free he shook his head barely visible in the moonlight i warned her that spitamenes was coming she knows him i gather that it is a marriage of convenience as long as he is on the right while we are on the left kineas said if he comes in front of srayanka she will kill him and to hades with the consequence they reached their camp in the last glow of the western horizon fires were lit and warriors ate their fill leon waited until they took their horses out to the picket lines we have food for two more days and then things will get tight he said the whole host of the sakje is in the same position diodorus said bitterly all alexander need do is wait and we will all melt away two hours ago you were ready to leave kineas said ive ridden all this way diodorus said shrugging off his own mercurial comments alexander is in the same situation hes converged all of his armies in the east at the edge of a desert and hes spent the summer fighting partisans he doesnt have the food stores hes used to well fight him tomorrow or the next day my wager goes on the next day srayanka came up with antigonus and the rest of the chiefs and officers as if kineas had called a council they stood quietly and kineas smiled to think of the sakje outside the queens red and white silk tent theyre fine kineas asked srayanka srayanka smiled would i wander out here to talk of war if my children were unwell she asked she looked wryly at samahe i am becoming my mother when young she rode with the spearmaidens but in middle age she was a mother first and her hand grew light kineas took her chin and kissed her i dont think your hand will grow light he said let spitamenes come under it tomorrow and well see she said alexander is the enemy diodorus drawled alexander was polite srayanka said she tossed her head hephaestion that one i would geld if only for urvaras sake kineas felt his guts roil i hadnt heard this srayanka shrugged shes a tough girl he did not break her and the young olbian boy loves her and she has healed no more need be said but hephaestion no one looking at srayanka in the light of a fire needed to wonder if her hand had grown light she cocked her head to one side so husband do you see it in your head there in the firelight kineas outlined his plan he drew pictures in the dust with the tip of a bronze knife hed found in the fire pit ataelus and i agree that alexander will send a force north either he will lead it himself or he will send someone he trusts its something he learned from parmenion it will be philotas wont it he murdered philotas diodorus said old age must be getting to you more fool he philotas was his best after parmenion so eumenes perhaps the cardian craterus philokles asked i never served the monster myself but i know the names why not craterus kineas shrugged somebody dangerous with good troops probably all cavalry in my head i still see philotas he paused and poured a libation to the dead mans shade theyll go north to the next ford which ataelus has already located and try to push across into the queens left flank well meet them at the ford if were quick thats the best service we can do for this army everyone nodded and if zarina loses well have a clear road home srayanka said kineas nodded yes he didnt elaborate let us say we meet this macedonian and rout him back across the ford samahe asked she shrugged looking around why do you look at me this way we have been known to win battles in the past that got her a laugh then what eh she looked around defiant kineas nodded i really cant say we could cross after them and return the favour but i would expect that any fight will leave us too beaten up to turn their flank and were too few we ought to be able to turn in on our own side however kineass knife point traced a black furrow along the sakje bank of the line that marked the jaxartes and strike the flank of their main effort our horses would be blown srayanka said thoughtfully diodorus had found a heavy basket to sit on he leaned forward the basket creaking under his weight and he pointed a stick at the map in the dirt what if alexanders main effort is the northern ford he asked hmm said philokles how long would we last kineas shook his head i wouldnt even fight beyond some skirmishing to make the ford cost him he gave a bitter smile we wouldnt last long no diodorus said and it wouldnt be worth spit anyway this sakje army isnt a phalanx philokles if you hit the sakje in the flank they just ride away and fight another day if alexander wants a fight he has to goad them to it fix them in place and then hit them srayanka nodded as if she had held a conversation with herself listen let us fight like assagatje let us move all our remounts to here she indicated a place just west of the ford then pointed at diodorus if diodoruss worst instincts are right and alexander comes north we can fight in retreat change horses and vanish no pursuit could possibly catch us on fresh horses yes all around the fire the chiefs and officers nodded lot slapped her back cruel hands you are still the cunning one she went on smiling a very unmotherly smile at her husband if we meet this flanking force and defeat it we take the time to change horses and we ride to the battle in the centre on fresh mounts kineas grabbed her and kissed her they kissed and the other leaders whooped and mocked them when he left her lips he shook his head you kiss better than any of my other cavalry commanders he said and she kicked his shin diodorus looked at the map in the sand again we should move tonight he said he looked at srayanka and shrugged apologetic forty stades under a bright moon is nothing to us after the desert and then there will be no dust to betray us odysseus is as usual correct kineas said he and srayanka exchanged a long look because precious hours were being taken from them never to be replaced we will ride together as we did when our love was young she said and she began to choke on her words but she fought through unbroken i will ask you the names of things in greek and you will ask me the sakje words and we will forget the future and know only what is now philokles couldnt bear it and he turned away ataelus was already calling for horses and antigonus was passing the unpopular news but the rest stayed by the fire the night on the plains was brisk i wonder where coenus is diodorus asked he waited a moment and then decided that kineas had not heard him do you wonder he began and kineas turned coenus should be watching the sun rise over the mountains of hyrkania in the morning kineas said athena and hermes have we been riding that long in the desert philokles asked ataelus grunted yes diodorus thumbed his beard every time you kiss srayanka i miss sappho more kineas slapped his shoulder there are great days ahead he said he felt sad and happy at the same time and then after a pause see to philokles when i am gone diodorus coughed to cover some tears that stood bright on his cheeks it just hit me that it will be as you say that you do know the hour of your death he sniffled are you sure kineas gathered him in an embrace i know this battle he said simply i die philokles diodorus asked wiping his eyes with the back of his hand ares its srayanka who will need us no kineas said she will be queen and all the sakje will be her husband philokles will have only you diodorus chewed his lip you remember sword lessons with phocion i think of them all the time the two men were still locked in embrace i will be the last left he was weeping the tears flowing down his cheeks like the muddy waters of the jaxartes so you must be the best kineas said when i fall you command not just for one action either i leave you the bequest of all my unfought battles diodorus backed away his hand hiding his face i was never the strategos you were he complained kineas gripped his neck two years ago you were a trooper he said soon we will fight alexander you know how to command you love to command before the gods i do diodorus said i leave you the bequest of my unfought battles kineas said again you should be king king of the whole of the bosporus kineas felt his own tears as he thought of all he would miss his children most of all make satyrus king he said im too much an athenian to be a king the other athenian stood straight i will he said they covered forty stades in a dream of darkness and the soft glitter of moonlight on the sand and the hand of artemis the huntress covered them ataeluss prodromoi waited at every obstacle and every turn guiding them around a camp of sakje in the dark clearing them across a gully with a burbling stream at the base and around a shaled hill that might have hurt the horses in the dark until they came to the back of a long ridge running perpendicular to the jaxartes ataelus rode up next to kineas in the dark for fighting he said quietly he pointed down the ridge at the river as it bowed through a deep curve in the moonlight iskander he said and pointed across the river where a thousand orange stars shone in the foothills of the sogdian mountains alexanders cooking fires they rode on for an hour the column winding back to be lost to sight in the darkness over the big ridge twelve stades later as kineas reckoned it they descended sharply from the path theyd followed towards the river which they could hear but not see he rode down into the vale heedless of possible enemy patrols eager to see the ground as best he could and srayanka came with him her household clattering along behind they rode hand in hand almost silent at the edge of the ford they halted well srayanka asked kineas shook his head and grinned for whatever it means this is not the place of my dream he said too narrow he pointed across no downed trees no giant dead tree on the far shore srayanka exhaled as if she had held a single breath all day so she asked kineas looked at the sky i speak no hubris he said when the macedonians come on this field we will triumph they turned quietly and rode back across the ridge to camp and perhaps to grapple a few hours of sleep from the last of darkness and the prebattle jitters but not for kineas he lay awake his body entwined with hers he no longer needed sleep he no longer intended to cede a moment to sleep the end was as close as the point of his spear i want the enemy to see nothing but sakje kineas said srayanka nodded as did lot sitting on his cloak kineas was fixing his blue horsehair crest to his helmet he had an odd feeling as if he had done all these things before so many times that he was an actor playing the same part on many different days in the theatre all around him the olbians were polishing their gear and affixing their helmet crests the hyperetes of each troop moving among them to inspect their work men used ash gathered from their last fire pits to put a fine polish on their bronze men skilled with stones put a fine edge on spear points and swords a few of the keltoi spoke loudly but most were quiet philokles sat on a rock sober he was combing out his hair behind him the red rim of the sun rose above the distant mountains in the east sitalkes who had once been kineass slave came up holding a pair of javelins with long thin shafts and linen throwing cords i didnt think you had any he said looking at the ground may ares bless you sitalkes the pleasure of a good weapon made kineas beam i hadnt even thought of it where did you get them he hefted one theyre beautiful sitalkes glanced at temerix who was watching from a distance glaring at them under heavy brows temerix made the points i set them he grinned good wood cutdown lances the two heads were gemlike gleaming bluered in the first light far better work than was usually expended on javelins kineas embraced sitalkes and then walked over and embraced temerix who stared at the ground while being hugged and then laughed aloud when the strategos turned away kineas thought that hed never heard the sindi smith laugh as ordered srayankas people patrolled the edge of the river their forms visible in a flash of gold or bronze or red leather most of her warriors were hidden in stands of trees on the near side of the jaxartes and a handful the boldest prowled the far bank the enemy force announced itself just before the end of the dawn when shadows were still long on the ground and spear points winked against the last of the darkness their dust cloud showed them to be moving carefully and their outriders made contact with ataeluss prodromoi and drove them back easily kineas watched from a stand of trees on the ridge his helmet under his arm his reserves hidden in a fold of ground behind him at the waters edge an hour later two squadrons of bactrians pushed parshtaevalt unceremoniously across the river brushing aside his heroics and the feverish archery of his companions in one quick charge that sent the sakje fleeing for their lives srayanka was forced to reveal all of her ambushers to stem the rout her countercharge stopped the bactrians on the near bank and emptied a number of saddles but the small size of her force was revealed the enemy commander came up with his staff and more cavalry eumenes kineas said with satisfaction he knew the cardian immediately from his heavy athletic physique the story was that philip alexanders father had seen the cardian fighting in an athletic contest and drafted him on the spot the cardian had never disappointed the father or the son and his physique superb as it was came second to his brain eumenes rallied the bactrians easily and his force began to deploy along the river easily outflanking srayankas sakje on both flanks the enemy commander had men on fresh horses and quivers full of arrows and the sakje began to flinch giving ground from the riverbank and then abandoning the tree line altogether penpusher diodorus said with disgust referring to the cardians post as military secretary they were lying in the gravel at the edge of the ridge caution personified kineas nudged him and pointed carefully drawing his friends attention to the bright flash of a golden helmet he wont be cautious he said upazan was waving his lance pointing across the river upstream a stade or so ataeluss prodromoi burst from cover into the flank of a troop of mercenary horse shooting at the gallop the enemy cavalry detached some files to defeat them across the river eumenes gave a sharp nod as if the revealing of ataeluss ambush had decided him the bactrian cavalry put away their bows upazan was already in the water with thirty armoured sauromatae ares balls kineas diodorus rolled off the top of the ridge and got to his feet he is coming across diodorus sounded as if hed just been invited to a particularly fine party kineas shook his head he ought to give it up no point to a flank march that meets resistance diodorus stepped into the handloop on his spear haft and sprang on to his charger without touching her back a dramatic mount that brought a rustle of approval from the olbian troopers he bowed from the saddle to hades with that hes coming kineas rubbed his beard showy bastard he said to diodorus and leaped on to the back of his second charger without touching the geldings back he grinned at diodorus who shook his head whos the showy bastard now strategos he asked kineas took his spears from carlus now for victory he said to the assembled olbians and keltoi he touched his heels to the geldings flanks and rode carefully to the top of the ridge until he could once again see into the valley of the jaxartes just as on the oxus the macedonians and their allies had formed on a broad front intending to swamp srayankas thin force six squadrons of bactrians sogdians and mercenary cavalry covered almost four stades along the bank spread out because sometimes the banks were too high or the scrub too thick for cavalry eumenes trumpeter blew a long call and then repeated it and the whole force came across in a rush it showed better discipline than crateruss force had demonstrated and kineass opinion of eumenes the cardian went up again srayankas household shot one volley at close range and broke cantering to the rear easily gaining ground on the riders coming across the river the river was only dactyloi deep in most places but horses wanted the water or they feared what lay beneath and they picked their way across eumenes visible in a purple cloak and a silvered bronze boeotian helmet with a gold wreath of bravery atop it sat peering under his hand watching the ridge where kineas sat on the back of his horse he turned shouting something at his hyperetes kineas felt like hiding an irrational desire given that it was almost certainly too late for eumenes to save his force from kineass trap kineas muttered a prayer to tyche that she not punish him for this mental hubris of course it was all still in the hands of the gods the trumpeter raised his trumpet at virtually the same moment that diodorus led the whole of the olbian cavalry over the ridge at the trot and put them straight into a gallop the ridge was nothing a few men high at its highest point but it was sufficient to add momentum to the olbians eumenes trumpet call rang out kineas watched as hundreds of enemy horsemen hesitated in the river or just reaching the top of the bank the signal was obviously a recall kineas turned to darius at his side tell lot now he said darius grinned and pushed his horse into a gallop at his side philokles laughed all morning he said i have been dreading the fact that i would finally have to fight on horseback youre a fine horseman kineas said the best in sparta philokles said he was laughing the olbian cavalry struck the bactrians and sauromatae at the edge of the jaxartes and blew through them unhorsing dozens of men and knocking horses to the ground or into the water their wedge was scarcely disordered and diodorus led them on right into the jaxartes an arrowhead pointed at the enemy commander off to kineass right srayanka rallied her household with a raised hand turned her horse under her like a circus performer in athens and led them straight back at the enemy her household formed its wedge at the trot and she kept her force slow so that they hit the shattered tangle of the bactrians and stayed to kill them kineas could see upazans helmet in the melee and he saw leon pushing to meet the sauromatae boy leon downed a betterarmoured foe with a spear thrust to the face recovered to parry a lance thrust from an unhorsed man and had to sidestep his horse to avoid being unhorsed himself sitalkes finished the man with the lance and leon pressed in but upazan turned his horse parrying blows from three olbians and ran baulked of his prey leon reared his horse and threw his spear it went over the keltoi in front of him and struck upazan squarely between the shoulders and bounced off his scale thorax eumenes the cardian was looking around for support and then he was riding away followed by his staff with diodorus hard on his heels the athenian caught eumenes trumpeter at the edge of the rising battle haze and tipped him out of the saddle with a swipe of his spear to the north the enemys mercenary cavalry were across the stream and rallying on srayankas flank coming forward at a collected trot in a strong tetragon unlike eumenes the mercenary commander saw his part of the trap in time to respond and he wheeled to face lots sauromatae on the flat ground a stade north of the ford and both forces vanished in a towering cloud of dust across the jaxartes antigonus was sounding the rally call kineas looked over the battlefield one more time you cant have everything he said the sauromatae are in for a fight lets go he waved to his escort the only reserve he had and they were off over the ridge and through the dust cloud of srayankas last melee her golden gorget shone like the sun and he found her easily i need to help lot he shouted our horses are tired she called but she sent dozens of her household knights to swell his ranks as they rode north along the jaxartes the mercenaries were holding their own their backs to the river visible through the battle haze like spirits in the underworld trot kineas ordered he had fifty men and they began to pull in on either side of him to make a wedge he wheeled his horse to make sure sure that he would punch into the mercenaries and not disorder the sauromatae and then the dust stole his sight and he was in a tunnel of sound and fury and fear a spear came out of the scrum and tore into his getae geldings neck just as he threw his first he never saw whether he hit his man or not and then he was sword to sword with a greek and the getae horse was sinking between his legs he took a blow on his bridle gauntlet and hacked the man between his helmet and his cuirass and they went down together and he was punched off his feet by the next horse in his file riding over him he curled into a ball his side almost numb with pain where a horse hoof had hit him for the third time in four weeks he tasted grit between his teeth and tried to spit his own dying horse screamed as yet another horse trampled it and fell and the weight of the horses rump crushed kineas to the earth drawing a scream of pain from him but the gods did not utterly desert him and the horses weight was shared by his own gelding they both rolled away maddened and yet no hoof caught him amidst the warp and woof of their tangle he crawled a few feet clear brother philokles asked he reached down a strong hand and lifted kineas out of the dirt and up on to his own chargers back as if kineas weighed less than nihmu i would have sworn by all the gods that you had told me to avoid coming off my horse in a battle kineas put his hands around the spartans waist fuck yourself he said thankfully the fight was over before kineas was rehorsed and he was the only casualty his bodyguards were deeply ashamed as neither of them had seen him fall and their apologies had all the drama the keltoi could bring to any theatre lot emerged from the dust and pulled off his helm his golden armour was scratched in several places and his sword was gone by the gods he said that was a fight to remember who were they your cousins kineas watched the last of the greeks crossing the jaxartes harried by ataeluss scouts and still in good order greeks and persians under a good officer kineas said his side hurt when he laughed or breathed he had broken ribs this officer lot asked leading a horse forward the man on the horses back looked defiant he had bright blond hair and a heavy face kineas didnt know him ransom kineas asked lot with a grimace for the pain lot shrugged he was brave i unhorsed him at the end i thought i might keep him back at the ford srayanka and diodoruss trumpets were busy where are you from hipparch philokles asked the man looked from one greek spear to the next with wonder amphipolis he said youre all greek lot spat eat my scrotum he said in sakje listen officer of amphipolis kineas said he felt the goddess at his elbow listen friend ride away go free your ransom is this to go in person to the parthenon and sacrifice to athena the greek officer sat straight i will do that he said dully his elation at escaping death was slipping into an awareness of defeat ill just keep your horse lot said pulling the reins take him lord good kineas said he mounted the thessalian gratefully although he needed help and it hurt he pointed back to the far ridge where the remounts awaited and touched philokles on the shoulder lets go and find the others they rode away olbians and keltoi and sauromatae leaving one greek cavalryman alone dismounted in the dust by the time they reached the ford eumenes was gone and they could hear his men rallying on the flat ground above the jaxartes already three stades away he wont come back diodorus said kineas watched the macedonians from beneath his hand breathing hard athena i thought i was done for he kept watching im inclined to agree hes going somewhere else kineas looked back across the ford how badly did we hurt him philokles shook his head thirty or forty men a bee sting kineas nodded let the prisoners go dismounted they wont fight us again today if they have to walk he slumped i need to wash in the river and i need someone philokles to wrap my ribs so that i can ride we could just ride away diodorus said srayanka nodded we turned them she said no man can say we have not done our part kineas dropped from his horse to the ground and sitalkes helped philokles strip his armour they tried to be gentle but kineas felt his vision tunnel and twice he cried out from the pain free at last of the scale shirt he picked himself up and walked into the water the cold helped him as did the feeling of the grit running away he splashed water on his torso wincing as every motion of his left arm sent a pulse of pain down his chest and into his groin srayanka held out a sheet of linen as a towel all my maidens are jealous she said kineas tried to smile he felt better but there were so many layers of pain and fatigue that he wasnt sure he could function he had lost a great deal in the dust when his horse died under him philokles took another length of linen from leon and began to wind it around kineas with the whole strength of his arms kineas couldnt breath much but the pain in his side diminished i think weve done our part diodorus said he obviously didnt like what he was seeing what was our part kineas asked we did our part when we stopped alexander on the oxus when we rescued you my lady when we stopped zopryon philokles was binding his chest winding it around and around his upper thorax kineas found it difficult to breathe and srayanka could see it you are wounded take the children and the rest of the wounded and start west she said we will yet cheat this prophecy kineas took the deepest breath he could manage and was delighted to find no pain at the bottom of the air even as his twin vision saw things far away even now zarina is winning or losing this battle he said listen to me she planned to line the riverbank alexander has his siege artillery guess what will happen the phalangites will have room to claw a foothold on the bank when alexander leads his cavalry across will the dahae and the massagetae hold diodorus shrugged so he said theyll run and then theyll stop alexander will proclaim victory nothing will be changed isnt that what weve learned on the plains philokles mounted his charger the same horse that satrax had given him in the snow a year and more ago now kineas seeks to teach us a different lesson my friend kineas took his children from nihmu and kissed them both you will protect them he asked until they begin to protect me she said goodbye baqca kineas turned for his horse philokles gave kineas a hand and srayanka pushed and together they got kineas up on thalassa get the horses watered kineas said all of them srayanka nodded as did lot kineas sat silent for a long time and gradually his friends his staff the chieftains and all around him became quiet he was about to speak when he saw the eagle he pointed off to the south the eagle was rising slowly from across the river clearly burdened by something probably a rabbit the preys entrails hung down between the eagles wings unbalancing his flight the bird turned and beat slowly towards them wings pumping the air among the greeks and sakje all conversation ceased and every head watched the bird as it flew slowly erratically and as it closed kineas could see that the eagle had been feeding on the carcass of the rabbit whose blood stained its white fur in streaks the eagle rose again on a draught of warm air as it came over the bend in the jaxartes where the officers had gathered while kineass wounds were tended then the eagle vented a raucous scream pivoted on a wingtip and dropped the carcass of the rabbit so that it plummeted to earth making thalassa shy and bouncing as high as a mans head before flopping almost at kineass feet the eagle screamed again and turned away leaving kineas with an impression of fierce mad intelligence from its golden eyes rid of the carcass it flew like the wind itself rose into the heavens and raced away the waves of pain from mounting had vanished with the eagle he straightened his back and raised his voice listen he said would you leave a brother in a fight this is not about winning winning it is just as diodorus has said this is about virtue and you will die for virtue diodorus asked but his eyes were on the sky wouldnt you kineas asked you never left me in the agora that day diodorus you might have run diodorus put his hand before his eyes kineas took a painful breath this is what we do friends lets do it well srayanka kissed him then she rose clamping her mare between her legs and stretching her spine sakje she shouted will you follow the king to battle baqcaking they roared a long drawnout roar like the sound of lions at the edge of night she was crying many of them were crying but the dust dried their tears as they rode they rode five stades or more seeing only the ephemera of battle a fleeing rider a wandering horse with its entrails dragging behind screaming in pain time had flowed away under them like the rivers of the steppe and it was afternoon and despite fresh horses they were tired and then they could hear the battle before they could see it a cacophony of horse noise and metal that filled the air swirls of dust came floating over the low ridge in front of them as if ejected from the battle or as if the spirits of the dead were fleeing kineas stopped his horse at the base of the ridge he waved to ataelus go and be my eyes he said ataelus gave a sad smile for you he called and he and his wife galloped diagonally up the ridge kineas turned to the officers dismount have the troopers take a drink he said when we go over the ridge well have the sakje on the right the sauromatae in the centre and the olbians on the left where they are least likely to get entangled with the massagetae or the dahae he looked at them all unless ataelus tells me something that shocks me we will go over the ridge and straight into the maelstrom diodorus was ashstraight sitting his horse as if on parade in athens what is our objective he asked kineas raised an eyebrow i intend to cut my way to alexander he said but failing that remember what zarina said you are warriors do as you will he allowed himself a small smile obedient warriors in crisp formations he won an answering smile from diodorus he was considering a farewell speech a classic battle oration when he saw ataelus careering down the ridge samahe at his heels the mans body language screamed of disaster and kineas abandoned his notion of a formal goodbye mount he called he waited until the slackers were mounted walk he called he waved his arms to indicate that the sauromatae and the sakje should form arrowheads to the right as he had described srayanka reached out a hand a hard hand with a doesoft back and they clasped hands like soldiers goodbye she said wait for me across the river live long queen he shouted back in sakje and they were parted her column forming to the right as his bore straight up the ridge ataelus pulled up next to him the zarinas standard is down he said the dahae are leaving the field ares wept diodorus said and kineas thought this is not what i saw even thalassa laboured over the last of the climb but before the sun had set another fingersbreadth kineas topped the ridge and the whole of the battlefield was laid out before him a bowl of war covering eight stades or more from ridge to ridge and what he saw shook him nearer to him scythian warriors on the other slope of the ridge were retreating shooting arrows in the face of a heavy line of enemy cavalry macedonians and greeks and sogdians all intermixed the scythians were spread thin and they gave ground quickly and never tried to rally down in the centre of the bowl the pikemen of the phalanx had established a line across the ford and had pushed on for some distance a rubble of dead horses visible even at this distance marked the futility of the sakje resistance but there was just one phalanx the other was visible pikes erect across the river behind the line of siege machines only far away at the limit of vision on the sakje right did the army of macedon seem to be getting the worst of it there and only there was the movement of the antlike contestants retrograde years of watching battles and serving in them had gifted kineas with an instant grasp of the meaning of the hundreds of signs sounds motion even the quality of reflection of light could tell you which direction a man was moving the macedonian left was losing the rest of their army was at the point of victory over all of it the fog of ares rose from the sandy ground to obscure everything but the wraithlike movements and the strongest glints of polished metal the sakje still glittered with gold so that even through the battle haze kineas could estimate their positions nowhere could he find queen zarina who should have been in the centre but just to the near side of the enemy centre just behind the fighting kineas could see a purple cloak surrounded by aides even as he watched alexander was leading a wedge of companions into the massagetae nobles to his front and behind the macedonian lines was the river dead trees filled the ford and across the river a huge dead tree towered over the field stark and awesome and kineas felt the full weight of his doom he shivered and his side hurt something liquid seemed to move inside his skin and he swayed in the saddle he began to turn his horse he thought of how he might after all his posturing leave the field flee with honour or without it i do not want to die he thought his breath burned in his throat and his heart seemed to pump out the last of his blood so that he was cold the setting sun was red like the blood of a dying man and it shone on his men as they crested the hill barring any possible retreat and they reminded him more than reminded him of who he was they were strong unbeaten three crisp triangles that darkened the ridge so that there was immediate commotion in the macedonian centre and the sakje on the ridge before him panicked assuming that they were macedonians he looked at his men the keltoi and former hoplites of olbia dressed in the remnants of greek armour with sakje tack and sauromatae armour here and there many in barbarian trousers some wearing sakje hats in place of their helmets just beside him hama grinned now for glory hama called he threw his sword in the air and it flew in a wheel of fire and hama caught it by the hilt all the keltoi roared thank you hama decision made kineas took a deep breath fear was deep in his guts but there was elation there as well there was even happiness the happiness of a craftsman nearing the completion of a long and heavy task to his right the sauromatae crested the hill and formed their ranks glittering bronze and iron scales over every man woman and horse gwair blackhorse the leftmost man in the front rank turned and waved the sun torched lots armour but however bright his bronze and gold burned srayanka was the sun herself as she rode over the crest her helmet and gorget too bright for him to watch kineass throat was heavy with all of it pride terror joy he could smell apples he left the point of the olbian wedge and rode along the crest sword in the air until he was sure that all three wedges were fully formed and ready if this were their moment he would not waste it with a simple error their cheers followed him and in the valley at his feet he could sense the change they were too golden to be macedonians even as he cantered back to his place the ocean noise of the sakje cheers began to come back from the centre as the massagetae realized that their long fight in the centre was not in vain and the purple cloak flickered in the setting sun and the dust but it was moving back kineas pulled into his place with diodorus at one shoulder and carlus at the other athena he called and men laughed aloud power flowed through him like the ichor of a god and the olbians hellenes and keltoi together sang athenas paean as they started forward and many among the sakje and even the sauromatae took it up so many times had they heard it around campfires standing in the rain or the biting heat of the plains among the snows of hyrkania come athena now if ever let us now thy glory see now o maid and queen we pray thee give thy servants victory the three wedges came over the crest at a walk as soon as the horses felt the slope kineas let them move taking the downhill side at a fast trot and then a canter and he could see lot and srayanka at the point of their formations keeping pace the cavalry in front of him broke a stade before he could reach them they had not had an easy day galled by scythian arrows and forced to climb the ridge now their world had turned upside down and they ran for the ford only the macedonian cavalry stood then charged back their tired horses making heavy work of the hill and the sauromatae in the centre crashed into them with a sound like summer thunder kineas refused to let thalassa have her head and he pulled her up keeping an eye on lots golden helmet as he used his heavy lance against the more lightly armed macedonians already disheartened to find themselves abandoned by their allies the macedonians held for a few heartbeats and then a few more unused to defeat fighting with their guts and then they too broke and the sauromatae began to reform their wedge on the move the chance of the hill and the ground had pointed their formations more at the ford than at the macedonian pikes who were already extending files and facing as fast as they could move to react far too late unless their king turned away from the centre to save them and if he did the battle was a stalemate kineas could feel it he was off the last of the ridge on the flat and in the battle haze off to his right there were trumpets alexander calling his hetairoi to save the battle kineas barked take command at diodorus and then wheel right at antigonus who sounded the call kineas tapped thalassa to a gallop and she leaped forward at his order flying over the ground kineas raised his heavy spear over his head showing all three formations their new direction and the three triangles wheeled staggered because of distance and reaction time kineas placed himself ahead of the sauromatae wheel lot wheel right lot was becoming less visible in the dust but he raised his lance and a moment later his trumpeter sounded srayanka will hit them first kineas thought he gave thalassa her head and the mare skimmed the dirt hooves scarcely touching the ground how far away were alexanders hetairoi he saw the golden glow of srayankas armour first and he pulled in as he came up wheel right he shouted she raised her longhandled axe in salute and her trumpet rang out as kineas closed with her wheeling thalassa alexander is right in front of us she laughed a sound of joy hephaestion is mine she shouted aiiyyeee and she gave her horse its head and the sakje were off into the dust kineas already angling away to the centre if he had pictured this correctly the three wedges would hit the macedonian companions in three staggered plunges like three sword thrusts he was nearly abreast of lot when the redcloaks came out of the haze he turned thalassa and settled into the sauromatae formation seconds before the two triangles crashed into each other the explosion of noise as they impacted drowned out thought kineas never had time to throw his javelin and thalassa crashed breast to breast against a macedonian horse that she couldnt avoid as kineas ducked the point of the mans lance and the two beasts went up in a flurry of hooves standing on their hindquarters kineass legs closed like a vice and he swept his javelin like a sword the point caught between the companions arms and kineas leaned into it as thalassa pushed forward on to four feet and the enemy trooper was down unhorsed but probably otherwise uninjured kineas pressed in immediately now he threw his javelin into the man facing lady bahareh recognizable from her heavy grey braids and kineass throw caught him under the bridle arm and sent him into the dust and she pushed forward as well and there was another chaos of noise from their left as the olbian wedge met the macedonians kineas was no longer a commander he retrieved his spear from his left hand and got it up over his head twohanded as the men and horses pressed close the two wedges were flattening out against each other and the closeserried cavalry were reduced to fighting like hoplites cheek to cheek with their opponents their legs crushed between horses his next opponent was still fumbling for his sword when kineas punched his spear shortened until his left fist was at the head between face and cuirass a blow rang off his scaled back and then another he looked round at where a macedonian had somehow penetrated their formation and he landed a blow with his butt spike but it glanced off the mans cuirass he took a blow on his raised arms armoured arms thanks to srayankas gift and thalassa reading his body backed up and kicked with her hind legs both hooves striking home against the enemys horse with the sound of an axe biting wood kineas thrust back again as a blow rang on the back of his helmet and his buttspike caught under the mans thigh ripping his leg as his horse failed him and they went down together kineas caught a glint of gold a flash of a new enemy in his peripheral vision and he swung the spear twohanded straight from back to front even as he turned his head and the whole weight of his cornelwood spear crashed sidelong into alexanders golden helmet ripping it free against the chinstraps and the king of macedon sagged away a dozen of his own troopers throwing themselves into the desperate press but kineas was on him and thrust again at the kings legs and scored deeply before two swords rang against his helmet weak blows but enough to drive him from his prey he parried got his spearbutt high and used it like a slave sweeping with a broom to parry jabbing his point into faces and down into unarmoured thighs so that men fell into the dust but alexander was slipping away slumped in his seat the wall of sauromatae was pressing forward now kineas could feel it he was too far into the macedonian formation but he could see alexander just another rank away companions pulling at his bridle he was hit hit hard kineas took a blow in the side the wounded side pain blinded him and training made him lash out with the spear point to cover his agony and a blow he never saw severed his heavy spear between his hands so that he had two pieces but this was a moment for which phocion trained you and he lashed out with both pieces raining blows on his opponents his whole being focused on getting to alexander but his vision was tunnelling and he almost lost his seat when a kopis bit into his right side under his arm scattering scales and drawing a new line of pain on his chest thalassa felt the change in his weight and reared kicking buying him precious heartbeats he dropped the halves of his spear and pulled the egyptian sword easily from its scabbard he couldnt breathe a long lance reached out from behind him and tipped a companion into the dust and he cut at his opponents missing wildly but still alive eyes clearing to his peril he parried and there were macedonians on either side of him so close that his booted knees were crushed against theirs and his riding whip came into his bridle hand like a gift from ares he slashed backhanded to the left and then rammed the butt of the whip under the riders jaw and turned back the whole weight of his body and thalassas motion behind his sword and he cut through the mans guard and his blade skidded down the mans shoulder and still had enough power to cut a long fold of flesh clear of his unarmoured sword arm kineas cut with the whip one two three consecutive blows to the mans face over their locked weapons and the man fell free more flesh shredding off his arm as he went and he screamed but he couldnt fall because the press of men and horses was so tight the king is down shouted in macedonianaccented greek and new strength flooded through kineas but with thalassas muscles straining between his legs he couldnt move trapped with the men he had put down and the companions just beyond the range of his sword were leaning far out over their horses heads trying to cut at him and he had to parry to protect thalassas head thalassa tried to rear and kineas hung on her neck to keep her down afraid in this press that shed lose her footing and fall take it over his shoulder again the lance struck over his shoulder and he risked a glance back lot was behind him take it he shouted kineas didnt want a lance in this insane press cover me he shouted parrying again to protect his horse and the sauromatae prince drove his lance into the macedonians unprotected head killing him and then darius was there and carlus and then sitalkes clearing his way through the press like a young achilles his helmet lost and his spear red and gold in the setting sun darius did an insane thing rising on his own horses back and then jumping to the horse of the last man kineas had dropped moving like an acrobat his sword licked out blinding a man and then showering blows on his helmet until he ducked and fell away carlus on his elephantine horse simply pushed through the press and for heartbeats it seemed that he might unhorse kineas in his eagerness next to him at the edge of kineass awareness was philokles raining blows without pause on his opponents like ares come to earth like a log jam in a thracian river in spring the macedonians gave slowly thalassa went forward a short lunge a single step kineas could only parry his arms too weak to make the strong cuts required to put an armoured man down in the dust but there were no blows coming at him to parry darius and carlus had taken his place in the line he hauled on thalassas reins and let lot squeeze past him thrusting strongly sitalkes cut down the trumpeter even as he set the instrument to his lips and sitalkes snatched the golden trumpet and raised it high exulting and died like that with a macedonian lance in his side when another sauromatae knight pushed past him kineas sagged and let them all past as the melee grew farther and farther away a few feet and then an ocean of sound away he took a blow on the back from a sauromatae who thought he was the enemy and he reeled and the man apologized and rode clear with him holding him against thalassas back you did me no damage kineas said you are badly wounded the man said decorus he had a name that sounded like that kineas couldnt get his head up no he said he was in fact wounded somewhere under his shirt of scale armour high on his left side something wet had happened and there was a cut on his right side as well and a lot of bruises and breathing hurt again more more still go back to it dekris thank you lord the young man tipped his helmet down pulled his lance out from under his thigh and looked right and left sounds more open over there he said and plunged away to the left kineas sat on his charger alone long enough to wish that he had a skin of water some random blow had cut the strap to his clay bottle he got his head up blew the snot from his nose and looked around there was still no wind and the hanging dust made the air seem heavy and sick the prodromoi were still behind the fighting formations while he took deep breaths ataelus came up and samahe and temerix they competed to give him water temerix had some wine he felt better immediately temerix gave him a piece of sausage with garlic in it loot from some skirmisher fight because the sakje had nothing like it and he wolfed it down he hadnt eaten in hours so he sat a quarter stade from the hottest cavalry fight hed ever seen sharing a sausage with his scouts his sense of the battle began to return despite the dust the sun was setting and the air on his sunburned dirty face seemed cooler thanks for the sausage he said to temerix who grinned lets go and win this thing he said which sounded pompous but thats the way it looked to him the melee had left him behind the companions werent breaking they were simply losing all around kineas scythian horsemen and women not armoured nobles but simple warriors from all the tribes cantered up some peered at him a few saluted him and called baqca and all threw themselves into the melee often shouting for the prodromoi to join them but the scouts waited with the discipline of two years of campaigns this he knew was what zarina had meant the scythians had a lifetime of coordinated hunting on the plains they knew when a beast was wounded and they rode to the fight every warrior choosing their own moment his few hundred were now just the tip of the spear and thousands of dahae and sakje were coming in behind them riding into the warstorm to fire arrows or thrust with their swords many had changed horses after their initial panic and they were comparatively fresh the shock was over and they scented victory kineas could smell it too and it smelled like horse sweat and dust and a hint of apples far away thalassa gave a cry and took a step forward rare for her to move unbidden and srayanka came out of the murk aiiyee she shrieked and they embraced and then she backed her mare you are injured kineas just smiled at her then he reached out with his right hand and pulled her close her gorget scraping dully against his scales and they kissed like people who might have lost everything despite everything we could ride away she said when they parted her hand where she had embraced his left side was covered in blood too late my love he said i cut that fuck hephaestion she said as if passing the time of day she handed him a javelin a late wedding present she said her mouth thinned lot went down to the grass she said ahh he said pain banished for a moment trumpets were sounding a recall i put alexander out of the fight he would mourn lot later and then he thought i will join lot soon enough and he hurt and it was wet but he chuckled again his grin was real his fear was gone really he was already dead and this last embrace was athenas favour he sat back on thalassa legs still strong lets finish it he said srayankas eyes locked with his one last time take us ataelus said at his side fresh horses kineas looked around form a wedge then he said and ataelus and samahe barked multilingual commands and the scouts formed up they advanced at a trot side by side kineas and srayanka pushed forward into the storm of ares the whole melee had motion now and warriors made way for them as they pressed forward all of their forces were intermixed pressing forward with the strength of victory as the sun set red as a gaping wound behind them blinding their opponents when it could penetrate the dust and the daimon was on them all and the olbians shouted apollo and nike and few shouted athena while the sakje and the sauromatae began to shout something else something that seemed wordless and built towards a word as they pressed forward so that all the unfocused shouts began to be a word repeated over and over a thousand thin and tired voices making the voice of the war god baqca they shouted and the sound carried him forward he had time to think this is what it is like to be a god and he felt nike the euphoria of victory suffuse him and the macedonians were breaking having covered their retreat exhausted professional superb but now finished philotas might have held them longer or parmenion but hephaestion had already left the field with what he called wounds and the thousand fickle spirits that warp even the best moved them to flow away kineas broke through into the front rank and he threw his javelin a long high throw that caught the rump of a fleeing horse and stuck there good throw philokles said i find it little different he said as if continuing an earlier conversation kineass vision was tunnelling from the pain of the throw but he managed a smile for the spartan hmm he said as if they were standing on the porch of the megaron in hyrkania talking philosophy a cavalry melee just the same a lot of pushing but with an animal doing the work philokles smiled his right hand was red the wrist was red and the arm that held his spear was streaked with blood drips to belie his tone i think i like it a good way to fight ones last battle kineas laughed and it hurt youre a good man he said philokles smiled i cant hear you say that too often the haze was clearing because the scythians were too fatigued to pursue and besides the water of the jaxartes was up to the hocks of their horses phalangites scrambled across the ford that they had won at such cost alexanders charge had saved them but they had no order and they were done for the day kineas turned his head and he knew them all every man and woman and he saw how the dream was true and not true he looked to the front and he saw a beaten army awaiting only the last blow just at the base of the great dead tree a lone horseman sat on an armoured horse his goldcovered helm red in the last of the sun he had a bow leons voice away to the left called through the red murk hes mine and started into the water diodorus said keep the line by ares kam baqca was at his shoulder it is time to cross the river she said kineas raised his sword though the pain came in like the sea at flood tide above the red swirl of dust he could see the last of a blue sky and high in the sky an eagle circled charge he said he gestured epilogue the next day in the full light of the sun srayanka crossed the river with thirty riders all spearmaidens their armour clean their horses groomed and their hair adorned with circlets of roses and grass srayanka wore the sword of cyrus the hilt of jade flashing its own message in the sun on the enemy side they met an escort of macedonians who were not so clean and she nodded to herself the escort was led by the one kineas had known tolmy and he was wounded she gave him only a blank face they rode through a silent camp of macedonians silent except for the groaning of the wounded and the shrill pain of the horses those who could stared at her as she passed she led her column past the siege machines where unwounded men stood ready and past lines of tents and hasty shelters made of blankets to where a dozen pavilions were pitched together and tolmy led them into a courtyard formed by the pavilions the king will see you here he is wounded he spoke very loudly as if to a fool my husband put him down she said in greek and the macedonian troopers mutterings were as ugly as her smile she did not dismount although tolmy beckoned to her several times the king awaits you he said tell him to come here i do not dismount in a camp of enemies she raised her chin her heart pounded in her chest until she reminded herself that she had nothing to lose she kept her chin high and eventually the flap of the greatest tent opened and alexander emerged he was pale and he limped and he immediately sat when a seat was brought only an amazon would bring this courtesy lady any other defeated king comes and kneels srayanka shrugged i am kind then i will not ask you to kneel alexanders face was instantly a mask of rage it is you who are beaten he spat she had a bag in her left hand she opened it and threw the object it held on to the ground it was alexanders golden helmet i might have put this atop a trophy such as the greeks raise across the river and nothing could you do to stop me she nodded at his silence keep it with my thanks for your courtesy when i was a hostage alexander drew breath to speak and she raised her hand listen i have not come to mock you killed my husband but i will hold my hand you will not come across the oxus or the jaxartes and the sakje will no longer support the usurper spitamenes whom i hate that is my word cross the rivers and die go elsewhere and conquer as you will i will conquer the world alexander said his anger was quenched already by his burning curiosity his interest his appreciation she spat back stay off the sea of grass king she shrugged tell your slaves we came and gave you tribute if you must but stay off the sea of grass she drew the sword of cyrus from the scabbard at her side my people say this is the sword that cyrus the great king brought to the sea of grass he left it with us come across the river and see what you will leave behind i have spoken she left him sitting on his ivory stool holding his helmet she didnt wait for her escort of macedonians who had dismounted expecting a longer parley she gathered her maidens and they rode clear and no hand was raised against them and across the river at the top of the ridge that towered over the ford of the jaxartes a big man naked in the sun made a pile of all the macedonian armour that his friends had stripped from the dead he wept as he worked but he worked hard and many hands helped he built the trophy carefully until it towered above the ridge and the helmet that graced the top had a blue plume and the bronze caught the sun and burned like a beacon
