marion lennox bushfire bride dear reader bushfires in australia are terrifying and catastrophic but theyre also unavoidable if our native forests are to regenerate the blackened landscape means death and destructionbut it also promises new life the forest near my home was destroyed two years ago and afterward i drove across the charred landscape with despair now my dog harry and i walk through the newly regenerated forest with joy rachel my heroine in bushfire bride has also felt despair but the cowral bay bushfire as well as the cowral bay doctor brings her joy and laughter and a new beginning as with our bushfire the destruction signals a new beginning for a whole community this book is a celebration of life after catastrophe i hope you love reading it as much as i loved writing it warm regards marion lennox prologue the thin blue line rose and fell rose and fell rose and fell how long does love last the young woman by the bed should surely know she sat and watched now as shed sat and watched for years i love you craig she whispered but there was no answer there was never an answer dappled sunlight fell over lifeless fingers beloved eyes once so full of life and laughter stayed closed the blue line rose and fell rose and fell i love you craig she whispered again and blessed his face with her fingers my love how long does love last for ever chapter one she may be beautiful but i bet shes stupid dr rachel harpers hamburger paused midway to her mouth tomato sauce oozed onto her tshirt but her tshirt was disgusting already the sauce was the same colour as her pants heyshe was colour coordinated she was also distracted look at her hair the voice was saying itd cost a fortune to keep it like that and what for shes a blonde bimbo toby mark my words a gorgeous piece of fluff but shes got lovely legs the childs words were a thoughtful response to the mans deep rumble and shes got really nice eyes never be taken in by appearances toby the deep voice decreed under that gorgeous exterior shes nothing but a twit enough rachel might be a reluctant protector but she was here to defend and defend she would she hitched back the curtain and faced the world or to be precise she faced the cowral dog show the pavilion was packed and shed retreated with her hamburger for a little privacy the cubicles behind each dog werent big enough to swing a cator a dogbut at least they were private who was criticising penelope hey she said and a man and a child turned to stare she wiped a smudge of tomato sauce from her chin and stared right back penelopes detractor was in his midthirties she guessed maybe he was a farmer thats what he looked like he was wearing moleskins and a khaki shirt of the type that all the farmers around here seemed to wear his curly black hair just reached his collar he had deep brown crinkly eyes and with his deeply tanned skin he looked nice rachel decided in fact if she was being criticaland she was definitely in the mood for being criticalhe looked more than nice he looked gorgeous the small boy beside him was aged about six and he was a miniature replica they had to be father and son father and son family the man was therefore married married why was she wondering about married she gave herself a swift mental swipe for thinking of any such thing dottie had been doing her work too well why would rachel possibly be interested in whether a complete stranger had a partner she was here with michael but then who was she kidding she was interested in anyone but michaelmarried or not the fact that she was married herself didntcouldntmatter dr rachel harper had reached her limit i need to show penelope to gain championship points michael had told her one day at sydney central hospital where they both worked and dottie had pushed her to go get a life shed said its time to move on so shed allowed herself to be persuaded rachel had imagined an hour or two displaying a beautiful dog a comfortable motel in the beautiful seaside town of cowral and the rest of the weekend lazing at the beach maybe dottie was right shed had no holiday for eight years she was exhausted past imagining maybe dotties edict that it was time to move on was worth considering but michaels dream weekend had turned out to be just thata dream reality was guilt it was also a heat wave a motel that refused to take dogs and an entire weekend guarding michaels stupid dog from supposedly jealous competitors where was michael who knew she sighed and addressed penelopes critics penelopes been bred from two australian champions she told the stranger and his child and she glared her very best puttingthepeasantsintheirplaces glare shes a very nice dog the little boy said he smiled a shy smile up at rachel can i pat her nose she softened of course you can she might bite the man warned and rachel stopped smiling and glared again stupid dogs bite penelopes a lady penelopes an afghan hound so the mans lips twitched there was laughter lurking behind those dark eyes and the beginning of a challenge so shes dumb rachel brightened a challenge great shed been here too long she was bored to screaming point anything was better than retreating to her soggy hamburger and yesterdays newspapers in truth what she was aching for was a fight with michael but he wasnt here however this man was the same speciesmaleand the laughter behind his eyes told her he was fair game youre not only rude she told him her gaze speculative youre also racist he raised his brows and his brown eyes creased into laughing disbelief youre saying shes smart shes a sweetheart rachel gave the great white hound a hug and then winced as a smear of ketchup soiled the dogs immaculate coat whoops michael would be out with his pistols where was michael you dont need to take my word for it the man was saying a small crowd was gathering now the judging heats were over final judging wasnt for another two hours and things were slow in the dog shed rachel wasnt the only one who was bored theres tests for dog intelligence youre going to implement the mensa quiz nothing so complicated lend me a piece of your hamburger lend hey get your own hamburger its in the interest of scientific research he told her my daddys a doctor the little boy said as if that explained everything yeah doctor of what rachel grinned down at the kid beginning to enjoy herself for the first time all weekend it sounds a sneaky way to get some of my hamburger its a simple experiment the man told her refusing to be sidetracked see my dog the stalls and their associated sleeping quarters were raised almost three feet above the ground rachel peered over the edge a lean brown dog of indeterminate parentage gazed back at her as big as a collie the mutt was all legs tail and eyes as rachel gazed down at him he raised his back leg for a weary scratch charming rachel said great party trick digger doesnt do party tricks she nodded in sympathetic understanding i guess you need to be housetrained to be let into parties the mans grin matched hers war hadnt just been declaredthe first shots had been fired are you implying diggers not housetrained seeing is believing this was ok she decided for the first time since shed been conned into coming to this last bastion of civilisation she was having fun guilt could be forgottenfor the moment penelope against digger it was a crazy conversation she wasnt sure how it had started but she didnt intend to stop breeding will out she declared theres been more gone into diggers breeding than your mutts my mutts name is penelope she said haughtily and shes no mutt she comes from long line of australian champions whereas your mutt digger also comes from a long line of champions the stranger told her he smiled again and it was a heartstopper of a smile a real killer were sure theres a piece of champion border collie in there somewhere and a champion kelpie and a champion dachshund rachel watched as diggers tiny pointy tail stuck straight up definitely dachshund thats silly the little boy said dachshunds are long and flat and diggers high and bouncy right she was trying not to laugh both the man and the boy were entrancing two gorgeous smiles two sets of deep dark eyes ready to spring into laughter she was bored out of her brain and this pair were a diversion sent from heaven so what do we do with my hamburger she asked and the mans smile deepened honestly it was a smile to die for we put it under a feed dish rachel raised her eyebrows then shrugged and handed over her burger a fair amount of ketchup came too the man looked down at his handketchup with hamburger attached ugh in truth it had been a very soggy hamburger and rachel wasnt all that sorry to lose it you like your burgers well sauced yes she told him and went back to glowering my dad says tomato sauce has too much salt and salts bad for blood pressure the little boy ventured people who say rude things about dogs are bad for blood pressure rachel retorted and there was a general chuckle from their growing audience so what are you intending to do with my hamburger watch the man stooped and placed a piece of hamburger underneath an upturned dog dish then he stood back and let diggers lead go slack dinner he said digger looked up at him adoring then the skinny brown dog gazed around the crowd as if ensuring each and every eye was on him he sniffed placed a paw on top of the dish crouched down pushed with the other pawthe dish toppled sideways to reveal the piece of hamburger digger looked around again as if awaiting applause it came he received his due and then delicately ate the hamburger uhoh now its penelopes turn shell get dirty rachel said and there was a trace of worry in her voice penelope might be lovely but her opposition was seriously smart well put it up on her platform the strangers smile was growing broader ill even wipe the ketchup off or maybe you could do it on your tshirt ouch watch your mouth another grin but the entire pavilion was watching now and he didnt stop he placed the dish in front of penelopes nose he broke a second piece of hamburger showed it to penelope and popped it underneath he backed away and left her to it penelope sniffed she sniffed again she whined she lay down in front of the dish she stood up and barked she shoved the dish sideways with her nose and barked again nothing happened she lay down and whined pathos personified so your dogs hungrier than mine rachel told him with a touch of desperation and there was general laughter you must starve digger do i look like a man whod starve a dog no he didnt he looked really nice rachel decided and she wished all of a sudden that she wasnt in soiled jeans and saucestained tshirt that her mass of deep brown curls were untangled and not full of the straw that the organisers had put down as bedding and that she looked oh heck what was she thinking of this guy had a kid she was here with michael and rachel are you feeding penelope unthinkingly shed raised the feed bowl and penelope was launching herself into the hamburger as if there was no tomorrow ummichael michael silverhaired suave and in charge of his world was elbowing through the crowd and his face was incredulous no one messed with michaels instructions pedigree dog food only what on earth do you think youre doing im proving penelopes intelligence she told him chin jutting enough was enough and shed had more than enough of dr michael levering back at sydney central michael had seemed witty and charming and as one of sydneys top cardiologists he was extremely eligible his invitation to go away with him for the weekend had half the staff in casualty green with envy and her friends and her family had finally pushed her to accept come on her motherinlaw had told her this is your chance you know its time you moved on a romantic weekend with a gorgeous bachelor rachel love you take some precautions and go for it precautions ha that was the last thing shed needed they were supposed to be sharing dog duty that was another joke michael had said hed sleep in the car because he was too tall to fit in the dog box but she was starting to have serious doubts about what car hed slept in when hed appeared this morning ten minutes before penelope had been due to appear in the judging ring hed looked far too clean to have slept in any car then hed said hed had to make an urgent telephone call she hadnt seen him again so what had he been doing all this time she looked at him suspiciously checking for damp hair if she could prove hed been swimming while shed dogsat she was going to have to kill him our dogs more intelligent than yours the little boy piped up and michael stared down at the child in distaste what are you talking about rachel flinched this weekend was definitely not going to plan sexy eligible ha this man was a kingsized toad im toby mcinnes and this is my dad the little boy told him oblivious to the anger in michaels voice my dads dr hugo mcinnes who are you michael opened his mouth but rachel forestalled him she knew what would come out and it wouldnt be pleasant this is michael and im rachel she told the little boy she watched hugos grip tighten on his sons hand and she didnt blame him she was moving into protection mode herself penelope is michaels dog but michael had moved on he was talking only to rachel did you know there are bushfires out of town bushfires rachel knew nothing of any bushfires she hadnt been out of the pavilion all day theyre a long way from here the manthe doctorcalled hugo was gazing from rachel to michael and back again his initial anger at michael seemed to have faded and he now looked as if the whole scene held great interest for him the fires are threatening to block the road michael snapped he shoved penelope away from him and the big dog practically fell over fast thinking was not penelopes strong point she whined a little and nuzzled rachel and rachel gave her a hug stupid or not she was still a very nice dog as company went if rachel had a choice between penelope or michael penelope was definitely preferable rachel theres an emergency back in town michael was saying bushfires or not i need to leave theres a helicopter on the way to collect me a helicopter a helicopter coming to collect michael rachel focused she really focused michael was cleanshaven he was wearing immaculate slacks and a crisp white shirtand a tie for heavens sake and his hair she couldnt stop staring at his hair he looked like hed just emerged from the shower the dog pavilion didnt run to showers rachel hadnt seen running water for twentyfour hours she stank of michaels dog what was the bet michael had just come from the beach via a shower via a motel shed reached her limit his talk of helicopters wasnt making sense but she didnt care did you sleep at the motel last night she demanded and michael paused no but do you own a red aston martin hugo asked politely interested yes michael suddenly looked flustered understandably he was used to deference and subservience he wasnt finding it here that fits hugo was saying you look the sort of guy who owns an aston martin i did a house call at the motel at two this morning arnold roberts was suffering badly from gout he had the adjoining suite to yours we inspected your car from stem to stern while we waited for his analgesic to take effect he smiled from rachel to michael and back againas if he was being really really helpful we were wondering whod bring a car like that to a place like this and now we know ill tell arnold it belongs to an afghan owner and all will be clear he was laughing but rachel hardly noticed her fury was threatening to overwhelm her you slept at the motel michael heard her anger then everybody did i thought you cancelled she said carefully when they wouldnt let us bring the dog they rang me later and said it was too late to cancelthey were keeping my deposit michael muttered he had the grace to look a bit shamefaced but only for a moment he regrouped fast with an ego the size of michaels it was easy and by then youd agreed to sleep here for heavens sake rachel you know how small the car is do you want me to hurt my back yes look its immaterial anyway he told her moving right on its just as well i had a decent nights sleep as it happens hubert witherspoons had a heart attack hubert witherspoon the name had its desired effect rachels fury was deflectedfor the moment hubert witherspoon was probably the richest man in australia he owned half the iron ore deposits in the country what the man wanted the man got he wants me michael told her what the witherspoon family arent risking road blocks due to bushfire theyve sent a helicopter to take me back to sydney he glanced at his watch it should be landing right now and they want me to leave immediately can you show penelope for her final judging and bring her home afterwards hubert witherspoon huberts death would be a national catastropheat least for the financial markets it should have made rachels eyes widen in awe it should have made her do whatever michael wanted butmichael had been swimming hed slept in a motel in a bed while shed been sitting with penelope feeling just dreadful about leaving sydney for such a reason you want me to show penelope she managed and he smiled the smooth specialisttojuniordoctor smile that had persuaded her to come on this weekend in the first place why did it make her think suddenly of snake oil youve been watching the other dogs being shown he told her you saw how i handled penelope this morning he checked rachel from head to toe with a judges critical eye penelope will be fine you might want to get yourself cleaned up a bit first though if she didnt slug him it was only because they were surrounded by a score of onlookers but it was a really close thing somehow she managed to keep hold of a shred of dignity a scrap right she took a deep breath you want me to drive all the way back to sydney by myself of course unless the bushfires block the road ill understand if youre delayed he tossed her the car keys and she was so astounded she caught them but that was all she was doing no rachel his tone became patientconsultant talking to slightly stupid junior you know i cant be replaced hubert needs a cardiologist and he needs the best i have hay in my hair she muttered through gritted teeth i cant show a potential australian champion yes you can you just need a he got no further she lifted the car keys and threw them right at his freshly shined shoes your dog your problem im going home she told him one syllable at a time ill hitchhike if i must but im not touching your car rachel stuff it stuff you but hubert hubert can die for all i care but he wont die because youre not there hes over eighty hes grossly overweight and there are at least five cardiologists in sydney who are as qualified as you are to care for him you know thats ridiculous i know nothing of the kind can i make a suggestion it was brown eyes hugo but rachel wasnt in the mood for interruptions she wheeled and gave him a look to kill butt out this is my business he held up his hand placating whoa im out of here she leaned back into the cubicle grabbed her overnight bag and hauled it out it was a fine gesture which didnt come off quite as planned she hadnt snibbed her bag shut and it flew open out tumbled her spare jeans her toilet bagand a bra and a couple of pairs of very lacy very scant panties they were dotties offerings her motherinlaw you never know whats going to happen dear shed told her and i do so want you to be prepared dottie was right you never did know what was going to happen but one thing rachel did know shed been a fool to ever agree to come here she closed her eyes as her belongings tumbled everywhere a bra flew past diggers nose he snagged it and held on seemingly bemused everyone was bemused dear heaven let the ground open under her she had to get out of here the dog can keep it she said with as much dignity as she could muster stuffing the rest of her gear into her bag and fighting a wave of burning mortification hes so smart he can probably work out how to wear it she pulled the remains of her bag shut tugged the shreds of her dignity around her and stalked toward the door they watched her go hugo with laughter in his eyes and michael with his jaw somewhere around his ankles she didnt care if she didnt see any one of them again shed be delighted she was getting out of here she didnt make it she stalked out of the pavilion took a couple of deep breaths and regrouped for a moment to try and figure out the location of the main entrance to the showgroundsand a dogfight broke out just behind her chapter two she stopped of course she stopped the sound of the dogfight was unmistakable the vicious earsplitting snarls breaking through everything else and then a highpitched scream of human terror shed have to have been less than human to ignore it she turned and stared as did everyone else close enough to hear the dogfight was at the entrance of the pavilion shed just left and it wasnt a fightit was a massacre a faded old cocker spaniel black and white turned to grey had been held on its lead by his teenage owner but the pit bull terrier had no restraint and it was intent on killing the dogs were locked in mortal combat though the cocker clearly had no idea about fightingno idea about how to defend himself the spaniels ownera girl of maybe fifteen or sowas the one whod screamed in terror she was no longer screaming she was trying desperately to separate them as rachel started forwardnothe girl grabbed the pit bulls collar and hauled the dog snarled and twisted away from the spanieland bit no rachel was screaming at her to stopto let go she was running but it was a good fifty yards back to the entrance to the pavilion the manhugowas before her the dogs were everywherea mass of writhing bodies with the girl beneath she had to get them apart the girl would be killed rachel dived to grab a collar to pull the pit bull from the girl but her arm was caught keep back hugos harsh command had the power to make her pause he was reaching for a hose snaking across the entrance and he hauled it forward turn it on she saw instantly what he wanted and dived for the tap two seconds later the tap was turned to full power the massive hose used to blast out the mess in the pavilion after showtime was directed full at the dogs nothing else could have separated them the blast hit the pit bull square on the muzzle and drove him back the hose turned to the spaniel but he was already whimpering in retreat badly bitten by the pit bull while rachel launched herself at the prone body of the girl her leg she breathed the girls leg was spurting bright arterial blood a vast pulsating stream oh god had the dog torn the femoral artery shed die in minutes the dog had lunged at her upper leg and the girl had been wearing shorts dear heaven someone get my bag fast run hugo was shouting with urgency the cars by the kiosk car keys were tossed into the crowdswiftly because hugos hands were already trying to exert pressure rachel was hauling her tshirt over her head they needed something for a pressure padanythingand decency came a very poor second to lifesaving she shoved the shirt into hugos hands and hugo wasnt asking questions he grabbed the tshirt and pushed kim dont move hugo was saying and with a jolt rachel realised he was talking to the girl he was good this man even in extremis he found time to tell his patient what was happening your legs been badly bitten and we need to stop the bleeding i know it hurts like hell but someones gone for painkillers just a few short minutes before we can ease the pain for you kim i promise could she hear rachel didnt know and she had to concentrate on her own role hugo would want a more solid pad than one tshirt could provide she stared up into the crowd michael she yelled hugo was too busy applying pressure to haul off his shirt and he needed something to make a pad and michael could help with more than a shirt he had the skills but michael was gone it couldnt matter take mine a burly farmer had seen her need and was hauling off his shirt she accepted with gratitude coiling it into a pad out of the corner of her eye she saw her overnight bag sprawled and open in the dust where shed dropped it as shed lunged for the tap more clothes great as hugo looked up searching for whatever she had she handed him a pad she made another with what was in the bag then she shoved the pad hard down over his and pressed he pressed with her even their combined effort wasnt enough to stop the flow i need forceps he said grimly my bag clives gone to fetch it the farmer told them hovering over both doctors as they worked his face ashen with concern hell be back any minute hes the fastest runner good they were working together their hands in tandem hugo was breathing fast using all his strength to push tighter and rachel realised that she was hardly breathing at all live please it was a prayer shed learned early on in her medical training and had used over and over skills were good but sometimes more was needed luck still the blood oozed push down harder hugo told her dont move off the wound im not moving she said through gritted teeth the bite resembled a shark bitea huge gaping wound that left untended would release all the bodys blood in minutes even if tended she was pushing down so hard it hurt i need forceps hugos voice was growing more urgent as the situation became more desperate damn wheres my bag here a youngster a boy of about sixteen was bursting through the crowd carting a bag that was three times the size of any doctors bag that rachel had ever seen a country doctors bag haul it open the boy flicked the bag open and rachels eyes widened forceps there were several and they were sitting on the top as if prepared for just this emergency she lifted a hand from the wound and grabbed the first pair were not going to stop this without clamping she muttered the femoral artery has to have been torn to explain this he accepted her medical knowledge without a blink i agree clive take a shirt and clear as much blood as you can while we work lets go he grabbed forceps himself and then looked across at her ready she took a deep breath this was a huge risk they needed the pad to stop the spurting but the only way to stop the bleeding altogether was to remove the pad and locate the source they had only seconds to do it or the girl would die beneath their hands ok she took two deep breaths now they lifted the pad away from the wound the blood spurted out and they were working blind searching in the mess that was the girls leg where in this mess was the artery dear god they had to stop it take the swab right away clive just for the moment hugo said be ready to replace it and in the tiny millisecond before the wound refilled with bloodthere rachel pushed in and grasped and the forceps linked to the torn artery she clicked them shutand the pumping died not enough there were more as well as the femoral artery two or three minor vessels had been torn they could kill all by themselves hugos forceps clamped shut on another blood vessel and the flow abated still further another pair of forceps was in rachels hands and hugo had another she was working like lightning without the pads there was no pressurethe blood simply pumped out gotcha another one was under hugos forceps he clamped and another and that was it the blood was still oozing but slowly now the pumping had stopped itd be flowing from the ripped veins but theyd done what they had to do for now we need to continue with pressure she said and sat back as hugo set to work with another shirt forming another pad theyd been lucky trying to find the blood vessels in these conditions yeah theyd been luckybut this man was good hugo was tying the pad firmly around the leg he gave her a curious glance there was still urgency but they were working with minutes now rather than seconds theyd blocked off the blood supply now they needed to prevent shock setting in they needed to replace fluids and they needed to save a leg that no longer had a blood supply pete ring the ambulance hugo snapped into the crowd tell them i want plasma and saline on board and if theyre not here in thirty seconds ill have their hides dave can you and a couple of the men find those damned dogs and deal with them before we have another disaster toby wheres toby he looked out into the crowd searching for his little boy myra can you take him the first two are already being looked after someone said the vets got the cocker and a couple of guys have gone after the pit bull the ambulance is on its way which left toby a middleaged woman stepped from the crowd of horrified onlookers and took tobys hand the child had been standing whitefaced and shocked as hugo and rachel had worked come on love she told him come with me while daddy looks after kim kim rachel looked up to the girls deathly white face kims eyes were open but it wasnt clear whether she was conscious or not youll be ok kim she told her taking the opportunity to take the girls hand in hers what shed most need now would be reassurance not panic we needed to hurt you a bit to stop the bleeding but were both doctors we know what were doing the bleedings stopped now the girls eyes widened she was conscious mum knickers someone find the sandersons hugo ordered its ok kim well find your mum and dad now and knickers is with the vet you know rob will look after knickers just as ill look after you the flaring panic in the girls eyes subsided they were winning kind of for now butwas one of the reasons the bleeding had eased because the blood pressure itself had dropped she hasnt lost too much hugo muttered and rachel realised he was thinking the same as she was too much blood there was certainly a lot rachel herself was covered with a spray of gore she was wearing only a bra above the waist and she looked like something out of a vampire movie paramedics were supposed to wear protective clothing she thought ruefully if kim had any sort of bloodborne disease then she and hugo were now also infected they couldnt care not now hugo was swabbing the girls arm and rachel moved to get a syringe by the time hugo had the line ready she was prepared five milligrams morphine yeah and then saline we need plasma hell wheres the ambulance it was here there was a shout and then someone was pushing through the crowd a couple of ambulance officers rachel almost wept with relief theyd have plasma salineeverything hugo needed theyd take over this wasnt her place she could go back to being a horrified onlooker but your husbands a cardiologist shed gone back to applying pressure as hugo inserted an iv line her husband she stared blankly and then realised who he was talking about michael her husband what a thought but now wasnt the time for fixing misconceptions yes thank god for that sorry im the only doctor in town he told her can you ask someone to find him hell be able to help he was catching the helicopter back to sydney rachel said blankly theres a helicopters taking off now a voice said helpfully you can hear it hed left michael had left maybe he hadnt even noticed what had happened rachel had stalked out and itd be just like michael to have left as well hed have heard the dogfight but he wouldnt have turned to investigate she knew him well enough after this weekend to know he wouldnt deviate from his chosen plan for anyone hes taken the helicopter hugo searched the crowd to find the farmer whod been the first to offer his shirt ok itll have to come back matt get onto the radio get the chopper returned here tell the pilot we need priority kim needs emergency surgery if were to save this leg she needs vascular surgeons we need to evacuate hernow will do matt muttered and ran there was a crowd of about twenty onlookers around them now but it wasnt the sort of crowd you saw in city accidents rachel thought there was horror on everyones faces they all knew kim they were all desperate to help rachel was the only woman whod stripped to her bra but she knew without asking that each and every one of these women would do the same and more if they needed to their care and concern were palpable then kims parents were there running toward their daughter across the showgrounds their fear reached the group on the ground before they did but kim had drifted into unconsciousness the combination of shock blood loss and painkillers had sent her under good rachel thought as her mother disintegrated into tears sobbing onto her chest the horror on her parents faces would only have made things worse enough there was nothing more she could do now one of the paramedics had taken her position keeping pressure on the wound she rose a buxom woman in floral crimplene put her arm around her and held rachel wasnt complaining she was grateful for the support who are you hugo asked he was adjusting a bag of plasma the ambulance officers were helping rachel wasnt needed rachel rachel harper youre a doctor yes youre not a vascular surgeon i suppose i wish she knew exactly what he was thinking a vascular surgeon was what they needed urgently the chances of saving kims leg were incredibly slim but michael has the skills and hes still in range hed be upset at being called back but he had no choice ok he stared up at her for a moment longer his intelligent eyes assessing each knew what the other was thinking they couldnt voice it herenot in front of kims parentsbut if the femoral artery wasnt repaired fast kim would lose the leg if not her life they needed the helicopter they needed michael kims future depended on it there was nothing rachel could do though for now she was no longer needed mrs keen the lady in the crimplene ushered rachel into the showground caretakers residence as the ambulance screamed its way to the hospital she was already under hot water while mrs keen tuttutted about the state of her clothes and the clothes in your bag are no better she told rachel through the bathroom door one of the men brought your bag over but youve dropped it and then used everything to stop the bleeding oh my dear theres blood on everything that was a minor worry for now rachel couldnt care she let the hot water steam away the gore and she worried about the girl worried about the leg michael would be really angry at being recalled hed hate to miss out on the witherspoon case it couldnt matter he wouldnt have heard the dogfight she decided michael levering saw only the things that affected him he was needed in sydney for a prestigious patient and rachel wasnt doing what he wanted hed have simply turned on his heel and stalked away as for rachel and penelopeothers could pick up the pieces if rachel didnt take his expensive dog and his expensive car back to sydney well michael had the money to send a lackey to the country to collect them later in the week dogshow organisers were hardly likely to let penelope starve and even if they did penelope was just a possession damn the man she was shaking a combination of anger and reaction to the whole situation theyd been really really lucky to save kims life michael would be back the helicopter would have returned by now and dislike michael as she did she had to concede he possessed the skills she didnt he was an incredibly competent vascular surgeon he might not have noticed the dog fight but if they planned to evacuate kim on his helicopter he would of course treat her and with hugo as backup she washed the last trace of blood from her arms as mrs keens face appeared around the door her cheeks were crimson with embarrassment and distress my dear im sorry to disturb you but youre needed back at the hospital dr mcinnes has just rung the helicopters refused to turn around she told her dr mcinnes says he has to operate now or shell lose the leg and youre all the help he has its not a publicly owned chopper harold keen the showground caretaker drove her to the hospital in grimfaced anger it seems it belongs to the chap that had the heart attackhubert witherspoon his mans the pilot hes under instructions to take your young man to sydney and theres no way hes turning back but michaels on board surely he can overrule i dont think he has any say in the matter rachel stared straight ahead she was wearing one of doris keens crimplene dresses shed hauled a comb through her hair but her curls were still dripping she was wearing a pair of doriss sandals she was heading to a tiny country hospital where they were facing surgery that was a nightmare help i suppose someones looking after penelope she said in a small voice and harold looked her over with evident approval your dogs fine he told her theres any amount of folk looking after her you look after kim and well look after you thank you she felt like she was about to cry damn michael damn him he had the skills she didnt he had the helicopter she needed he was gone its no use being angry we just have to get on with it hugo was already kitted out for surgery in green theatre gown cap and slippers the nurse had ushered rachel straight through to the theatre she glanced around and her heart sank this was a tiny surgery set up for minor procedures not the major trauma that was facing them now she swallowed and looked up and some of her panic must have shown in her face whats your background he asked his voice gentling a little im a registrar at sydney central emergency medicine i dont i dont have the surgical skills to cope with this but youre the reason we were able to clamp the arteries so fast he told her so you saved kims life in the first place its just a matter of finishing what we started yeah right youre planning on rejoining the femoral artery if we canyes he shook his head it may be unlikely well succeed but we have to try ive been on the phone to specialists in sydney and we dont have a choice by the time we get her evacuated to sydney the leg will be dead if we dont try then she loses the leg its as simple as that im assuming you can give an anaesthetic he wasnt expecting her to operate that was such a relief her knees almost buckled right then yes if he was prepared to be heroic then so was she this was heroic surgery she thought damn fool surgery the outcome seemed almost inevitable but he was right they had to try its not as bad as it seems he told her we have a video link to sydney joe cartier one of the countrys leading vascular surgeons has agreed to help us every step of the way ive hauled in jane cross a local who plays at being a filmmaker shes setting up computer equipment and shell video while we operate she can do really intricate closeup stuff so everything i do goes straight down the line to sydney and i get immediate feedback hed organised all this while shed been in the shower i youre not a surgeon im a family doctor he told her im two hours away from backup im everything if you werent hereif i didnt have an anaesthetistthen id count this impossible but we have enough going for us now to hope so what are we waiting for lets go afterwards when rachel was asked to describe what had been done shed simply shake her head how they did itit was impossible all she could describe were the technicalities and they were impressive enough they had a speakerphone mounted just beside the table every sound they made went straight down the wire to sydney jane cross a woman in her forties looking crazily incongruous with theatre garb covering a purple caftan and a mass of jangling earrings dangling beneath her theatre cap directed a video camera straight at the wound you promise you wont faint hugo had asked the middleaged woman as shed set up the equipment and jane had regarded hugo and rachel with incredulity even with a hint of laughter what faint me when ive got a captive audience i intend to faint at least three times and ill probably throw up too but later not until ive done my job she was wonderful rachel decided she was right there behind hugos hands but somehow she had the skill and the sensitivity to stay clear enough for his fingers to do their work the pictures she took were via a digital video camera linked to video conferencing equipment in sydney joe cartier had a clear viewand hugo was asking questions every step of the way rachel couldnt help him at all she had her own battles she wasnt a trained anaesthetistshed done basic training but that was alland kim was so severely shocked that just keeping her alive was a major battle she worked with a phone link too theyd run out of phone lines but janes partner a dumpy little woman in jeans and sweatshirt sat in a corner of the theatre where she didnt have to seeher stomach was evidently not as strong as janesand relayed rachels questions down the line to an anaesthetist in sydney minimal anaesthesia for such a shocked patient the specialist told her working her through a careful haemodynamically neutral induction method he worked through her needs with her and rachel wondered that such a small hospital could meet the requirements he snapped down the phone it could for a tiny hospital hugo had brilliant equipment it was stunning that they had sufficient blood supplies on hand but there was so much more rachel had blood on request she had plasma she had saline and a team outside the theatre was warming all the fluids before she even saw them the fluids werent the only thing being heated keep the patient warm at all costs the anaesthetist barked down the phone and warmed blankets appeared like magic to cover every part of kims body that hugo didnt need to work on after that one instruction rachel didnt need to worry about warmingthe blankets were replaced every few minutes by freshly warmed ones handed through the door there must be a hive of industry out there it was an amazing scene as well as the unseen industry outside they had two nurses working with them in the theatre elly was a competent middleaged woman whitefaced and shocked because she was best friends with kims mum but that fact wasnt allowed to get in the way of her professionalism then there was david a gingerheaded kid who looked like he was hardly old enough to be qualifiedbut was magnificent under pressure they were all magnificent under pressure rachel thought the whole town and hugo what was being asked of him was unthinkable his concentration was fiercehe didnt lift his head he concentrated as she guessed hed never concentrated in his life where was the laughing man at the dog show gone hed been replaced by a pure professionala professional being asked to work well past his level of training this was nightmare stuff the specialist at the end of the phone could only guidethere was no way anyone could help hugo manoeuvre the fine particles of tissue back into being a viable blood supply rachel concentrating fiercely on an anaesthetic that was taking her to the limits of her ability could only wonder if hugo hadnt been there could she have done such a thing no she thought honestly hugo had obviously done far more extensive reading and studying in this area than she had the questions he asked the specialist showed keen intelligence and an incisive knowledge of what he was trying to achieve the man was seriously good and he was succeeding even when the femoral artery was somehowamazinglyreconnected and the first surge of pink started to appear in the lower leg he didnt relax his questions to the unknown joe in sydney seemed if anything to increase he worked on and on tying off vessels that were damaged beyond repair he completed the vascular surgery took a deep breath and a plastic surgeon came on the line guiding him through the complex steps in closing such a wound to give a decent cosmetic outcome they were worrying about appearances rachel thought jubilantly watching the colour seep back into kims toes and making sure the heart line on her monitor stayed steady as blood pressure stabilised they were worrying how shed look in the future they were winning and finallyfinally after hours without lifting their headsthe team in sydney let out a cheer down the phone lines well done cowral they told them unless you have any more big dogs menacing the populace well leave you to it and to the thanks of the entire theatre team the telephone lines went dead the theatre fell silent rachel was still concentrating hugo was placing dressings around the wound and she had to concentrate on reversing the anaesthetic having kim reestablish her own breathing but the satisfaction she glanced up and the joy she felt was reflected in every face in the room except hugos he looked sick the strain rachel had been under had been immensethe strain hugo had felt must have been well nigh unbearable hed won but at a cost shed worked as a team member for long enough to know that it was time for someone else to take charge and she was the only possible option david take over the dressing she ordered hugo leave the rest to us we dont need you here any more hed been under more pressure than any doctor should face and now job done reaction was setting in with a vengeance im ok but the hands holding the pad were suddenly shaking his fingers had seemed nerveless for hours skilled and precise past understanding it was more than understandable that reaction should set in now go and tell the sandersons their kid will keep her leg she told him kims parents will still be worried sick go kim was taking her first ragged breaths one of the nurses had given them the news some time ago that their daughter would be fine but they wouldnt believe it until theyd heard it from hugo and hugo needed to tell them hugo had achieved the impossible this was his gift the theatre team agreed david lifted the tape from hugos nerveless fingers and started applying it job done youre being kicked out of theatre dr mcinnes the young nurse told him giving his senior a cheeky grin that was still flushed with triumph they were all high on success it was a fabulous feeling the ladys told you to leave and what the lady wants the lady should get dont you agree hugo stepped back from the table he gave rachel a long assessing look and then his face broke into the beginnings of a crooked smile i guess we owe the lady big time there you go then rachel said with a lot more placidity than she was feeling pay your debt to us all by getting out of here if youre sure im sure and then for some reason she couldnt fathom she put her hand on his arm it was a fleeting gestureof congratulationof comfort she wasnt sure but she knew that she was compelled to do it her hand stayed he looked down at her fingers resting on the sleeve of his theatre gown and his face twisted into an expression she didnt recognise for one fleeting moment his hand came up to cover hers warmth flooded between themand something else something she couldnt begin to recognise youre right dr harper he said softly so softly she could hardly catch the words i need to get out of here he left the two nurses wheeled kim through to recovery and rachel was left with jane the lady with the video and pat the lady on the floor holding the mobile phone theyd never met until three hours ago and they were grinning at each other like fools that was fantastic rachel said and if she couldnt keep her voice steady who could blame her jane i have no idea how you filmed that without fainting fainting isnt what i felt like jane admitted what i felt like was far more messy but i figured i could do the messy stuff afterwards when no one needed me and hey guess what now i dont feel like it at all any more you realise you guys saved kims leg the video recording and computer link had meant the specialists on the end of the line had been able to watch them every step of the way and pats relayed instructions had given rachel every skill shed needed we all saved kims leg pat decreed she rose and came across to give her friend a hug and then the two of them hugged rachel this wasnt something thatd happen in a big city hospital but it was an entirely appropriate action here a great action we make a fantastic team pat said roundly were so glad youre here now dr harper something tells me dr mcinnes is going to need the best team he can get the words somehow broke through her exhaustion they didnt make sense what was pat saying something about hugo needing a team surely that need was past why now she asked why would hugo need me any more now a really solid medical team is exactly what were going to need now pat told her the winds swung around word came through as we were on our way in here the fires blocking the highway theres no way in and theres no way out and the fires getting bigger by the minute rachel walked through to the sink and hauled off her theatre gown without even thinking she was so tired she could hardly stand she ran cold water over her wrists and then splashed her face trying to haul her tired mind into gear she was stuck in this town well done you the voice behind her made her jump and she turned to find hugo in the doorway the exhaustion in his face matched hers well done yourself she managed hed startled her more he unnerved her he really did have a gorgeous smile she decided crooked but nice and the way hed touched her no she didnt want to think about the way hed touched her what was a doctor like hugoa doctor with such skillsdoing in a place like this the surgery hed just performed had been amazing he should have trained in surgery he could be one of the countrys finest i like cowral he told her and her eyes widened what you were thinking whats a nice boy like me doing in a place like this he told her and he was so near the truth that she gasped i dont i wasnt its what all city doctors think why on earth would anyone practise in such a remote area but i think that cowrals fantastic im here through choice while you dr harper are truly stuck at some time since shed kicked him out of the operating suite hed hauled off his theatre gown underneath he was wearing moleskins and a casual shirt similar to the ones hed been wearing at the dog show though without the gore somehow hed found time to change before surgery he was transformed again she thought doctor to farmer doctor to farmer what was she thinking she wondered she was finding it hard to concentrate on what mattered the fires being stuck here craig oh god she shouldnt be here she was here she was trapped without craig the fires are bad the fires are a problem he told her he was splashing cold water on his face as if he needed to wake himself up and his voice was muted the burns in the national park theres no private property threatened but the neck of land into town has been cut when the fire shifted everyone who wasnt local got out of town before the road closed you were in theatre when the evacuation call came through we didnt give you that option he rubbed his face on a towel and then looked at her really looked at her and his voice softened im sorry rachel but youre stuck here for the duration she swallowed and tried to think through the implications we could get helicopter evacuation she said at last and he nodded still watching her we could if it was urgent but kims no longer an urgent case are you urgently required back in sydney was she urgently needed no she had to admit at least not by the hospital as of last friday she was officially on holiday the trip to cowral had been intended to be a weekend away followed by two weeks of lying in the sun back in sydney though shed have lain on bondi beach so she could still visit craig morning and night craig needed her no craig didnt need her she needed to get her head around that once and for all she couldnt but the reality was that no one would complain if she wasnt back in sydney for the next few days least of all craig she may as well admit it umno thats great he told her because i may just need you myself hugo needed her great everyone needed rachel everyone always had so what was new dear god she wanted to go home craig she didnt have a choice she was here with hugo while craig was craig just was chapter three rachel walked slowly back to the showgrounds dragging her feet in toobig sandals shed told hugo she needed to see to penelope kims parents were needing more reassurance hed been distracted and shed slipped away he had enough to worry about without her worries which were considerable it was just on dusk the evening was still and very very warm the sound of the sea was everywhere cowral was built on a bluff overlooking the southern ocean the stars were a hazy sheen of silver under a smoky filter to the north she could see the soft orange glow of threatening fire it was too far away to worry about she thought maybe itd stay in the national park and behave meanwhile itd be a great time for a swim but she had things to sort penelope accommodation sleep michaels aston martin was parked at the entrance to the showgrounds and she looked at it with a frown shed thrown the car keys back at michael were they in his pocket right now as he did his heroic lifesaving thing back in the city or had he left the keys in penelopes dog stall it was all very well standing on ones dignity she thought ruefully but if hed taken his keys then shed be walking everywhere she didnt like her chances of hotwiring an aston martin meanwhile meanwhile penelope rachel pushed open the wire gates of the dog pavilion and went to find the second of her worries michael might have taken his car keys but he hadnt taken his dog penelope was right where rachel had left her sitting in the now empty dog pavilion gazing out with the air of a dog whod been deserted by the world oh you poor baby she hugged the big dog and hauled herself up into the stall to think about her options i havent deserted you even if your master has penelope licked her face then nosed her crimplene in evident confusion you dont like my fashion sense either she gave a halfhearted smile were stuck with it but meanwhile meanwhile she was hungry no make that starving shed had one bite of a very soggy hamburger some hours ago the remains had long gone penelope didnt look hungry at all you ate the rest of my hamburger penelope licked her again fine it was disgusting anyway but what am i supposed to eat she gazed about her the pavilion was deserted michael hadnt left his keys her bag was over at the caretakers residence where shed showered she could walk over there and fetch it but why the contents of the bag were foul she had her purse with hershed tucked it into a pocket of the capacious crimplene she needed nothing else wrong she needed lots of things she had nothing else so she had her purse a dog and a really rumbling stomach i guess we walk into town she told penelope the only problem was that the hospital and the showgrounds were on one side of the river and the tiny township of cowral was on the other we dont have a choice she told the dog walking is good for us lets get used to it the key to our wheels has just taken himself back to sydney and were glad he has compared to your master i hate to tell you penelope but walking looks good in comparison cowral was closed it was a tiny seaside town it was sunday night all the tourists had left when the roads had started to be threatened rachel trudged over the bridge and into town to find the place was shut down as if it was dead winter and midnight not a shop was open by the time she reached the main street the pall of smoke was completely covering the moon and only a couple of streetlights were casting an eerie foggy glow through the haze it looks like something out of sherlock holmes rachel told her canine companion murderer appears stage left she stood in the middle of the deserted street and listened to her stomach rumble and thought not very nice thoughts about a whole range of people a whole range of circumstances murder was definitely an option her phone was in her purse she hauled it out and looked at it who could she ring no one she didnt know anyone she stared at it some more and as if shed willed it it rang all by itself she was so relieved she answered before it had finished the first ring rachel it was dotties bright chirpiness sounding down the line her motherinlaw whod so wanted this weekend to work rachel i hope im not intruding but i so wanted to know how it was going where are you dear rachel thought about it im standing in the main street of cowral she said thinking about dinner oh she could hear dotties beam down the line are you going somewhere romantic maybe outdoors rachel said cautiously looking around at her options under the stars she looked through the smoke toward the sea on the beach how wonderful is the weather gorgeous rachel tried not to cough from smoke inhalation gorgeous and you have such gorgeous company rachel looked dubiously down at penelope yes yes i do you know we so wanted you to have a good time lewis and i theres no chance of extending your time there i suppose actually there may be rachel told her she explained about the fires and the road being cut theres nothing to worry about butwe may be held up here for a few more days there was no reason to explain that we meant rachel and an afghan hound not rachel and a gorgeous hunk of eligible cardiologist but her words were just what dottie wanted to hear oh my dear thats lovely she could hear dotties beam widen unless the fires are a real problem they dont seem to be australians understood about bushfires most national parks burned every few years or sothey needed to burn to regenerateand as long as they didnt threaten townships they werent a worry dottie clearly thought this time theyd been sent from heaven dottie she said cautiously craig youre not to worry we told you and we meant it his father and i have taken right over as we should have long ago as you should have let us but you concentrate on yourself dorothy told her you concentrate on your future on your romantic dinner under the stars thats an order and the phone went dead great she stared at it her link with home she should be back in the hospital right now why wasnt she craig dont think about it think about now now what if there was no dinner to be had in cowral then she needed to think about her next need sleep accommodation cowral bays only motelthe place where michaeltherat had slept last nightwas on the other side of the river shed walk back over the bridge she decided shed leave penelope in her dog box in the pavilion and book herself into the motel hey maybe the motel even had room service by the time she reached the motel her feet in her borrowed sandals were screaming that she had blisters shed bother with taking penelope back to the pavilion later she decided so she tied the dog to a tree and walked into motel reception to find no room at the inn sorry love the motel owner told her casting a nervous glance at rachels dubious apparel theres fire crews from the other side of the peninsula trapped here now and theyve booked us out do you have a restaurant rachel asked with more hope than optimism and was rewarded by another dubious look and another shake of the head everyones closed the country womens association are putting on food twentyfour hours a day for the firefighters in the hall over the bridge but you dont look like a firefighter rachel swallowed no no i dont are you ok love the woman asked her eyes narrowed you dont need one of them womens refuge places do you i could call the police for you if you like great that was all she needed a girl had some pride but rachel was really struggling to find it here she took a deep breath and pulled herself together maybe womens refuges had food good grief what was she thinking um no thank you she fished in her purse and found a couple of coins there was a candy dispensing machine by the counter and the sweets looked really inviting ill ring a friend but meanwhile ill just buy a couple of these im sorry love the woman told her the machines broken the technicians due tomorrowif he can get through the fires rachel walked outside and untied penelope then she considered trying really hard not to panic panic seemed an increasingly enticing option shed go back to the hospital she decided hugo had said he needed her how much he was about to be put to the test if you need me youll have to house and feed me shed tell him no feed me first she corrected herself and penelope maybe she couldnt expect hugo to take on penelope shed take her back to the pavilion bad idea it had been almost an hour now since rachel had collected penelope penelope had been the last dog to leave and the showground caretakers had done their duty at some time while rachel had walked into town and back again the high wire gates had been bolted closed the caretakers residence was in the centre of the grounds well out of shouting distance rachel put her head against the cyclone wire and closed her eyes great just great the whole situation was getting farcical where was this womens refuge this has to go into the record books as the most romantic weekend a girl has ever had she told penelope but penelope looked at her with the sad eyes of an afghan hound who hadnt been fed you ate my hamburger rachel told her dont even think about looking at me like that she sighed her stomach rumbled a response she put her hand on penelopes collar and started trudging toward the hospital there was the sound of vehicle behind hera big one she moved onto the verge a fire truck came around the bend on the wrong side of the road it veered onto the grassy verge and she had to jump for her life if shed been one whit less angry she might have been hit but her reflexes were working fine rachel was tired and hungry and worried but there was still a vast well of anger directed at michael and herself and her circumstances when the fire truck swerved around the bend on the wrong side of the road it was almost as if she expected it she yelped and leapt and as the truck screeched to a halt she found herself sprawled ignominiously in the grass at the side of the road with penelope somehow sprawling on top of her great what else could possibly happen to her she lay and addressed herself to a clump of grass right under her nose beam me up scottie wheres a spaceship when you need one are you ok miss the horror in the voice above her had her pushing herself up from the road she might be mad as fire but no one here deserved to think theyd squashed her im fine she rolled over shoved a startled penelope off hauled her crimplene down to something akin to decency and tried to look fine honest oh heck the man had reached her hed been driving the truck behind him his fellow firefighters were climbing down from the cab to see what was wrong the engine was still running and the truck lights were illuminating the road i could have killed you its your lucky day you didnt she tried a smile and the muscles almost worked sort of they were gathering round her now a bunch of men and women with blackgrimed faces fire uniforms and hard hats they looked exhausted they were looking at her with concern she must look a real candidate for her womens refuge she thought and the concept was looking more and more appealing if there was a womens refuge somewhere around here that would take her with an afghan hound shed be in there like a shot or maybe she gave penelopes backside another shove maybe even without an afghan were really sorry the fireman told her and she tried focusing on the man before her he looked scared to death i guess you werent expecting hikers she told him its too dark to walk off the road she hauled herself upward someone gave her a hand which she accepted with gratitude then she looked more closely at the man before her under the soot there were cuts and scratches blood as well as grime he looked dreadful are you ok stupid question really it was absolutely obvious that he wasnt i just he wiped his hand across his eyes my eyes the smoke and hed been driving you need to go to the hospital she told him thats where were going there was a shedthe farmer told us it was used for storing hay so we made an attempt to save it what he forgot to tell us was that he stored fuel in there as well the thing went up with a bang that scared us almost as much as we scared you but thats all the damage thank god theres a few of us with sore eyes but were thinking that weve been lucky lucky or not they looked shocked and ill rachels personal problems were set aside in the face of these peoples needs you should have been treated before you drove docs been busy someone said we heard up on the ridge that he couldnt come up hes been caught up with a dogbite or something of course hed been caught up and there was no one else rachel thought he was on his own except for her hugo had her whether he liked it or not and a fat lot of use she was she thought ruefully hiking round the country with her crazy afghan hound looking for food and for shelter as if she were destitute it was time she hauled herself together and started being useful tell you what she said brushing gravel from her knees and trying to stop her knees from doing the shaking they were so intent on lets all go to the hospital im a doctor and im needed there but if its ok with you she managed a shaky grin as she looked around their smokefilled eyes which were now tinged with disbelief a doctor in crimplene but she wasnt going down that road explanations could take hours indulge me with something ive always wanted to do she told them im a country girl from way back once upon a time i even drove my dads truck at haycarting so i have my heavy vehicle licence so all you have to do is say yes let me drive your fire engine which was how dr rachel harper md dressed in glorious crimplene and doris keens sandals with gravel in her knees nothing in her stomach and dog hair all over her got to drive the cowral bay fire truck with a bunch of ten disgustingly dirty and slightly injured firefighters and one potential australian champion afghan in the back you told me to have a weekend to remember she silently told her absent motherinlaw as they headed for the hospital well dottie im doing just that hugo wasnt at the hospital and rachel was aware of a stab of disappointment but at least the nurses knew her from that afternoon when shed helped with kim they greeted her as a friend and the orderly took over penelopes care as if she was no trouble at all youve come to help miss he told her as the firefighters milled around the emergency room and it was obvious to everyone that rachel needed to turn into a doctor again youre very welcome ill give your dog some dinner shall i dinner yes actually i but dinner wasnt her destiny its great that youre here david the gingerhaired nurse whod helped with kim was looking more flustered than he had that afternoon one of our old farmers had a stroke an hour ago dr mcinnes had to go out there in a hurry and heres all these guys needing checking can i give you a hand and well see what we can do together she worked for an hour it was solid medicine but straightforward washing out eyes checking bruises and cleaning scratches one of the women was suffering slightly from smoke inhalation and rachel decreed that she be admitted but the oxygen alleviated the symptoms almost immediately great she worked steadily through on minor stuff except the man whod been driving the truck he had a sliver of something nasty in his eye as well as a cut that was deep enough to need stitching but it was the eye she was worried about rachel shoved her rumbling stomach aside and focused she dropped in fluoresceina yellow stainand examined the eye through the ophthalmoscope and worried can we xray she asked david sure the xray came backstill worrying she pinned it against the light and fretted some more as the door opened behind her problem she turned and it was hugo for a momentfor just a momentit was as much as she could do not to fall into his arms with relief shed pushed hunger and exhaustion and shock away but the events of the day were catching up with her she was really close to breaking point falling into a colleagues arms wasnt exactly professional she got a grip sort of mental slap around the ears she hauled herself into as much of a medical mode as she could muster theres a foreign body just at the edge of the cornea she told him turning back to the lightbox and attempting to concentrate on the image there was fuel in metal drums that exploded while they were trying to save a shed this looks like a sliver of metal embedded in the cornea but not penetrating his sights blurred but maybe thats just the reaction to the pain and a bit of debris thats on the surface the eye wont stop watering theres a couple of nasty lacerations around the eye itself thatll need stitching but its the metal im worried about its very near the optic nerve if he moves while im trying to manoeuvre it out well i dont think i can cope with this under local anaesthetic hugo nodded he crossed to stand beside her and they stared at the screen together its not touching anything crucial i think we could do it he stared at it a bit longer maybe youre right though its going to be fiddly but under a local anaesthetic id rather not he looked down at her and smiled like you ophthalmology isnt my speciality it looks straightforward enough as long as he doesnt move but theres a bit of repair work to do and im not superconfident eyes arent my area of expertise and if i have to fiddle and curse id prefer that the patient was sedated while i did it that makes two of us she looked at the xray some more and even managed a shaky smile we couldnt evacuate him to the city its a very small sliver its not penetrating evacuating means bringing a helicopter from the city and visibility is making things dangerous yes but but we do have two doctors he went on inexorably even if one of them looks like she just came out of a welfare shop from a home for battered women actually she said with dignity ive had one offer to take me there in a squad car already tonight have you the ready laughter she was starting to know flashed into his eyes the fire guys tell me they nearly ran you down yeah but then they let me drive their fire engine she told him which was really cool the deep smile lurking in the back of his eyes strengthened into the beginnings of something that looked like pure admiration and surprise she flushed but his eyes were sliding down to her legs breaking the moment hed seen her bloodstained knee that graze wants washing and we all need dinner and a sleep and its not going to happen she told him still strangely flushed what was it with this man that had the capacity to unsettle her she had to move on our firefighter has an empty stomach which means hes ready for anaesthesia now she told him his eye isnt going to get better on its own if were going to operate there isnt a better time than now is there nope he sighed i guess not lead on dr harper do you want to operate or do you want to do the anaesthetic im choosing anaesthetics she told him two anaesthetics in one day i think im starting to specialise it took longer than they had thought it would by the time they finished and the firefighter was recovering in the ward neatly stitched foreign body removed and intravenous antibiotics preventing complications rachel was swaying on her feet she hadnt felt it at all while shed been in theatreadrenaline again she supposedbut when she emerged she sagged her stocks of adrenaline must be at an alltime low she crossed to the sinks and held on and if she hadnt held on she would have sunk to the floor itd pass shed worked exhausted in the past after nights on duty when craig no dont go there in a minute shed start considering the complications surrounding her but for now for now she held on hey hugo had hauled off his gown and was watching her his eyes narrowing in concern are you ok she thought about it ok people kept asking her that and the concept was ludicrous if youre offering to take me back to my womens refuge the answer is yes womens refuge any sort of refuge she muttered as long as it serves dinner bread and dripping would be fine come to think about it bread and dripping would be fantastic youre hungry you stole my hamburgerremember so i did he was looking at her as if shed just landed from outer space that waswhateight hours ago it feels more and i didnt eat it then penelope finished it for me someone took her off to feed her when i arrived i bet shes had a really good meal doggos or something something really delicious what did you do between operating on kim and now he asked and she rolled her eyes i walked i walked in these really stupid sandals which by the way are about ten sizes too big i walked back to the pavilion to find michael hadnt left me the keys to his car i brought his stupid dog from the pavilion and i walked into town searching for a café to discover the whole place has shut its like a ghost town i walked back to the motel to discover the place has been booked out by the boys own fire brigade and their restaurant doesnt serve meals and their candyvending machine is broken i walked back to the showgrounds to discover the gates had been locked i started to walk back here but the fire engine nearly ran me down i came in here i washed out a few eyes i sewed up a gashed leg and now ive operated on an eye so i think maybe ive reached my limit im wearing doris keens crimplene my feet hurt my stomachs empty i dont even have a dog box to sleep in and im very very close to hysterics she eyed him with caution and if you dare to even twitch the sides of your mouth with the suggestion of laughter dr mcinnes i intend to lie down on the floor and give way to a fullscale tantrum theyll hear me back in sydney im not his mouth definitely twitched but it was hauled back under control fast im not laughing i dont believe you im definitely not he bit his lip pushed the laughter resolutely to the backburner and eyed her with a certain amount of caution ok it appears you need some help where shall we start food she told him as bad as that worse lets go then he smiled it fits with what i need to do he told her im hungry too you havent had dinner one of my very elderly patients had a stroke ive been out there with her she died an hour ago im sorry dont be he told her annie was a ninetysixyearold farmer shes run her own farm since her husband walked out on her sixty years ago she didnt miss him a bit shes had a great life she was healthy and happily living in her own home until the end and i wish all endings could be as happy mmm it was a happy ending but his words had caught her unawares twisting her thoughts back to where her thoughts always ended craig she swallowed she looked down at her hands and found her hands had clenched into fists craig for some stupid reason her eyes were filling with tears which was ridiculous surely she should be used to this by now it was just that shed never been away for eight years food she needed food thats why she was reacting like this hugo was watching her with concern and she blinked and sniffed and got on with it sorry she told him i was justreacting to the day or something did you say you knew where we can find some food he was still watching her still with that look that said he saw far more than she wanted him to but he accepted that she needed to move on well give you a few biscuits and cheese to keep the wolf from the door while i wash your knee first he told her i need a medico with two good legsnot with one infected then we find toby tobys down at the town hall and thats where the food is theres a fire effort happening in town and the locals are either out on the front or working to support them even at this late hour therell be food so well collect toby and feed you two birds with one stone she blinked back the last of her emotion and managed a grin lead on then she told him two birds did you say ill eat them both that hed noticed the embedded gravel in her knee amazed her the crimplene was flapping around her calves and her knees were hardly exposed maybe one of the firefighters had told him or maybe hed justnoticed he was that sort of a doctor she decided as he carefully scrubbed the surface and then checked that each particle of gravel had been removed itd be hard to do it herself but it was also hard to sit still and watch his bent head as he concentrated on what he was doing his fingers were the fingers of a surgeon she decided he was skilled and careful andkind he unnerved her she didnt understand the emotions he engendered and she wasnt sure that she wanted to ththank you she murmured as he put a dressing in place over the damaged skin he smiled up at her think nothing of it maam i owe you one why i disparaged your dog penelopes michaels dog she said before she could help herself and he gave a rueful little smile so she is but isnt there something in the wedding vows that says with all your worldly goods doesnt that include afghan hounds hugo still thought she was married to michael she stared down at the band of gold on her left hand and gave a twisted smile married to michael ha but it wasnt the time or the place to disillusion him what was the point besides biscuits and cheese werent nearly enough we need to move on she murmured and he cast her a look that was curiously questioning and curiously understanding fine he said and he let his fingers stay on the dressing on her knee for just a fraction of a moment longer than he had to long enough to impartwhat comfort understanding she didnt know fine he told her lets move on they checked on kim first rachels stomach couldnt get any louder than it already was and when hugo suggested it she agreed there were some things still more important than food and seeing kim safely asleep was one of them she woke a couple of hours back hugo told her but she went back to sleep almost immediately her body would be so shocked that shed sleep for days rachel thought and she was sleeping soundly now kims mother was by her side sitting holding her hand doing nothing she was simply watching it was enough kim shows every sign that shell be fine hugo told the woman as rachel watched from the doorway he lifted the base of kims bedsheet to reveal two sets of very pink toes her circulations almost back to normal shes on maximum intravenous antibiotics her obs are great she looks as if shes going to have very little permanent damage well do more nerve tests in the morning but she wiggled everything when she woke and had full sensation your husband was watching did he tell you he did mrs sandersons face creased in fierce concentration concentrating on control i was home getting some things for her when she woke her fragile control broke and her voice choked on a sob i shouldnt have left kim needed her things i mean i shouldnt have left her at the showgrounds she wanted to show knickers if id thought the jeffreys could be stupid enough to let their dog off the lead i just didnt realisehow easy it is to lose someone we came so close but not close enough hugo said gently his hand on the womans shoulder shell be fine he smiled down into her tearful face tell me how knickers is it was the right thing to ask it made the terror recede the woman gulped and gave him a watery smile knickers is good she took a big breath and searched for calm shed been to the brink rachel realised this day would live with her for ever the vet says hell be ok though my husband is saying itll cost more to have knickers fixed than kim we cant claim a cocker spaniels expenses through medical insurance hugo grinned see im cheap at half the price he smiled a comfort smile rachel was starting to recognise now what about you going home and getting some rest weve sedated kim fairly heavily so id be surprised if she woke before morning i might just watch for a little more the woman whispered if its ok i just want to watch she just wanted to watch her breathing rachel thought she knew to sit there and watch a chest rise and fall she bit her lip and hugo turned and saw he thought it was the hunger though he must do there was surely no other reason for it she could see she had him confused and she fought to remove her expression the stillness of her face i need to take our dr harper for a feed he told mrs sanderson well leave you to your vigil but dont exhaust yourself kim will need you in the morning if only to prevent all her friends from visiting in the first five minutes keep up your strength i will the woman smiled through tears thank you both we were so lucky we were really lucky hugo said as they headed out to the parking lot together we were hugely lucky to have you here to help us we still are rachel said nothing at all the local hall was where the action was it was set a block back from the main street but even so rachel wondered how she could have missed it when she and penelope had walked into town hugo turned the corner and bright lights shone out through open doors even at midnight there were dozens of cars parked outside and people were spilling out onto the pavement so this is cowral bays night life she said faintly and hugo grinned it doesnt get any better than this come and meet cowral oh and id take a deep breath if i were you i suspect youve been voted an honorary local now like it or not she had from the moment she walked in the door she was welcomed as a friend a lifesaver shed treated the firemen and shed treated kim now she could tell why the pavilion had been locked and darkenedwhy the town itself had seemed abandoned everyone was here doris keen was busy making sandwiches but when she saw rachel she dropped what she was doing and came forward her arms outstretched oh my dear we were that worried we didnt know where youd got to we assumed youd gone home but then charlie found your husbands car and it was still locked we searched but then the fire brigade boys came in and they said youd gone back to the hospital and youve been working so hard everyone was assuming michael was her husband rachel thought shed been with him she wore a wedding ring it didnt matter let them she tried to think of michael with some degree of caring had he managed to save hubert witherspoon she didnt know and she didnt much mind for a moment she almost felt it in her to be sorry for him hed left and hed missed out onthis this hubbub of caring penelope the dog flashed back into her mind and she gave a guilty start her dog michaels dog was back at the hospital she half turned but hugo was before her our hospital orderly has taken penelope home for the night he told her jakes wife has a poodle we figured theyd get on fine what was it with this man he had the ability to read what she was thinking almost as she thought it the feeling was really really unnerving this ladys a real champion someone said behind her and she recognised one of the men whod been on the fire truck there were scores of firefighters here this must be their refuelling station before they went back to the fire or turned in for the night shes a hungry real champion hugo said from behind her his hand was on her shoulder and for some reason it was a huge support his warmth gave her shaking legs strength somehow his presence made this welcome feel realas if she was part of all this but it wasnt real she told herself a little bit desperately it was an illusion she was most definitely not a part of this she cast hugo an unsure glance and pulled away from under his hand but then she missed it when he released her she missedthe contact the link what daddy a voice yelled out from the other side of the hall and a tousleheaded pyjamaclad toby came bounding through the crowd of locals to greet him hugo reached out and caught him swinging him high in the air tobes why arent you in bed mrs partridge made me have an afternoon sleep toby said with all the indignation of a small man whose person has been significantly violated she said wed all had a nasty shock and she needed a liedown too so i went to sleep and now im wide awake and mrs partridges helping me make lamingtons for the firefighters to eat tomorrow can we stay for a while daddy yes we can he told him hugging him close far be it from me to interfere with lamingtonmaking and we need to wait for dr harper to be fed why because were taking her home to stay with us to stay with them he had to be kidding he wasnt theres nowhere else full to the brim of irish stew fresh bread rolls and tobys magnificent lamingtons rachel was tucked into hugos capacious car with as much room for argument as if shed been a parcel but why youve already discovered the motels full theres a couple of beds at the hospital but we need them while this fires burning i want all resources left free for emergencies toby and i have a big house at the rear of the hospital and theres two spare bedrooms but your wife im a widower he said bluntly but im trustworthy he put on his most trustworthy smile and she had to smile no but exactly no buts can you think of anywhere better he smiled across at her and his smile had her insides doing strange things very strange things indeed this was no trustworthy smile it looked exactly the opposite but he was still speaking she had to concentrate theres no womens refuge to be had he was saying despite the rumours the dog pavilions closed for the night and something tells me you werent very comfortable there last night anyway and the park benches are exceedingly hard so its us or nothing we really want you to stay toby announced from the back seat me and digger like you even though your dress looks funny gee thanks she fingered the crimplene and wondered how it was that the crimplene was the least odd thing in the succession of things that had happened to her today well do something about that tomorrow hugo announced but for now wed be very pleased if you took up our offer of accommodation dr harper what about it what about it there was only one answer to that she had no choice yes please she said and decided then and there that arguing was out of the question things were entirely out of her hands chapter four the house they took her to was a big old timber home in the same grounds as the hospital it had wide verandas all around and a garden that in the dim light cast by the hospital nightlights looked overgrown and rambling digger was lying on the front steps when they arrived he rushed down to greet them his whole body quivering in delight hugo pushed open the front door rachel walked inside as he followed carrying tobyand she stopped still in astonishment this wasnt a home it was an artwork a magnificent artwork like something out of vogue it had been furnished with exquisite taste in rich reds and golds every piece of furnishing was richly ornate and highly decorative the floor was sleekly polished with gorgeous persian rugs scattered at artistic intervals there were elegant pieces of sculpture carefully placed the settees and chairs were colour coordinated with dainty matching cushions artfully arranged heavy brocade curtains were held back looped and looped again with vast gold tassels that hung to the floor good grief this wasnt a doctors residence it wasnt a childs residence it was franklyscary but hugo seemed oblivious both to his surroundings and to her reaction toby would you show dr harper where shell sleep he asked ill put the coffee on he disappeared in the direction of the kitchen while toby towed her through to the back of the house the further she went the more awful it became this rooms where my daddy sleeps and this is where digger and i sleep toby told her and rachel had glimpses of two rooms with the same amazing furnishings he towed her further you can have this room or this room it made no difference which gorgeous brocade beds with hugely rich furnishings huge gold bows of something like velvet with threads of something shining and metallic hung at each corner of the bed the beds looked like they took half an hour of intense concentration and a degree in interior design to make each morning ugh do you and your daddy likeumreally decorated houses she asked as toby stood and waited for her verdict his small face furrowed in concentration why your whole house is sort offrilly and red and gold you guys must really like red and gold huh i like purple toby told her so daddy likes red and gold i think he likes blue toby considered some more or maybe yellow mr addington at the bank has a really yellow car and whenever my dad sees it he whistles and says what a beauty so why is your house red and gold my mummy decorated the house toby told her my mummy died just after i was born daddy was really sad i guess he would be rachels face softened losing your mummy would be really hard yeah but i didnt know her toby said with the blunt pragmatism of a sixyearold my daddy says aunty christine looks like her the photos are a bit the same and aunty christine loves this house she comes in here and looks at it and cries oh great aunty christine says digger shouldnt come into the house because he messes it up but daddy said he put his foot down over that whatever that means toby told her and i want a darth vader poster on my bedroom wall cos daddy and i love that movie but aunty christine says my mummy would hate it and i mustnt even ask daddy because itd make him sad do you think itd make him sad or is it something else hed put his foot down about maybe this wasnt a conversation she should get drawn into she decided not when shed known these people for not much more than two minutes there was lots of background here that she didnt understand but at least she had a bed she decided brightening an amazing bed shed had a truly excellent meal she could put up with a little red and gold opulence she sat down on the bed it gave under her weight she gave a tentative bounce and the bed bounced back the symmetry of the covers was ruined great do you do much bouncing she asked toby and he looked like he didnt know what she was talking about you ruin the covers if you bounce he told her aunty christine says so she says dont move things dont touch she says mummy would have everything perfect rachels eyes widened what an extraordinary statement butbouncings fun im sure your mummy would want you to have fun aunty christine would growl at me if i bounced on my bed would she growl at you if you bounced on mine toby thought about it deeply i guess she wouldnt he said at last youre a grownup she couldnt growl at you id like to see her try shed never met the unknown aunt christine but already she held her in aversion and hugo what had they created a shrine to a dead wife and sister when it should be a home she knewwho betterthat life was to be lived by the living for the living not for the dead it could all be taken away so quickly enough she bounced again and smiled at toby and moved along so that there was room beside her want to try yes toby said and went to join her they bounced digger watching from the doorway ventured further in looking as stunned as it was possible for a goofy dog to look they continued to bounce digger started to bark and toby giggled and bounced higher it was great stupid but great it had been one heck of a day rachels emotions had been pushed to the limit she didnt know what she was doing here she didnt have a clue what was happening to her but for nowfor this minute there was just one crazy time a tousleheaded child who looked as if he didnt get enough laughter in his life and rachel and rachel knew she definitely needed more laughter more bouncing if the springs broke shed pay for them she decided if the tassels frayed if the gilt was tarnished some things just had to be done and they had to be done now she had hold of tobys hands and they were bouncing in unison as digger barked a crazy accompaniment on the side what on earth she looked over to the doorway hugo was watching them stunned what on earth do you think youre doing she refused to give up the moment not yet shed had a very big day and so had toby a vision of tobys face as hed watched them work on kim came back to her it was too much horror for a sixyearold to be put to bed with he needed to sleep with bouncing were bouncing dr mcinnes she told him then gripped tobys hands tighter and bounced again care to join us youll break the bedsprings ill pay for them she said nobly im donating one set of bedsprings to the common good i need a bounce and so does toby im sure you do too i wouldnt fit he said faintly and she grinned thats what you get for showing your guest to a room with a single bed daddys got a bigger bed toby volunteered midbounce can we can go there digger barked again as if he thought that was a truly excellent idea my beds for sleeping in hugo told them and rachel grimaced how boring the kettles boiled do you want a drink rachel considered she bounced a couple of times and looked down at toby he bounced with her and met her lookcoconspirators cobouncers do we want a drink toby id like some hot chocolate he told her and bounced again that sounds good another bounce maybe we could stop and bounce again tomorrow night are you staying for two nights she cast a sideways glance at hugo and bounced a bit more i may she told him if im not kicked out because of my bouncing habits i think im needed because of the fire toby asked and she nodded because of the fire and becausemaybe because you guys could do with a bit of bouncing like me what was happening here hugo prepared three mugs of hot chocolate and listened to their laughter hed backed out of the room fast why he didnt know confusion he thought he was definitely confused the sight of one crazy doctor gorgeous in her borrowed crimplene holding his little son and bouncing as if she were six years old too confusion summed it up he thought she was like no one hed ever met she wasgorgeous she was also married she was wearing a band of gold very definitely on the third finger of her left hand she was attached to a creep called michael how attached married attached but thenhe wore a wedding band as well why habit he guessed beth had been dead for almost six years now so why did he keep wearing the ring the vision of christine came into his head beths older sister christine who came in every day and cared for toby fussed over this house made sure toby had a memory of his mother christine would marry him he knew that she was just waiting for him to move on from her sister so he wore a wedding ring its time you got over it christine had told him but he wasnt ready he hadnt been ready to marry beth he hadnt wanted to marry anyone the memory of his parents loveless marriage was always therehis mother cool and calculating with eyes only for things of monetary value and his father whod had eyes only for women he could bed he himself had been raised to be selfcontained aloof and indifferent and only toby had ever been able to get under his skin the thought of rachel came back into his vision bouncing christine would never bounce not in a fit neither would beth his exwife have bounced neither would his mother rachel wasdifferent but rachel had a husband he thought back to the silverhaired cardiologist hed met so briefly the man might be odious but he was obviously an extremely wealthy and wellconnected doctor and they were married so rachel might be bouncing in his spare bedroom with his small son but she had a husband and an afghan hound and a life back in the city so stop thinking of her likewhat like his father thought of women no it wasnt like that this was something he had never felt beforein truth hed never known he could feel this way ever but he was certainly feeling and the problem washe couldnt stop to save himself the hot chocolate was excellent exhausted glowing with exertion from their bouncing rachel and toby enjoyed it equally hugo watched them as hed watch two kids with their play lunch and rachel looked up and caught his eye and said what what do you meanwhat what are you grinning at i was just thinking you and toby look of an age toby is very mature for six she set her mug down on the table and rose to her feet which all of a sudden didnt feel too steady it had been a rollercoaster of a day and she was rolling downward to sleep and im sure its tobys and my bedtime toby had an afternoon nap i didnt even have a nap last night why not itd take far too long to explain she said with dignity she eyed him with indecision i suppose you wouldnt happen to have a spare toothbrush would you my gears still at the showgrounds not only a toothbrush he grinned while you and toby were bouncing i made you up a sleeping kit one pair of pyjamas slightly large one brandnew toothbrush and a comb everything else you need youll find in the guest bathroom she swallowed heck it was a small enough gesture but it was enough the man was thoughtful the man smiled the man was seriously gorgeous goodnight then she said and there was a distinct tremor in her voice his smile died and their eyes met something passed between them that was indefinable but it was stillthere but there was nothing to say to try and bring it into the openthis thing impossible goodnight he said and she knew he was thinking no such thing he was thinking exactly what she was thinking impossible what was it with her hugo stood and watched while rachel walked away from him down the corridor to her bedroom her door closed behind her but he stood and watched for a very long time what was it dottie my dear why are you ringing at this time of night im checking rachel was tucked into her opulent bed her cellphone resting on her pillow i just need dottie i need to know you know hes just the same he always will be just the same whether youre here or not now are you somewhere nice with that nice young man i rachel bit her lip that nice young man maybe she could apply the adjective to toby yes she said yes i am has he taken you somewhere gorgeous she smiled at that this at least was an easy question its all red and gold brocade she whispered and incredibly luxurious dottie you should see the bed there was a moments silence and then dottie spoke again deeply satisfied then why are you wasting time on the phone talking about it she demanded you put your phone down this minute and go and make the most of it make the most of it that was a joke rachel put the phone down and pulled up her covers but in the end she did make the most of it or she did what she most needed to do she slept digger was barking rachel surfaced to sunlight streaming in over her bed she blinked trying to figure out just where she was memory came flooding back she stretched out in her toobig pyjamas and thought this wasnt such a bad place to live if you took away the brocade and the tassels and the particularly ghastly cupids staring dotingly down from the mantelpiece her bedroom was facing east shed hauled back the dreadful crimson drapes the night before and now she could see right out to the ocean beyond why the bedroom had drapes she didnt know unless the local cows were nosy there were cows in the paddock beyond the house the sea was beyond the cows and beyond the sea was the horizon a smoky haze was filtering the light but it still looked great her apartment at the hospital looked out at a brick wall maybe she could move to the country when craig yeah right get a grip craig she groped under her bed for her purse checked the timeit was eight oclock far later than she usually slept even after huge nights on callfound her phone and dialled home some things were automatic but some things werent needed or wanted what are you doing ringing again dorothy sounded cross that shed contacted her i told you not to and i meant it rachel leave it be i cant tell you how delighted we are that youre having a good time but craig there was silence then you know very well how craig is dear i told you lewis popped in before breakfast and hes stable as he always is rachel its no use ringing but you will let me know rachel love nothings going to change and you know it you go back to whatever it is youre doing her motherinlaw said gently stop ringing move on get yourself a life a life right dorothy thought she was having a nice romantic time she looked down at herself dressed in what she guessed were hugos spare pyjamas blue and yellow stripes very fetching she looked at the bedside chair where doriss crimplene lay waiting which she said to herself romantic choice eh which would cinderella wear and wheres my fairy godmother when i need her hugo and toby and the plump roundfaced lady shed seen taking care of toby yesterday were all having breakfast oh and digger the lady was just setting down a plate of scraps under the table this was clearly doggy heaven it was rachel heaven she sniffed bacon coffee toast some things were irresistible she hitched up her pyjamas and hiked right in hi she said and tried not to look selfconscious hi said toby while the lady and hugo just looked no comment is required she told them she glared at hugoat the lurking laughter she could see behind his eyes dont even think about it she held out her hand to the bacon lady while the other still clutched her waist im rachel im myra partridge the lady told her taking her hand and gripping it with warmth and real friendliness she eyed rachels outfit in concern theyre not the doctors pyjamas i have no idea she told her theyre the ones the doctor kindly gave me last night all i know is that theyre not this doctors pyjamas theyre threatening to slide but ive decided that they still look better on me than doris keens frock does oh my dear myras lips twitched she was in her late fifties rachel guessed with eyes that said she smiled most of the time she reached into a kitchen drawer and proffered a safety pinwhich rachel accepted with real gratitude i saw you in doriss frock last night doris rang a while back if she wants her frock back shes welcome to it rachel thought about it though she might want to come and get it i cant see myself hiking over to her place in these sit yourself down they were all smiling now as she stuck the safety pin in placeall three of them the kitchen felt great here the opulence and overdecoration were toned down by the sheer domesticity of cooking and the dog under the table and smiling people there were pots and pans and pancakes rachel said faintly i thought youd all be hungry myra beamed the doctors been out since dawn has he rachels smile slipped she looked across the table at hugo problems kims running a fever not too bad im hoping its nothing ive upped the antibiotics to maximum and a couple of the fire crews have been working through the night i checked them as they came in hed be doing something else if it wasnt kim and the fire crews myra said comfortably hes always gone at dawn i come in and look after the wee one until aunty christine comes in and takes me to school toby told her mrs partridge would take me to school and i want her to but aunty christine makes dad let her she wasnt buying into any family argument not yet well lucky you to have two ladies to escort you she wriggled herself around in her pyjamas testing the security of the pin she let go the waist and did a little test jumpher hands hovering just in case while hugo toby myra and digger looked on fascinated they were doomed to disappointment the safety pin held she sat herself down and reached for a pancake deeply satisfied you were going to wake me up for some of these right hugo was looking at her with a very strange expression umright i wanted to wake you up hours ago toby announced but daddy wouldnt let me you have a very kind daddy rachel beamed just as long as he lets me share his pancakes and his bacon and coffee very kind indeed clothes that was the most important thing doris dropped your bag off an hour ago myra told her but shes kept your clothes theres stains i dont want to know about them rachel said firmly thinking about the last time shed seen them and deciding if she never saw them again itd be too soon theres nothing wrong with crimplene and flannelette digger saved your bra toby told her and she faltered her bra the last time shed seen that had been whoops flannelette and crimplene and lacy black bras are hardly professional hugo told her and rachel managed a sickly sort of smile umno not your whitecoated doctor image huh no he said faintly and her grin widened hey it wasnt he who was doing the discomposing it was suddenly hugo who was discomposed she had hugo mcinnes out of his comfort zone which feltgood definitely good she decided he made her discomposed it was nice to have him a little discomposed in return but he was about to discompose her again i think we have the problem sorted he told her mmm she was into a mouthful of bacon yesterdays hunger was still fresh enough to make her really appreciate her food and this was seriously good christines bringing you some clothes she thought about it christine she looked at toby red and gold christine they all knew what she meant there were three smiles but hugo was rising pushing back his coffeecup shes very good i dont know where wed be without her and shes not red and gold at all she has a style all her own he glanced at his watch she should be here in a few minutes to take toby to school i need to do a house call if its ok with you rachel ill collect you in an hour and take you out to our nursing home i was hoping you might be able to help he paused as if what he was asking was an impertinence but she wasnt in the mood for worrying over impertinence of course ill help if im trapped here i may as well be useful but how the fires are worsening he motioned to the window and the haze between there and the sea seem to be thicker theyre not threatening the town yet but the crews are working hard to keep it like that and most of the crews are made up of volunteers with differing levels of fitnessas well as differing levels of common sense there are lots of medical problems i need to go up to the ridge so youd like me to do the coughs and colds and the like while you do the hero stuff would you of course i would she grinned at him there was something about this man that made her want to smileeven when she was offering to do his mundane work for him while he did the exciting stuff though i guess that means i dont get to drive fire trucks any more his smile matched hers i heard about your firetruck driving very impressive but still his eyes smiled at herlinking themwarming parts of her she hadnt known were cold crazy butnice youre hardly dressed for firetruck duty she looked down at her pyjamas and pouted whats wrong with these i reckon id look pretty snappy behind the wheel of a fire truck in flannelette pyjamas your safety pin would never hold he chuckled and the strange link was broken for now ok lets negotiate the duty roster when were organised when youre wearing something a bit more doctorlike meanwhile i have to go myra can you he was interrupted in midsentence the back door swung wideand in walked christine it wasnt hard to pick her rachel looked up from her bacon and she knew straight away who this had to be the lady was seriously lovely she also wasnt decorated at all she didnt need to be what had hugo said she has a style all her own she certainly did she was tall with flamecoloured hair swept up into a sleek knot the hair itself seeming to tug the flawless complexion free of any lines no lines would dare come near this woman she was wearing cropped black pants to calf length a tiny white top strappy black sandals and a silver bracelet that must have cost a fortune she looked as if she belonged in an innercity art gallery rachel thought with only one very fast rueful glance down at her pyjamas she thought back to the people shed seen yesterday at the cowral show this woman didnt fit hello all the womans greeting was bright and warm she smiled straight at hugo though rachel noticed and toby didnt look up from his breakfast are you ready toby you can see hes still eating his breakfast rachel thought but she didnt say so the question seemed to be rhetorical christine had dropped a carry bag on the floor and was reaching for the coffeepot heaven you make the best coffee hugo harrumph myra rose and stumped over to the sink and rachel wondered who had made the coffee by the expression on myras face it wasnt hard to guess maybe it didnt matter though christine had moved on youre the new doctor christine sank into the chair myra had just left as if it was her right and turned her attention to rachel so youre rachel ive heard all about you she motioned to the bag there are some clothes i purchased for you from our local discount store i hope theyre what you want hugo theyre what hugo wanted rachel raised her brows at hugo and he attempted a smile he looked a bit uncomfortable i phoned christine and told her you were in trouble who me rachel tried hard to sound nonchalant i like pyjamas discount store hey obviously shed been categorised by crimplene she swallowed her last piece of pancake and smiled at all of them discount store maybe she should put that aside there were undercurrents here that she clearly didnt understand undercurrents that were maybe more important than her pride toby was concentrating fiercely on his pancake and wasnt looking at anyone myra was looking angry what was going on it didnt matter this wasnt her place and these people had nothing to do with her in a couple of days the fires would die down and shed be out of here the clothes are all here christine swept a manicured hand at her bag and smiled at hugo and rachel thought unconcerned or not im with toby here his little nose was practically in his toast but she knew her manners thank you christine she told her have you bought them how much do i owe you ill pay hugo said but christine put a hand sweetly on his arm its fine dear the mathesons who run the discount store know youre stuck they wont charge you hugo was stuck gee she was having fun here rachel thoughtor she didnt think she rose and lifted christines obnoxious bag she hated it already even though she hadnt opened it ill pick up my bill fromwho did you say mathesons if i really need this she told them otherwise ill return it thank you anyway christine now if youll excuse me she huffed at the lot of them toby looked up at her and she caught the sixyearolds eye and gave him a tiny sideways wink then she sailed from the room with as much dignity as a girl in toobig pyjamas could muster theyre horrible they were all gonetoby and hugo and christine christine to take toby to school and hugo to do his house call rachel peered out into the kitchen where myra was washing the dishes the housekeeper turned and rachel looked at her with despair in her eyes i cant wear these sorry the housekeeper wiped her hands on the dishcloth and looked rachel up and down rachel was wearing doriss crimplene again look she held up a pair of black trousers plain dead plain voluminous with a heavy vinyl belt she held up a neat white cotton blouse another identical blouse a plain black cardigan black flatsoled sandals at least doriss crimplene has flowers on she wailed and hugos pyjamas have stripes myra i may be stuck here but these are awful christine only wears black and white myra said dubiously coming forward and taking the offending garments away from her only only christines clothes are beautifully cut and really really stylish and these clothes are built to fit anyone anyone at all or no one these are burial clothes myra myra cast her another dubious glance you dont think maybe youre going over the top here no rachels chin jutted i may be stuck here but i refuse to look like christines welfare case while im here you dont wear black huh no way it was the one thing she had in lifeher clothes she wore happy clothes the sort of clothes thatd make craig smile if he no she wasnt going down that road but she didnt wear black ever youre wearing pink she told myra and if she sounded a bit like a sulky teenager she couldnt help it but myra was smiling tell you what ive finished the dishes she told her im officially off duty until toby comes home from school we have an hour before dr mcinnes returns so myra glanced at her watch its not yet nine and eileen sanderson doesnt usually open until ten but if its for you eileen sanderson kims mum oh no i cant she owns cowral bays only decent dress shop and its great expensive but good but shell be with kim shes home i saw brian her husband swap shifts with her a couple of hours ago as i was coming here and she lives next door to the store but shell be asleep not eileen i cant rachel you saved her daughters life myra told her you helped the firefighters last night theres not a soul in cowral bay who wouldnt drop everything to help you right now she frowned and looked again at the black shapeless trousers except maybe christine and she tossed her dishcloth aside with a determined throw grasped rachel by the hand and towed her out to her car hugo drove home an hour later his thoughts overwhelmed with what lay ahead the fire was worse the forecast was for a strong northeast wind which would bring the fire down from the ridge already the town was shrouded by a pall of smoke so heavy hugo had to put on his headlights thered be heat exhaustion as well as firerelated injuries he thought grimly it was already scorchingly hot if the fire grew worse if there were emergencies he needed backup he was set up here as a single doctor usuallywell sometimesone doctor was enough in a sleepy fishing village there was no need for a huge medical presence few doctors wanted to practise in such a remote area and the swell of campers during summer wasnt enough to tempt medics wanting a high income normally hugo didnt mind working alonehe even liked itbut his radio was telling him a quarter of the state was under threat from fire that meant relief medical teams wouldnt be forthcoming even in an emergency there was only himbut now at least there was rachel as well but if the road cleared just for a few hours shed be out of here he thought grimly she had a husband and the worlds stupidest dog and a city career she was a fine doctorhell she had the skills he desperately needed in a partnerbut shed be out of here the road was still cut though he thought and as far he could see that was the only bright spot on his horizon he had a captive worker and shed said shed work a captive worker he thought of rachel as hed last seen her in those crazy pyjamas his mouth twitched and his bleakness lifted a little she was here she had said shed work now as long as christine had fitted her out in some sensible clothes he pulled into the driveway looked down at the list of things he still had to do this morning and went to find his colleague he walked through the screen door and stopped dead good grief rachel was sitting at the kitchen table helping myra pod peas shed obviously reclaimed penelope penelope and digger were lying side by side under the table looking extraordinarily pleased with each other but that wasnt where hugos attention was caught and held rachel was only fivefour or soa good eight inches shorter than he wasbut what she lacked in height she made up for in impact this morning in his pyjamas shed looked amazing but now she was wearing bright yellow leggings that stopped at midcalf and a white overshirt that looked as if it had been splashed by daubs of yellow paint her shirt was rolled up businesslike but there was nothing businesslike in the way it was unbuttoned to show enough cleavage to be interesting very interesting so interesting he could hardly take his eyes away what else he could scarcely take her in apart from the cleavage her riot of shining brown curls was caught back with a wide yellow ribbon and her feet were ensconced in gold and white trainers christine never gave you those clothes he said faintly and she chuckled good guess mrs sandersons a darling and she has such taste i returned the clothes christine brought me im very grateful but they just werent me she held up a shoe and admired it and gold and white trainershow practical are these very practical he said weakly and she grinned she rose and looked expectantly out to the car are we heading out to the nursing home now youre not wearing that outfit to the nursing home why ever not im thinking of their hearts i dont think im carrying enough anginine he said and she chuckled again she had the nicest chuckle youre telling me the oldies wont like my clothes i have no idea he managed i do know theyll never have seen anything like it in their lives he looked down at her amazing shoes you dont think gold and white in this ash might be just a little impractical theyll wash im not putting doriss sandals back on for quids they may be sensible but i dont do sensible so i see the oldies not only loved rachels clothesthey loved rachel in this heat and smokefilled atmosphere the ills of a group of sixty frail retirees could be depended on to keep hugo busy for half a day but only a couple of problems were serious hugo expected to do the tricky stuff himself while rachel took a routine clinic but rachel had no sooner been introduced to the sitting room in general and the nurse in charge in particular than she balked tell me why youre staying i have a couple of bedbound patients ill check before i go youre telling me that i cant check them that you dont think im competent no but then youre not needed anywhere else of course he is don the nursinghome charge nurse a beefy bearded giant was clearly amused by the strange tension between the two and the way hugo kept glancing at his colleague as if he couldnt believe his eyes ive had a call from the hospital already saying theres another couple of firefighters need looking at and theyve just admitted harry peterss kid who fell off the back of the fire truck and broke his arm they want you back there hugo i cant just leave you here hugo said frowning at the jonquilyellow apparition in front of him why not the jonquilyellow apparition raised herself up on her jonquilyellow toes and glared are you saying youre a better doctor than i am no but then take me to the patients youre worried about talk me through what needs to be done and then get out of here no more buts youre wasting time dr mcinnes wasting time no one had ever accused hugo mcinnes of wasting time ever it was all he could do not to gasp go on then don was clearly intrigued and enjoying himself what are you waiting for hugo he hardly knew chapter five it was harder work than shed thought it would be rachel had been working in an emergency department for the last four years coping with emergencies these werent emergencies she had to scour her brain for the things shed learned in basic traininghow to dress and treat leg ulcers how to look after a man who was suffering longterm effects of the cortisone hed taken after suffering rheumatoid arthritis for forty years how to ease the passing of an old ladyninetyeight her bed card said but she was still able to smile and grasp rachels hand in greetinga lady who might only have days left to live rachel had asked hugo to let her do this so he had left her to it she hadnt realised until hed gone that it had been quite an act of faith of trust ill come back and collect you at lunchtime hed told her and had gone off to see to his town patients and his firefighters he was needed so was she she couldnt think about hugo she had enough to concentrate on herself but the oldies were lovely they helped her all the way don was at her side and everyone knew the routine dr hugo uses that sort of dressing she was told by a patient the very elderly mrs collins before don could open his mouth she cast him a sideways grin and started wrapping mrs collinss ulcer with the dressing the old lady had pointed at do i get the feeling this place would run on its own if we werent here she asked we learn to be selfsufficient don told her theres days when hugo cant come when hes on holidays when there are emergencies in the town he cant come don told her only then our dr mcinnes doesnt do holidays what never he last took a holiday three years ago don bent and helped her adjust the dressing mrs collins eightynine and very very interested in this yellow doctor was listening avidly as she was treated i dont think he knows the meaning of the word holiday christine takes toby to new york to visit his grandmother during school holidayspaid for by hugoand thats it it sounds a pretty dreary life its a better life now than when he was married don said bluntly some marriages are the pits hmm should you be saying this to me rachel raised her eyebrows at the bearded nurse and don grinned nope but if we cant gossip whats the use of living isnt that right mrs collins thats dead right sheila collinss old eyes perused rachel and suddenly she leaned over and grabbed her hand she held it up youre married yourself she demanded and rachel met her look square on yes not separated or anything no so when this fire is over and the roads cleared youll go back to your husband there was only one answer to that of course i will the old ladys look was steady news must travel fast in this town everyone was really well informed frighteningly well informed they say you were fighting with your husband at the dog show they say hes a creep and a bully and he left our kim for dead no one here knows my husband rachel said steadily first impressions there were places rachel wasnt prepared to go no one needed explanations no one here knows him she said again stay out of her space sheila don said sternly or you just might get iodine on those legs sheilas eyes narrowed she stared at rachel for a moment longer and then gave a cackle of laughter oh sure i guess itd serve me right if i do but its not just me whos curious she wants to know about our dr mcinnes as much as we want to know about her then tell her don was in his fifties or maybe a little older he looked contented rachel thought he looked like a nurse whod spent his life caring for people in a small townand who was content to do so for as long as he could the feeling was suddenlynice living in cowral would be a good life she thought shed never considered country medical practice maybe she maybe after no our dr hugo made a bad marriage sheila told her and rachel forced herself to concentrate not that that was very hard sheila was right she really did want to know why he didnt have much of a home life our doc hugo sheila said his mother was a right little cowonly after what she could get she lit out for the city as soon as she could and we never saw her again but hugo used to come down here old dr mcinnes had been here for as long as anyone can remember and whenever his mother wanted to get rid of himwhich was oftenhugo used to come down to stay he loved his grandpa then the old man had a stroke soon after hugo qualified as a doctor and hugo came for good i dont think he had much choice he came because he loved the old man and then he was sort of stuck so he hadnt come through choice he was really unsettled at first don took over the tale then they were a pair rachel thoughtthe nurse who looked like hed be more at home on a logging truck than in a nursing home and the ancient lady whose bright eyes gleamed with intelligence andmischief the old man was ill for a couple of years don continued with only a sideways glance and a twinkle to show he knew exactly what rachel was thinking hugo was here helping him it must have been a huge shock after practising medicine in sydney but then he met beth the old lady chipped in christine and beth they came down here to paint their parents were divorced their father had a fishing shack here so living was cheap they had nothing to bless themselves with but they thought they were the best thing since sliced bread their mother has a studio in new york and thats how they dressedlike theyd just walked off the streets of manhattan they complained because no one knew how to make decent coffee they were exotic and they were gorgeous don added they were also really really expensive their paintings were incomprehensible and pretty soon they latched onto the idea that one of them should marry our doctor and of course he was so bored that he fell for it sheila told her this was a story told in tandem the fact that there seemed to be some urgency about it was strange but that was the way rachel was hearing it maybe it was the way she was meant to be hearing it he was feeling trapped by the needs of this communityby the needs of his grandfather beth was gorgeous and reminded him of a life hed left behind and after his parents example i dont think he knew what a decent marriage was so he married her and had toby damned stupid don shook his head he looked sideways at rachel as if figuring out how much to telland then obviously decided that unprofessional or not he was going to tell anyway it was never going to work beth married hugo for all the wrong reasons and personally i dont think hugo knew the right reasons to marry either neither of them really knew what marriage was beth filled that house with all that weird stuff she spent a fortune but still it didnt make her happy she left him twice then when she found she was pregnant she walked out for ever she wanted an abortion but he hated the idea she compromised by leaving him no i know it doesnt make sense but then beth didnt make sense to herself she wasnt living with hugo when toby was born she was living with some painter up in sydney but still bleeding him dry sheila added and then she died don looked sick at the memory she had eclampsia apparently she and the guy she was living with were drinking too much she didnt care about the babybut it wasnt toby who ended up suffering she ignored the symptoms until she was far gone toby was born by caesarean section but it was too late and that left our hugo feeling dreadful guilt he hadnt tried to make her come home and christine made the guilt worse christine rachel whispered of course christine don shrugged she stays on in this town because thats where she owns a house but she hates the place her paintings dont sell she spends any money she gets on stupid things youd feel sorry for her if she wasnt so damnedsuperior shes got no money of her own she lives here and she wont let anyone forget beth she makes hugos guilt worse my beth she keeps saying as she shoves that shrine of a house down their throats we must never forget tobys mother the fact that they fought like cat and dog when beth was alive she wants to marry hugo sheila was totally absorbed in her tale her ulcers were almost completely bandaged now but the old lady had a captive audience until they were finished and she wasnt letting go and little by little shes wearing him down hugo has to let toby spend time with christine its the only contact the kid has with his mothers family and she guilts him into keeping that house just as it was enough rachel thought beginning to feel just a little desperate the bandages were in place this was entirely improperdoctor gossiping about another doctor with that doctors patients and a nurse rachel rose to her feet and tried to look determined im sure i need to see someone else no matter who you see theyll tell you the same thing sheila retorted our dr mcinnes is being railroaded into marriage with another like the first and shes not even a decent artist what she does is horrible rachel was left wondering what was horrible the thought of such a marriageor christines artwork maybe she knew how did it go hugo collected her half an hour after hed said he would hed been delayed by a minor crisis he told her but the look on his face told rachel it hadnt been minor he looked strained past endurance whats wrong she asked but he shook his head whatever it was he didnt intend to share it how did you manage at the nursing home he asked changing the subject with more bluntness than tact she hesitated but his face was shuttered this was a man accustomed to working on his own she thought he carried the responsibility for this towns health on his shoulders alone she could share but only as much as he wished her to share and maybe it wasnt fair to push when she was here for such a short time so she concentrated on now on the present i love your oldies she told him i now know not only their medical histories but also the history of everyone in cowral he managed a smile at that including mine of course including yours she settled into the passenger seat of his comfortable old family sedan and smiled across at him she wanted him to smile she wanted to take that look of strain away from around his eyes how can you doubt it so he grimaced have they worked out your love life yet mine she raised her eyebrows at that i dont have a love life you have a husband thats right she said and somehow kept her voice steady as he looked across at her a husband a love life theyre not the same thing were they once they were a long time ago where are we going now she asked he wasnt the only one who could change the subject it was high time to move on from what was suddenly dangerous ground ill drop you at home for lunch and a rest while i while you keep working thats the plan she shook her head nope as plans go it sucks sorry i slept this morning while you worked ive done a whole three hours work while you i suspect have done about six so why is it that now i get to be bored while you play doctor he thought about it you dont have to be bored you could take penelope for a walk i walked my feet off last night i dont intend to walk anywhere for six months then what do you want to do have lunch now and then do something useful she said promptly if im trapped in your house for the whole afternoon i might be forced to do something direlike strip the brocade wallpaper from the living room it had been the wrong thing to say his face sort of set whoops rachel said not sounding in the least contrite dont tell me you like brocade im very grateful to christine he said stiffly which was a strange answer to a question that had hardly been asked im grateful to christine too she told him refusing to be dismayed into a guilty conscience but im not wearing brocade because of it or even the clothes she chose youll hurt her feelings really she looked at him in disbelief is that why you stick with the brocade you really think that shed be devastated if you said thank you christine youre very thoughtful but i dont like red and gold brocade i like yellow he frowned what are you talking about i dont like yellow toby says you like yellow i dont you dont like mr addingtons yellow car the corners of his mouth twitched the look of strain eased a bit and rachel found herself smiling inside good who told you about mr addingtons car he demanded toby you do like it of course i like it its a ferrari is that all you like about it youd like it better in red and gold she cocked her head to one side michaels aston martin is red i hate that car he raised his brows at that seemingly intrigued so what is it with you and michael you hate his dog you hate his car you fight with the man in public and he abandons you in a town with a bushfire threatening how did she answer that she couldnt she managed a shrug so the coldness of her tone didnt deflect him he was still being nosy i dont see that you have much of a marriage dr harper should she tell him no she decided his reaction to such a story was a complication she could do without she hated telling people she hated the way their faces shuttered down with shock and disbelief it was so much better to use michael as a scapegoat a pseudohusband to hide the reality of pain it was none of hugos business after all i dont hate penelope she told him concentrating on the least of her issues with michael whatever gave you that idea you dont love her shes sort ofgoofy she grinned moving right on steering fast from very dangerous personal relationships come on dr mcinnes share your work with me dont sentence me to an afternoon with my goofy dog and your brocade walls i was planning to go out to the fire front hugo told her theres a command post out there the teams are starting to show effects of smoke inhalation heat exhaustion burns and the adrenaline isnt letting them stop can i come with you those mobile eyebrows rose right up again in those clothes she looked down at herself maybe not she agreed cautiously maybe mrs sanderson could find me something a wee bit more suitable maybe well grab a sandwich and then drop by the fire station he told her the smile she was beginning to know and to love resurfacing from behind his eyes i dont think even mrs sanderson does a couturier line in yellow firefighting apparel the fire front was closer than they had expected cowral bay was on a spit about five miles from the narrows the milewide strip of land connecting cowral to the mainland the narrows were covered in mountainous bushland and all of it was burning hugo had expected to drive through to the far side of the first ridge but there were roadblocks just as the land started to rise and he was waved to a command post that had been brought further south hell hugo pulled off the road and they stared together up at the ridge the wind had died a little which meant the billowing smoke was spiralling skyward and they could see flames bursting up over the mountains and for the first time rachel got nervous up until now the fire had been a sort of backdrop to her real worries it was the reason she was stuck here and nothing else australians were accustomed to bushfires and this was a bushfire in bush but maybe it could turn to something worse she stared down at herself the officer manning the fire station had equipped her with heavyduty overalls and big leather boots and she carried a hard hat shed looked at herself in the mirror and had hooted with laughter but nownow she wasnt laughing this is big she whispered and hugo looked over at her and nodded we lost a firefighter this morning you lost the wind changed he told her he was trying to backburn and hed gone too far from his team he was cut off and there was nothing anyone could do to save him they brought his body down just before i came to find you she swallowed no wonder hed looked strained why didnt you tell me i just did thered been no need rachel thought or there had been a needa desperate needbut hugo had been on his own for too long to realise it sharing trauma talking about it was the only way to cope in emergency medicine but hugo coped alone somehow what can i do she asked in a small voice and he looked across at her assessing if you really want to help i said i did didnt i she snapped suddenly angry im a member of your medical team dr mcinnes a team youre not on your own get used to it i didnt mean just use me she said wearily use me he cast her another strange look but the situation was dire it was true he did need her the team who were with barry when he diedtheyre still out there theyre due to come in at two id like to see them all therell be real trauma none of them would come off duty until their shift changed but i said id be available and you want teams to be briefed last year in bushfire season i had a volunteer go home after suffering smoke inhalation he didnt tell anyone he was having trouble breathing then started coughing uncontrollably by the time i saw him it was almost too late i want the dangers spelled out to everyone whether theyve heard it five times or not i want them to know to keep fluids on board the professionalseven the welltrained volunteershave been augmented now by helpers who mean well but havent got two clues as to personal safety theyre working in teams but they get good ideas and go off by themselves the guy this morning hes in his sixties and he runsranthe local hardware store he thought he knew it all the fire chief has taken it hard hes taken the volunteers through the safety drill but i want the medical bits spelled out in words of one syllable i dont want any more deaths i can do that make it sound dire hugo told her theres no second chances out there i can do dire she nodded there was no laughter between them now there was only medical need which was how half an hour later overalled and booted and wearing her hard hat for heavens sake we wear them all the time when were on duty shed been told its a habit that makes sense not to break rachel found herself lecturing to a group of people who looked as out of place as she was hugo was with the team of firefighters whod lost their friend she was with everyone else trying to sound knowledgeable and authoritative she did it was amazing what you could do when needs must you stay hydrated she ordered you carry water all the time you never remove your hard hat ever you keep your protective clothing on no matter how hot you get you feel unwell for any reason you get back here for any reason you start to cough i want you back at base you get any chest pain a sore throat your legs start achinganything at allyou get back here fast theres no medals for heroics if you put your life at risk youll put your whole team at risk now before you go i want you to run past me individually and tell me a really brief medical history and if theres anything at all youre vaguely worried about you tell me now you hear now shes amazing one of the firefighters told hugo miriam was one of the semitrained volunteers shed been on the front line with barry and she was suffering a nasty burn on her hand as well as shock from that mornings trauma hugo had what he needed to treat her on the spot but having cleaned and dressed her burn he was sending the woman home now they stood together in the clearing watching rachel assessing her firefighters thirty feet away each catching their breath before they moved on she is amazing hugo agreed they could hear her voice raised in authority bossy youd think shed been trained to do it be bossy hugo smiled maybe she has i wish id been a bit bossy miriam said and there was a load of bitterness and regret in her voice barry knew what we were told to do we were just mopping up after backburning if anything gets away call for help we were told but when it flared he started fighting like a madman the rest of us were retreating and he took it as a personal challenge then it was all around him if id been a bit bossier barry wouldnt have taken it from you hugo said gently miriam was usually a clerk in the shire offices she was so out of place here it was almost ridiculous hed never take orders from someone without authority hed have taken orders from your rachel miriam told him you just have to hear her she seemsin charge she did but what had miriam said your rachel his rachel the words were unnerving miriam had meant them to denote that he and rachel were a team but looking across and seeing rachel it seemed almost more than that she was listening to an elderly man who was telling her exactly why he should be allowed to fight the fires sam nieve hell it was obvious to anyone the man couldnt firefight hugo half rose to intervene but he didnt need to he couldnt hear what she was telling him but the mans shoulders didnt sag instead his chest puffed out he removed his helmet and he departed with an air of increased importance his little car took off in the direction of the town and hugo gave a sigh of relief sam had a heart condition he was the last person theyd want on the fire line but he was almost as stubborn as barry how had she convinced him if anyone could rachel could he thought the lady was amazing his rachel no the lady was married the lady wastaken they worked solidly for three hours but then it was time to return to the town hugo had patients in hospital and he had a clinic to run he needed to return the teams had changed over the offduty firefighters had gone back to the town to sleep and the onduty members were lined up against the fire front the doctors would be needed again at changeoveror earlier if emergencies arosebut maybe because of the work theyd done thered be less chance of an emergency they could only hope you did really well he told rachel as they drove homeward and she flushed if were forming an admiration society can we make it mutual nope what did you tell sam to make him give up his plans to fight fires you really want to know yeah i used you he raised his brows and grinned you used me i told him youd lost two patients in two days and there wasnt room in the funeral parlour for a third i also told him if you lost someone else youd be in for a breakdown and itd be on his head if the town lost its doctor gee thanks very much he said faintly but she hadnt finished yet i told him brute strength wasnt all that was needed here i told him that if the fire worsened it was really important that everyones roof is clear and they have their hoses ready there are lots of people who are just blind when it comes to this type of thing she grinned ignoring the fact that his brows had hit his hairline i suspect in fact that mr nieves own personal gutters around his roof are not as clean as they should be i seemed to hit a nerve anyway i suggested he contact the local school and borrow a few of the older kids and do a housetohouse check hugo whistled seemingly totally astonished well done you its true she said gently whats true you really dont want any more deaths what do you think she looked at him considering im all for them she said at last teasing for a smile more deaths mean fewer patients and patients mess up your consulting rooms faster than anything i know he laughed with her but there wasnt a true smile behind his eyes the two deaths she probed gently and waited he needed to talk she suspected there wouldnt be a lot of professional support in this onedoctor town and it seemed like it was professional support he was uncomfortable with she didnt let him off the hook she waited and finally he shrugged and started to speak last nights death was expected he told her it was annies time but i was fond of her for all that he gave a twisted smile annie started making me chocolate cakes when beth died and weve had a weekly chocolate cake ever since and barrybarry was a pompous little prig who didnt deserve what happened to him he has a sweet little wife and a couple of obnoxious kids wholl miss him for ever silence more silence its hard this country practice rachel said at last she was combing pieces of debris from her hair with her fingers shed taken her hard hat off before shed got back in the car which had been a mistake the air was thick with falling ash and most of it seemed to have ended up in her hair you get attached something you dont do its not all that easy getting attached when you work in emergency medicine she agreed i keep track of some patients but not many so when you finish up a shift the days over pretty much itd be a great life hugo said softly and rachel didnt miss the note of bitterness in his voice what so youd really like to swap id just like to turn off sometimes he told her this town i came here for a few years to look after my ailing grandfather and ive never been able to leave because you cant get anyone else to replace you partly and partly what else shed twisted sideways to watch him they were nearly back in town nowtheir time for intimacy was almost over and she regretted it she liked this big gentle man with the laughing eyes she liked him a lot it seemed such a shame that he was meant forthe likes of christine shed seen the way christine had looked at hugo hugo may have married one sister but by the look in christines eyes and by the accounts of local gossip he was destined to marry the other but hugo wasnt talking about christine or he was but only in that she was part of the tapestry of tobys life partly because my life is here he told her tobys life the people here love him he has myra and christine andso many people he has the freedom of the placetheres not a soul in cowral bay who doesnt know who he is and watches out for him and in return you watch out for them she said softly he was concentrating on turning into the hospital car park but it wasnt the concentration that was causing the set look around his mouth he cared hed certified the deaths of two of cowrals own in the past twentyfour hours and it had bitten deep rachel saw deaths most days she worked in a big city emergency department two deaths wouldnt affect her like this maybe they should maybe she should be more involved she was involved enough how could she be any more involved than she was right now she should be home it must be amazing hugo said to leave work at night and be free to go to the movies go out to a restaurantdo anything you want he had to be kidding if he knew how much she hated eating out and when had she last gone to a movie going to movies on her own sucked i have responsibilities she said stiffly and he nodded of course you do penelope michael michaels not youre right michaels none of my business he cut her off as he switched off the engine but im interested what do you do with the rest of your life how do city doctors without kids operate its a world away from what i know you did it once its so long ago ive forgotten i wouldnt mind remembering remembering what he was talking about the giddy social life michael enjoyed rachel knew and that was so far away from her own experience that it was ridiculous she closed her eyes what was the point in explaining there wasnt one this man had enough on his shoulders without burdening him with her personal tragedy you wouldnt be interested she said flatly and you have work to do is there anything else i can do to help he looked at her and once again she had the feeling he saw more than she wanted him to but he couldnt know how could he possibly know about craig he didnt of course he didnt he was shaking his head moving on youve done enough youre doing clinic for a couple of hours so toby and i will see you at dinner thats right so you can take your overalls off dr harper and turn into a guest again exercise your dog or something right ill see you later end of conversation but he was still watching her his eyes still held hers he should turn away she thought he should get out of the car he didnt they were somehowlocked it was a strange sensation stupid senseless he had things to do she was a married woman and they had no link they did have a link they were just looking at each other seeing seeing past the façade seeing what was really behind it she stared into his face and she could see the battering this man had suffered over the years the loneliness the wanting how could she see that she didnt know but see it she did and if she could read so much in his face how much more could he read in hers this was ridiculous she had things to do dogs to walk hours to fill before she saw him again ridiculous somehow rachel managed to break the momentbreak the link she climbed from the car and slammed the door with more force than was needed the slam was a statement im going to take a shower she told him and if her voice wasnt quite steady there wasnt a darned thing she could do about it ill see you later she walked away leaving hugo staring after her chapter six he didnt have a clue what was going on hugo worked his way through half a dozen patients and maybe it was just as well there was nothing serious because his attention was definitely elsewhere or maybe itd be better if there was something serious he decided maybe his thoughts needed to be hauled right back to work not on some slip of a doctor whose eyes made him smile whose smile made him chuckle whose smile made him twist inside how long had it been since someone had made him feel like this some woman never he thought as he carefully wound wet bandage around tom harriss arm tom had fallen and broken his forearm while clearing undergrowth around his house when the fires had started four days ago hugo had put the initial plaster on loosely because of inflammation but the arm had settled now and it could be fixed more securely into its casing tom though was a man of few words he didnt want to chat so hugos attention stayed right where it was on rachel why was it on rachel she was married he told himself happily married for all he knew sure the man shed been with at the dog show had seemed a creep but the nicest of women found partners in the strangest of places she hadnt said a word about her marriage being unhappy maybe she couldnt maybe the man was violent no he thought back to his medical training to the one question hed been told could predict violence in marriages in almost every case hed used it time and again with sometimes astonishing results is there any time in the last couple of years where youve felt afraid of your husband he thought of rachel and he knew instinctively that shed shake her head if he directed his question at her shed been angry at michael at the dog show but she hadnt been afraid of him shed flung those car keys at him with such force that the memory still made him smile you thinking of the new lady doctor tom asked and hugo nearly dropped his bandages no i was thinking how good this arm is looking people dont smile like that thinking about a sixtyyearold fishermans broken arm tom said dourly though there was the hint of laughter in his eyes why not you have a very nice arm hugo tossed back and toms face creased into reluctant laughter yeah and yours is sexy and all as well he retorted but i bet our rachel has a sexier one our rachel how quickly had the community taken her as one of its own the ladys married hugo snapped before he could stop himself and toms grin broadened so im on the right track then look its nothing to do with me mate tom told him im just here to get an arm fixed youre the one who has to go home tonight and sleep in the same house married or not hugo shook his head thoroughly confused i cant yeah you can tom said encouragingly knowing exactly what he was thinking like it or not or you can at least try it was well past dinnertime when a weary hugo arrived home what a day and there was still a ward round to do before he could sleep even so he was aware of a lifting of his spirits as he walked from the hospital across the lawn to the house itd be different tonight rachel would be there she certainly was he walked in the back door and instead of a formally set table with myra waiting to serve up chops and three vegetablesher standard fare to be expected at least three times a weekhe walked in to find rachel packing an enormous picnic basket toby was sitting on the table poking things into its depths and his small face was lit up with excitement were going to the beach for tea he told his father before hugo could open his mouth or for your tea and an aftertea picnic for us rachel says its so hot and stuffy that if she doesnt get a swim shell expire she will too rachel was back in those extraordinary yellow clothes again her wonderful clothes and the dogs are going stircrazy she gestured to the two dogs who were lying on the floor eyeing the picnic basket with a devotion that said theyd already tested the contents have you finished for the day dr mcinnes i need to do a ward round before ive done your ward round she told him before he could finish elly talked me through every patient in the hospital and theres no need for you to see any of them again tonight she corrected herself you might like to look in on kim to check that her obs are still ok before you go to bed but as of twenty minutes ago they were fine theres no change in the fire crews for another two hours and things seem relatively settled the winds forecast to strengthen tomorrow which means havoc might break loose so toby and i figured we might have some fun while the goings good thats now the nursing home yep there are a couple of oldies who need checks mrs bosworths breathing is cause for concern ive told don well stop in on the way the way to the beach she tossed a bag of grapes into the picnic basket and beamed at him expectant so did toby the dogs looked up and wagged a tail apiece and he could swear they were beaming too i cant he said faintly and rachels beam slipped immediately he found himself staring at a lady with her arms crossed schoolmarmlike and a martial glint in her eye why ever not if im needed youre needed at the nursing home and toby and i have agreed well watch television in the oldies sitting room while you do the doctor bit or vice versa but mrs bosworths anxious and shes asking for you she smiled you must have something in your bedside manner that i dont her smile faded or hazel bosworth knows you and its a familiar face she needs when shes frightened but after that the smokes not so bad that itll be awful we have cold sausages we have cold drinks and fresh bread and some of tobys wonderful lamingtons your bathing costumes already packed and were already wearing ours under our clothes so what other objections would you care to make hugo couldnt think of any he couldnt think of any at all how long since hed had a picnic on the beach please can we go daddy can we go toby was jiggling with excitement under the table penelope and digger were jiggling as well yes he said promptly before he changed his mind and got sensible yes we can why not the nursing home was quieter than theyd expected most of the residents have seen scores of bushfires in their time don told them theyre not panicking he gave a rueful smile most of them gave up their households of precious possessions when they came in here it makes a difference when theres not so much to lose even mrs bosworth her breathings dreadful hugo she has emphysema and we cant get the smoke out of the atmosphere shes so sick but when i told her i was going to call you she said not to botherthat the doctors would have more than enough to cope with tonight and if she died then it was her time age puts a different perspective on things not just age it was experience rachel thought as hugo disappeared to see to mrs bosworths breathing problems and she settled to wait with toby once upon a time in another life shed collected porcelain she remembered craig coming home from football bouncing in the front door full of his triumph shouting to her whizzing her round in triumph crashing one of her porcelain statuettes off the hall table shed been angry dear god shed been angry the porcelain was long sold it had been many years since rachel had seen anything more important than people life now this minute mrs bosworth was settling hugo was emerging discussing her condition with don the oxygen rate was up to maximum now and hed given her a relaxant fear was making her breathing faster causing more problems because of course there was fear possessions could be abandoned but not so life sometimes life was wonderful life was now rachel thought with quiet satisfaction as they reached the shoreline tomorrow might well be ghastly but for nowfor now there was this moment the locals had too much sense to be sitting on a smoky stretch of beach everyone not directly committed to the fire effort was supporting those who were tired people chose to stay indoors but now was too good to waste the tension eased from hugos tired mind almost as soon as his toes touched the sand the wind had miraculously dropped to almost nothing the fine haze of eucalyptfilled smoke was even soothing if there hadnt been the possibility that it might threaten the town when the wind came up he could almost enjoy it or maybe he could enjoy it anyway how long since hed hauled off his shoes and spent the evening on the beach he wouldnt have thought to do it rachel had thought of it rachel maybe we wont light fires to warm our sausages rachel was suggesting as the dogs went careering like mad things along the shore and hugo could only agree wise idea one spark and wed have every hose in town pointed straight at us there are people on the lookout right now sparks drift for miles and are a threat all by themselves the town wont burn will it daddy toby asked and hugo hauled himself together hed been sounding too solemn maybe hed been sounding too solemn for far far too long no the town wont burn theres no wind at all tonight so the backburners can really get things under control he took a deep breath for nowfor this small fragment of timehe could forget about fires he could evenamazinglyforget about medicine he could concentrate on what was important lets eat he suggested and he could feel the tension easing out of him still more rachel was smiling again as if she knew that some invisible barrier had been broached but it seemed she wasnt pushing im swimming first she told him toby and i snacked while we waited for you you have a sausage or two and join usbut dont eat too much itd be a shame to have to wait your requisite half an hour because you were scared of cramps thats an old wives tale he said and she raised mocking eyebrows its the medicine my granny taught me are you saying my grannys medicineand therefore my medicineis wrong he thought about that he thought about the way he was feeling free almost lightheaded there was an anticipation in his heart that had nothing to do with common sense and everything to do with the way this lady smiled dr rachel harpers medicine no but good she told him her smile showing him she was aware of the fact that he was confused and she intended enjoying it mind your sausages dr mcinnes toby and i are going for a swim so hugo sat and ate and watched his small son and this strange city doctor cavort in the shallows rachel was the strangest creature he decided she was part girl part woman part professional doctor part kid who was searching for fun and laughter there was so much about her he didnt understand the hardest thing of all was to reconcile her marriage to michael to a doctor whod risked a girls life hugo was under no illusion that michael couldnt have redirected the helicopter he would have heard the impassioned plea to return hed have heard how desperately ill kim was hugo himself had talked to the pilot and hed heard the pilot turn and talk to michael it had been michael the helicopter had come to collect to have forced him to stay in the air would have been nothing short of abduction michael therefore must have been complicit in the decision not to bring the helicopter back to take kim to safety and michael was married to rachel rachel who was gorgeous hey toby spin rachel was calling waist deep in the shallows she had toby high in her arms and was spinning him like the sails of a small windmill she spun and spun while the dogs barked and barked and hugo couldnt stop himself from grinning in delight enough hed eaten enough one more sausage and ill cramp he told himself and strolled into the water to join them at the waters edge he paused laughing at the expression of joy on tobys face as he whirled faster and faster hugo chuckled out loudand then his chuckle died rachel and toby had shed their outer clothes at the waters edge from where hugo had sat thirty yards up the beach rachel had looked beautiful in her crimson onepiece bathing suit cut to reveal every gorgeous curve shed been glowingly lovely but closer closer there were scars he stared caught by the incongruity of it by the questions the fine white lines were the marks of a skilled plastic surgeon hugo could see that but no skill could entirely cover the trauma rachels body must have once endured when a long time ago he thought looking at the way the scarring had fadedfine lines blending into her nearperfect skin she was laughing and whirling and she and toby turned to face him glowing with happiness he didnt get his face in order fast enough she stopped whirling and set toby down on his feet carefully what she said youve been hurt he spoke without thinking and then could have kicked himself he could have said nothing he should have he could have pretended he hadnt noticed a nonmedical person might not have noticed no she was so lovely that any man would look at rachel long and hard the fine lines of scarring didnt detract from her loveliness but they were unmistakable car accident she said shortly answering his question before hed voiced it eight years ago a car accident of course he gave himself another mental kick why had his thoughts gone straight to this michael character he was starting so stupidly to dislike these werent the type of scars that were the result of battering from an aggressive husbandand anyone could see that rachel wasnt a battered wife she was probably a hugely contented wife who occasionally threw car keys at her husband wives did that beth had thrown more than car keys at him but what was he thinking of he was still staring at rachel as if he were stupid im sorry he told her i didnt mean to stare it must have been some accident it was she looked as if she was about to say more and then closed her lips together tight internal injuries fractures you name it i had it she shrugged it was a long time ago bodies heal mostly there was a depth of bitterness in her words that he couldnt help but hear maybe someone had died in the accident someone she loved but the blank look on her face was a shield all by itself keep off the look said dont go there so he didnt even though he badly wanted to it was none of his business it looks like youve had some great corrective surgery he managed and her smile came flooding back there was relief there and the beginnings of laughter i have havent i for heavens sake was she laughing at his discomfort theres a wonderful plastic surgeon in sydney who calls me his masterpiece i sometimes get the feeling hed like to hang me on his wall for show and tell rachel was so damned courageous he just had to look at that scarring to know the trauma that lay behind it and that brief look of pain had told him there was even more you are a masterpiece he said softly and she flushed she wasnt giving in to her discomposure though she moved right on to discomfit him further you know youre not too bad yourself she scooped toby up into her arms and twinkled what do you reckon toby dont you think your dad has the greatest sixpack youve ever seen sixpack toby was giggling entranced and entranced was a good way to describe his father hugo was enchanted by this vivacious slip of a girl she was soaking wet her soft brown curls were lying in dripping tendrils around her face her eyes were dancing you know sixpacks she told toby seemingly unaware of the riot she was causing in hugos solar plexus or somewhere some nerve centre hed hardly been aware he possessed sixpacks are cans of beer tied up together you look at your daddys chest and tell me if it doesnt look just like that good grief it was as much as hugo could do not to blush he swallowed tried to think of something to say couldnt so did the only thing he could think of he dived straight under the water and left them alone he stayed out of their way for about a quarter of an hour its the equivalent of a cold shower he told himself and that was what he needed he swam and he swam using the rhythm of his strokes to try and settle his brain what was happening to him rachel was a married woman she was a colleague whod been trapped here by the fire as soon as the wind changed and the fires burned back on themselves shed be out of here he had no business to think of her as he was thinking he had no choice he was definitely thinking he swam it had to end some time it had been a huge day and a man could only swim so far regardless of what demons were driving him toby and rachel had taken themselves up the beach and were engaged in building the worlds biggest sandcastle as hugo towelled himself dry and strolled up the beach to join them rachel shifted back to admire their handiwork she glanced up at his facewhich he was still trying to controland she chuckled hey dont get your knickers in a twist by a comment on a sixpack she grinned its what we women put up with all the time that was the female equivalent of a wolf whistle he stared sorry her smile widened as his discomfiture deepened sorry yourself ok im sorry about the sixpack remark but you did get personal first so i did he said faintly so i guess im sorry too actually im not sorry she said with a sideways very thoughtful look for the expression on your faceit was well worth it had it been worth it he stared down at her and she smiled back enigmatic and lovely and thoroughly confusing it couldnt last he might be directionless but rachel at least was focused toby was lifting a football from the bottom of the picnic basket and was kicking it across the sand without much hope given up on the sandcastle rachel asked him yeah the little boy looked down at his plastic football and sighed i brought this with me tonight cos bradley drummond says i cant dropkick i gotta learn how to dropkick and dad cant dropkick for nuts you cant dropkick rachel stared at hugo amazed i played basketball he said in explanation and she looked at him as if it wasnt an explanation at all i cant believe it a man who plays basketball what use is a sixpack in basketball hey say no more she wiped her hands on nonexistent trousers and wriggled her shouldersa player prepared to launch into a tackle a basketball player good grief toby lad give me the ball can you dropkick he asked shyly and she nodded i was taught by the best my husband was the worlds absolutely top dropkicker or so he told me and who am i to doubt it and he taught me gee toby said impressed gee is right so there you go dropkick lessons coming up and you dr mcinnes stop worrying and have some dinner she told him youve hardly eaten anything she flashed him a look that was almost a warning sausages and lamingtons and grapes eat for heavens sake hugo lets keep life simple keep life simple he didnt know what she was talking about or maybe he did but he sure as heck didnt want to admit it it had gone way past being simple but at least it was peaceful miraculously his cellphone stayed silent it might be the calm before the storm but for these few hours there seemed no medical need and no need at all for them to rush their picnic and head for home with their dropkick lessons completed to their mutual satisfaction rachel and toby turned their attention back to food they polished off sausages with gusto its our second dinner rachel declared and its much nicer the second time around they ate their fill of lamingtons and finished off with a thermos of coffee with lemonade for toby and then toby snuggled down on beach towels beside them and drifted toward sleep one sixyearold had had a truly excellent day we dont do this often enough hugo said ruefully running his fingers through tobys sandand saltstiff hair but he wasnt totally focused on his son he was still letting rachels words drift around his head my husband was the worlds absolutely top dropkicker he didnt like it he didnt want to think about rachels husband and it seemed rachels thoughts were travelling on a similar route christine doesnt like the beach christine his gaze jerked to hers startled whats it got to do with christine she is the lady you intend to marry rachel said gently and watched his face he said nothing christine that relationship had been on the backburner for so long that he hardly knew when had it started this assumption that hed end up with his sisterinlaw he didnt know when it had begun shed just been there even when beth had been alive christine had done the organising acting as gobetween in their increasingly turbulent marriage suggesting steering oh there had been nothing untoward in their relationship during the marriage there was nothing untoward in it now it was just drifting toward marriage maybe and why because it was easier because the town was waiting christine was waiting its been six years rachel said softly isnt it about time you married the woman who told you we were getting married christine did rachel told him she glanced down at toby who was sleeping now deeply unconscious tonight when i told her we were coming to the beach i was told in no uncertain terms to keep myself to myself ive never actually been given the scarlet woman treatment before but i copped it tonight for heavens sake hugos face set in anger of all the stupid she had no right did she have a right he hadnt given her reason to think otherwise he admitted to himself lately christine had taken to kissing him goodbye and a few weeks ago hed let himself kiss her back not as hed kissed her in the past brotherinlaw to sisterinlaw but more man to woman hell why he knew why hed needed to so much just to feel the touch of a woman in his arms but it had still felt wrong even though beth had been dead these six years so hed pulled back apologised but christine had smiled and hed known that she was waiting and he hadnt said no he hadnt said it could never work in truth hed been wondering six years was a long time and this was a tiny town in this confined environment he couldnt look at a woman without that woman getting the wrong idea affairs were impossible he was so damned lonely and he was hungry he wasnt hungry for christine he conceded to himself looking at the woman in front of him and accepting what was becoming clearer by the minute he was hungry for rachel rachel was unavailable what had she said about her husband the worlds absolutely top dropkicker there was a wealth of affection in the way shed said it that had been unmistakable maybe christine was all there was so you are going to marry her rachel was watching him with the air of an inquisitive sparrow furious with himself as well as her he started to haul the picnic things together i think its time we took toby home tobys asleep he cant be any more asleep at home than he is right now and you havent answered the question its none of your business mmm but i thought wed agreed wed already been impolite we may as well keep going dont you think no he said goaded and she smiled you started it he had he conceded with his talk of her scarring but he had no intention of continuing rachel had no intention of stopping toby doesnt like christine much she told him neither does myra do you think christine would soften with the brocaderememberingbeth thing if you married look i wouldnt want to live with it she stretched her legs out full length admiring her sandy toes she had beautiful crimson toenails very distracting toenails i can see why youd want to of course she conceded shes lovely is christine very like your wife was will you cut it out he was half laughing half angry why dont we talk about you for a change like what about me she was still admiring her toenails like what is it between you and your husband you were fighting like cat and dog at the weekend it cant be much of a marriage the laughter left her face shed been teasing himit had been lighthearted banterbut suddenly there was no banter left there was a long silence then no she said at last and she spoke so softly he had to strain to hear what she was saying no i dont have much of a marriage he shouldnt go further he should stop this potentially hurtful conversation right now he couldnt the devilor somethingwas driving him he had to push yet youre criticising me for potentially making a loveless marriage whoa her eyes flashed at that i didnt say a word about a loveless marriage she retorted spirit reentering her voice with a vengeance i may not have much of a marriage but i surely went into it with love yet you want out the conversation had become suddenly so intense he could hardly breathe hell how had this happened he watched her face and her eyes were blind as if she was consumed by panic im out now arent i she whispered dear god i shouldnt be but im out he didnt know what was happening he didnt understand all he knew was that hed hurt her somehow and hurt her badly rachel dont look like that look like what like theres something inside you thats tearing apart im not its not her hands were fumbling trying to collect the picnic things together but he could see she wasnt thinking of what she was doing her hands werent connected to her thoughts and her eyes were still so painfilled that he found himself reaching out grasping her fingers between his holding she didnt pull away she didnt move how long they stayed there he could never afterwards tell the night was creeping in through the smoky haze the sun had slipped unnoticed behind the mountains behind the distant fires the beach was deserted all was still apart from the soft hush hush hush of the waves slipping into shore one after the other endless time was nothing there was nothing this had started as comforthadnt itbut now it was more deeper for this moment there was just this man and this woman and a meeting that neither could understand that neither wanted that simply was still their hands held it was their eyes doing the talking searching locked to each other and discovering in each a link a bond an aching need and a knowledge that in each other pain could be assuaged the moment stretched on he should break his hold he should release her hands pull back but still his eyes searched hers and with every moment that passed the need to do more became increasingly compulsive inescapable one man one woman one moment he pulled her into his arms and he kissed her what was she doing here rachel hardly knew all she knew was that the moment hugos fingers touched hers her mind shut down to everything that wasnt him toby was asleep the dogs were far off fruitlessly chasing gulls in endless circles around the beach there were no witnesses to what was happening here there was no problem with witnesses no one would gainsay her this pleasure dottie had told her that as shed packed the gorgeous lingerie and pushed her out the door to what shed thought would be a romantic weekend with michael only it would never have worked even if michael had beennice she could never have let him near her the guilt had still been with her the overriding bitterness at what could have been but all of that was lost the moment hugos hands touched hers he pulled her into him and as his mouth claimed hers and as she melted effortlessly into him all she felt was joy oh the pleasure the aching wonder eight years of sorrow and loneliness were all dispelled in this one kiss in this meeting of bodies one with the other it was a kiss but it was so much more than a kiss it was a melting of barriers a moving forward a reaffirmation of life itself she couldnt pull away she knew she should but she hadnt the strength rachel whod been so strong for so long was falling now as she hadnt let herself ever fall shed been alone and nowshe was home she was where she belonged hugo was kissing her and she was moving from an old life into a new like a butterfly emerging from a faded and torn chrysalis to begin a new life hugo life or death living or dying i chooselife the dogs disturbed them the flock of gulls theyd been chasing finally wheeled out to sea delirious with excitement the dogs came hurtling up the beach soaking wet they landed on the picnic rug and proceeded to shake what seemed gallons of seawater over everyone including toby he woke and whimpered a little hugo pulled away for an instant and it was enough to let reality in to let rachels reality sink in what was she doing and there they all werethe old doubts the fears and the loneliness and the endless future they hadnt disappeared theyd been subsumed by the moment but they were still there the pressure of hugos mouth was still on her lips she put her fingers up to touch them but hugo was before her toby had stirred and settled the dogs had wheeled away again and he was catching her fingers in his lovely big hands and there was such a look of tenderness on his face that she must surely melt rachel no she faltered and pulled away reluctantly he released her he watched her his eyes calm something had changed for him too she thought frantically he knew he couldnt know he mustnt rachel whats wrong im married she said and there was such a blunt finality about the words that the look of tenderness shuttered down on his face as if it had never been you saidyou wanted out i didnt she was hauling herself together nowsomehow she had to get off this beach she had to get away from this man she had to leave i dont want he started but she was before him neither do i she was close to tears here she was lying again she wanted hugo so much that she was tearing apart and she could feel herself disintegrating iits almost dark she stammered you have to check kim iim tired i need my bed please hugo can we go she rose and hauled her beach towel around herself like a shield it was stupid nothing could protect her from what she was feeling nothing can we go she whispered again please hugo i dont need this i cant i cant and there was nothing for them to do but to leave there was nothing for hugo to do but to look at her with hungry eyes and a hopeless heart kim was fine when he arrived back at the hospital but hugo took his time with the injured teenager he hardly knew why kim was deeply asleep her exhausted parents had finally decided to cease their vigil and leave their daughter in the nurses care hugo could have simply glanced at the observation chart and left but instead he carefully checked the wound unwinding the bandages and surveying his handiwork with care david the gingerhaired nurse who was in charge tonight watched with thoughtful appreciation you know shes fine i checked the leg myself a couple of hours ago no temp the legs as pink as the other one shes having pain but it seems to be settlingeven her parents are relaxing now why not you dr mcinnes im relaxing hugo snapped and david grinned yeah and im a monkeys uncle youre tense as all getout youre not expecting any dramas here are you hugo looked down at kims face the fifteenyearold was sleeping soundly exhausted from the effects of trauma and relaxing deeply into the drugs he was using for painkilling she lookedfine no he wasnt expecting any trauma here thanks to rachel what was rachels story why did he need to know shell be ok he managed but david was still watching him youre avoiding going home david asked softly and hugo winced was he so transparent no but david didnt believe him he was a fine nurse and part of that was that he read people well theres nothing here for you to do he told hugo his eyes still thoughtful the last of the fire crews rang in half an hour ago because theres no wind up on the ridge theres been no dramas at allnot even a bad case of smoke in the eyes you can go home to bed dr mcinnes yeah and you ought to david was watching him with an intensity that hugo found unnerving the forecast for tomorrow is horrible if they dont hold the firebreaks the town will be safe the river the river will hold it this side but the other side you know the plan is for everyone to get over here and stay hugo shifted uneasily thinking it through forcing his mind away from rachel and onto the urgency of what lay ahead peoples homes are insured theyve had warning to leave theyll come people do damned stupid things get yourself to bed hugo davids voice was suddenly rough with concern you know youre going to be needed ill be fine silence then at least you have dr harper davids eyes were still probing rachel he amended and watched hugos face twist david looked even more thoughtful hmm the expression on his face said was that the way the wind blew then it wasnt up to hugo to enlighten him yeah at least i have rachel he snapped and shoved his hands deep into his pockets and glared so go to bed and thank your stars you have her while you do david told him right he was right of course he was right go to bed and be thankful to bed to sleep that was a joke and rachel she lay awake and thought about craig but she didnt ring dottie chapter seven rachel was awake before he was as hugo appeared in the kitchen for breakfast just after six rachel burst through the screen door a dog attached to a leash in either hand she stopped short when she saw him discomfited the dogs bounded across the kitchen to greet him and he bent to hug them giving himself time to collect himself the dogs were great afghan and mongrel were becoming fast friends michael would have kittens aristocracy mixing with the hoipolloi ouch michael there he was thinking about michael again why the hell couldnt he keep himself from thinking about michael rachel was wearing short shorts and a crop top and sandals she was all bare legs and glowing face and shiny hair how could he not think of michael he had to get himself together hi he tried and waited hi youve been to the beach that much was obvious the dogs were damp and sandcoated and penelope the afghan had such a look of bliss on her dopey face he almost felt sorry for her that she had to return to the city to michael there he was again rachel had to return to the city to michael the thought was enough to make the beginnings of his smile fade completely i couldnt sleep rachel told him and the tension escalated by about a mile she hadnt been able to sleep neither had he because what was he thinking of heck he had bettermore serious things to think about than why rachel hadnt been able to sleep like a bushfire its bad rachel told him moving on before he could the wind came up before the sun did the dogs and i could see the flames rising higher on the ridge while we waited for the sunrise how long had she been on the beach it didnt matter it couldnt matter move on crisis today he said and turned his back to put on the kettle he was wearing his boxer shorts and nothing else that was what he always wore while he ate breakfast and why his lack of clothes bothered him now he didnt know what precautions are we taking she asked waiting for him to finish at the sink so she could pour bowls of water for the dogs then she turned her attention to toast as though she was completely unaware of him how could she be unaware of him he thought savagely he was climbing walls here in her shorts and her tiny crop top that left nothing to the imagination he was so aware of her that everything else was blotted out completely like the little matter of a town threatened by bushfire were setting a safety zone up on the beach he managed maybe you saw there were people on the beach setting up equipment as i was leaving the safety zones changing from the hall yeah this side of the river can act almost as a safety zone by itselfits been really well cleared but if the fire turns firestorm firestorm thats what frightens us he told her we can cope with a fire that comes at us fast but a firestorm is something else if its burning so fast it starts sucking oxygen before it then it creates its own energy it becomes a vortex consuming all well move medical supplies down to the beach and essentials to protect a crowd if the fire looks like escalating then everyone goes there well evacuate the hospitaleveryoneand we hope like hell wont they send backup from the mainland rachel asked in a small voice and he frowned she sounded scared he hadnt meant to scare herbut maybe he was a bit scared himself ive been lying in bed listening to the radio reports he told her with this north wind after days of such heat half the states threatened every fire service is looking after its own and the state troops are needed for the cities where most lives are at risk so were on our own and despite the dangers the town was facing todaydespite the uncertaintyhe was suddenly distracted were on our own the words jabbed deep he was on his own he thought drearily as he sat on the other side of the table and ate cereal as she ate her toast she was only feet away from him but she was so distant so lovely she was married and he had a fire to think about patients medicine the future right they ate on in silence each deep in thought and neither willing to share toby arrived before they finished eating hiking into the kitchen in his bobthebuilder pyjamas and blessedly breaking a tension that was well nigh unbearable hi he said hi yourself hugo smiled at his young son grateful to have someone break a silence that was becoming way too difficult impossible breakfast toby scorned to answer such a dumb question but his small face lit at the sight of rachel and he launched himself onto her knees she hugged him round the middle and he beamed can i have my toast here dad why not toast on rachels knees if hugo could no he needed a cold showerand hed just had a cold shower he rose and made toast and handed it to his son without saying a word while rachel and toby chatted like old friends i need to go he said more to himself than anyone else myra will be here soon do you want me at the hospital or down at the beach rachel asked balancing her coffee around tobys breakfast can you do standard clinic she winced at that yeah right as if anyones going to check in with coughs and colds today someone needs to be there she looked at him for a long moment weighing what hed just said she was trying to decide whether to challenge himwhether to bring to the surface the real issue here which was that he needed room in his head she was infringing on that just by being she knew it he needed to work alone you know where to find me if you need me she said at last dont hesitate i wont is the fire going to burn the town down toby was sitting more firmly on rachels lap now regarding his father with huge eyes hed claimed rachel as his own but he still needed his daddy the fire wont burn the town hugo said and rachel put her arms around toby and hugged him again i think today you should stay home with myra or with me she told him and im guessing myra might want to stay on her own farm maybe we could pack a suitcase with all the most important things you and daddy have hugo give me a list and toby you can make a list too then if it gets really smoky we can take the suitcase down to the beach and we wont have to worry about the smoke making everything smell will we take the dogs too of course well take the dogs she looked down at the two dogs who were slumped in soggy and sandy happiness over her feet how could we let them get smoky she smiled up at hugo off you go then dr mcinnes make a list and leave it for us then you go and save the world and toby and i will save penelope and digger and tobys teddybear and your photo albums and whatever else we can find thats worth saving right whatever was worth saving hugo made a list which was reallystupidlyshort then made his way to the hospital and all he could think of was save me christine arrived at eightthirty to collect toby for school and was annoyed to find he wasnt coming hes staying with me for the morning rachel told her and christine gave her a look that was meant to turn her to stone and huffed to the hospital to find hugo i went to collect the kid toby hugo said mildly he was packing equipment into the back of his car he needed a full operating suite on this day he couldnt depend on any one place to stay safe but he could always run his car into the shallows and operate from there if he had to the kids name is toby dont be stupid christine snapped i know what his name is hugo whats going on rachels offered to take care of toby myra wants to stay home todayunderstandably her farms under threat as well as the rest of the town tobys nervous about going to school and rachels offered to care for him hell be safe at school christine wasnt offering to care for toby herself hugo noticed he only had half his mind on what she was saying the rest of his thoughts were on the contents of the cooler he was packing into his car did it contain every drug he could need had he forgotten anything important so why isnt he going to school christines anger was palpable and he made himself concentrate the schools happy for every child with parents available to care for them to stay home rachels not a parent hugo paused he straightened and looked at christine really seeing her she was brittle this morning tight no shes not he met her gaze full on theres something between you and rachel christine snapped and hugo shook his head no but you want there to be something shes married you still want there to be there was only one answer to that yes he said gently he paused but the thing had to be said christine whats between us its happened so gradually that ive hardly noticed but its therethe expectation that wed start a relationship we have started a relationship no he shook his head christine whats between us is no more a basis for a relationship than what was between beth and i ive made a mistake rachel well its true shes married and theres no future for us but its made me see that you and i can never work because youll find someone like rachel no he closed his eyes i cant find anyone like rachel but even knowing theres someone like her in the worldit makes a difference so ive been hanging around in this onehorse dump for nothing i thought you were here for your art there was a long silence then the fire will make great pictures she admitted and the publicityitll give me a market there you go then he hesitated but it might as well be said be honest chris thats all thats ever mattered to youand to beth the art things not people silence she half turned ready to leave angry but he held her with his eyes and continued to hold finally she smiled a crooked little smile that was half mocking half furious damn you you know us too well me and beth you love your art people are second we could have worked out a great relationship yeah i practise medicine while i pay for your paints she shrugged but the crooked smile stayed it was worth a try he shook his head no it wasnt christine its time i did things a bit differently i think its even time i moved on from brocade meanwhile i have a fireravaged community to care for she looked at him for a long moment and then shrugged again a shrug of release fine i have things to paint but you know shell never have you shes married to some wealthy medical specialist in town why could she possibly be interested in you why indeed no reason at all christine turned on her heel and walked away and hugo stared after her and thought ive just tossed in a future because of a slip of a doctor who has nothing to do with me nothing and everything the fire threatened for most of the morning but that was all it did threaten reports coming into the town were that the line created by backburning was holding the temperature soared but the wind seemed to rise to a certain velocity and stay holding rachel worked through the myriad minor ailments presenting at the clinic there were so many she had to concede that hugo had been right in asking her to take over asthmatics were having appalling trouble with the smoke and people whod never had asthma in their lives had it now the towns older residents their capacity to retain body equilibrium with sweating compromised with age were in real trouble rachel admitted two elderly men to hospital and don rang through wanting advice for another in the nursing home the ash in the air is messing with our airconditioning he told her the oldies are suffering enough already and we need to have them fit to evacuate youre planning on evacuating hugos down on the beach setting up a full medical centre in case don told her the real problems will be when this wind changes itll strengthen before any change and thats what hugos most worried about its what were all worried about so she should be worried too rachel gave him the advice he needed replaced the phone and looked out the window there was nothing to see the smoke had thickened to the stage where visibility was down to about ten yards toby was settled out in the waiting room playing with a train set he seemed perfectly content to be there watched over by ruby hugos receptionist but within calling distance of rachel unless she was actually examining patients she left the door open so she could make eye contact every now and then hed look up and make sure she could see him and then hed glance over to where the giant suitcase was sitting in a corner he had rachel he had his precious belongings penelope and digger were out on the veranda in sight so hugo was out in the wide world but this link made it ok for now rachel it was a call over the intercom rachel had just seen her last patient but the call made her sink back into her seat elly the hospital charge nurse sounded worried rachel are you there yes can you come through to the hospital fast theres a baby fitting katy brady the babys mother is bringing her in now but she sounds as if shes unconscious already a fast word of explanationthankfully toby was a doctors child and knew what the word emergency meantand rachel ran leaving the dogs and toby with ruby she reached the hospital entrance as a rust bucket of an ancient ford screeched to a halt in the entrance its connor brady and his mother katy elly told her as they hauled open the car door but there was no time for more the young mother almost fell out of the drivers seat the baby was slumped over his mothers knee katy was obviously a teenage mumyoung to the point where she was scarcely out of childhood herself she was wearing frayed jeans and a tiny crop top with tattoos peeking out from underneath her hair hung in dreadlocks down to her waist but it wasnt katy that rachel was looking at connor brady seemed about six weeks old and he was in dire trouble the baby had been lying across his mothers knees and one look told rachel what the trouble wasand what was the cause of what was happening she put her hand on the childs forehead and winced at what she felt fever the babys temperature must be over forty and he was wrappedtightly wrappedin blankets my baby katy was sobbing almost incoherent in fear but rachel already had him hauling away the blankets as she lifted the little one from the car the baby was limp his eyes rolling back in his head as if hed been convulsing for far too long i need dr hugo the girl wailed but rachel wasnt listening she was doing a fast assessment looking for telltale signs of a meningococcal rash checking for neck stiffness searching thankfully there was nothing get me scissors she told elly damn there were buttons and ribbons everywhere and she wanted these clothes off fast there were no signs of a rash that she could see and the little ones neck was moving freely the likely cause of this was a simple fever combined with heat elly run me a sink full of cool water as the girl stumbled out of the car and reached for the baby rachel met her fear head on im a doctor she told her katy im pretty sure that your babys convulsing because hes hot we need to get him cool straight away give him to me the girl was reaching out for her baby in instinctive protest at losing contact but rachel was already moving toward the hospital entrance carrying the baby with her come with me she told katy talk to me as i work how longs he been like this her confident tone must have broken through the girl hiccuped on a sob and then tried to talk heshes got a cold i asked dr mcinnes for antibiotics but he wouldnt give me any then this morning he was so stuffed up and the radio said we might be evacuated so i wrapped him up really well and started packing but then i came back to his crib and he washe was all rigid then when i picked him up he went sort of limp rachel had reached the emergency room now she hadnt stoppedkaty had stumbled along beside her as shed taken connor inside now she had him on the examination table and was attacking the crazy layette peeling it away like an unwanted skin a really thick skin bootees jacket nightgown the babys body was so hot when you found him did you put him straight in the car she was turning to the sink where elly was already running water but she was still questioning the frightened child by her side the girl needed comfort but the need to establish a time frame was more urgent than comfort what how longs he been fitting she asked directly when did you phone i phoned as soon as i saw him i picked him up and he was really odd and i was so scared i just called the girl hiccuped on a sob the call came through eight minutes ago elly told her i rang you straight away how long had you left him in the cot could he have been fitting for a while before you found him no the girl was trying desperately to focus sensing it was important just for a moment the last of the babys clothes fell away to reveal a tiny limp body just two minutes at most i wrapped him and put him down and went to get his carrycot and then he was like this so hed been fitting for probably no more than ten minutes but ten minutes convulsing still meant a risk of brain damage they had to get him cool whats the problem it was hugo hed entered unseen behind them taking in the scene before him as he strode into the room convulsion rachel said shortly without turning shed lifted the baby to the sink and shoved her elbow in to check the temperature but elly knew her stuff the water had the chill taken off but that was all it was cool to the touch rachel lowered the little one right in up to his neck the remains of his clothing and all sponge water over his head she told elly hugo i need diazepam he didnt question her need coming he replied and disappeared come on the baby lay unresponding in her hands please it was a silent prayer said over and over in her years working in emergency sometimes it worked let this be one of those times please come on connor and as if on cue she felt a tremor run through the little body another the baby stiffened arched was it more of the same a further convulsion the eyes were still unfocused i need the diazapam its here hugo was back with her rachel lifted the babys slippery little body for a moment as hugo carefully administered the drug their heads bent together over the tiny child elly had stepped back to give hugo room to manoeuvre he discarded the packing then started scooping water over the little head come on come on they were willing this thing together and it worked connors body gave a long long shudderand his little eyes opened connor stared up at the strangers above his little mouth dropped open his chin wobbledand he gave a feeble feeble wail it was the sweetest sound rachel let her breath outhow long had she been holding it almost since shed seen the baby she looked up at hugo and saw her joy reflected in his eyes hes back we have success hugo said softly well done you lucky me rachel whispered hugo was continuing to scoop water over the tiny fuzzy head but the wail was building strength as young connor realised the indignity of his position to have this outcome was a gift a blessing she looked over her shoulder at the young mother katy was quietly sobbing mascara running in two ugly lines down her cheeks will you hold him in the water katy she said softly he sounds like he wants his mother i cant the girl choked on a sob he shouldnt be sick i wanted an antibiotic but dr mcinnes wouldnt give it to me he wouldnt she sank down on a chair and put her head in her hands and rachel signalled to elly to take her place with the baby with a questioning look at hugoand an answering nodshe stooped and took the girls hands in hers pulling them away from her teardrenched eyes and forcing her to look at her katy antibiotics wouldnt have helped connors cold will get better all by itself its a combination of fever and this heat that has caused the fitting the baby book said keep him warm when he has a cold katy said defiantly it said it i read she sniffed and tried a glare that didnt come off i read everything you dont have someone who can give you advice rachel frowned is there a baby clinic in town in the city there were clinics specifically set up for very young mothers who didnt have the support that an older woman might be capable of finding for herself no theres not the staff available for a baby clinic hugo said grimly from behind her connors cries were escalating and he needed to raise his voice to be heard i do my best but we need another doctor he hesitated then added what about you how do you feel about staying in town and helping set a baby clinic up plus the rest i wouldnt mind rachel said before she could help herself and suddenly she was looking at hugo and he was looking back at her with unspoken thoughts but this wasnt the timeor the place we need to move on hugo said and there was real reluctance in his voice im sorry but we need to move fast the fires broken through the firebreak what does that mean that we evacuate hugo told her now my baby katy sobbed and hugo looked down at the thrashing screaming infant and grinned you know katy i reckon your baby might be the least of our problems well dress him in a nappy and nothing else theres shade down at the beach if he gets hot then you take him into the shallows in fact sitting in the shallows seems a fine idea for everyone its your job to keep connor cool katy while we look after everyone else later rachel could only remember the next few hours as chaos ordered chaos but chaos for all that but the township had been gearing for this event for two days now and when they moved they moved fast firefighting became a lower priority once the firebreaks had been breached everyone moved into protection mode all firefighters were pulled out of the hillsit was pointless and dangerous to stay there every ablebodied person was assigned a job volunteers went from house to house ensuring people had left checking that everything that could be done had been done then the town was left to fend for itself sam nieve was in his element he was the elderly man with the heart condition rachel had sent home from the fire front now he was in charge of what he termed the home guard hed taken his role very seriouslyhe had lists of houses with every occupant and by the time rachel and hugo reached the beach rachel accompanying kims stretcher and hugo supervising the other two seriously ill hospital inmates he was set up at a makeshift desk crossing off the name of every town inhabitant hed even set up planking so that every person who arrived at the beach was forced to walk past his desk this way i know whos still in their houses he told hugo and there was no mistaking the pride in the mans voice theres only three im still worried about miss baxter whos got a gammy leg and wont leave because she loves her garden les harding whos worried about his crazy feral cats and sueellen lesley ive sent a couple of teams to bring in miss baxter and les and as many of his cats as they can catch theres only sueellen left to worry about you didnt send a team to fetch her in hugo asked the hospital stretchers were being set up far down the beach the idea was that if the fire grew to firestorm status then people could back into the shallows every blanket in the town had been collected and was already lying sodden waiting to cover a needy head kims stretcher had already been taken down in a moment rachel would go down and readjust the drips that the girl still needed but hugo had stopped by sams desk and so had rachel she saw the concern etched on hugos face and was immediately worried sueellen wont come if a team of people arrive sam said casting an uncertain glance up at hugo i tried to tell her the danger but she slammed the door in my face have you seen her today hugo asked shortly and sam shook his head not since yesterday gary lewis went up there last night but she wouldnt let him in either hes been on the radio worrying about her but theres nothing i can do how did she seem erratic jumpy angry the two men were looking at each other and their worry was mirrored in each others eyes problem rachel asked and hugo nodded sueellen has schizophrenia shes normally good but something like this can throw her i saw her last week and she was coping well but i asked if she was taking her pills sam said she told me to go to hell shed say that even if she was taking them hugo had turned and was staring up into the hills as if he could see anything the idea was ludicrous the smoke was whirling around their faces and visibility was practically zero the fire trucks had parked on the sand and were surrounding the temporary township in a ringfire trucks in a semicircle with the sea at their backs there was safety here but not for sueellen you know she hates interference i was a mate of her dads sam said heavily i know she stops taking her pills from time to time and i know it used to scare her old man where is she rachel asked out the back of the town hugo said she has five acres of overgrown bush sam shook his head im not sending anyone else out there not now if she wont come she wont she might come for me yeah and youll put your head in a noose because of a bloody schizo but hugos face had set in anger sueellens a great woman he looked at rachel as if he was seeking her approval by the look on sams face he knew he wouldnt get approval from him she used to play with the state orchestra before she became ill and now she sits up there with her damned goats getting madder and madder sam muttered but hugo shook his head she runs angora goats she spins and weaves and plays and talks to herself im wasting time hugo hesitated im the only person she trusts where are her people rachel asked dismayed her father died five years back she went out for a while with gary lewis one of the local firemen but she fretted that her medication was making her stupid she made gary leave her be and since then she doesnt let anyone else close you cant get up there theres still time they turned to look northward but of course there was nothing an impenetrable layer of smoke the wind was pushing ash through the air rachel could taste it she opened her mouth to speak and a fine film of ash landed on her tongue instead of speaking she ended up coughing theres surgical masks hugo said shortly get one on you need to be fit rachel i want everyone here wearing them can you can i what but she knew already what he was going to ask can you take over i need to go theres toby she stared at him helplessly myra had collected toby when the order for evacuation had come and now toby was splashing happily in the shallows with his mates from school to them this was still a game long may that last hugo let me go she placed a hand on his arm suddenly urgent with anxiety i dont have anyone i can go you have a husband who doesnt need me there shed said it and even as she said it she acknowledged it was the truth dottie was right but toby needs you you dont know the way and sueellen doesnt trust you theres no one else sueellen will come with ill be all right there are dams in her home paddock well make it in time risk your life for a schizo sam was bristling in indignation shes not a schizo hugo said wearily shes a fine musician and shes a lovely person and shes my patient i should have gone out there myself last night he stared helplessly at rachel i need to go can you cover for me here their eyes met he knew what he was asking she thought he knew but he had to go she knew this man well enough even after such a short time to understand that his need was absolute toby had an aunt toby had a town full of caring people the unknown sueellen had no one except hugo of course you need to go she whispered and watched his face change i understand go then but go fast and only go on the understanding that youll come back safe promise me i promise she reached out and grasped his hands her voice suddenly urgent she met his eyes and hers locked with them and held hugo you must he stared down at her for a long moment and his gaze fell to their clasped hands his mouth twisted into an expression she couldnt begin to understand i promise he said and he pulled her to him and kissed her hard on the lips it was a fast and brutal kiss a kiss born of fear and of want and of pure adrenalin then he was pushing her away his eyes bleak take care of toby he said as he turned and ran into the smoke keep the town safe for me until i come back chapter eight hes got time sam said uneasily he was watching rachel watching the stricken look in her eyes he didnt understand all of what was going on here but he understood enough the fires coming through fast but theres no hint of firestorm yet if hes sensibleif the wind stays at its current force only of course it didnt ten minutes after hugo had left the wind strengthened from strong to gale force ripping across the crowded beach with a force that was terrifying the blast of hot air before the fire was almost overpowering rachel was stooped over a stretcher bridget mcleod had turned a hundred the week before the heat was making her badly dehydrated and rachel was setting up a saline drip as the searing wind blasted across the beach the woman pushed her away theres others need you more leave me be theres no need to be noble rachel told her trying not to sound panicky behind her mask were organised for this she finished what she was doing and straightened trying to see through the swirling smoke but the townsfolk were prepared a heat like this couldnt last the galeforce wind would blast through with frightening force but because of the beach they could survive after the initial fire front firefighting operations could begin again but for now the little populace were hauling blankets over their heads following orders that had been drilled into this fireprone town since their childhood those who couldnt walk were being carried into the shallows toby rachel turned to find myra at her side myra had toby in her arms with blankets wedged between them theres nothing more you can do lass stay with us during the worst myra said and there was no choice two firefighters had hold of bridgets stretcher and were carrying her into the shallows the old lady already covered with a soaking blanket the rest of the stretchers were lined up where the waves broke lightly over patients feet every patient had an allocated carer each with sodden blankets toby was whimpering with fear the noise from the fire was almost deafening take care of toby hugo had said hugo oh god hugo she couldnt think of him now she mustnt the people of this tiny town were huddled in the shallows she could scarcely breathe there was nothing to do except survive somewhere out there was hugo if i survive so must you she whispered to herself as she dropped to her knees in the shallows toby crawled from myras arms to hers and clung they had their blankets right over their heads a sodden canopy to stop the shower of burning ash falling directly onto them the fire was a roaring inferno despite the pall of smoke she could sense the flamesa wall of fire bursting down from the mountains the air was being sucked up the oxygen it was so hard to breathe i want my daddy toby whimpered and rachel held him close and whispered into his hair so do i she murmured so do i but daddys gone to see a patient hell be back soon please sueellen hugo was out of the car holding woollen wadding over his face to augment his mask as he raced toward the burning house vision was down to almost nothingthe fire was all around him the trees overhead were roaring with flames it had caught the back of the house had caught on this side of the house at least there was a little shelter the house itself was stopping the worst of the blast so far hugo was coughing retching yelling thinking fast maybe shed gone to the dam maybe it was the obvious place surely she wouldnt still be in the house sueellen something hit his legssomething alive he looked down to see a halfgrown collie pup whining in terror scratching at the door whining again dear god the dogs body language was unmistakable she was inside for something that had threatened for so long it was over with a speed that was frightening all by itself one minute the population of cowral was crouched in the shallows while the fire blasted its way right over their heads the next the front had moved on the air was still choked with smoke and debris but the roaring receded the feeling that the very air required to breathe was being sucked away was replaced by the same choking thick sensation that had been with them most of the day with the passing of the front the wind dropped the fire had made its own wind a vortex thats what the firefighters had said could happen and now rachel believed them toby was still cradled in her arms myra was beside them their bodies a threesome of contact with the waves splashing over them in a rhythm that had been crazily undisturbed by the fire rachel pushed back her blanket and peered cautiously out around her everyone was doing the samea field of grey sodden ghosts arising from the ashes katy and her baby the ancient bridget hauling back her blanket herself and peering out with an interest that belied her hundred years casualties sam was beside her pushing himself out from underneath something that looked like a vast eiderdown his wife was beside him sylvia nieve still had a head full of hairrollers and as she pushed back the eiderdown she gave them a cautious pat making sure of what was important did everyone get to the beach rachel asked and the cold feeling of dread in the pit of her heart felt like a lump of lead elaine baxter and les harding arrived just as it hit ian told her one of the men got bitten by one of less cats the cats are here in a cageif someone hasnt drowned them but hugo she asked he didnt come back hell have been well into the hills when it hit seeing his patient rachel said swiftly as toby turned a fearful face toward sam she had to stay calm hysterics would help no one there was a lady whos ill up in the hills and your daddy has gone to look after her and i need to go too toby can you stay with myra while your daddy and i keep on working ill see anyone here who needs help and then sam how long do you think before we can get through to sueellens place ill check with the fire chief sam told her as soon as its safe to move let me know rachel told him she gave toby a hard hug as much to reassure herself as to reassure toby hugo might hugo might need help the chiefll send a tanker ill come too she worked solidly on the beach coping with breathing difficulties and myriad minor injuries while she waited for the fire chief to declare it safe to travel through the town to sueellens farmlet beyond i cant believe how lightly weve got off the chief a grizzled man in his fifties pushed back his hard hat and wiped his forehead as he surveyed the clearing beach the storm sucked everything up in its path but weve done such a good clearing job around the town that weve only lost four houses and they were holiday accommodation where no one followed orders to clear once the firestorm had passed the townsfolk streamed back to their homes in time to put out spot fires and stop the fire from taking hold now the main front had reached the point where land became sea cowral was still surrounded by a ring of fire but increasingly the town looked safe but hugo can we go rachel finished wrapping a burned arm with a sterile dressing a burning branch had been flung into the shallows at the height of the fireit must have been blown for a quarter of a milebut the child whod been hit was already aching to get back to the excitement rachel clipped the dressing gave the boys parents a rueful grin and turned back to the fire chief you dont want to go with us doc he told her ive got gary lewis on the truck alreadyhes been out on the front and when he found out sueellen didnt make it to the beach he nearly went berserk theres one of you emotionally involved and youre not he met her look square on and sighed yeah he admitted of course i am then what are we arguing over she was dressed in her firefighting gear toby was safe with myra there was no one else needing urgent treatment and somewhere out there was hugo she definitely needed to go but still the fire chief hesitated doc what youre not seeing this at its worst he told her the rivers blocked the worst of the blast here if we were right before the front she gazed at his grim face and saw the message he was trying not to tell her youre telling me theres little chance hugos survived the boys are trying to clear the road now he told her well let you know no she straightened her shoulders in an unconscious brace position im a doctor he they may be hurt his eyes met hers giving her the truth to be honest doc the chances are that theyre a lot more than hurt i know but if not im bringing medical supplies and im coming sueellen lesley lived five minutes drive out of town but it took two fire crews half an hour to reach it once outside the town boundaries there was thick bushor what was left of thick bush now there was simply smouldering fire eucalypts burned fast the trees were already starting to smoulder rather than flame and the smell of burning eucalyptus oil was overpowering branches had dropped across the road trees were down every obstacle they reached had to be dealt with slowlyflames put out and the wood cooled enough to shift two fire crews worked in tandem with a water tanker ferrying water as needed by the time they reached the tiny farmhouse where sueellen lived rachel was almost ready to scream you sure youre not needed back in town the fire chiefs face was grim as they rounded the last corner rachel had been working as hard as any of his team joining the hard manual labour that had been needed to clear the road she was working as one of his crew but there were personal issues here he could see it the set look on her face had him worried he was worried anyway one of his boys was emotionally involved with sueellen and gary was making himself sick with worry and as well as sueellen well this was doc mcinnes hell if im needed theyll contact me rachel told him shortly elly knows where i am and the radio network is still operational but theres nothing back in town but heat exhaustion and dehydration and elly and don and david can cope with that but dont fight me on this she told him were wasting time just get there and then the farmhouse was in view or what was left of the farmhouse nothing the tiny farm cottage looked almost as if it had been vaporisedsucked into thin air with only a smouldering slab remaining where the house had once stood even the chimney had collapsed in on itself and was now a low mound of crumbling smoking brick nothing could have survived this hugo rachel caught her breath there was a car parked beside the wreck or what was left of a car a big old family sedan hugos car rachel was out of the truck before it stopped staring her heart was somewhere else gone a lifeless thing with no meaning there were tears streaming down her face and she didnt check them she couldnt hugo and then a shout from gary the giant of a young firefighter who was so worried about sueellen over here hes over here in the dam gary who obviously knew the lie of the land had spared not even a glance for the burntout shell of the house where it was obvious nothing could have survived but hed moved swiftly toward a bank over to the left now he stood on the rise and yelled back to them theyre over here theyre in the dam doc with about thirty bloody goats and a dog and sueellen theyre alive hugo was alive but sueellen barely qualified hed heard them come but he could do nothing the girl in his arms needed all his attention her eyes were wide but what she was seeing was invisible to him she was drifting in and out of consciousness her blood pressure was way down and her pulse was thready and weak he needed equipment he needed help the grass at the verge of the dam was still smouldering he couldnt move so he lay supporting sueellen partly submerged in the water beside them her halfgrown collie lay and whined and whined and around them sueellens beloved angora goats shifted in anxiety the girl in his arms stirred and seemed to focus icant she whispered you dont need to do anything sueellen he told her trying hard to keep his voice reassuring and steady youve done it all your goats are fine youve saved your pup youre burned but not too badly youll be ok people are coming well both be looked after your goats your dogs all of us she was no longer listening shed dropped again into unconsciousness he closed his eyes and when he opened them rachel was slithering down the bank toward him his rachel i havent been able to help i havent had anything to work with hugo told her the fire crew had laid a thermal blanket over the mud at the side of the dam garyappalled beyond beliefhad lifted sueellens limp body from hugos grasp and laid her tenderly on the bank someone else had run for rachels equipment now they were working fiercely in tandem severe burns shock smoke inhalation why hadnt they been able to get here earlier rachel thought fiercely as she checked blood pressure eighty over fifty hell gary look after hugo she ordered as one of the few professional firefighters gary would know basic first aid but hugo was having none of it he brushed gary aside and reached for the iv equipment im fine i havent been able to help but i can now are your hands burned no your voice is rasping im not burned its just from smoke inhalation well then leave it she cast a doubtful glance at him but his look was grim and determined she had the sense to let it be moving to sueellens mouth tilting her chin so her jaw dropped open i checked hugo said briefly theres no obvious burns to her mouth the pharynx isnt swollen lucky rachel placed a stethoscope on sueellens chest while hugo accepted the bag of saline from gary and swabbed the girls bare arm iv access would have to be antecubitalthrough the elbowbecause of deep burns on her hands she was still deeply unconscious oh god shes dying the young firefighter whispered and rachel found time to glance up at him you sound like you love her she said gently and the young giant nodded they were working together to rip away clothing and place the bags of saline we used to go out with each other when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia she called it off said it was unfair to me i came around last night to see if she needed help and she told me to clear off but she didnt want me to i could tell and then today i was caught out with the fire truck and couldnt check hell i didnt know i didnt know he hadnt known how much he loved her rachel thought with the sudden insight of someone whod been down just that road shell be right she said gently gary can you find us more blankets from the truck i know its crazy but the water will have chilled her and we need her warm youll find the sheets i broughtthey look like a cross between plastic and tin foil and i have sheets of clingwrap i want them too the firefighter nodded grateful to do anything anything he disappeared at a run we need to contact air ambulance services hugo said in a voice that was growing more ragged by the minute i already have it was the fire chief appearing over the dam bank with his radio receiver still in his hand one of the states medical evacuation helicopters is available apparently our firestorm has upgraded us cowrals become a priority and the chopper will be here in twenty minutes if we can keep her alive hugo muttered and rachel shook her head theres no doubt she had an oxygen mask on the girls face and already sueellens complexion was deepening under the grime to something that looked more healthy as if on cue the girl stirred and moaned morphine rachel murmured reaching behind her for her bag but it was hugo who administered it he was shocked and battered but he was working on autopilot let me go let me go it was a thready whisper but she was starting to fight them haloperidol rachel queried and hugo nodded if sueellen was schizophrenic then the whole combination of events might well be enough to push her over the edge sedation was imperative the fluids were flowing freely now rachel took another bloodpressure reading and breathed a bit more easily a hundred and ten seventy see hugo well do it youll do it he muttered i couldnt do it without you hell rachel i had nothing because your car went up in flames she said brusquely it could be said you had an excuse i dont think the medical board is going to strike you off for losing your doctors bag and you did save the patient gary arrived back sliding down the bank with a bunch of blankets he looked worried sick lets find the extent of these burns hugo said he was starting to sound in control a bitjust a little he lifted sueellens palms and grimaced rule of palm take the area of a size of a palm print and measure how many palm prints were burned on the girls body twenty thirty they were looking at something like thirty per cent burns we need that fluid coming in fast we have it rachel replied have we got dressing packs we have everything we need shed carried her bag with her and she flipped it open as hugo started gently separating burned fingersimperative in these first few minutesshe started sorting handing hugo sachets of specially formulated gel to soak the burns then gauze to place over them before they wrapped the whole area in clingwrap it was imperative to get the area sterile and airfree at what cost came the time spent in the dam what infections were in the ashand mudladen water but at least it meant she had a chance and a chance was what she most needed as gary stooped over sueellen and her eyes fluttered open and found garyas gary lifted her hand to his face and heldjust held rachel thought sueellen had everything she needed right here right now she was injured almost to death but she had her love and one look at gary told her that it would take more than schizophrenia or bushfires to part them again and all of a sudden rachel was blinking back tears ofenvy she was in the house hugo was sitting in the mud on the dam bank his head in his hands behind them the whirr of the helicopter was fading into the distance theyd lifted sueellen from the dam bank warmed her shocked body covered her burns with antiseptic gel and the thin plastic burn wrap and continued her on intravenous fluids theyd given her as much morphine as they could then theyd loaded her into the medical evacuation helicopter where a team of skilled medicos were waiting to take her to sydney gary had gone too it hadnt been discussed she had every chance of survival rachel thought as she watched the chopper disappear into the distance although the burns to her legs and hands were too extensive to be treated in a small country hospital they shouldnt be extensive enough to be lifethreatening not with the prompt treatment shed had and the fact that in an hour shed be in the best burns unit in the state and the schizophrenia with love and devotion she had a good chance of a stable life gary wasnt about to be pushed aside again for however noble a motive rachel thought and here already the goats were emerging from the water starting to forage over burned ground amazingly they even looked as if they were finding things to eat the goats might be back to business as usual but hugo wasnt he was sitting on the dam bank looking sick rachel sat down beside him hauled pudge sueellens pup up onto her knee and held the shaking dog with her free hand she took hugos and held that too tight hugo he looked dreadful while theyd worked over sueellen hed been efficient doctor in medical mode but as the chopper left the fight seem to have drained out of him hugo she whispered again and he stirred as if trying to rouse himself from a dreadful dream the house had started to burn before i reached her he said at last wearily as if hardly conscious that rachel was beside him she must have gone back in i yelled out and i could hear her inside the house screaming for pudge screaming but pudge was outside the pup came to greet me as i pulled up desperate as if he knew his mistress was inside so you went in of course he winced and rachel looked down at the hand she was holding there were blisters there burns hed been wearing protective clothing and that was intact but there were spot burns on his hands and on his face hed been through hell she pulled back on her hand afraid she was hurting him but his grip tightened but you found her she said softly and he nodded i found her in the back bedroom and the curtains were burning the window had exploded inward and she had bare feet bare feet hugo i should have come last night i should have thought of sueellen then he groaned hell i should have youre one man she said gently i went to the beach there was no danger last night and other people checked gary loved her and he checked she sent him away there was nothing else you could do you know that but today today you came you came in time theyre saying on the beach that sueellen refused to evacuate do you think she would have evacuated if youd ordered her to youre not omnipotent hugo youre human youre a doctor and a really fine one at that but youre still human she took his palms into her hands and looked down he was burned but not too badly still her face twisted dear god hed come so close youre a lovely lovely man she whispered the best oh god hugo if id lost you he wasnt hearing he was still with sueellen i thought she was stable he said bleakly sensible last time i saw her i was out here three days ago when the fires first threatened she talked about evacuation plans so why didnt i check because you cant be everything to everyone she said softly then because she couldnt bear to watch the pain in his eyes any more she took his face in her hands and kissed himsoftly on each eyelid in turn sueellen made her own decision not to leave her animals thats her responsibility back at the beach sam called her a schizoa mental caseand if thats the way you regarded her then yes you were responsible for her because she wasnt responsible for herself you should have locked her up and taken total control but you said she was a person capable of her own decisions yes but but nothing rachels voice was urgent now she could see the selfloathing in hugos eyes and she wasnt having any of it he was hurt this man she could put bandages on his hands but it wasnt enough what hurt more than a heart sueellen knew the dangers sam and gary both said shed been warned she chose to stay she was ill would you have locked her in a mental institution no but but nothing sueellen lived independently and she was hurt making that life for herself i wont have you blaming yourself dr mcinnes he looked up at her and the beginning of an exhausted smile crossed his face just a trace bossy arent we its what i do best she said softly and smiled back at him hugo gazed up at her really looked his burned hand came up and brushed the curls from her face they were tumbling every which way from under her hard hat shed be smokegrimed she thoughtblack with soot and sand and smoke but hugos eyes were holding her and his fingers traced her cheekbone gentlya feather touch youre so beautiful beautiful and bossy she asked in a voice that wasnt quite steady thats the one rachel what i need to kiss you he told her and what was a girl to say to a request like that she kissed him more than that she gave her heart right there and then or maybe it had been given in those awful moments on the beach under the sodden blanket with the fire roaring overhead thinking that somewhere out here was hugo her love her love there was another love craig that hadnt disappearedit never could there was still commitment still pain but it didnt stop this flowering that was happening within her right now dottie had said it was time she moved on put craig behind her but it wasnt like that she hadnt been able to put craig behind her for eight long years and she couldnt now she didnt need to because craig was still with her craig was a part of who she was a part of her loving she held hugos dear scorched face in her hands and she kissed him with all the love in her heart and she knew that this was no betrayal this was an extension of loving a wealth of love broadening expanding her heart to take in toby and cowral and penelope and digger and sueellen and maybe a few crazy goats clustered around and a confused pup called pudge and hugo she kissed him and found herself melting not just her lips her whole life melting away and reforming regrouping stronger richer deeper love he tasted of fire he tasted of heat and want and aching need he tasted of hugo her fingers held him curled into his hair clinging letting his mouth devour her knowing that for him this kiss was as affirmation of life as well as love knowing for him this was the only way to move forward through love love washere love was now love was hugo there was no time for each other not now they held each other for as long as they could desperately taking what they most needed from this precious contact but of course there was more needed of them this day than the care of sueellen the fire chief stood behind them and coughed and waited hed given them space he was a wise man and hed seen their need hed directed his team away from them as the chopper left and had given them as much time as he could but needs were breaking through doc he coughed a couple of times and tried again doc they broke apart sort of battered and filthy they sat in the mud and looked up at him and the fire chief gave them a grin which said the incongruous picture they made was hardly lost on him geez whatever turns you on doc he said to hugo me i like my missus in a sexy negligee but if you like em covered with sootwell each to his own but kinky is what i call it rachel blushed she blushed from the roots of her hair to the tips of her toes and she tried to haul away but hugo was having none of it his hand tightened around her waist and he grinned sexiest lady i know isnt she just the firechiefs grin broadened well have her up on our calendar next year hard hat included look im sorry to disturb you youd think we could have a bit of privacy hugo complained he seemed suddenly almost jovial weve searched so hard to find it and here we are with only thirty goats one dog and twenty odd firefighters as an audience his smile faded just a bit but it didnt leave his eyes completely dont tell me problems no major ones the chief wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and something suspiciously like moisture smeared his cheek weve been so bloody lucky its amazing but but one of the teams down at the river are saying some of the guys are suffering from smoke inhalation and the publicans wifeshe tried to hook up the hose as the first of the heavy smoke hit the town but she was working blind and she fell over the tap she sounds like shes broken her toe a broken toe is that all hugo asked in voice that was none too steady thats all doc the chief told him for now you guys might have time to continue thisdiscussion later if you need to but for now im afraid cowral wants you both to be doctors hugo smiled and turned back to rachel to his love can we be doctors for a bit hugo asked her he held rachel close and the expression in his eyes told her all she ever needed to know about this man there was no need for anything else just hugo his feel his touch his eyes and the way he looked at her what do you think my love he whispered can we be doctors for a bit as long as we stay being more than just doctors underneath she answered her eyes smiling and holding and loving as long as we stay just as we are and then her smile broke into a chuckle of love and laughter and joy only maybe a little bit cleaner they worked then through the rest of that long long day because of course it wasnt just firefighters with smoke inhalation and maddie forsyths broken toe the town was in firefighting mode there were minor burns everywhere exhaustion dehydration stress hugo and rachel worked together and separately they saw an endless stream of patients one after another the little hospital was a clearinghouse through which most of the towns population passed at some time during the day toby was there from time to time brought in by myra just to see that daddy and rachel were still there still fine toby and myra came with three dogs because of course they couldnt leave the shaky pudge at the farm hugo had scooped him up and carried him into town beneath his firecrew jacket and had handed him over to myra to fuss over amazingly the two big dogs seemed to sense the little dogs distress and now pudge was the centre of a twodog housekeeper and small boy circle of protection by his second visit into the hospital the puppys tail was starting to wag again ill telephone melbourne and tell them to pass the news on to sueellen hugo told rachel as myra herded her charges outdoors again itll do her more good than medicine in the middle of all thishe could find time to think laterally about sueellen that was what country practice was all about rachel thought as she returned to washing ash out of a firefighters eyes country practice was medicine from textbooksplus the rest it was healingjust for her they worked far into the night the townsfolk had gone home from the beach the wind died and about ten oclock the hopedfor change blew through softly from the south the air temperature dropped to almost cool and there was a spattering of blessed rain but still they worked a team had been organised to go from house to house checking not for spot fires now but on peoples health the elderly and those at risk had had a day where theyd been tested to the limit they could go home now and maybe collapse with exhaustion stress smoke inhalation minor injuries so everyone was checked cowral looked after its own and as each problem was reported it was passed on to the medical team at two am rachel finally arrived back in the kitchen of the doctors residence myra had taken toby and all three dogs out to her place for the night there were casseroles sitting on the kitchen tableof coursebut rachel was beyond eating she sat and stared at nothing at nothing at all and fifteen minutes later hugo walked in he was as exhausted as she was he appeared at the screen door and his face was grey with fatigue she rose and looked at him justlooked and what passed between them it was a vow it was confirmation of all they had come through that day it was the start of their life together rachel he said at last and it was as if it was a blessing hugo she whispered and walked straight into his arms there was no time then for anything but love there was no time for talking no time for anything but filling this aching searing need holding finding their rightful place they showered together because to do otherwise was to waste time their filthy clothes were shed togetherclothes that on any day but this one would have had both doctors struck off the medical register as disgraces to the medical profession but no one had minded their clothes theyd been doctors first and foremost theyd seen to the towns medical needs but nowthe need was past the towns needs there was time now for their own needs time to become lovers there was no hesitation no questions there were only answers their bodies met in joyful wonder they washed each other under the stream of warm water soaping smiling learning each others bodies in this the most intimate act of cleaning soaping off the layers of grime to reveal bodies that were already known and loved his hands were smoothing the soap over her skin and it was the most erotic of sensations she had the flannel and was rubbing his back but her body was falling forward leaning into him letting her mouth touch his tasting wanting needing the need was mutual allexclusive it was as if this man and this woman had been meant for each otherdestinedfrom the beginning of time and then they were together in hugos big bed dry and warmed but still naked gloriously naked skin against skin holding holding narrowing the gap merging man and woman becoming one it had been so long had it ever been this good rachel didnt know she couldnt think she couldnt compare what had been between rachel and craig was another time another life it had been preciouswas still preciousbut it was a thing apart this was now this man her beloved hugo holding her as if he loved her he did love her she knew it and she gloried in it craig would not gainsay her this love because she loved craig she knew with a surety that was a part of her own heart that she had his blessing she could feel it her body was doubly blessed dear heaven the feel of hugo the wonder his big hands were holding her as if she was the most precious thing in the world his warmth the smell of him the taste the way her body moulded around him opened welcomed he came into her and their mutual need was overwhelming the wonder the joy they slept how could they not sleep after this day their exhaustion was absolute sated with loving they slept entwined and rachel fell into a sleep as deep as shed ever been in ever since the accidentever since that dreadful dayher sleep had been troubled disturbed as if shed had to stay awake for the next disaster there would be another disaster her world had been pulled from under her feet and she couldnt trust she couldnt sleep but nowin this mans arms she slept let tomorrow bring what it may for now there was only this man and his arms and his body and his love and hugo it had never been like this with beth hed drifted into marriage with beth as hed nearly drifted into marriage with her sister stupid stupid stupid yet how could he have known it had been stupid hed never known it could be like this he woke about dawn and his fingers twined gently through rachels tumbled curls how could he have suspected there was loving like this in the world this wonderful woman thisblessing she stirred in sleep her eyes half opened and she smiled at him his heart twisted inside him and he gathered her to him with such tenderness the most precious thing rachel her eyes closed and she snuggled into him her breasts moulded to him he felt desire stir but exhaustion was still there desire could wait he thought with a growing joy it could wait an hour or two there was all the time in the world this was his rachel rachel murmuring her name into her hair he drifted back to sleep the phone woke them it was late at least eight the sun was streaming across the brocade quilt hed get rid of it hugo thought and then joyously yes hed get rid of every piece of brocade in the house this day was the first day of the rest of his life his life with rachel she was waking beside him her eyes fluttering open smiling reaching up to touch his unshaven chin the phone was ringing rachel medical imperative answer the phone he smiled back at her and then answered the phone a womans voice urgent with need is rachel there dr harper shes not answering her cellphone i need to speak to her sure he heard the fear and reacted his eyes sent rachel an urgent message and handed her the phone rachel took the receiver and listened dottie she was suddenly wide awake pushing herself up in bed oblivious of the fact that she was naked a sunbeam was streaming across her creamy breasts dear god she was beautiful but her voice sounded concerned no dottie were fine im sorry i should have rung you last night i might have known youd see it on the news reports no the towns been left basically intact were safe no no then her voice softened with dread but he cant dottie he was stable she listened some more and then put her lips tightly together her eyes closed as if in pain of course ill come she whispered of course just as soon as i can get there the line went dead hugo lifted the receiver from rachels suddenly limp grasp and laid it back on the cradle then he turned and took her hands in his what is it rachel she opened her eyes and stared at him but she wasnt seeing him she was seeing something a long way away in the far far distance its craig she whispered craig my husband hes dying chapter nine somehow while hugo helped rachel put her belongings together and practically forcefed her toast and arranged for someone to drive hersomehow he got it out of her craig and i were in a car smash eight years ago she said her voice laced with pain we were med students together wed gone out together since school dottie craigs mum is practically my mum we were so close we got married and everything was perfect and then some drunk driver smashed into us on a blind bend when we were coming home from one of craigs football matches the drunk was on the wrong side of the road and there was nothing craig could do to avoid him i was hurt craig craig was hardly touched except for a blow to his head one blow one blow and he was unconscious and he never woke up her voice broke on a sob and hugo held her mug of tea to lips that were tight with the shock of past hurt and hurt still to come so michael the guy at the dog show hes a schmuck she said dottie said i should get away have some fun and i met you he took a deep breath did some fast thinking last night hed made love to a woman hed thought was in an unhappy marriage now things had changed shed changed and his head he was having trouble getting it around this but the pain on her face was real and dreadful and it needed to be addressed now rachel im really sorry she pulled herself together then sort of sorry im not she gave him a fleeting hurting smile how could i be sorry for last night it was the most wonderful her voice broke but she managed to go on hugo it was fantastic the best i could never ever regret it but you do see that i need to go of course you do it tore him apart that he couldnt put her in his car and drive her to sydney himself but of course he couldnt the town still had medical imperatives at least the road was open rain in the night had cleared the route out of town hed put out a call and someone would drive her all the way to melbourne he could arrange that at least but he couldnt leave rachel i know she swallowed the last of her tea and stood looking down into the dregs at the bottom of the mug i know im sorry hugo im sorry love hugo worked for that daylong hours of minor crises he worked the next the day after that the day after that he could bear it no longer he talked to myra and to toby contacted a locum service and found some help and went to town the thin blue line rose and fell rose and fell rose and fell how long does love last the young woman sat and watched as shed sat and watched for years i love you craig she whispered but there was no answer as thered never been an answer dappled sunlight fell over lifeless fingers beloved eyes once so full of life and laughter stayed closed the blue line rose and fell rose and fell faltered i love you craig she whispered again and blessed his face with her fingers my love how long does love last maybe for no longer than a breath hugo stood at the ward door and watched rachel she was sleeping her bright curls were tangled on the white coverlet her hand held his her face rested on his chest hugos eyes moved to the monitor and stilled the heartbeat was fast and irregular he watched hed learned so much over the last few days questions that should have been asked of rachel had been answered by the consultant hed called eight years in a coma he was a strong young man hugo with nothing but a bleed into the brain to maim him we thought he could live even longer than this theres been no end in sight but a few months ago he suffered a clot deep vein thrombosis you know its not uncommon in cases like this the bodys so inactive we thought maybe wed lose him then i think his parents and rachel said their goodbyes but he rallied and rachel went on waiting rachel ive known rachel since she was a medical student the consultant said bluntly she and craig were a great pairlovely creatures with the world at their feet since the accident its as if someones blown rachels flame out shes clever shes an extraordinary doctor but every night she sits by craigs bedside and she simplywell she simply is she must have loved him its so hard to move forward the consultant said gently without a death dottie and lewis craigs parents well after the clot they seemed to let go they pushed rachel she was making the first tentative steps and now the clots have reappeared ones sitting in his lung this is the end hugo the end of a very long story so now hugo stood at the door and watched her he simplywatched her as shed watched craig for all these years with all the love in her heart shed gone for coffee it had been one hell of a day the emotions in rachels tired mind were threatening to overwhelm her how could this happen while she was falling in lovefor the second timeher first love was deciding to slip away from this world she didnt feel guilty she couldnt how could she in a sense it was because of craig that shed fallen so heavily for hugo the love she felt for both men was mixed up intertwined because she loved hugo her love for craig couldnt die regardless of what happened to the man in the bed the man shed loved for ever but she couldnt think of hugo now he was still there in the backgrounda warmth and a joy in the back of her mind a vast tenderness that filled the cold and the emptiness that had been with her for so long but for now there was only craig his breathing had become shallow there was a pneumonia that wouldnt clear it was his time time to let go she filled her coffeemug in the relatives kitchenette at the end of the ward and walked slowly back to the small room where craig lay by himself and stopped short in the doorway hugo was there hugo was sitting in the chair beside craigs bed and he was speaking mate i have no idea whether you can hear me the jurys out on brain injuryon this dying business how much you know how much you can sense but i figuredthe way i felt i had to come i had to talk to you you have the right rachel stepped back he hadnt heard her return she leaned against the wall of the corridor and she closed her eyes and listened while hugo spoke to craig while one love spoke to another i dont know how much rachel has told you but im hugo mcinnes im a country family doctor im a widower with a kid and a dog and im thirtyfive years old and im in love with your wife and im in love with your wife it was such a bold statement that rachel drew in her breath she swallowed and she waited it sounds pretty dreadful doesnt it hugo said and paused i never thought id say that to someone i think of as a friend that im in love with your wife but maybe its because thats the way i think of you that i can say it as a friend there was a long pause then out in the corridor rachel set her coffeemug down on the floor her fingers were trembling a couple of nurses walked past and looked at her in concern but she waved them on hed come craig you and rachel have loved each other for a long time i know that hugos voice was soft but pervasive reaching where she strained to hear i know that i can see it in rachels eyes i can see how deep your love was after all this timepart of rachel is you well now ive fallen for herfallen for her in a big way maybe as hard as you ever fell but of course its different im not loving a girl straight out of school im loving a woman whos been loved beforewhos loved before whos become what she is because some guy a long time ago made her smile lit up her world took her in his arms and loved her and made her feel that anything was possible when love was around hugo hesitated as though finding difficulty in finding words the right words but somehow he kept going ive never felt like that he said at last i drifted into a marriage that was a bit of a disaster my wife died and that made me feel even more selfcontained like lovemarried lovewas something you read about in romance novels not something that changed the world only then i met rachel another silence then shes really something he whispered shes the best you and rachel must have been amazing and what rachels grown to bebecause of you you know he said his voice still soft thats why im here to tell you that youre a part of rachel and because of that i guess youll be a part of our family youll be with us youll live on rachels eyes were filling with tears she lifted a finger and wiped them away but more followed still he spoke it sounds corny doesnt it hugo was saying ruefully lives on for ever in our hearts its true though ive finally figured this love thing out the more you have the more you seem to get the more you give the more it grows around you because you loved rachel and she loved youshes reached out and shes enveloped us me my kiddid i tell you that i have a sixyearold called toby who thinks your rachel is the best thing since sliced bread rachels promised to teach him to kick a football she says you taught her that your footballliving on in my kid and theres more he was smiling rachel could hear it in his voice we have a couple of dogs diggerhes mine hes a mutt and theres penelope she belonged to some creep we met and didnt like im about to give the guy an offer he cant refuse because our familys too small we need at least two dogs we have anotherpudgewhos staying with us while someone else we know and love recovers from an injury therell be more rachel is the sort of woman wholl keep an open door to strays and im with her there and therell be kids rachel drew her breath in at that the tears dried she was smiling stupidly she was grinning the nurses passed her again and she grinned at them like a fool and they looked at her like she was demented it didnt matter what had he said how could she forget therell be kids well have babies hugo said softly at least i hope like hell well have babies i havent actually discussed this with rachel yet but hey this is the equivalent of girls talk with a bloke we can say anything in here right right well having babies before toby was born i thought one was enough but hes twisted himself round my heart like you wouldnt believe and if it was rachels kid your kid out in the corridor rachel drew in her breath once again you see theres the thing hugo said apologetically because if we have another kid then im going to be thinking that he or she is part of you any baby we have would seem your gift to us youve given me the gift of love the gift of rachel ill never forget it mate ill never forget you youll be held in our family in all honour if we have a boy then theres no doubt what hell be called im not sure how we can swing craig into a girls name rachel heard the smile in his voice maybe well just have to keep on trying until we get a boy itd be fine with me as long as its fine by you rachels eyes were closed the emotions surging around her heart were threatening to overwhelm her she leaned hard against the wallshe needed its support to stop herself falling over it seemed as if the whole world had stopped breathing the silence went on for ever and then well thats all i wanted to say hugo murmured i needed to get that off my chest youve got things to do breathing to concentrate on rachel peeped forward and saw hugos hand lift craigs and hold it two big hands mens hands intertwined it was all she could do not to cry out at the sight of it her breathing started again ragged and filled with tears and you have dying to face hugo whispered im sorry mate that you cant live im that damned sorryand if giving up rachels love would bring you back to us id do it in a minute but the guys in consultant suits are telling me it wont happen so ill say goodbye ill leave you to your parents and to rachel but know know mate that in our housein any home that im lucky enough to build and share with your wifeyoull be honoured and youll be loved for ever it was five minutes before hugo left the ward when he came out into the corridor there was no one to be seen just a mug of cold coffee lying abandoned on the polished floor chapter ten ashes to ashes dust to dust the wind blew gently across the mountain graveyard rachel stood silent as the coffin was lowered into the waiting ground lewis and dottie stood on either side of her holding her united in a grief that had been agonised and raw eight years ago but was now muteda soft and wondrous goodbye these three who still loved craig who would always love craig in the end it was good this tiny graveyard it was near to the place where craig had been borna tiny country cemetery where the wind keened around the mountains and a man could see for miles where spirits could at last be free this was a good place for craig to come to rest his grandparents his greatgrandparents a babe who would have been craigs brother if hed been born at termthey were all here his body was where it belonged and craig lived on in those who loved him rachel hugged those holding herthis man and this woman whod been by her side for so long its ok she whispered and dottie smiled through her tears it surely is dottie blinked back tears and looked across at her husbandand lewis released rachel and came around to take his wife in his arms well done lass lewis said he was a big gruff man whod loved his son with an intensity that was even greater than his passion for the football hed once played he hugged his wife but he looked over her head at rachel and now its time for you girl to move on move on your young man lewis kissed his wife gently on the top of her head and then dottie and lewis both turned and smiled at her your hugo my hugo hes here lewis said and motioned out to the road where the track led down the mountain to the tiny township below and there was hugo he was standing by his car he didnt approach the mourners he simply stood waiting hes here lewis said simply its time you went to him rachel closed her eyes and when she opened them they were smiling at her dottie and lewis and hugo there was nothing left to do here nothing at all she gave her inlaws one last hugone last smileand then she crossed the graveyard and walked into the arms of her love chapter eleven as weddings went it was a pretty good wedding toby knew about weddings he knew the bride was supposed to look gorgeous well rachel looked gorgeous brides were supposed to be white and lacy and rachel was lacy enough to be entirely satisfactory not too fussy though he decided she had no veil or train her dress was made of white silk myra had told him it was sort of bare around her shoulders with a floaty kind of skirt and bare feet it was pretty nice toby decidedfor a bride he wasnt sure about her feet though bare toes werent brides supposed to wear high heels still thatd be pretty stupid on the beach where theyd decided to hold the ceremony the ceremony was taking place on the exact spot where rachel had taught him to dropkick the exact place where the townspeople had sheltered from the fire they were waiting for the ceremony to start a couple of oldies from the nursing home were setting up a sound system they were fiddling with knobs and don was helping it seemed like they were having a bit of trouble but it didnt matter everyone was smiling and waiting as though they had all the time in the world which was fine for them but tobys football was up in the car if hed known hed have to wait he could have brought it down for a quick kick he was a fantastic dropkicker now rachel was all right at teaching him dropkicking he guessedfor a girl she was better than his dad but lewis was well lewis was ace he and dottie who refused to be called anything but lewis and dottie seemed to spend a heap of time here now they loved cowral they loved toby which was fine by toby he loved lewis and dottie right back life had expanded considerably for toby everyone he knew was on this beach such a crowd that was part of the reason theyd decided not to have the ceremony in cowrals tiny church thered be people who wouldnt fit and who could miss out myra was standing beside him toby was holding the ring and myra was a bit worried that hed drop it as if he would myra was looking a bit distracted toby thought looking at her with affectionate appraisal shed spent the morning grooming the dogs to within an inch of their lives penelope looked gorgeouswell she always did though not quite so gorgeous now that hugo and rachel and toby spent so much time on the beach but digger had come up respectably too knickers was here as well with a great red bow round his neck knickers the cocker spaniel whose fight seemed to have started this whole chain of events the black and white spaniel had recovered completely so had kim the girl was sitting hugging her knees on the sand as they waited for the ceremony to begin her dog was snuggled beside her they looked great pudge looked great too toby conceded moving on to the next dog in the pack of assorted canine guests pudge was still spending time with them even though sueellen had returned shed been back in town for a few weeks now staying in the hospital while her feet slowly healed the townsfolk were rebuilding her cottage and one of the firefighters was with her gary toby had overheard dad telling rachel that maybe this was the best thing that could have happened to sueellen rachel said gary was big and kind and besotted hed carried sueellen out of the dam with her burnt feet hed visited her in melbourne he was pushing her wheelchair now and rachel and dad thought things were looking really interesting dad said gary even liked goats there were all sorts of interesting things happening in cowral at the moment myra said the fire had started people thinking how transient life waswhatever that meant myra said it had something to do with being happy being happy now she said it also meant what was happening to aunty christine she was here with that man michael michael had come down one day soon after the fire to collect penelope hed blustered in really angry saying there was no way penelope could stay and then hed met christine christine had been in their kitchen when hed arrived shed been angry about dottie and rachel redecorating tobys bedroom so shed been in the mood to yell too anyway michael had yelled at rachel and christine had yelled at dad and then michael and christine had gone somewhere to complain some more and rachel and dad had grinned and dad had said well well wonders will never cease and it seemed penelope could stay because of the mess at the dog show she hadnt got enough championship points to keep her place in the states afghan hound hierarchy which meant michael didnt want to breed from herwhich was just fine by rachel and dad dad said any puppies of penelopes would risk having a kangaroo loose in the top paddock and rachel had giggled and agreed what was keeping them they were taking so long gee if there was just time to get his football but the oldies behind the sound system had finally succeeded the sound system crackled into action and music blared out across the beach what was the song toby knew it he knew it it was a bouncing song and everyone else in town knew it too because in seconds the whole town was singing about great balls of fire at the top of their lungs everyone was laughing as rachel walked down the sandy beach lewis held her arm as proud as any father and dottie fussed over her dress but it was hugo rachel was watching hugo who was waiting with so much love in his eyes that even toby could see it it was very satisfactory toby decided he liked his dad looking like that soppy but good then the tune ended and another started softer lovely its bachs sheep may softly graze myra whispered her eyes glistening with unshed tears because theyve come home to each other home here everyone was gazing at the shallows where once a township had sheltered to be safe and now a man and a woman were meeting each other taking fingers in hands and turning together to make these the most sacred of vows toby even forgot his football with this ring i thee wed with my body i thee worship from this day forth i now pronounce youman and wife i love you hugo whispered and rachel looked into the eyes of her second and most precious love and she whispered them back i love you she whispered hugo mcinnes i love you for ever ace thought toby it had gone off exactly as it should great vows no one could wiggle out of this one not that he thought theyd want to rachel and his dad were looking at each other with the goofiest grins matching grins any minute now yep here it was yuck the kiss if it had to be done then it had to be done he supposed but he wished theyd get on with it there was football to be played wedding cake to be eaten life to be lived right now marion lennox
