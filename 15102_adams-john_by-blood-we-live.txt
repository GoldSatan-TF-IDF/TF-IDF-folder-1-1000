greenberg by harpercollins reused with permission of curtis brown ltd introduction by john joseph adams how do we define the vampire are they barely animated corpses of a horrific visage killing indiscriminately or are they suave charismatic symbols of sexual repression in the victorian era do they die in sunlight or does it only make them itch a little or god forbid sparkle do crosses and holy symbols work at repelling them or is that just a superstition from the old times are they born or made by other vampires and anyway are these vampires created through scientific means such as genetic research or a virus or are they the magical kind can they transform into bats or are they stuck in the appearance they had when they were turned are we talking the traditional eastern european vampire or something more exotic like the tagalog mandurugo a pretty girl during the day and a winged mosquitolike monstrosity by night do they even drink blood or are they some kind of psychic vampire more directly attacking the lifeforce of their victims vampire stories come from our myths but their origins are quite diverse stories of the dead thirsting for human life have existed for thousands of years although the most common version we speak of in popular culture originated in eighteenthcentury eastern europe why is the notion of the dead risen to prey on the living such an omnipresent myth across so many cultures perhaps the myth of the vampire comes from a little bit of projection on the part of the living we have a hard time imagining our existence after death and it may be easier to imagine a life that goes on somehow but what kind of life would a corpse live our ancestors were intimately familiar with decomposition even if they didnt precisely understand it if i were dead i know i would have a certain fixation for living things and perhaps i might finding death an unagreeable state attempt to steal from the living some essence that defines the barrier between the living and death blood stands in for the notion of life easily enough now i just have to get that essence inside of me somehow hmm slurp or perhaps theres a darker more insidious reason for the pervasiveness of the vampire story is there some kernel of universal truth behind all these stories many of the tales included here will offer their own explanations for the stories and myths because if theres one thing we love almost as much as vampires themselves its exploring their true natures with the wealth of material accumulated on the nasty bloodsuckers no two authors approach the vampire myth in quite the same way the commonality of the vampires story means their tales can take place in any time and in any place the backdrop changes and the details too but always underneath it all there is blood all draw from those dark fearful histories but provide their own fresh take each like a rare blood type to be sought by connoisseurs such as yourself hear again one of our oldest and most wellknown fairy tales from a new darker perspective in neil gaimans snow glass apples and just who is the mysterious tribute in elizabeth bears house of the rising sun he seems so familiar visit the philippines in gabriela lees hunger and see the world from the eyes of a creature of decidedly noneuropean origin if that is not exotic enough for your tastes then travel into the future and beyond with ken macleods undead again is your thirst still not satisfied hunt through these pages for stories by authors such as stephen king joe hill kelley armstrong lilith saintcrow carrie vaughn harry turtledove and many more there is a feast here to be had drink deeply snow glass apples by neil gaiman neil gaiman is the bestselling author of american gods coraline and anansi boys among many other novels his most recent novel the graveyard book won the prestigious newbery medal given to great works of childrens literature in addition to his novelwriting gaiman is also the writer of the popular sandman comic book series and has done work in television and film the story of snow white is best known from the disney animated feature which is about seven lovable dwarfs with names like happy and bashful gaimans take on that tale is new but in a way its also old for long ago before disney disneyfied it the story of snow white was told to childrenchildren who would almost certainly die before reaching adulthood and whose parents couldnt afford to be so delicate about the cruelties of the world it was a tale in which a womans feet are shoved into burning hot iron shoes so that she is forced to dance until she falls down dead this story harkens back to that earlier darker tradition and then takes it a few steps farther mutilation pedophilia necrophilia this definitely isnt disney i do not know what manner of thing she is none of us do she killed her mother in the birthing but thats never enough to account for it they call me wise but i am far from wise for all that i foresaw fragments of it frozen moments caught in pools of water or in the cold glass of my mirror if i were wise i would not have tried to change what i saw if i were wise i would have killed myself before ever i encountered her before ever i caught him wise and a witch or so they said and id seen his face in my dreams and in reflections for all my life sixteen years of dreaming of him before he reined his horse by the bridge that morning and asked my name he helped me onto his high horse and we rode together to my little cottage my face buried in the gold of his hair he asked for the best of what i had a kings right it was his beard was redbronze in the morning light and i knew him not as a king for i knew nothing of kings then but as my love he took all he wanted from me the right of kings but he returned to me on the following day and on the night after that his beard so red his hair so gold his eyes the blue of a summer sky his skin tanned the gentle brown of ripe wheat his daughter was only a child no more than five years of age when i came to the palace a portrait of her dead mother hung in the princesss tower room a tall woman hair the colour of dark wood eyes nutbrown she was of a different blood to her pale daughter the girl would not eat with us i do not know where in the palace she ate i had my own chambers my husband the king he had his own rooms also when he wanted me he would send for me and i would go to him and pleasure him and take my pleasure with him one night several months after i was brought to the palace she came to my rooms she was six i was embroidering by lamplight squinting my eyes against the lamps smoke and fitful illumination when i looked up she was there princess she said nothing her eyes were black as coal black as her hair her lips were redder than blood she looked up at me and smiled her teeth seemed sharp even then in the lamplight what are you doing away from your room im hungry she said like any child it was winter when fresh food is a dream of warmth and sunlight but i had strings of whole apples cored and dried hanging from the beams of my chamber and i pulled an apple down for her here autumn is the time of drying of preserving a time of picking apples of rendering the goose fat winter is the time of hunger of snow and of death and it is the time of the midwinter feast when we rub the goosefat into the skin of a whole pig stuffed with that autumns apples then we roast it or spit it and we prepare to feast upon the crackling she took the dried apple from me and began to chew it with her sharp yellow teeth is it good she nodded i had always been scared of the little princess but at that moment i warmed to her and with my fingers gently i stroked her cheek she looked at me and smiledshe smiled but rarelythen she sank her teeth into the base of my thumb the mound of venus and she drew blood i began to shriek from pain and from surprise but she looked at me and i fell silent the little princess fastened her mouth to my hand and licked and sucked and drank when she was finished she left my chamber beneath my gaze the cut that she had made began to close to scab and to heal the next day it was an old scar i might have cut my hand with a pocketknife in my childhood i had been frozen by her owned and dominated that scared me more than the blood she had fed on after that night i locked my chamber door at dusk barring it with an oaken pole and i had the smith forge iron bars which he placed across my windows my husband my love my king sent for me less and less and when i came to him he was dizzy listless confused he could no longer make love as a man makes love and he would not permit me to pleasure him with my mouth the one time i tried he started violently and began to weep i pulled my mouth away and held him tightly until the sobbing had stopped and he slept like a child i ran my fingers across his skin as he slept it was covered in a multitude of ancient scars but i could recall no scars from the days of our courtship save one on his side where a boar had gored him when he was a youth soon he was a shadow of the man i had met and loved by the bridge his bones showed blue and white beneath his skin i was with him at the last his hands were cold as stone his eyes milkyblue his hair and beard faded and lustreless and limp he died unshriven his skin nipped and pocked from head to toe with tiny old scars he weighed near to nothing the ground was frozen hard and we could dig no grave for him so we made a cairn of rocks and stones above his body as a memorial only for there was little enough of him left to protect from the hunger of the beasts and the birds so i was queen and i was foolish and youngeighteen summers had come and gone since first i saw daylightand i did not do what i would do now if it were today i would have her heart cut out true but then i would have her head and arms and legs cut off i would have them disembowel her and then i would watch in the town square as the hangman heated the fire to whiteheat with bellows watch unblinking as he consigned each part of her to the fire i would have archers around the square who would shoot any bird or animal who came close to the flames any raven or dog or hawk or rat and i would not close my eyes until the princess was ash and a gentle wind could scatter her like snow i did not do this thing and we pay for our mistakes they say i was fooled that it was not her heart that it was the heart of an animala stag perhaps or a boar they say that and they are wrong and some say but it is her lie not mine that i was given the heart and that i ate it lies and halftruths fall like snow covering the things that i remember the things i saw a landscape unrecognisable after a snowfall that is what she has made of my life there were scars on my love her fathers thighs and on his ballockpouch and on his male member when he died i did not go with them they took her in the day while she slept and was at her weakest they took her to the heart of the forest and there they opened her blouse and they cut out her heart and they left her dead in a gully for the forest to swallow the forest is a dark place the border to many kingdoms no one would be foolish enough to claim jurisdiction over it outlaws live in the forest robbers live in the forest and so do wolves you can ride through the forest for a dozen days and never see a soul but there are eyes upon you the entire time they brought me her heart i know it was hersno sows heart or does would have continued to beat and pulse after it had been cut out as that one did i took it to my chamber i did not eat it i hung it from the beams above my bed placed it on a length of twine that i strung with rowanberries orangered as a robins breast and with bulbs of garlic outside the snow fell covering the footprints of my huntsmen covering her tiny body in the forest where it lay i had the smith remove the iron bars from my windows and i would spend some time in my room each afternoon through the short winter days gazing out over the forest until darkness fell there were as i have already stated people in the forest they would come out some of them for the spring fair a greedy feral dangerous people some were stunteddwarfs and midgets and hunchbacks others had the huge teeth and vacant gazes of idiots some had fingers like flippers or crabclaws they would creep out of the forest each year for the spring fair held when the snows had melted as a young lass i had worked at the fair and they had scared me then the forest folk i told fortunes for the fairgoers scrying in a pool of still water and later when i was older in a disc of polished glass its back all silvereda gift from a merchant whose straying horse i had seen in a pool of ink the stallholders at the fair were afraid of the forest folk they would nail their wares to the bare boards of their stallsslabs of gingerbread or leather belts were nailed with great iron nails to the wood if their wares were not nailed they said the forest folk would take them and run away chewing on the stolen gingerbread flailing about them with the belts the forest folk had money though a coin here another there sometimes stained green by time or the earth the face on the coin unknown to even the oldest of us also they had things to trade and thus the fair continued serving the outcasts and the dwarfs serving the robbers if they were circumspect who preyed on the rare travellers from lands beyond the forest or on gypsies or on the deer this was robbery in the eyes of the law the deer were the queens the years passed by slowly and my people claimed that i ruled them with wisdom the heart still hung above by bed pulsing gently in the night if there were any who mourned the child i saw no evidence she was a thing of terror back then and they believed themselves well rid of her spring fair followed spring fair five of them each sadder poorer shoddier than the one before fewer of the forest folk came out of the forest to buy those who did seemed subdued and listless the stallholders stopped nailing their wares to the boards of their stalls and by the fifth year but a handful of folk came from the foresta fearful huddle of little hairy men and no one else the lord of the fair and his page came to me when the fair was done i had known him slightly before i was queen i do not come to you as my queen he said i said nothing i listened i come to you because you are wise he continued when you were a child you found a strayed foal by staring into a pool of ink when you were a maiden you found a lost infant who had wandered far from her mother by staring into that mirror of yours you know secrets and you can seek out things hidden my queen he asked what is taking the forest folk next year there will be no spring fair the travellers from other kingdoms have grown scarce and few the folk of the forest are almost gone another year like the last and we shall all starve i commanded my maidservant to bring me my lookingglass it was a simple thing a silverbacked glass disc which i kept wrapped in a doeskin in a chest in my chamber they brought it to me then and i gazed into it she was twelve and she was no longer a little child her skin was still pale her eyes and hair coalblack her lips as red as blood she wore the clothes she had worn when she left the castle for the last timethe blouse the skirtalthough they were much letout much mended over them she wore a leather cloak and instead of boots she had leather bags tied with thongs over her tiny feet she was standing in the forest beside a tree as i watched in the eye of my mind i saw her edge and step and flitter and pad from tree to tree like an animal a bat or a wolf she was following someone he was a monk he wore sackcloth and his feet were bare and scabbed and hard his beard and tonsure were of a length overgrown unshaven she watched him from behind the trees eventually he paused for the night and began to make a fire laying twigs down breaking up a robins nest as kindling he had a tinderbox in his robe and he knocked the flint against the steel until the sparks caught the tinder and the fire flamed there had been two eggs in the nest he had found and these he ate raw they cannot have been much of a meal for so big a man he sat there in the firelight and she came out from her hiding place she crouched down on the other side of the fire and stared at him he grinned as if it were a long time since he had seen another human and beckoned her over to him she stood up and walked around the fire and waited an armslength away he pulled in his robe until he found a coina tiny copper pennyand tossed it to her she caught it and nodded and went to him he pulled at the rope around his waist and his robe swung open his body was as hairy as a bears she pushed him back onto the moss one hand crept spiderlike through the tangle of hair until it closed on his manhood the other hand traced a circle on his left nipple he closed his eyes and fumbled one huge hand under her skirt she lowered her mouth to the nipple she had been teasing her smooth skin white on the furry brown body of him she sank her teeth deep into his breast his eyes opened then they closed again and she drank she straddled him and she fed as she did so a thin blackish liquid began to dribble from between her legs do you know what is keeping the travellers from our town what is happening to the forest people asked the head of the fair i covered the mirror in doeskin and told him that i would personally take it upon myself to make the forest safe once more i had to although she terrified me i was the queen a foolish woman would have gone then into the forest and tried to capture the creature but i had been foolish once and had no wish to be so a second time i spent time with old books for i could read a little i spent time with the gypsy women who passed through our country across the mountains to the south rather than cross the forest to the north and the west i prepared myself and obtained those things i would need and when the first snows began to fall then i was ready naked i was and alone in the highest tower of the palace a place open to the sky the winds chilled my body goosepimples crept across my arms and thighs and breasts i carried a silver basin and a basket in which i had placed a silver knife a silver pin some tongs a grey robe and three green apples i put them down and stood there unclothed on the tower humble before the night sky and the wind had any man seen me standing there i would have had his eyes but there was noone to spy clouds scudded across the sky hiding and uncovering the waning moon i took the silver knife and slashed my left armonce twice three times the blood dripped into the basin scarlet seeming black in the moonlight i added the powder from the vial that hung around my neck it was a brown dust made of dried herbs and the skin of a particular toad and from certain other things it thickened the blood while preventing it from clotting i took the three apples one by one and pricked their skins gently with my silver pin then i placed the apples in the silver bowl and let them sit there while the first tiny flakes of snow of the year fell slowly onto my skin and onto the apples and onto the blood when dawn began to brighten the sky i covered myself with the grey cloak and took the red apples from the silver bowl one by one lifting each into my basket with silver tongs taking care not to touch it there was nothing left of my blood or of the brown powder in the silver bowl save nothing save a black residue like a verdigris on the inside i buried the bowl in the earth then i cast a glamour on the apples as once years before by a bridge i had cast a glamour on myself that they were beyond any doubt the most wonderful apples in the world and the crimson blush of their skins was the warm colour of fresh blood i pulled the hood of my cloak low over my face and i took ribbons and pretty hair ornaments with me placed them above the apples in the reed basket and i walked alone into the forest until i came to her dwelling a high sandstone cliff laced with deep caves going back a way into the rock wall there were trees and boulders around the cliffface and i walked quietly and gently from tree to tree without disturbing a twig or a fallen leaf eventually i found my place to hide and i waited and i watched after some hours a clutch of dwarfs crawled out of the cavefrontugly misshapen hairy little men the old inhabitants of this country you saw them seldom now they vanished into the wood and none of them spied me though one of them stopped to piss against the rock i hid behind i waited no more came out i went to the cave entrance and hallooed into it in a cracked old voice the scar on my mound of venus throbbed and pulsed as she came towards me out of the darkness naked and alone she was thirteen years of age my stepdaughter and nothing marred the perfect whiteness of her skin save for the livid scar on her left breast where her heart had been cut from her long since the insides of her thighs were stained with wet black filth she peered at me hidden as i was in my cloak she looked at me hungrily ribbons goodwife i croaked pretty ribbons for your hair she smiled and beckoned to me a tug the scar on my hand was pulling me towards her i did what i had planned to do but i did it more readily than i had planned i dropped my basket and screeched like the bloodless old pedlar woman i was pretending to be and i ran my grey cloak was the colour of the forest and i was fast she did not catch me i made my way back to the palace i did not see it let us imagine though the girl returning frustrated and hungry to her cave and finding my fallen basket on the ground what did she do i like to think she played first with the ribbons twined them into her raven hair looped them around her pale neck or her tiny waist and then curious she moved the cloth to see what else was in the basket and she saw the red red apples they smelled like fresh apples of course and they also smelled of blood and she was hungry i imagine her picking up an apple pressing it against her cheek feeling the cold smoothness of it against her skin and she opened her mouth and bit deep into it by the time i reached my chambers the heart that hung from the roofbeam with the apples and hams and the dried sausages had ceased to beat it hung there quietly without motion or life and i felt safe once more that winter the snows were high and deep and were late melting we were all hungry come the spring the spring fair was slightly improved that year the forest folk were few but they were there and there were travellers from the lands beyond the forest i saw the little hairy men of the forestcave buying and bargaining for pieces of glass and lumps of crystal and of quartzrock they paid for the glass with silver coinsthe spoils of my stepdaughters depredations i had no doubt when it got about what they were buying townsfolk rushed back to their homes came back with their lucky crystals and in a few cases with whole sheets of glass i thought briefly about having them killed but i did not as long as the heart hung silent and immobile and cold from the beam of my chamber i was safe and so were the folk of the forest and thus eventually the folk of the town my twentyfifth year came and my stepdaughter had eaten the poisoned fruit two winters back when the prince came to my palace he was tall very tall with cold green eyes and the swarthy skin of those from beyond the mountains he rode with a small retinue large enough to defend him small enough that another monarchmyself for instancewould not view him as a potential threat i was practical i thought of the alliance of our lands thought of the kingdom running from the forests all the way south to the sea i thought of my goldenhaired bearded love dead these eight years and in the night i went to the princes room i am no innocent although my late husband who was once my king was truly my first lover no matter what they say at first the prince seemed excited he bade me remove my shift and made me stand in front of the opened window far from the fire until my skin was chilled stonecold then he asked me to lie upon my back with my hands folded across my breasts my eyes wide openbut staring only at the beams above he told me not to move and to breathe as little as possible he implored me to say nothing he spread my legs apart it was then that he entered me as he began to thrust inside me i felt my hips raise felt myself begin to match him grind for grind push for push i moaned i could not help myself his manhood slid out of me i reached out and touched it a tiny slippery thing please he said softly you must neither move nor speak just lie there on the stones so cold and so fair i tried but he had lost whatever force it was that had made him virile and some short while later i left the princes room his curses and tears still resounding in my ears he left early the next morning with all his men and they rode off into the forest i imagine his loins now as he rode a knot of frustration at the base of his manhood i imagine his pale lips pressed so tightly together then i imagine his little troupe riding through the forest finally coming upon the glassandcrystal cairn of my stepdaughter so pale so cold naked beneath the glass and little more than a girl and dead in my fancy i can almost feel the sudden hardness of his manhood inside his britches envision the lust that took him then the prayers he muttered beneath his breath in thanks for his good fortune i imagine him negotiating with the little hairy menoffering them gold and spices for the lovely corpse under the crystal mound did they take his gold willingly or did they look up to see his men on their horses with their sharp swords and their spears and realize they had no alternative i do not know i was not there i was not scrying i can only imagine hands pulling off the lumps of glass and quartz from her cold body hands gently caressing her cold cheek moving her cold arm rejoicing to find the corpse still fresh and pliable did he take her there in front of them all or did he have her carried to a secluded nook before he mounted her i cannot say did he shake the apple from her throat or did her eyes slowly open as he pounded into her cold body did her mouth open those red lips part those sharp yellow teeth close on his swarthy neck as the blood which is the life trickled down her throat washing down and away the lump of apple my own my poison i imagine i do not know this i do know i was woken in the night by her heart pulsing and beating once more salt blood dripped onto my face from above i sat up my hand burned and pounded as if i had hit the base of my thumb with a rock there was a hammering on the door i felt afraid but i am a queen and i would not show fear i opened the door first his men walked in to my chamber and stood around me with their sharp swords and their long spears then he came in and he spat in my face finally she walked into my chamber as she had when i was first a queen and she was a child of six she had not changed not really she pulled down the twine on which her heart was hanging she pulled off the dried rowanberries one by one pulled off the garlic bulbnow a dried thing after all these years then she took up her own her pumping hearta small thing no larger than that of a nannygoat or a shebearas it brimmed and pumped its blood into her hand her fingernails must have been as sharp as glass she opened her breast with them running them over the purple scar her chest gaped suddenly open and bloodless she licked her heart once as the blood ran over her hands and she pushed the heart deep into her breast i saw her do it i saw her close the flesh of her breast once more i saw the purple scar begin to fade her prince looked briefly concerned but he put his arm around her nonetheless and they stood side by side and they waited and she stayed cold and the bloom of death remained on her lips and his lust was not diminished in any way they told me they would marry and the kingdoms would indeed be joined they told me that i would be with them on their wedding day it is starting to get hot in here they have told the people bad things about me a little truth to add savour to the dish but mixed with many lies i was bound and kept in a tiny stone cell beneath the palace and i remained there through the autumn today they fetched me out of the cell they stripped the rags from me and washed the filth from me and then they shaved my head and my loins and they rubbed my skin with goose grease the snow was falling as they carried metwo men at each hand two men at each legutterly exposed and spreadeagled and cold through the midwinter crowds and brought me to this kiln my stepdaughter stood there with her prince she watched me in my indignity but she said nothing as they thrust me inside jeering and chaffing as they did so i saw one snowflake land upon her white cheek and remain there without melting they closed the kilndoor behind me it is getting hotter in here and outside they are singing and cheering and banging on the sides of the kiln she was not laughing or jeering or talking she did not sneer at me or turn away she looked at me though and for a moment i saw myself reflected in her eyes i will not scream i will not give them that satisfaction they will have my body but my soul and my story are my own and will die with me the goosegrease begins to melt and glisten upon my skin i shall make no sound at all i shall think no more on this i shall think instead of the snowflake on her cheek i think of her hair as black as coal her lips as red as blood her skin snowwhite the master of rampling gate by

entirely different sort of house this house is beautiful serene here everyone is smiling so take off your coat and have a drink sit by the fire stay a while rampling gate it was so real to us in those old pictures rising like a fairytale castle out of its own dark wood a wilderness of gables and chimneys between those two immense towers grey stone walls mantled in ivy mullioned windows reflecting the drifting clouds but why had father never gone there why had he never taken us and why on his deathbed in those grim months after mothers passing did he tell my brother richard that rampling gate must be torn down stone by stone rampling gate that had always belonged to ramplings rampling gate which had stood for over four hundred years we were in awe of the task that lay before us and painfully confused richard had just finished four years at oxford two whirlwind social seasons in london had proven me something of a shy success i still preferred scribbling poems and stories in the quiet of my room to dancing the night away but id kept that a good secret and though we were not spoilt children we had enjoyed the best of everything our parents could give but now the carefree years were ended we had to be careful and wise and our hearts ached as sitting together in fathers booklined study we looked at the old pictures of rampling gate before the small coal fire destroy it richard as soon as i am gone father had said i just dont understand it julie richard confessed as he filled the little crystal glass in my hand with sherry its the genuine article that old place a real fourteenthcentury manor house in excellent repair a mrs blessington born and reared in the village of rampling has apparently managed it all these years she was there when uncle baxter died and he was the last rampling to live under that roof do you remember i asked the year that father took all these pictures down and put them away i shall never forget that richard said how could i it was so peculiar and so unlike father too he sat back drawing slowly on his pipe there had been that bizarre incident in victoria station when he had seen that young man yes exactly i said snuggling back into the velvet chair and looking into the tiny dancing flames in the grate you remember how upset father was yet it was a simple incident in fact nothing really happened at all we couldnt have been more than six and eight at the time and we had gone to the station with father to say farewell to friends through the window of a train father saw a young man who startled and upset him i could remember the face clearly to this day remarkably handsome with a narrow nose and welldrawn eyebrows and a mop of lustrous brown hair the large black eyes had regarded father with the saddest expression as father had drawn us back and hurried us away and the argument that night between father and mother richard said thoughtfully i remember that we listened on the landing and we were so afraid and father said he wasnt content to be master of rampling gate anymore he had come to london and revealed himself an unspeakable horror that is what he called it that he should be so bold yes exactly and when mother tried to quiet him when she suggested that he was imagining things he went into a perfect rage but who could it have been the master of rampling gate if father wasnt the master uncle baxter was long dead by then i just dont know what to make of it richard murmured and theres nothing in fathers papers to explain any of it at all he examined the most recent of the pictures a lovely tinted engraving that showed the house perfectly reflected in the azure water of its lake but i tell you the worst part of it julie he said shaking his head is that weve never even seen the house ourselves i glanced at him and our eyes met in a moment of confusion that quickly passed to something else i leant forward he did not say we couldnt go there did he richard i demanded that we couldnt visit the house before it was destroyed no of course he didnt richard said the smile broke over his face easily after all dont we owe it to the others julie uncle baxter who spent the last of his fortune restoring the house even this old mrs blessington that has kept it all these years and what about the village itself i added quickly what will it mean to these people to see rampling gate destroyed of course we must go and see the place ourselves then its settled ill write to mrs blessington immediately ill tell her were coming and that we can not say how long we will stay oh richard that would be too marvelous i couldnt keep from hugging him though it flustered him and he pulled on his pipe just exactly the way father would have done make it at least a fortnight i said i want so to know the place especially if but it was too sad to think of fathers admonition and much more fun to think of the journey itself id pack my manuscripts for who knew maybe in that melancholy and exquisite setting id find exactly the inspiration i required it was almost a wicked exhilaration i felt breaking the gloom that had hung over us since the day that father was laid to rest it is the right thing to do isnt it richard i asked uncertainly a little disconcerted by how much i wanted to go there was some illicit pleasure in it going to rampling gate at last unspeakable horror i repeated fathers words with a little grimace what did it all mean i thought again of the strange almost exquisite young man id glimpsed in that railway carriage gazing at us all with that wistful expression on his lean face he had worn a black greatcoat with a red woollen cravat and i could remember how pale he had been against that dash of red like bone china his complexion had been strange to remember it so vividly even to the tilt of his head and that long luxuriant brown hair but he had been a blaze against that window and i realized now that in those few remarkable moments he had created for me an ideal of masculine beauty which i had never questioned since but father had been so angry in those moments i felt an unmistakable pang of guilt of course its the right thing julie richard answered he at the desk already writing the letters and i was at a loss to understand the full measure of my thoughts it was late afternoon when the wretched old trap carried us up the gentle slope from the little railway station and we had at last our first real look at that magnificent house i think i was holding my breath the sky had paled to a deep rose hue beyond a bank of softly gilded clouds and the last rays of the sun struck the uppermost panes of the leaded windows and filled them with solid gold oh but its too majestic i whispered too like a great cathedral and to think that it belongs to us richard gave me the smallest kiss on the cheek i felt mad suddenly and eager somehow to be laid waste by it through fear or enchantment i could not say perhaps a sublime mingling of both i wanted with all my heart to jump down and draw near on foot letting those towers grow larger and larger above me but our old horse had picked up speed and the little line of stiff starched servants had broken to come forward the old withered housekeeper with her arms out the men to take down the boxes and the trunks richard and i were spirited into the great hall by the tiny nimble figure of mrs blessington our footfalls echoing loudly on the marble tile our eyes dazzled by the dusty shafts of light that fell on the long oak table and its heavily carved chairs the sombre heavy tapestries that stirred ever so slightly against the soaring walls it is an enchanted place i cried unable to contain myself oh richard we are home mrs blessington laughed gaily her dry hand closing tightly on mine her small blue eyes regarded me with the most curiously vacant expression despite her smile ramplings at rampling gate again i can not tell you what a joyful day this is for me and yes my dear she said as if reading my mind that very second i am and have been for many years quite blind but if you spy a thing out of place in this house youre to tell me at once for it would be the exception i assure you and not the rule and such warmth emanated from her wrinkled little face that i adored her at once we found our bedchambers the very finest in the house well aired with snowwhite linen and fires blazing cozily to dry out the damp that never left the thick walls the small diamond pane windows opened on a glorious view of the water and the oaks that enclosed it and the few scattered lights that marked the village beyond that night we laughed like children as we supped at the great oak table our candles giving only a feeble light and afterwards it was a fierce battle of pocket billiards in the game room which had been uncle baxters last renovation and a little too much brandy i fear it was just before i went to bed that i asked mrs blessington if there had been anyone in this house since uncle baxter died that had been the year almost fifty years ago and she was already housekeeper then no my dear she said quickly fluffing the feather pillows your father came that year as you know but he stayed for no more than a month or two and then went on home there was never a young man after that i pushed but in truth i had little appetite for anything to disturb the happiness i felt how i loved the spartan cleanliness of this bedchamber the stone walls bare of paper or ornament the high luster of the walnutpaneled bed a young man she gave an easy almost hearty laugh as with unerring certainty of her surroundings she lifted the poker and stirred the fire what a strange thing for you to ask i sat silent for a moment looking in the mirror as i took the last of the pins from my hair it fell down heavy and warm around my shoulders it felt good like a cloak under which i could hide but she turned as if sensing some uneasiness in me and drew near why do you say a young man miss she asked slowly tentatively her fingers examined the long tresses that lay over my shoulders she took the brush from my hands i felt perfectly foolish telling her the story but i managed a simplified version somehow our meeting unexpectedly a devilishly handsome young man whom my father in anger had later called the master of rampling gate handsome was he she asked as she brushed out the tangles in my hair gently it seemed she hung upon every word as i described him again there were no intruders in this house then mrs blessington i asked no mysteries to be solved she gave the sweetest laugh oh no darling this house is the safest place in the world she said quickly it is a happy house no intruder would dare to trouble rampling gate nothing in fact troubled the serenity of the days that followed the smoke and noise of london and our fathers dying words became a dream what was real were our long walks together through the overgrown gardens our trips in the little skiff to and fro across the lake we had tea under the hot glass of the empty conservatory and early evening found us on our way upstairs with the best of the books from uncle baxters library to read by candlelight in the privacy of our rooms and all our discreet inquiries in the village met with more or less the same reply the villagers loved the house and carried no old or disquieting tales repeatedly in fact we were told that rampling was the most contented hamlet in all england that no one daredmrs blessingtons very wordsto make trouble here its our guardian angel that old house said the old woman at the bookshop where richard stopped for the london papers was there ever the town of rampling without the house called rampling gate how were we going to tell them of fathers edict how were we going to remind ourselves but we spoke not one word about the proposed disaster and richard wrote to his firm to say that we should not be back in london till fall he was finding a wealth of classical material in the old volumes that had belonged to uncle baxter and i had set up my writing in the little study that opened off the library which i had all to myself never had i known such peace and quiet it seemed the atmosphere of rampling gate permeated my simplest written descriptions and wove its way richly into the plots and characters i created the monday after our arrival i had finished my first short story and went off to the village on foot to boldly post it to the editors of blackwoods magazine it was a glorious morning and i took my time as i came back on foot what had disturbed our father so about this lovely corner of england i wondered what had so darkened his last hours that he laid upon this spot his curse my heart opened to this unearthly stillness to an undeniable grandeur that caused me utterly to forget myself there were times here when i felt i was a disembodied intellect drifting through a fathomless silence up and down garden paths and stone corridors that had witnessed too much to take cognizance of one small and fragile young woman who in random moments actually talked aloud to the suits of armour around her to the broken statues in the garden the fountain cherubs who had not had water to pour from their conches for years and years but was there in this loveliness some malignant force that was eluding us still some untold story to explain all unspeakable horror in my minds eye i saw that young man and the strangest sensation crept over me that some enrichment of the picture had taken place in my memory or imagination in the recent past perhaps in a dream i had reinvented him given a ruddy glow to his lips and his cheeks perhaps in my recreation for mrs blessington i had allowed him to raise his hand to that red cravat and had seen the fingers long and delicate and suggestive of a musicians hand it was all very much on my mind when i entered the house again soundlessly and saw richard in his favorite leather wing chair by the fire the air was warm coming through the open garden doors and yet the blaze was cheerful made the vast room with its towering shelves of leatherbound volumes appear inviting and almost small sit down richard said gravely scarcely giving me a glance i want to read you something right now he held a long narrow ledger in his hands this was uncle baxters he said and at first i thought it was only an account book he kept during the renovations but ive found some actual diary entries made in the last weeks of his life theyre hasty almost indecipherable but ive managed to make them out well do read them to me i said but i felt a little tug of fear i didnt want to know anything terrible about this place if we could have remained here forever but that was out of the question to be sure now listen to this richard said turning the page carefully fifth of may he is here i am sure of it he is come back again and several days later he thinks this is his house he does and he would drink my wine and smoke my cigars if only he could he reads my books and my papers and i will not stand for it i have given orders that everything is to be locked and finally the last entry written the morning before he died weary weary unto death and he is no small cause of my weariness last night i beheld him with my own eyes he stood in this very room he moves and speaks exactly as a mortal man and dares tell me his secrets and he a demon wretch with the face of a seraph and i a mere mortal how am i to bear with him good lord i whispered slowly i rose from the chair where i had settled and standing behind him read the page for myself it was the scrawl the writing the very last notation in the book i knew that uncle baxters heart had given out he had not died by violence but peacefully enough in this very room with his prayer book in his hand could it be the very same person father spoke of that night richard asked in spite of the sun pouring through the open doors i experienced a violent chill for the first time i felt wary of this house wary of our boldness in coming here heedful of our fathers words but that was years before richard i said and what could this mean this talk of a supernatural being surely the man was mad it was no spirit i saw in that railway carriage i sank down into the chair opposite and tried to quiet the beating of my heart julie richard said gently shutting the ledger mrs blessington has lived here contentedly for years there are six servants asleep every night in the north wing surely there is nothing to all of this it isnt very much fun though is it i said timidly not at all like swapping ghost stories the way we used to do and peopling the dark with imaginary beings and laughing at friends at school who were afraid all my life he said his eyes fixing me steadily ive heard tales of spooks and spirits some imagined some supposedly true and almost invariably there is some mention of the house in question feeling haunted of having an atmosphere to it that fills one with foreboding some sense of menace or alarm yes i know and there is no such poisonous atmosphere here at all on the contrary ive never been more at ease in my life he shoved his hand into his pocket to extract the inevitable match to light his pipe which had gone out as a matter of fact julie i dont know how in the world im going to comply with fathers last wish to tear down this place i nodded sympathetically the very same thing had been on my mind since wed arrived even now i felt so comfortable natural quite safe i was wishing suddenly irrationally that he had not found the entries in uncle baxters book i should talk to mrs blessington again i said almost crossly i mean quite seriously but i have julie he said i asked her about it all this morning when i first made the discovery and she only laughed she swears shes never seen anything unusual here and that theres no one left alive in the village who can tell tales of this place she said again how glad she was that wed come home to rampling gate i dont think she has an inkling we mean to destroy the house oh it would destroy her heart if she did never seen anything unusual i asked that is what she said but what strange words for her to use richard when she can not see at all but he had not heard me he had laid the ledger aside and risen slowly almost sluggishly and he was wandering out of the double doors into the little garden and was looking over the high hedge at the oaks that bent their heavy elbowed limbs almost to the surface of the lake there wasnt a sound at this early hour of the day save the soft rustle of the leaves in the moving air the cry now and then of a distant bird maybe its gone julie richard said over his shoulder his voice carrying clearly in the quiet if it was ever here maybe there is nothing any longer to frighten anyone at all you dont suppose you could endure the winter in this house do you i suppose youd want to be in london again by then he seemed quite small against the towering trees the sky broken into small gleaming fragments by the canopy of foliage that gently filtered the light rampling gate had him and i understood perfectly because it also had me i could very well endure the winter here no matter how bleak or cold i never wanted to go home and the immediacy of the mystery only dimmed my sense of everything and every place else after a long moment i rose and went out into the garden and placed my hand gently on richards arm i know this much julie he said just as if we had been talking to each other all the while i swore to father that i would do as he asked and it is tearing me apart either way it will be on my conscience forever obliterating this house or going against my own father and the charge he laid down to me with his dying breath we must seek help richard the advice of our lawyers the advice of fathers clergymen you must write to them and explain the whole thing father was feverish when he gave the order if we could lay it out before them they would help us decide it was three oclock when i opened my eyes but i had been awake for a long time i had heard the dim chimes of the clock below hour by hour and i felt not fear lying here alone in the dark but something else some vague and relentless agitation some sense of emptiness and need that caused me finally to rise from my bed what was required to dissolve this tension i wondered i stared at the simplest things in the shadows the little arras that hung over the fireplace with its slim princes and princesses lost in fading fiber and thread the portrait of an elizabethan ancestor gazing with one almondshaped eye from his small frame what was this house really merely a place or a state of mind what was it doing to my soul why didnt the entries in uncle baxters book send us flying back to london why had we stayed so late in the great hall together after supper speaking not a single word i felt overwhelmed suddenly and yet shut out of some great and dazzling secret and wasnt that the very word that uncle baxter had used conscious only of an unbearable restlessness i pulled on my woollen wrapper buttoning the lace collar and tying the sash and putting on my slippers i went out into the hall the moon fell full on the oak stairway and on the deeply recessed door to richards room on tiptoe i approached and peering in saw the bed was empty the covers completely undisturbed so he was off on his own tonight the same as i oh if only he had come to me asked me to go with him i turned and made my way soundlessly down the long stairs the great hall gaped like a cavern before me the moonlight here and there touching upon a pair of crossed swords or a mounted shield but far beyond the great hall in the alcove just outside the library i saw unmistakably a flickering light and a breeze moved briskly through the room carrying with it the sound and the scent of a wood fire i shuddered with relief richard was there we could talk or perhaps we could go exploring together guarding our fragile candle flames behind cupped fingers as we went from room to room a sense of wellbeing pervaded me and quieted me and yet the dark distance between us seemed endless and i was desperate to cross it hurrying suddenly past the long supper table with its massive candlesticks and finally into the alcove before the library doors yes richard was there he sat with his eyes closed dozing against the inside of the leather wing chair the breeze from the garden blowing the fragile flames of the candles on the stone mantel and on the table at his side i was about to go to him about to shut the doors and kiss him gently and ask did he not want to go up to bed when quite abruptly i saw in the corner of my eye that there was someone else in the room in the far left corner at the desk stood another figure looking down at the clutter of richards papers his pale hands resting on the wood i knew that it could not be so i knew that i must be dreaming that nothing in this room least of all this figure could be real for it was the same young man i had seen fifteen years ago in the railway carriage and not a single aspect of that taut young face had been changed there was the very same hair thick and lustrous and only carelessly combed as it hung to the thick collar of his black coat and the skin so pale it was almost luminous in the shadows and those dark eyes looking up suddenly and fixing me with the most curious expression as i almost screamed we stared at one another across the dark vista of that room i stranded in the doorway he visibly and undeniably shaken that i had caught him unawares my heart stopped and in a split second he moved towards me closed the gap between us towering over me those slender white fingers gently closing on my arms julie he whispered in a voice so low it seemed my own thoughts speaking to me but this was no dream he was real he was holding to me and the scream had broken loose from me deafening uncontrollable and echoing from the four walls i saw richard rising from the chair i was alone clutching to the door frame i staggered forward and then again in a moment of perfect clarity i saw the young intruder saw him standing in the garden looking back over his shoulder and then he was gone i could not stop screaming i could not stop even as richard held me and pleaded with me and sat me down in the chair and i was still crying when mrs blessington finally came she got a glass of cordial for me at once as richard begged me once more to tell what i had seen but you know who it was i said to richard almost hysterically it was he the young man from the train only he wore a frockcoat years out of fashion and his silk tie was open at his throat richard he was reading your papers turning them over reading them in the pitch dark all right richard said gesturing with his hand up for calm he was standing at the desk and there was no light there so you could not see him well richard it was he dont you understand he touched me he held my arms i looked imploringly to mrs blessington who was shaking her head her little eyes like blue beads in the light he called me julie i whispered he knows my name i rose snatching up the candle and all but pushing richard out of the way went to the desk oh dear god i said dont you see whats happened its your letters to dr partridge and mrs sellers about tearing down the house mrs blessington gave a little cry and put her hand to her cheek she looked like a withered child in her nightcap as she collapsed into the straightbacked chair by the door surely you dont believe it was the same man julie after all these years but he had not changed richard not in the smallest detail there is no mistake richard it was he i tell you the very same oh dear dear mrs blessington whispered what will he do if you try to tear it down what will he do now what will who do richard asked carefully narrowing his eyes he took the candle from me and approached her i was staring at her only half realizing what i had heard so you know who he is i whispered julie stop it richard said but her face had tightened gone blank and her eyes had become distant and small you knew he was here i insisted you must tell us at once with an effort she climbed to her feet there is nothing in this house to hurt you she said nor any of us she turned spurning richard as he tried to help her and wandered into the dark hallway alone youve no need of me here any longer she said softly and if you should tear down this house built by your forefathers then you should do it without need of me oh but we dont mean to do it mrs blessington i insisted but she was making her way through the gallery back towards the north wing go after her richard you heard what she said she knows who he is ive had quite enough of this tonight richard said almost angrily both of us should go up to bed by the light of day we will dissect this entire matter and search this house now come but he should be told shouldnt he i demanded told what of whom do you speak told that we will not tear down this house i said clearly loudly listening to the echo of my own voice the next day was indeed the most trying since we had come it took the better part of the morning to convince mrs blessington that we had no intention of tearing down rampling gate richard posted his letters and resolved that we should do nothing until help came and together we commenced a search of the house but darkness found us only half finished having covered the south tower and the south wing and the main portion of the house itself there remained still the north tower in a dreadful state of disrepair and some rooms beneath the ground which in former times might have served as dungeons and were now sealed off and there were closets and private stairways everywhere that we had scarce looked into and at times we lost all track of where precisely we had been but it was also quite clear by supper time that richard was in a state of strain and exasperation and that he did not believe that i had seen anyone in the study at all he was further convinced that uncle baxter had been mad before he died or else his ravings were a code for some mundane happening that had him extraordinarily overwrought but i knew what i had seen and as the day progressed i became ever more quiet and withdrawn a silence had fallen between me and mrs blessington and i understood only too well the anger id heard in my fathers voice on that long ago night when we had come home from victoria station and my mother had accused him of imagining things yet what obsessed me more than anything else was the gentle countenance of the mysterious man i had glimpsed the dark almost innocent eyes that had fixed on me for one moment before i had screamed strange that mrs blessington is not afraid of him i said in a low distracted voice no longer caring if richard heard me and that no one here seems in fear of him at all the strangest fancies were coming to me the careless words of the villagers were running through my head you would be wise to do one very important thing before you retire i said leave out in writing a note to the effect that you do not intend to tear down the house julie you have created an impossible dilemma richard demanded you insist we reassure this apparition that the house will not be destroyed when in fact you verify the existence of the very creature that drove our father to say what he did oh i wish i had never come here i burst out suddenly then we should go both of us and decide this matter at home no thats just it i could never go without knowing his secrets the demon wretch i could never go on living without knowing now anger must be an excellent antidote to fear for surely something worked to alleviate my natural alarm i did not undress that night nor even take off my shoes but rather sat in that dark hollow bedroom gazing at the small square of diamondpaned window until i heard all of the house fall quiet richards door at last closed there came those distant echoing booms that meant other bolts had been put in place and when the grandfather clock in the great hall chimed the hour of eleven rampling gate was as usual fast asleep i listened for my brothers step in the hall and when i did not hear him stir from his room i wondered at it that curiosity would not impel him to come to me to say that we must go together to discover the truth it was just as well i did not want him to be with me and i felt a dark exultation as i imagined myself going out of the room and down the stairs as i had the night before i should wait one more hour however to be certain i should let the night reach its pitch twelve the witching hour my heart was beating too fast at the thought of it and dreamily i recollected the face i had seen the voice that had said my name ah why did it seem in retrospect so intimate that we had known each other spoken together that it was someone i recognized in the pit of my soul what is your name i believe i whispered aloud and then a spasm of fear startled me would i have the courage to go in search of him to open the door to him was i losing my mind closing my eyes i rested my head against the high back of the damask chair what was more empty than this rural night what was more sweet i opened my eyes i had been half dreaming or talking to myself trying to explain to father why it was necessary that we comprehend the reason ourselves and i realized quite fully realizedi think before i was even awakethat he was standing by the bed the door was open and he was standing there dressed exactly as he had been the night before and his dark eyes were riveted on me with that same obvious curiosity his mouth just a little slack like that of a school boy and he was holding to the bedpost almost idly with his right hand why he was lost in contemplating me he did not seem to know that i was looking at him but when i sat forward he raised his finger as if to quiet me and gave a little nod of his head ah it is you i whispered yes he said in the softest most unobtrusive voice but we had been talking to each other hadnt we i had been asking him questions no telling him things and i felt suddenly i was losing my equilibrium or slipping back into a dream no rather i had all but caught the fragment of some dream from the past that rush of atmosphere that can engulf one at any moment of the day following when something evokes the universe that absorbed one utterly in sleep i mean i heard our voices for an instant almost in argument and i saw father in his top hat and black overcoat rushing alone through the streets of the west end peering into one door after another and then rising from the marbletop table in the dim smoky music hall you your face yes go back julie it was fathers voice to penetrate the soul of it i insisted picking up the lost thread but did my lips move to understand what it is that frightened him enraged him he said tear it down you must never never cant do that his face was stricken like that of a schoolboy about to cry no absolutely we dont want to either of us you know it and you are not a spirit i looked at his mudspattered boots the faintest smear of dust on that perfect white cheek a spirit he asked almost mournfully almost bitterly would that i were mesmerized i watched him come towards me and the room darkened and i felt his cool silken hands on my face i had risen i was standing before him and i looked up into his eyes i heard my own heartbeat i heard it as i had the night before right at the moment i had screamed dear god i was talking to him he was in my room and i was talking to him and i was in his arms real absolutely real i whispered and a low zinging sensation coursed through me so that i had to steady myself against the bed he was peering at me as if trying to comprehend something terribly important to him and he didnt respond his lips did have a ruddy look to them a soft look for all his handsomeness as if he had never been kissed and a slight dizziness had come over me a slight confusion in which i was not at all sure that he was even there oh but i am he said softly i felt his breath against my cheek and it was almost sweet i am here and you are with me julie yes my eyes were closing uncle baxter sat hunched over his desk and i could hear the furious scratch of his pen demon wretch he said to the night air coming in the open doors no i said father turned in the door of the music hall and cried my name love me julie came that voice in my ear i felt his lips against my neck only a little kiss julie no harm and the core of my being that secret place where all desires and all commandments are nurtured opened to him without a struggle or a sound i would have fallen if he had not held me my arms closed about him my hands slipping into the soft silken mass of his hair i was floating and there was as there had always been at rampling gate an endless peace it was rampling gate i felt around me it was that timeless and impenetrable soul that had opened itself at last a power within me of enormous ken to see as a god sees and take the depth of things as nimbly as the outward eyes can size and shape pervade yes i whispered aloud those words from keats those words to cease upon the midnight without pain no in a violent instant we had parted he drawing back as surely as i i went reeling across the bedroom floor and caught hold of the frame of the window and rested my forehead against the stone wall for a long moment i stood with my eyes closed there was a tingling pain in my throat that was almost pleasurable where his lips had touched me a delicious throbbing that would not stop then i turned and i saw all the room clearly the bed the fireplace the chair and he stood still exactly as id left him and there was the most appalling distress in his face what have they done to me he whispered have they played the cruelest trick of all something of menace unspeakable menace i whispered something ancient julie something that defies understanding something that can and will go on but why what are you i touched that pulsing pain with the tips of my fingers and looking down at them gasped and you suffer so and you are so seemingly innocent and it is as if you can love his face was rent as if by a violent conflict within and he turned to go with my whole will i stood fast not to follow him not to beg him to turn back but he did turn bewildered struggling and then bent upon his purpose as he reached for my hand come with me he said he drew me to him ever so gently and slipping his arm around me guided me to the door through the long upstairs corridor we passed hurriedly and through a small wooden doorway to a screw stairs that i had never seen before i soon realized we were ascending the north tower of the house the ruined portion of the structure that richard and i had not investigated before through one tiny window after another i saw the gently rolling landscape moving out from the forest that surrounded us and the small cluster of dim lights that marked the village of rampling and the pale streak of white that was the london road up and up we climbed until we had reached the topmost chamber and this he opened with an iron key he held back the door for me to enter and i found myself in a spacious room whose high narrow windows contained no glass a flood of moonlight revealed the most curious mixture of furnishings and objects the clutter that suggests an attic and a sort of den there was a writing table a great shelf of books soft leather chairs and scores of old yellowed and curling maps and framed pictures affixed to the walls candles were everywhere stuck in the bare stone niches or to the tables and the shelves here and there a barrel served as a table right alongside the finest old elizabethan chair wax had dripped over everything it seemed and in the very midst of the clutter lay rumpled copies of the most recent papers the mercure de paris the london times there was no place for sleeping in this room and when i thought of that where he must lie when he went to rest a shudder passed over me and i felt quite vividly his lips touching my throat again and i felt the sudden urge to cry but he was holding me in his arms he was kissing my cheeks and my lips again ever so softly and then he guided me to a chair he lighted the candles about us one by one i shuddered my eyes watering slightly in the light i saw more unusual objects telescopes and magnifying glasses and a violin in its open case and a handful of gleaming and exquisitely shaped sea shells there were jewels lying about and a black silk top hat and a walking stick and a bouquet of withered flowers dry as straw and daguerreotypes and tintypes in their little velvet cases and opened books but i was too distracted now by the sight of him in the light the gloss of his large black eyes and the gleam of his hair not even in the railway station had i seen him so clearly as i did now amid the radiance of the candles he broke my heart and yet he looked at me as though i were the feast for his eyes and he said my name again and i felt the blood rush to my face but there seemed a great break suddenly in the passage of time i had been thinking yes what are you how long have you existed and i felt dizzy again i realized that i had risen and i was standing beside him at the window and he was turning me to look down and the countryside below had unaccountably changed the lights of rampling had been subtracted from the darkness that lay like a vapor over the land a great wood far older and denser than the forest of rampling gate shrouded the hills and i was afraid suddenly as if i were slipping into a maelstrom from which i could never of my own will return there was that sense of us talking together talking and talking in low agitated voices and i was saying that i should not give in bear witness that is all i ask of you and there was in me some dim certainty that by knowledge alone i should be fatally changed it was the reading of a forbidden book the chanting of a forbidden charm no only what was he whispered and then even the shape of the land itself eluded me and the very room had lost its substance as if a soundless wind of terrific force had entered this place and was blowing it apart we were riding in a carriage through the night we had long long ago left the tower and it was late afternoon and the sky was the color of blood and we rode into a forest whose trees were so high and so thick that scarcely any sun at all broke through to the soft leafstrewn ground we had no time to linger in this magical place we had come to the open country to the small patches of tilled earth that surrounded the ancient village of knorwood with its gabled roofs and its tiny crooked streets we saw the walls of the monastery of knorwood and the little church with the bell chiming vespers under the lowering sky a great bustling life resided in knorwood a thousand hearts beat in knorwood a thousand voices gave forth their common prayer but far beyond the village on the rise above the forest stood the rounded tower of a truly ancient castle and to that ruined castle no more than a shell of itself anymore as darkness fell in earnest we rode through its empty chambers we roamed impetuous children the horse and the road quite forgotten and to the lord of the castle a gaunt and whiteskinned creature standing before the roaring fire of the roofless hall we came he turned and fixed us with his narrow and glittering eyes a dead thing he was i understood but he carried within himself a priceless magic and my young companion my innocent young man passed by me into the lords arms i saw the kiss i saw the young man grow pale and struggle to turn away it was as i had done this very night beyond this dream in my own bedchamber and from the lord he retreated clutching to the sharp pain in his throat i understood i knew but the castle was dissolving as surely as anything in this dream might dissolve and we were in some damp and close place the stench was unbearable to me it was that most terrible of all stenches the stench of death and i heard my steps on the cobblestones and i reached to steady myself against the wall the tiny square was deserted the doors and windows gaped open to the vagrant wind up one side and down the other of the crooked street i saw the marks on the houses and i knew what the marks meant the black death had come to the village of knorwood the black death had laid it waste and in a moment of suffocating horror i realized that no one not a single person was left alive but this was not quite right there was someone walking in fits and starts up the narrow alleyway staggering he was almost falling as he pushed in one door after another and at last came to a hot stinking place where a child screamed on the floor mother and father lay dead in the bed and the great fat cat of the household unharmed played with the screaming infant whose eyes bulged from its tiny sunken face stop it i heard myself gasp i knew that i was holding my head with both hands stop it stop it please i was screaming and my screams would surely pierce the vision and this small crude little room should collapse around me and i should rouse the household of rampling gate to me but i did not the young man turned and stared at me and in the close stinking room i could not see his face but i knew it was he my companion and i could smell his fever and his sickness and the stink of the dying infant and see the sleek gleaming body of the cat as it pawed at the childs outstretched hand stop it youve lost control of it i screamed surely with all my strength but the infant screamed louder make it stop i cannot he whispered it goes on forever it will never stop and with a great piercing shriek i kicked at the cat and sent it flying out of the filthy room overturning the milk pail as it went jetting like a witchs familiar over the stones blanched and feverish the sweat soaking his crude jerkin my companion took me by the hand he forced me back out of the house and away from the crying child and into the street death in the parlour death in the bedroom death in the cloister death before the high altar death in the open fields it seemed the judgment of god that a thousand souls had died in the village of knorwood i was sobbing begging to be releasedit seemed the very end of creation itself and at last night came down over the dead village and he was alive still stumbling up the slopes through the forest towards that rounded tower where the lord stood with his hand on the stone frame of the broken window waiting for him to come dont go i begged him i ran alongside him crying but he didnt hear try as i might i could not affect these things the lord stood over him smiling almost sadly as he watched him fall watched the chest heave with its last breaths finally the lips moved calling out for salvation when it was damnation the lord offered when it was damnation that the lord would give yes damned then but living breathing the young man cried rising in a last spasmodic movement and the lord who had remained still until that instant bent to drink the kiss again the lethal kiss the blood drawn out of the dying body and then the lord lifting the heavy head of the young man to take the blood back again from the body of the lord himself i was screaming again do not do not drink he turned and looked at me his face was now so perfectly the visage of death that i couldnt believe there was animation left in him yet he asked what would you do would you go back to knorwood would you open those doors one after another would you ring the bell in the empty church and if you did would the dead rise he didnt wait for my answer and i had none now to give he had turned again to the lord who waited for him locked his innocent mouth to that vein that pulsed with every semblance of life beneath the lords cold and translucent flesh and the blood jetted into the young body vanquishing in one great burst the fever and the sickness that had wracked it driving it out with the mortal life he stood now in the hall of the lord alone immortality was his and the blood thirst he would need to sustain it and that thirst i could feel with my whole soul he stared at the broken walls around him at the fire licking the blackened stones of the giant fireplace at the night sky over the broken roof throwing out its endless net of stars and each and every thing was transfigured in his vision and in my visionthe vision he gave now to meto the exquisite essence of itself a wordless and eternal voice spoke from the starry veil of heaven it sang in the wind that rushed through the broken timbers it sighed in the flames that ate the sooted stones of the hearth it was the fathomless rhythm of the universe that played beneath every surface as the last living creaturethat tiny childfeel silent in the village below a soft wind sifted and scattered the soil from the newturned furrows in the empty fields the rain fell from the black and endless sky years and years passed and all that had been knorwood melted into the very earth the forest sent out its silent sentinels and mighty trunks rose where there had been huts and houses where there had been monastery walls finally nothing of knorwood remained not the little cemetery not the little church not even the name of knorwood lived still in the world and it seemed the horror beyond all horrors that no one anymore should know of a thousand souls who had lived and died in that small and insignificant village that not anywhere in the great archives in which all history is recorded should a mention of that town remain yet one being remained who knew one being who had witnessed and stood now looking down upon the very spot where his mortal life had ended he who had scrambled up on his hands and knees from the pit of hell that had been that disaster it was the young man who stood beside me the master of rampling gate and all through the walls of his old house were the stones of the ruined castle and all through the ceilings and floors the branches of those ancient trees what was solid and majestic here and safe within the minds of those who slept tonight in the village of rampling was only the most fragile citadel against horror the house to which he clung now a great sorrow swept over me somewhere in the drift of images i had relinquished myself lost all sense of the point in space from which i saw and in a great rush of lights and noise i was enlivened now and made whole as i had been when we rode together through the forest only it was into the world of now this hour that we passed we were flying it seemed through the rural darkness along the railway towards the london where the nighttime city burst like an enormous bubble in a shower of laughter and motion and glaring light he was walking with me under the gas lamps his face all but shimmering with that same dark innocence that same irresistible warmth and it seemed we were holding tight to one another in the very midst of a crowd and the crowd was a living thing a writhing thing and everywhere there came a dark rich aroma from it the aroma of fresh blood women in white fur and gentlemen in opera capes swept into the brightly lighted doors of the theatre the blare of the music hall inundated us then faded away only a thin soprano voice was left singing a high plaintive song i was in his arms and his lips were covering mine and there came that dull zinging sensation again that great uncontrollable opening within myself thirst and the promise of satiation measured only by the intensity of that thirst up stairs we fled together into highceilinged bedrooms papered in red damask where the loveliest women reclined on brass bedsteads and the aroma was so strong now i could not bear it and before me they offered themselves they opened their arms drink he whispered yes drink and i felt the warmth filling me charging me blurring my vision until we broke again free and light and invisible it seemed as we moved over the rooftops and down again through raindrenched streets but the rain did not touch us the falling snow did not chill us we had within ourselves a great and indissoluble heat and together in the carriage we talked to each other in low exuberant rushes of language we were lovers we were constant we were immortal we were as enduring as rampling gate i tried to speak i tried to end the spell i felt his arms around me and i knew we were in the tower room together and some terrible miscalculation had been made do not leave me he whispered dont you understand what i am offering you i have told you everything and all the rest is but the weariness the fever and the fret those old words from the poem kiss me julie open to me against your will i will not take you again i heard my own scream my hands were on his cool white skin his lips were gentle yet hungry his eyes yielding and ever young father turned in the raindrenched london street and cried out julie i saw richard lost in the crowd as if searching for some one his hat shadowing his dark eyes his face haggard old old i moved away i was free and i was crying softly and we were in this strange and cluttered tower room he stood against the backdrop of the window against the distant drift of pale clouds the candlelight glimmered in his eyes immense and sad and wise they seemed and oh yes innocent as i have said again and again i revealed myself to them he said yes i told my secret in rage or bitterness i know not which i made them my dark coconspirators and always i won they could not move against me and neither will you but they would triumph still for they torment me now with their fairest flower dont turn away from me julie you are mine julie as rampling gate is mine let me gather the flower to my heart nights of argument but finally richard had come round he would sign over to me his share of rampling gate and i should absolutely refuse to allow the place torn down there would be nothing he could do then to obey fathers command i had given him the legal impediment he needed and of course i should leave the house to him and his children it should always be in rampling hands a clever solution it seemed to me as father had not told me to destroy the place and i had no scruples in the matter now at all and what remained was for him to take me to the little train station and see me off for london and not worry about me going home to mayfair on my own you stay here as long as you wish and do not worry i said i felt more tenderly towards him than i could ever express you knew as soon as you set foot in the place that father was all wrong uncle baxter put it in his mind undoubtedly and mrs blessington has always been right there is nothing to harm there richard stay and work or study as you please the great black engine was roaring past us the carriages slowing to a stop must go now darling kiss me i said but what came over you julie what convinced you so quickly weve been through all richard i said what matters is that we are all happy my dear and we held each other close i waved until i couldnt see him anymore the flickering lamps of the town were lost in the deep lavender light of the early evening and the dark hulk of rampling gate appeared for one uncertain moment like the ghost of itself on the nearby rise i sat back and closed my eyes then i opened them slowly savouring this moment for which i had waited too long he was smiling seated there as he had been all along in the far corner of the leather seat opposite and now he rose with a swift almost delicate movement and sat beside me and enfolded me in his arms its five hours to london he whispered in my ear i can wait i said feeling the thirst like a fever as i held tight to him feeling his lips against my eyelids and my hair i want to hunt the london streets tonight i confessed a little shyly but i saw only approbation in his eyes beautiful julie my julie he whispered youll love the house in mayfair i said yes he said and when richard finally tires of rampling gate we shall go home under st peters by harry turtledove harry turtledovewho is often referred to as the master of alternate historyis the hugo awardwinning author of more than novels and short stories his most recent novels are the man with the iron heart after the downfall give me back my legions and hitlers war in addition to his sf fantasy and alternate history works hes also published several straight historical novels under the name h n turteltaub turtledove obtained a phd in byzantine history from ucla in turtledove says that part of the appeal of vampire fiction is that we humans like to think were at the top of the food chain but what if were not he said vampire stories also often involve immortalityas this one doesand sexwhich this one doesntand both of those are abiding themes to which vampires give a different slant this story takes place in st peters basilica in vatican city one of christianitys holiest sitesand tells the tale of the vampire living underneath it its a difficult story to talk about without giving away the good parts let it suffice to say that its ohso blasphemous say three hail marys and an our father after reading incense in the air even down here behind the doors frankincense and myrrh the scents he remembered from days gone by days when he could face the sun somber latin chants he recognized them even now though the chanters didnt pronounce latin the way the legionaries had back in those bright days and the hunger always the hunger would he finally feed it had been a long time such a very long time he could hardly remember the last time hed had to wait so long he wouldnt die of starvation he couldnt die of starvation his laughter sent wild echoes chasing one another in his chamber no he couldnt very well die not when he was already dead but he could wish himself extinguished he could and he did every waking momentand every moment from now to forever or the suns next kiss was a waking moment much good wishing did him he waited and he remembered what else did he have to do nothing they made sure of it his memory since his death and resurrection was perfect he could bring back any day any instant with absolute clarity absolute accuracy much good that did him too he preferred recalling the days before the days when he was only a man was he ever only a man he knew how many would say no maybe they were right but he remembered himself as man and man alone but his memories of those days blurred and shiftedas a mans wouldso he might have been wrong maybe he was something else something different right from the start hed packed a lot into thirtyodd years refugee carpenter reformer rebel convict he could still hear the thud of the hammer that drove in the spikes he could still hear his own screams as those spikes pierced him hed never thought down deep in his heart that it would come to thatwhich only just went to show how much he knew hed never thought down deep in his heart that it would come to this either which again just went to show how much he knew if he were everything people said he was would he have let it come to this he could examine that portion of hisnot of his life no but of his existence with the perfect recall so very distant from mortality he could examine it and he had time and again try as he would he couldnt see anything he might have done differently and even if he did see something like that it was much too late to matter now habemus papam when you heard the latin acclamation when you knew it was for you was there any feeling to match that any in all the world people said a new orthodox patriarch once fell over dead with joy at learning he was chosen that had never happened on this trunk of the tree that split in but seeing how it might wasnt hard a lifetime of hopes of dreams of work of prayer of patience and then at last you had to try to fill the fishermans sandals they will remember me forever was the first thought that went through his mind for a man who by the nature of his office had better not have children it was the only kind of immortality he would ever get a cardinal could run things behind the scenes for years could be the greatest power in the oldest continually functioning institution in the worldand five minutes after he was dead even the scholars in the curia would have trouble coming up with his name but once you heard habemus papam he would have to deal with italians for the rest of his life he would have to smell garlic for the rest of his life part of him had wanted to retire when his friend his patron passed at last to go back north of the alps to rusticate that was only part of him though the rest he had been running things behind the scenes for years getting his chance to come out and do it in the open to be noted for it to be noticed for it was sweet and his fellow cardinals hadnt waited long before they chose him either what greater honor was there than the approval of your own more than anyone else they understood what this meant some of them wanted it too most of them wanted it no doubt but most of the ones who did also understood they had no chance of gaining it coming out of the shadows becoming the public face of the church wasnt easy for a man whod spent so long in the background but hed shown what he could do when he was chosen to eulogize his predecessor he wrote the farewell in his own tongue then translated it into italian that wasnt the churchly lingua franca latin had been but still no one who wasnt fluent in it could reasonably hope to occupy peters seat if he spoke slowly if he showed italian wasnt his native tonguewell so what it gave translators around the world the chance to stay up with him and delivering the eulogy meant people around the world saw him and learned who he was when the college of cardinals convened to deliberate that had to be in the back of some minds he wouldnt have a reign to match the one that had gone before not unless he lived well past the century mark but achilles said glory mattered more than length of days and john xxiii showed you didnt need a long reign to make your mark vatican ii cleared away centuries of deadwood from the church even the latin of the mass went well there was reason behind that who spoke latin nowadays this wasnt the roman empire any more even if cardinals vestments came straight out of byzantine court regalia but change always spawned a cry for more change female priests married priests homosexuality contraception abortion when ever the world shouted for all those things the world though was a weather vane turning now this way now that changeable as the breeze the church was supposed to stand for what was right whatever that turned out to be if changes come theyll come because of me if they dont that will also be because of me the new holy father thought which way more than a billion people go depends on me why anyone would want a job like this made him scratch his head that he wanted it himself or that most of him did was true no matter how strange it seemed so much to decide to do so little time a tavern in the late afternoon they were all worried even the publican was worried he hadnt looked for such a big crowd so late in the day they were all eating and drinking and talking they showed no signs of getting up and leaving if they kept hanging around he would have to light the lamps and olive oil wasnt cheap but they kept digging their right hands into the bowl of chickpeas and mashed garlic hed set out and eating more bread and calling for wine one of them had already drunk himself into quite a state looking back from down here understanding why was easy hindsight was always easy foresight theyd called it prophecy in those days had he had the gift his human memory wasnt sure but then his human memory wasnt sure about a lot of things that was what made trying to trace the different threads twisting through the fabric so eternally fascinating he wished he hadnt used that word even to himself he kept hoping it wasnt so hed been down here a long long long time but not forever he wouldnt stay down here forever either he couldnt could he he was so hungry the tavern hed been looking back at the tavern again he wasnt hungry then hed eaten his fill and hed drunk plenty of wine wine red as blood what did wine taste like he remembered it was sweet and he remembered it could mount to your head almost the way any food did these days but the taste the taste now was a memory of a memory of a memoryand thus so blurred it was no memory at all hed lost the taste of wine just as hed lost the tastes of bread and chickpeas garlic though garlic he still knew he remembered the sensation of chewing of reducing the resistive mass in his mouthwhatever it tasted liketo something that easily went down the throat he almost smiled there in the darkness he hadnt needed to worry about that in a while where was he so easy to let your thoughts wander down here what else did they have to do oh yes the tavern the wine the feel of the cup in his hands the smell of the stuff wafting upwards nearly as intoxicating as but if his thoughts wandered there they wouldnt come back he was so hungry the tavern then the wine the cup the last cup he remembered saying and i tell you i wont drink from the fruit of the vine any more till that day when i drink it anew with you in my fathers kingdom theyd nodded he wasnt sure how much attention they paid or whether they even took him seriously how long could anybody go without drinking wine what would you use instead water milk you were asking for a flux of the bowels if you did but hed kept that promise hed kept it longer than he dreamt he would longer than he dreamt he could he was still keeping it now after all these years soon though soon he would have something else to drink if you paid attention to the television you would think he was the first pope ever installed his predecessor had had a long reign so long that none of the reporters remembered the last succession for them it was as if nothing that came before this moment really happened one innocentan american of courseeven remarked the new pope is named after a previous one he was not a mirthful man but he had to laugh at that what did the fool think the roman numeral after his name stood for he wasnt named after just one previous pope he was named after fifteen one of these days he would have to try to figure out what to do about the united sates so many people there thought they could stay good catholics while turning their backs on any teachings they didnt happen to like if they did that how were they any different from protestants how could he tell them they couldnt do that without turning them into protestants well he didnt have to decide right away deo gratias so much had happened this first day of his new reign if this wasnt enough to overwhelm a man nothing ever would be pretty soon he thought he would get around to actually being pope pretty soon yes but not quite yet as if to prove as much a tubby little italiannot even a priest but a deaconcame up to him and waited to be noticed the new pope had seen the fellow around for as long as he could remember actually he didnt really remember seeing him aroundthe deacon was about as nondescript as any man ever born but the odor of strong garlicky sausages always clung to him when it became obvious the man wouldnt go away the pope sighed a small discreet sigh what is it giuseppe please to excuse me holy father but theres one more thing each new keeper of the keys has to do the deacon said ah now the pope made a small interested noise i thought i knew all the rituals he was in fact sure he knew all the ritualsor he had been sure till this moment but deacon giuseppe shook his head he seemed most certain and most selfassured no sir only the popes knowthe popes and the men of the order of the pipistrelle the what the new pope had also been sure he was acquainted with all the orders religious and honorary and both commingled in vatican city the order of the pipistrelle giuseppe repeated patiently we are small and we are quiet but we are the oldest order in this place we go back to the very beginning of things close enough pride rang in his voice is that so the pope carefully held his tone neutral any order with a foundation date the least bit uncertain claimed to be much older than anyone outside its ranks would have wanted to believe even so hed never heard of an order with pretensions like that back to the beginning of things i suppose you came here with peter thats right your holiness we handled his baggage deacon giuseppe spoke altogether without irony he either believed what he was saying or could have gone on the stage with his acting did my friend my predecessor do whatever this is the pope asked yes sir he did and all the others before him if you dont do this you arent really the pope you dont really understand what being the pope means freemasonry we have a freemasonry of our own who would have thought that freemasonry of course wasnt nearly so old as its members claimed either but that wasor might bebeside the point all right the pope said this must be complete whatever it is deacon giuseppe raised his right hand in what wasnt a formal salute but certainly suggested one grazie holy father mille grazie he said i knew you were a thorough man he nodded seeming pleased hed found the right word and it was the right word the pope also nodded acknowledging its justice deacon giuseppe took his elbow and steered him down the long nave of st peters away from the papal altar and toward the main entrance past the haloed statue of st peter and the altar of st jerome they went past the chapel of the sacrament and on the popes right the tombs of innocent viii and pius x not far from the main entrance a red porphyry disk was set into the floor marking the spot where in the old st peters that preceded berninis magnificent building charlemagne was crowned roman emperor now to the popes surprise crimson silk draperies surrounded the disk discreetly walling it off from view another surprise ive never seen these draperies before they belong to the order deacon giuseppe said as if that explained everything to him it must have but he had to see it didnt explain everything to his companion for he added we dont use them very often will you step through with me the pope did once inside the bloodred billowing silk he got surprised yet again i didnt know that disk came up you werent supposed to holy father deacon giuseppe said youd think wed do this over in the sacred grotto it would make more sense what with the popes tombs thereeven peters they say maybe it was like that years and years ago but it hasnt been for a long long time here we do it and here itll stay amen he crossed himself theres a stairway going down the pope said how many more amazements did the vatican hold yes thats where were going you first holy father giuseppe said be careful its narrow and theres no bannister air fresh air even through doors closed and locked and warded against him he sensed it his nostrils twitched he knew what fresh air meant sure as a hungry dog knew a bell meant it was time to salivate when he was a man hed lived out in the fresh air hed taken it for granted hed lived in it and much too soon hed died in it crucifixion was a roman punishment not a jewish one jews killed even animals as mercifully as they could when they had to kill men the sword or the axe got it over with fast the romans wanted criminals to suffer and be seen to suffer they thought that resulted in fewer criminals the number of men they crucified made the argument seem dubious but they didnt care as for the suffering they were right about that the pain was the worst thing hed ever known it unmanned him so that he cried out on the cross then he swooned swooned so deeply the watching soldiers and people thought he was dead he dimly remembered them taking him down from the crosspulling out the spikes that nailed him to it was a fresh torment and one more followed it for one of the roman soldiers bit him then hard enough to tear his flesh open but not hard enough evidently to force a sound past his dry throat and parched lips how the rest of the romans laughed that was the last purely human memory he had of their mirth at their friends savagery when he woke to memory again he was changed no there was one thing more theyd called the biter dacicus at the time it didnt mean anything to a man almost dead but he never forgot it even though it was meaningless so maybeprobablythe change in him had begun that soon when he did think about it again for a while he believed it was only a name then he learned better dacicus meant the dacian the man from dacia not one more human in ten thousand these days could tell you where dacia layhad lain but its borders matched those of what they called romania these days or near enough and people told stories about romania he had no way to know how many of those stories were true some like sliding under doors surely werent or he would have considering what had happened to him though he had no reason to doubt others and now he smelled fresh air soon very soon how long has this been here the pope asked i never dreamt anything like this lay under st peters the stone spiral stairway certainly seemed ancient deacon giuseppe lit it however not with a flickering oliveoil lamp but with a large powerful flashlight that he pulled from one of the large deep pockets of his black vestments your holiness as far as i know its been here since peters day giuseppe answered seriously i told you before the order of the pipistrelle is in charge of what peter brought in his baggage and that was the pope asked a trifle impatiently i dont want to talk about it now youll see soon enough but im a keeper of the keys too metal jingled as the deacon pulled a key ring from a pocket the pope stopped and looked back over his shoulder giuseppe obligingly shone the flashlight beam on the keys they were as ordinary as modern as boring as the flashlight itself the pope had hoped for massive ancient ones rusty or green with verdigris no such luck at the bottom of the stairway a short corridor led to a formidable steel door the popes slippers scuffed through the dust of ages motes he kicked up danced in the flashlight beam who last came here he asked in a low voice why your blessed predecessor your holiness deacon giuseppe replied oh and mine of course he opened the door with the key which worked smoothly as he held it for the pope he went on this used to be woodwell naturally thats what they had in the old days they replaced it after the last war better safe than sorry you know safe from what sorry because of what as the pope asked the questions the door swung behind the deacon and him with what sounded like a most definitive and final click a large and fancy crucifix was mounted on the inner surface another such door seemingly identical lay a short distance ahead with peters baggage of course giuseppe answered will you stop playing games with me the pope was a proud and touchy man im not the deacon crossed himself again before god your holiness im not he seemed at least as touchy and at least as proud as the pope himself and then out of the same pocket from which hed taken the flashlight he produced a long phallic chunk of sausage and bit off a goodsized chunk the odors of pepper and garlic assailed the popes nostrils and the incongruity assailed his strong sense of fitness even more he knocked the sausage out of giuseppes hand and into the dust stop that he cried to his amazement the italian picked up the sausage brushed off most of whatever clung to it and went on eating the popes gorge rose meaning no disrespect holy father giuseppe mumbled with his mouth full but i need this its part of the ritual god will strike me dead if i lie not may god strike me dead if i lie the deacon said god will strike me dead the pope relentlessly precise noted the distinction he pointed to the door ahead what is on the other side of that he asked a sudden and startling quaver in his voice an empty chamber deacon giuseppe replied and beyond that something i hope think on the last supper holy father the deacon answered which didnt help he thought of his last supper which didnt help not now not with his raging hunger it was too long ago they were out there he could hear them out there talking in that language that wasnt latin but sounded a little like it he could see the dancing light under the door any light at all stung his eyes but he didnt mind and he could smell them mans flesh was the most delicious odor in the world but when he smelled it up close it was always mingled with the other smell the hateful smell his keepers knew their business all right even without garlic the cross on the farthest door would have held him captive herehad held him captive here hed tasted the irony of that times uncounted this is my blood hed said this is my flesh irony there too oh yes nowsoonhe hoped to taste something sweeter than irony where would he have been without dacicus not herehe was sure of that anyhow he supposed his body would have stayed in the tomb where they laid it and his spirit would have soared up to the heavens where it belonged did he even have a spirit any more or was he all body all hunger all appetite he didnt know he didnt much care either it had been too long dacicus must have been new when he bit him new or stubborn in believing he remained a man after being bitten rolling away the stone was easy going about with his friends was easy toofor a little while but then the sun began to pain him and then the hunger began taking refuge in the daytime began to feel natural so did slaking the hunger when he could soon now soon why the last supper the pope demanded because we reenact itin a manner of speakingdown here deacon giuseppe replied this is the mystery of the order of the pipistrelle even the orthodox even the copts would be jealous if they knew they have relics of the son we have the son the pope stared at him our lords body lies here he whispered hoarsely his body he was not taken up as we preach he wasa man was that the mystery ator rather here belowthe heart of the church the mystery being that there was no mystery that since the days of the roman empire prelates had lived a lie his stern faith stumbled no his friend his predecessor would never have told him about this it would have been too cruel but the little round sausagemunching deacon shook his head its not so simple your holiness ill show you he had another key on the ring he used it to unlock the last door and he shone the flashlight into the chamber beyond light a spear of light it stabbed into his eyes stabbed straight through his eyes and into his brain how long had he gone without as long as hed gone without food but sustenance he cherished he craved he yearned for light was the pain that accompanied it the pain he couldnt avoid or evade he got used to it moment by agonizing moment so long here in the silent dark he had to remember how to see yes there was the blackrobed one the untouchable inedible one the stinker who carried his lightthrower like a sword what had happened to torches and oil lamps like the last several of his predecessors this blackrobe had one of these unnatural things instead well i am an unnatural thing myself these days he thought and his lips skinned back from his teeth in a smile both wryly amused and hungry so very hungry now the pope crossed himself violently who is this he gasped what is this but even as he gasped he found himself fearing he knew the answer the short scrawny young man impaled on the flashlight beam looked alarmingly like so many byzantine images of the second person of the trinity shaggy dark brown hair and beard long oval face long nose the wounds to his hands and feet and the one in his side looked fresh even if they were bloodless and there was another wound a small one on his neck none of the art showed that one none of the texts spoke of it seeing it made the pope think of films hed watched as a boy and when he did his hand shaped the sign of the cross once more it had no effect on the younglooking man who stood there blinking he hadnt thought it would not really no he said it cannot be it must not be he noticed one thing more even when deacon giuseppe shone the flashlight full in the younglooking mans face the pupils did not contract did not could not with each passing second it seemed more likely deacon giuseppes somber nod told him it wasnt just likelyit was true well holy father now you know said the deacon from the order of the pipistrelle behold the son of man behold the resurrection behold the greatest secret of the church but why how not even the pope as organized and coherent as any man now living could speak clearly in the presence ofthat oncethathappened to him he couldnt stand the sun after a while deacon giuseppe told the tale as if it had been told many times before and so no doubt it had when peter came to rome he came too in the saints baggageunder the sign of the cross of course to make sure nothing untoward happened hes been here ever since we keep him we take care of him great god the pope tried to make sense of his whirling thoughts no wonder you told me to think of the last supper he forced some iron into his spine a longdead feldwebel whod drilled him during the last round of global madness would have been proud of how well his lessons stuck all right ive seen him god help me i have take me up to the light again not quite yet your holiness the deacon replied we finish the ritual first eh we finish the ritual deacon giuseppe repeated with sad patience seeing him does not suffice it is his first supper in a very long time your predecessor being so young when he was chosen remember the text your blood is his wine your flesh his bread he said something else in a language that wasnt italian the pope a formidable scholar recognized it as aramaic he even understood it suppers ready the last meal had been juicier that was his first thought but he wasnt complaining not after so long he drank and drank his own communion with the world of the living he would have drunk the life right out of him if not for the blackrobed one be careful that one urged still speaking the only language he really knew well remember what happened time before last he remembered hed got greedy hed drunk too much the man died not long after coming down here to meet him then hed fed againtwice in such a little while they didnt let him do anything like that the next time however much he wanted to and that one lasted and lastedlasted so long he began to fear hed made the man into one like himself he hadnt done that very often he wondered whether dacicus intended to do that with himto him he never had the chance to ask did dacicus still wander the world not alive any more but still quick one of these centuries if dacicus did they might meet again you never could tell when he didnt let go fast enough the blackrobed one breathed full in his face that horrible poisonous stink made him back away in a hurry he hadnt got enough it could never be enough not if he drank the world dry but it was ever so much better than nothing before he fed he was empty he couldnt end barring stake sunlight or perhaps a surfeit of garlic but he could wish he would he couldand he had no more fresh vitality flowed through him he wasnt happyhe didnt think he could be happybut he felt as lively as a dead thing could my god the new pope said not in aramaic not in latin not even in italian his hand went to the wound on his neck the bleeding had already stopped he shuddered he didnt know what hed expected when deacon giuseppe took him down below st peters but not this never this are you all right your holiness real concern rode the deacons voice ithink so and the pope had to think about it before he answered too good deacon giuseppe held out a hand automatically the pope clasped it and in so doing felt how cold his own flesh had gone the round little nondescript italian went on cant let him have too much we did that not so long ago and it didnt work out well the new pope understood him altogether too well then he touched the wound again a fresh horror filling him yes he remembered the films too well am i going to turn into one of those he pointed toward the central figure of his faith who was licking blood off his lips with a tongue that seemed longer and more prehensile than a mere mans had any business being we dont think so giuseppe said matteroffactly just to be sure though the papal undertaker drives a thin ash spike through the heart after each passing we dont talk about that to the press one of the traditions of the order of the pipistrelle is that when the sixth ecumenical council anathematized pope honorius back thirteen hundred years ago it wasnt for his doctrine but because is honorius out there too or under here somewhere no he was dealt with a long time ago deacon giuseppe made pounding motions i see the pope wondered if he could talk to talk to the son of god or the son of someone anyhow did he have aramaic enough for that or possibly hebrew how the rabbi of rome would laughor cryif he knew does every pope do this endure this every single one giuseppe said proudly what better way to connect to the beginning of things here is the beginning of things he was risen you know holy father how much does why really matter for a lot of the world why would matter enormously the muslims the protestants the orthodox his head began to hurt although the wound didnt maybe talking with him wasnt such a good idea after all how much do i really want to know when we go back up i have a lot of praying to do the pope said would all the prayer in the world free him from the feel of teeth in his throat and what could he tell his confessor the truth the priest would think hed gone mador worse wouldnt think so and would start the scandal a lie but wasnt inadequate confession of sin a sin in and of itself the headache got worse deacon giuseppe might have read his thoughts you have a dispensation against speaking of this your holiness it dates from the fourth century and it may be the oldest document in the vatican library its not like the donation of constantine eithertheres no doubt its genuine deo gratias the pope said again shall we go then the deacon asked one moment the pope flogged his memory and found enough aramaic for the question he had to ask are you the son of god the sharptoothed mouth twisted in areminiscentsmile you say it came the reply well he told pilate the same thing even if the question was a bit different the pope thought as he left the little chamber and deacon giuseppe meticulously closed and locked doors behind them and when the pope was on the stairs going back up to the warmth and blessed light of st peters one more question occurred to him how many popes had heard that same answer how many of them had asked that same question hed heard it in aramaic in greek in latin and in the language latin had turned into he always said the same thing and he always said it in aramaic you say it he murmured to himself there alone in the comfortable darkness again was he really how could he know but if they thought he was then he wasfor them wasnt that the only thing that counted that roman had washed his hands of finding absolute truth he was a brute but not a stupid brute and this new one was old and likely wouldnt last long pretty soon he would feed again and if he had to try to answer that question one more time afterwards then he did that was all child of an

doing a stint on aquaman this story which first appeared in weird tales puts an islamic spin on the traditional vampire tale the roots of which of course are christian set in the lands north of baghdad during the reign of caliph harun alrashid late eighth century a group of merchants encounter a strange creature in the desert and soon find themselves unwilling scheherazades to the bloodthirsty beast merciful allah i am as a calf fatted for slaughter masrur aladan roared with laughter and crashed his goblet down on the polished wood tableonce twice thrice a trail of crescentshaped dents followed his hand i can scarce move for gorging the fire was banked and shadows walked the walls masrurs tablefor he was master herestood scatterspread with the bones of small fowl masrur leaned forward and squinted across the table a calf he said fatted he belched absently and wiped his mouth with winestained sleeve ibn fahad broke off a thin cold smile we have indeed wreaked massacre on the race of pigeons old friend his slim hand swept above the littered tabletop we have also put the elite guard of your wine cellars to flight and as usual i thank you for your hospitality but do you not sometimes wonder if there is more to life than growing fat in the service of the caliph hah masrur goggled his eyes doing the caliphs bidding has made me wealthy i have made myself fat he smiled the other guests laughed and whispered abu jamir a fatter man in an equally stained robe toppled a small tower erected from the bones of squab the night is young good masrur he cried have someone fetch up more wine and let us hear some stories baba masrur bellowed come here you old dog within three breaths an old servant stood in the doorway looking to his sportive master with apprehension bring us the rest of the wine babaor have you drunk it all baba pulled at his grizzled chin ah ah but you drank it master you and master ibn fahad took the last four jars with you when you went to shoot arrows at the weathercock just as i suspected masrur nodded well get on across the bazaar to abu jamirs place wake up his manservant and bring back several jugs the good jamir says we must have it now baba disappeared the chagrined abu jamir was cheerfully backthumped by the other guests a story a story someone shouted a tale oh yes a tale of your travels master masrur this was young hassan sinfully drunk no one minded his eyes were bright and he was full of innocent stupidity someone said you have traveled to the green lands of the north the north masrur grumbled waving his hand as though confronted with something unclean no lad no that i cannot give to you his face clouded and he slumped back on his cushions his tarbooshed head swayed ibn fahad knew masrur like he knew his horsesindeed masrur was the only human that could claim so much of ibn fahads attention he had seen his old comrade drink twice this quantity and still dance like a dervish on the walls of baghdad but he thought he could guess the reason for this sudden incapacity oh masrur please hassan had not given up he was as unshakeable as a young falcon with its first prey beneath its talons tell us of the north tell us of the infidels a good moslem should not show such interest in unbelievers abu jamir sniffed piously shaking the last drops from a wine jug if masrur does not wish to tell a tale let him be hah snorted the host recovering somewhat you only seek to stall me jamir so that my throat shall not be so dry when your wine arrives no i have no fear of speaking of unbelievers allah would not have given them a place in the world for their own if they had not some use rather it is certain other things that happened which make me hesitate he gazed kindly on young hassan who in the depths of his drunkenness looked about to cry do not despair eggling perhaps it would do me good to unfold this story i have kept the details long inside he emptied the dregs of another jar into his cup i still feel it so strongly thoughbitter bitter times why dont you tell the story my good friend he said over his shoulder to ibn fahad you played as much a part as did i no ibn fahad replied drunken puppy hassan emitted a strangled cry of despair but why old comrade masrur asked pivoting his bulk to stare in amazement did the experience so chill even your heart ibn fahad glowered because i know better as soon as i start you will interrupt adding details here magnifying there then saying no no i cannot speak of it continue old friend before i have taken another breath you will interrupt me again you know you will wind up doing all the talking masrur why do you not start from the beginning and save me my breath all laughed but masrur who put on a look of wounded solicitousness of course old friend he murmured i had no idea that you harbored such grievances of course i shall tell the tale a broad wink was offered to the table no sacrifice is too great for a friendship such as ours poke up the fire will you baba ah hes gone hassan will you be so kind when the youth was again seated masrur took a swallow stroked his beard and began in those days masrur said i myself was but a lowly soldier in the service of harun alrashid may allah grant him health i was young strong a man who loved wine more than he shouldbut what soldier does notand a good deal more trim and comely than you see me today my troop received a commission to accompany a caravan going north bound for the land of the armenites beyond the caucassian mountains a certain prince of that people had sent a great store of gifts as tribute to the caliph inviting him to open a route for trade between his principality and our caliphate harun alrashid wisest of wise men that he is did not exactly make the camels groan beneath the weight of the gifts that he sent in return but he sent several courtiers including the undervizier walid alsalameh to speak for him and to assure this armenite prince that rich rewards would follow when the route over the caucassians was opened for good we left baghdad in grand style pennants flying the shields of the soldiers flashing like golden dinars and the caliphs gifts bundled onto the backs of a gang of evil contrary donkeys we followed the banks of the faithful tigris resting several days at mosul then continued through the eastern edge of anatolia already as we mounted northward the land was beginning to change the clean sands giving way to rocky hills and scrub the weather was colder and the skies gray as though allahs face was turned away from that country but the men were not unhappy to be out from under the desert sun our pace was good there was not a hint of danger except the occasional wolf howling at night beyond the circles of the campfires before two months had passed we had reached the foothills of the caucassianswhat is called the steppe country for those of you who have not strayed far from our baghdad i should tell you that the northern lands are like nothing you have seen the trees there grow so close together you could not throw a stone five paces without striking one the land itself seems always darkthe trees mask the sun before the afternoon is properly finishedand the ground is damp but in truth the novelty of it fades quickly and before long it seems that the smell of decay is always with you we caravaneers had been over eight weeks atraveling and the bite of homesickness was strong but we contented ourselves with the thought of the accommodations that would be ours when we reached the palace of the prince laden as we were with our caliphs good wishesand the tangible proof thereof we had just crossed the high mountain passes and begun our journey down when disaster struck we were encamped one night in a box canyon a thousand steep feet below the summit of the tall caucassian peaks the fires were not much but glowing coals and nearly all the camp was asleep except for two men standing sentry i was wrapped in my bedroll dreaming of how i would spend my earnings when a terrible shriek awakened me sitting groggily upright i was promptly knocked down by some bulky thing tumbling onto me a moments horrified examination showed that it was one of the sentries throat pierced with an arrow eyes bulging with his final surprise suddenly there was a chorus of howls from the hillside above all i could think of was wolves that the wolves were coming down on us in my witless state i could make no sense of the arrow at all even as the others sprang up around me the camp was suddenly filled with leaping whooping shadows another arrow hissed past my face in the darkness and then something crashed against my bare head filling the nighttime with a great splash of light that illuminated nothing i fell back insensible i could not tell how long i had journeyed in that deeper darkness when i was finally roused by a sharp boot prodding at my ribcage i looked up at a tall cruel figure cast by the cloudcurtained morning sun in bold silhouette as my sight became accustomed i saw a knifethin face darkbrowed and fierce with mustachios long as a tartar herdsmans i felt sure that whoever had struck me had returned to finish the job and i struggled weakly to pull my dagger from my sash this terrifying figure merely lifted one of his pointy boots and trod delicately on my wrist saying in perfect arabic wonders of allah this is the dirtiest man i have ever seen it was ibn fahad of course the caravan had been of good size and he had been riding with the armenite and the underviziernot back with the hoi polloiso we had never spoken now you see how we first truly met me on my back covered with mud blood and spit and ibn fahad standing over me like a rich man examining carrots in the bazaar infamy ibn fahad had been blessed with what i would come later to know as his usual luck when the banditswho must have been following us for some dayscame down upon us in the night ibn fahad had been voiding his bladder some way downslope running back at the sound of the first cries he had sent more than a few mountain bandits down to hell courtesy of his swift sword but they were too many he pulled together a small group of survivors from the main party and they fought their way free then fled along the mountain in the darkness listening to the screams echoing behind them cursing their small numbers and ignorance of the country coming back in the light of day to scavenge for supplies as well as ascertain the nature of our attackers ibn fahad had found mea fact he has never allowed me to forget and for which i have never allowed him to evade responsibility while my wounds and banditspites were doctored ibn fahad introduced me to the few survivors of our oncegreat caravan one was susri aldina cheerful lad freshfaced and smoothcheeked as young hassan here dressed in the robes of a rich merchants son the soldiers who had survived rather liked him and called him fawn to tease him for his wideeyed good looks there was a skinny wretch of a chiefclerk named abdallah pursemouthed and ironeyed and an indecently plump young mullah who had just left the madrasa and was getting a rather rude introduction to life outside the seminary ruad the mullah looked as though he would prefer to be drinking and laughing with the soldiersbesides myself and ibn fahad there were four or five more of thesewhile abdallah the primfaced clerk looked as though he should be the one who never lifted his head out of the koran well in a way that was true since for a man like abdallah the balance book is the holy book may allah forgive such blasphemy there was one other notable for the extreme richness of his robes the extreme whiteness of his beard and the vast weight of his personal jewelrywalid alsalameh the undervizier to his eminence the caliph harun alrashid walid was the most important man of the whole party he was also surprisingly not a bad fellow at all so there we found ourselves the wrack of the caliphs embassy with no hope but to try and find our way back home through a strange hostile land the upper reaches of the caucassians are a cold and godless place the fog is thick and wet it crawls in of the morning leaves briefly at the time the sun is high then comes creeping back long before sunset we had been sodden as welldiggers from the moment we had stepped into the foothills a treacherous place those mountains home of bear and wolf covered in forest so thick that in places the sun was lost completely since we had no guideindeed it was several days before we saw any sign of inhabitants whatsoeverwe wandered unsteered losing half as much ground as we gained for walking in circles at last we were forced to admit our need for a trained local eye in the middle slopes the trees grew so thick that fixing our direction was impossible for hours at a time we were divining the location of mecca by general discussion andblasphemy againwe probably spent as much time praying toward aleppo as to mecca it seemed a choice between possible discovery and certain doom we came down by night and took a young man out of an isolated shepherds hovel as quietly as exbrigands like ourselves or at least like many of us ibn fahad my apologies could the family did not wake the dog did not bark we were two leagues away before sunrise im sure i felt sorry in a way for the young peasantlout wed kidnapped he was a nice fellow although fearfully stupidi wonder if we are now an old dull story with which he bores his children in any case once this young rusticwhose name as far as i could tell was unpronounceable by civilized tonguesrealized that we were not ghosts or jinni and were not going to kill him on the spot he calmed down and was quite useful we began to make real progress reaching the peak of the nearest ridge in two days there was a slight feeling of celebration in the air that night our first in days under the open skies the soldiers cursed the lack of strong drink but spirits were good nonethelesseven ibn fahad pried loose a smile as the undervizier walid told a humorous story i looked about the camp there were but two grim faces the clerk abdallahwhich was to be expected since he seemed a patently sour old deviland the stolen peasantboy i walked over to him ho young one i said why do you look so downcast have you not realized that we are goodhearted godfearing men and will not harm you he did not even raise his chin which rested on his knees shepherdstyle but he turned his eyes up to mine it is not those things he said in his awkward arabic it is not you soldiers but this place gloomy mountains they are indeed i agreed but you have lived here all your young life why should it bother you not this place we never come hereit is unholy the vampyr walks these peaks vampyr said i and what peasantdevil is that he would say no more i left him to his brooding and walked back to the fire the men all had a good laugh over the vampyr making jesting guesses as to what type of beast it might be but ruad the young mullah waved his hands urgently i have heard of such afreets he said they are not to be laughed at by such a godless lot as yourselves he said this as a sort of scolding joke but he wore a strange look on his round face we listened with interest as he continued the vampyr is a restless spirit it is neither alive nor dead and shaitan possesses its soul utterly it sleeps in a sepulcher by day and when the moon rises it goes out to feed upon travelers to drink their blood some of the men again laughed loudly but this time it rang false as a brassmerchants smile i have heard of these from one of our foreign visitors said the undervizier walid quietly he told me of a plague of these vampyr in a village near smyrna all the inhabitants fled and the village is still uninhabited today this reminded someone else myself perhaps of a tale about an afreet with teeth growing on both sides of his head others followed with their own demon stories the talk went on late into the night and no one left the campfire until it had completely burned out by noon the next day we had left the heights and were passing back down into the dark treeblanketed ravines when we stopped that night we were once more hidden from the stars out of sight of allah and the sky i remember waking up in the foredawn hours my beard was wet with dew and i was damnably tangled up in my cloak a great dark shape stood over me i must confess to making a bit of a squawking noise its me the shape hissedit was rifakh one of the other soldiers you gave me a turn rifakh chuckled thought i was that vampyr eh sorry just stepping out for a piss he stepped over me and i heard him trampling the underbrush i slipped back into sleep the sun was just barely over the horizon when i was again awakened this time by ibn fahad tugging at my arm i grumbled at him to leave me alone but he had a grip on me like an almsbeggar rifakhs gone he said wake up have you seen him he walked on me in the middle of the night on his way to go moisten a tree i said he probably fell in the darkness and hit his head on somethinghave you looked several times ibn fahad responded all around the camp no sign of him did he say anything to you nothing interesting perhaps he has met the sister of our shepherdboy and is making the twobacked beast ibn fahad made a sour face at my crudity perhaps not perhaps he has met some other beast dont worry i said if he hasnt fallen down somewhere close by hell be back but he did not come back when the rest of the men arose we had another long search with no result at noon we decided reluctantly to go on our way hoping that if he had strayed somewhere he could catch up with us we hiked down into the valley going farther and farther into the trees there was no sign of rifakh although from time to time we stopped and shouted in case he was searching for us we felt there was small risk of discovery for that dark valley was as empty as a paupers purse but nevertheless after a while the sound of our voices echoing back through the damp glades became unpleasant we continued on in silence twilight comes early in the bosom of the mountains by midafternoon it was already becoming dark young fawnthe name had stuck against the youths protestswho of all of us was the most disturbed by the disappearance of rifakh stopped the company suddenly shouting look there we straightaway turned to see where he was pointing but the thick trees and shadows revealed nothing i saw a shape the young one said it was just a short way back following us perhaps it is the missing soldier naturally the men ran back to look but though we scoured the bushes we could find no trace of anyone we decided that the failing light had played fawn a trickthat he had seen a hind or some such two other times he called out that he saw a shape the last time one of the other soldiers glimpsed it too a dark manlike form moving rapidly beneath the trees a bowshot away close inspection still yielded no evidence and as the group trod wearily back to the path again walid the undervizier turned to fawn with a hard flat look perhaps it would be better young master if you talked no more of shadowshapes but i saw it the boy cried that soldier mohammad saw it too i have no doubt of that answered walid alsalameh but think on this we have gone several times to see what it might be and have found no sign of any living man perhaps our rifakh is dead perhaps he fell into a stream and drowned or hit his head upon a rock his spirit may be following us because it does not wish to stay in this unfamiliar place that does not mean we want to go and find it but the other began enough spat the chiefclerk abdallah you heard the undervizier young prankster we shall have no more talk of your godless spirits you will straightaway leave off telling such things your concern is appreciated abdallah walid said coldly but i do not require your help in this matter the vizier strode away i was almost glad the clerk had added his voice because such ideas would not keep the journey in good order but like the undervizier i too had been rubbed and grated by the clerks highhandedness i am sure others felt the same for no more was said on the subject all evening allah though always has the last wordand who are we to try to understand his ways we bedded down a very quiet camp that night the idea of poor rifakhs lost soul hanging unspoken in the air from a thin unpleasant sleep i woke to find the camp in chaos its mohammad the soldier fawn was crying hes been killed hes dead it was true the mullah ruad first up in the morning had found the mans blanket empty then found his body a few short yards out of the clearing his throat has been slashed out said ibn fahad it looked like a wild beast had been at him the ground beneath was dark with blood and his eyes were wide open above the cursing of the soldiers and the murmured holy words of the mullah who looked quite green of face i heard another sound the young shepherdlad grimly silent all the day before was rocking back and forth on the ground by the remains of the cookfire moaning vampyr he wept vampyr the vampyr all the companions were of course completely unmanned by these events while we buried mohammad in a hastily dug grave those assembled darted glances over their shoulders into the forest vegetation even ruad as he spoke the words of the holy koran had trouble keeping his eyes down ibn fahad and i agreed between ourselves to maintain that mohammad had fallen prey to a wolf or some other beast but our fellow travelers found it hard even to pretend agreement only the undervizier and the clerk abdallah seemed to have their wits fully about them and abdallah made no secret of his contempt for the others we set out again at once our company was somber that dayand no wonder no one wished to speak of the obvious nor did they have much stomach for talk of lighter thingsit was a silent file of men that moved through the mountain fastnesses as the shadows of evening began to roll down the dark shape was with us again flitting along just in sight disappearing for a while only to return bobbing along behind us like a jackdaw my skin was crawlingas you may well believethough i tried to hide it we set camp building a large fire and moving near to it and had a sullen closecramped supper ibn fahad abdallah the undervizier and i were still speaking of the follower only as some beast abdallah may even have believed itnot from ordinary foolishness but because he was the type of man who was unwilling to believe there might be anything he himself could not compass as we took turns standing guard the young mullah led the farfromsleepy men in prayer the voices rose up with the smoke neither seeming to be of much substance against the wind of those old cold mountains i sidled over to the shepherdlad hed become if anything more closemouthed since the discovery of the morning this vampyr you spoke of i said quietly what do your people do to protect themselves from it he looked up at me with a sad smile lock the doors i stared across at the other menyoung fawn with clenched mouth and furrowed brow the mullah ruad eyes closed plump cheeks awash with sweat as he prayed ibn fahad gazing coolly outward ever outwardand then i returned the boys sad smile no doors to lock no windows to bar i said what else there is an herb we hang about our houses he said and fumbled for the word in our unfamiliar language after a moment he gave up it does not matter we have none none grows here i leaned forward putting my face next to his face for the love of god boy what else i knew it was not a beast of the earth i knew i had seen that fluttering shadow well he mumbled turning his face away they say some men do that you can tell stories what i thought he had gone mad this is what my grandfather says the vampyr will stop to hear the story you tellif it is a good oneand if you continue it until daylight he must return to the place of the dead there was a sudden shriek i leaped to my feet fumbling for my knife but it was only ruad who had put his foot against a hot coal i sank down again heart hammering stories i asked i have only heard so he said struggling for the right phrases we try to keep them farther away than thatthey must come close to hear a man talking later after the fire had gone down we placed sentries and went to our blankets i lay a long while thinking of what the armenite boy had said before i slept a hideous screeching sound woke me it was not yet dawn and this time no one had burned himself on a glowing ember one of the two soldiers who had been standing picket lay on the forest floor blood gouting from a great wound on the side of his head in the torchlight it looked as though his skull had been smashed with a heavy cudgel the other sentry was gone but there was a terrible thrashing in the underbrush beyond the camp and screams that would have sounded like an animal in a cruel trap but for the halfformed words that bubbled up from time to time we crouched huddled staring like startled rabbits the screaming began to die away suddenly ruad started up heavy and clumsy getting to his feet i saw tears in his eyes we we must not leave our fellow to sssuffer so he cried and looked around at all of us i dont think anyone could hold his eye except the clerk abdallah i could not be silent fool the clerk said heedless of blasphemy it is a wild beast it is for these cowardly soldiers to attend to not a man of god the young mullah stared at him for a moment and a change came over his face the tears were still wet on his cheeks but i saw his jaw firm and his shoulders square no he said we cannot leave him to shaitans servant if you will not go to him i will he rolled up the scroll he had been nervously fingering and kissed it a shaft of moonlight played across the gold letters i tried to grab his arm as he went past me but he shook me off with surprising strength then moved toward the brush where the screeching had died down to a low broken moaning come back you idiot abdallah shrieked at him this is foolishness come back the young holy man looked back over his shoulder darting a look at abdallah i could not easily describe then turned around and continued forward holding the parchment scroll before him as if it were a candle against the dark night there is no god but allah i heard him cry and mohammad is his prophet then he was gone after a long moment of silence there came the sound of the holy words of the koran chanted in an unsteady voice we could hear the mullah making his ungraceful way out through the thicket i was not the only one who held his breath next there was crashing and branches snapping as though some huge beast was leaping through the brush the mullahs chanting became a howl men cursed helplessly before the cry had faded though another scream camenumbingly loud the rage of a powerful animal full of shock and surprise it had words in it although not in any tongue i had ever heard before or since another great thrashing and then nothing but silence we lit another fire and sat sleepless until dawn in the morning despite my urgings the company went to look for trace of the sentry and the young priest they found them both it made a grim picture let me tell you my friends they hung upside down from the branches of a great tree their necks were torn and they were white as chalk all the blood had been drawn from them we dragged the two stonecold husks back to the campcircle and shortly thereafter buried them commonly with the other sentry who had not survived his head wound one curious thing there was on the ground beneath the hanging head of the young priest lay the remains of his holy scroll it was scorched to black ash and crumbled at my touch so it was a cry of pain we heard said ibn fahad over my shoulder the devilbeast can be hurt it appears hurt but not made to give over i observed and no other holy writings remain nor any hands so holy to wield them or mouth to speak them i looked pointedly over at abdallah who was giving unwanted instructions to the two remaining soldiers on how to spade the funeral dirt i halfhoped one of them would take it on himself to brain the old meddler true grunted ibn fahad well i have my doubts on how cold steel will fare also as do i but it could be there is yet a way we may save ourselves the shepherdboy told me of it i will explain when we stop at midday i will be waiting eagerly said ibn fahad favoring me with his halfsmile i am glad to see someone else is thinking and planning beside myself but perhaps you should tell us your plan on the march our daylight hours are becoming precious as blood now as a matter of fact i think from now on we shall have to do without burial services well there we were in a very nasty fix as we walked i explained my plan to the group they listened silently downcast like men condemned to deathnot an unreasonable attitude in all truth now heres the thing i told them if this young louts idea of taletelling will work we shall have to spend our nights yarning away we may have to begin taking stops for sleeping in the daylight every moment walking then is preciouswe must keep the pace up or we will die in these damned haunted mountains also while you walk think of stories from what the lad says we may have another ten days or a fortnight to go until we escape this country we shall soon run out of things to tell about unless you dig deep into your memories there was grumbling but it was too dispirited a group to offer much protest be silent unless you have a better idea said ibn fahad masrur is quite correctalthough if what i suspect is true it may be the first time in his life he finds himself in that position he threw me a wicked grin and one of the soldiers snickered it was a good sound to hear we had a short midday restmost of us got at least an hours sleep on the rocky groundand then we walked on until the beginning of twilight we were in the bottom of a long thickly forested ravine where we promptly built a large fire to keep away some of the darkness of the valley floor ah but fire is a good friend gathered around the blaze the men cooked strips of venison on the ends of green sticks we passed the waterskin and wished it was morenot for the first time now then i said ill go first for at home i was the one called upon most often to tell tales and i have a good fund of them some of you may sleep but not allthere should always be two or three awake in case the teller falters or forgets we cannot know if this will keep the creature at bay but we should take no chances so i began telling first the story of the four clever brothers it was early and no one was ready to sleep all listened attentively as i spun it out adding details here stretching a description there when it ended i was applauded and straight away began telling the story of the carpet merchant salim and his unfaithful wife that was perhaps not a good choiceit is a story about a vengeful djinn and about death but i went on nonetheless finished it then told two more as i was finishing the fourth story about a brave orphan who finds a cave of jewels i glimpsed a strange thing the fire was beginning to die down and as i looked out over the flames i saw movement in the forest the undervizier walid was directly across from me and beyond his oncesplendid robes a dark shape lurked it came no closer than the edge of the trees staying just out of the fires flickering light i lost my voice for a moment then and stuttered but quickly caught up the thread and finished no one had noticed i was sure i asked for the waterskin and motioned for walid alsalameh to continue he took up with a tale of the rivalry beyond two wealthy houses in his native isfahan one or two of the others wrapped themselves tightly in their cloaks and lay down staring up as they listened watching the sparks rise into the darkness i pulled my hood down low on my brow to shield my gaze and squinted out past walids shoulder the dark shape had moved a little nearer now to the lapping glow of the campfire it was manshaped that i could see fairly well though it clung close to the trunk of a tree at clearings edge its face was in darkness two emberred eyes unblinkingly reflected the firelight it seemed clothed in rags but that could have been a trick of the shadows huddled in the darkness a stonethrow away it was listening i turned my head slowly across the circle most eyes were on the undervizier fawn had curtained his in sleep but ibn fahad too was staring out into the darkness i suppose he felt my gaze for he turned to me and nodded slightly he had seen it too we went on until dawn the men taking turns sleeping as one of the others told storiesmostly tales they had heard as children occasionally of an adventure that had befallen them ibn fahad and i said nothing of the dark shape that watched somewhere in the hour before dawn it disappeared it was a sleepy group that took to the trail that day but we had all lived through the night this alone put the men in better spirits and we covered much ground that night we again sat around the fire i told the story of the gazelle king and the enchanted peacock and the little man with no name each of them longer and more complicated than the one before everyone except the clerk abdallah contributed somethingabdallah and the shepherdboy that is the chiefclerk said repeatedly that he had never wasted his time on foolishness such as learning stories we were understandably reluctant to press our selfpreservation into such unwilling hands the armenite boy our guide sat quietly all the evening and listened to the men yarning away in a tongue that was not his own when the moon had risen through the treetops the shadow returned and stood silently outside the clearing i saw the peasant lad look up he saw it i know but like ibn fahad and i he held his silence the next day brought us two catastrophes as we were striking camp in the morning happily no fewer than when we had set down the night before the local lad took the waterskins down to the river that threaded the bottom of the ravine when a long hour had passed and he had not returned we went fearfully down to look for him he was gone all but one of the waterskins lay on the streambank he had filled them first the men were panicky the vampyr has taken him they cried what does that foul creature need with a waterskin pointed out alsalameh hes right i said no im afraid our young friend has merely jumped ship so to speak i suppose he thinks his chances of getting back are better if he is alone i wondered i still wonder if he made it back he was not a bad fellow witness the fact that he took only one waterbag and left us the rest thus we found ourselves once more without a guide fortunately i had discussed with him the general direction and he had told ibn fahad and myself of the larger landmarks but it was nevertheless with sunken hearts that we proceeded later that day in the early afternoon the second blow fell we were coming up out of the valley climbing diagonally along the steep side of the ravine the damned caucassian fogs had slimed the rocks and turned the ground soggy the footing was treacherous achmed the older of the remaining pikemen had been walking poorly all day he had bad joints anyway he said and the cold nights had been making them worse we had stopped to rest on an outcropping of rock that jutted from the valley wall and achmed the last in line was just catching up to us when he slipped he fell heavily onto his side and slid several feet down the muddy slope ibn fahad jumped up to look for a rope but before he could get one from the bottom of his pack the other soldiernamed bekir if memory servesclambered down the grade to help his comrade he got a grip on achmeds tunic and was just turning around to catch ibn fahads rope when the leg of the older man buckled beneath him and he fell backward bekir caught off his balance pitched back as well his hand caught in the neck of achmeds tunic and the two of them rolled end over end down the slope before anyone could so much as cry out they had both disappeared over the edge like a wine jug rolling off a tabletop just that sudden to fall such a distance certainly killed them we could not find the bodies of course could not even climb back down the ravine to look ibn fahads remark about burials had taken on a terrible ironic truth we could but press on now a party of fivemyself ibn fahad the undervizier walid abdallah the clerk and young fawn i doubt that there was a single one of our number who did not wonder which of us would next meet death in that lonesome place ah by allah most high i have never been so sick of the sound of my own voice as i was by the time nine more nights had passed ibn fahad i know would say that i have never understood how sick everyone becomes of the sound of my voiceam i correct old friend but i was tired of it tired of talking all night tired of racking my brain for stories tired of listening to the cracked voices of walid and ibn fahad tired to sickness of the damp gray oppressive mountains all were now aware of the haunting shade that stood outside our fire at night waiting and listening young fawn in particular could hardly hold up his turn at taletelling so much did his voice tremble abdallah grew steadily colder and colder congealing like rendered fat the thing which followed was no respecter of his cynicism or his mathematics and would not be banished for all the scorn he could muster the skinny chiefclerk did not turn out to us though to support the storycircle but sat silently and walked apart despite our terrible mutual danger he avoided our company as much as possible the tenth night after the loss of achmed and bekir we were running out of tales we had been ground down by our circumstances and were ourselves become nearly as shadowy as that which we feared walid alsalameh was droning on about some ancient bit of minor intrigue in the court of the emperor darius of persia ibn fahad leaned toward me lowering his voice so that neither abdallah or fawnwhose expression was one of complete and hopeless despaircould hear did you notice he whispered that our guest has made no appearance tonight it has not escaped me i said i hardly think it a good sign however if our talk no longer interests the creature how long can it be until its thoughts return to our other uses i fear youre right he responded and gave a scratchy painful chuckle theres a good three or four more days walking and hard walking at that until we reach the bottom of these mountains and come once more onto the plain at which point we might hope the devilbeast would leave us ibn fahad i said shaking my head as i looked across at fawns drawn pale face i fear we shall not manage as if to point up the truth of my fears walid here stopped his speech coughing violently i gave him to drink of the waterskin but when he had finished he did not begin anew he only sat looking darkly as one lost out to the forest good vizier i asked can you continue he said nothing and i quickly spoke in his place trying to pick up the threads of a tale i had not been attending to walid leaned back exhausted and breathing raggedly abdallah clucked his tongue in disgust if i had not been fearfully occupied i would have struck the clerk just as i was beginning to find my way inventing a continuation of the viziers darian political meanderings there came a shock that passed through all of us like a cold wind and a new shadow appeared at the edge of the clearing the vampyr had joined us walid moaned and sat up huddling by the fire i faltered for a moment but went on the candleflame eyes regarded us unblinkingly and the shadow shook for a moment as if folding great wings suddenly fawn leaped to his feet swaying unsteadily i lost the strands of the story completely and stared up at him in amazement creature he screamed hellspawn why do you torment us in this way why why why ibn fahad reached up to pull him down but the young man danced away like a shying horse his mouth hung open and his eyes were starting from their darkrimmed sockets you great beast he continued to shriek why do you toy with us why do you not just kill mekill us all set us free from this terrible terrible and with that he walked forwardaway from the fire toward the thing that crouched at forests edge end this now fawn shouted and fell to his knees only a few strides from the smoldering red eyes sobbing like a child stupid boy get back i cried before i could get up to pull him backand i would have i swear by allahs namethere was a great rushing noise and the black shape was gone the lamps of its stare extinguished then as we pulled the shuddering youth back to the campfire something rustled in the trees on the opposite side of the campfire one of the near branches suddenly bobbed beneath the weight of a strange new fruita black fruit with redlit eyes it made an awful croaking noise in our shock it was a few moments before we realized that the deep rasping sound was speechand the words were arabic it was you it said who chose to play the game this way almost strangest of all i would swear that this thing had never spoken our language before never even heard it until we had wandered lost into the mountains something of its halting inflections its strange hesitations made me guess it had learned our speech from listening all these nights to our campfire stories demon shrilled abdallah what manner of creature are you you know very well what kind of thing i am man you may none of you know how or why but by now you know what i am why why do you torment us so shouted fawn writhing in ibn fahads strong grasp why does the serpent kill a rabbit the serpent does not hate it kills to live as do i as do you abdallah lurched forward a step we do not slaughter our fellow men like this devilspawn ccclerk the black shape hissed and dropped down from the tree cclose your foolish mouth you push me too far it bobbed as if agitated the curse of human ways even now you provoke me more than you should you huffing insect enough the vampyr seemed to leap upward and with a great rattling of leaves he scuttled away along the limb of a tall tree i was fumbling for my sword but before i could find it the creature spoke again from his high perch the young one asked me why i toy with you i do not if i do not kill i will suffer more than i suffer already despite what this clerk says though i am not a creature without without feelings as men have them less and less do i wish to destroy you for the first time in a great age i have listened to the sound of human voices that were not screams of fear i have approached a circle of men without the barking of dogs and have listened to them talk it has almost been like being a man again and this is how you show your pleasure the undervizier walid asked teeth chattering by kkkilling us i am what i am said the beast but for all that you have inspired a certain desire for companionship it puts me in mind of things that i can barely remember i propose that we make a bargain said the vampyr a wager i had found my sword and ibn fahad had drawn his as well but we both knew we could not kill a thing like thisa redeyed demon that could leap five cubits in the air and had learned to speak our language in a fortnight no bargains with shaitan spat the clerk abdallah what do you mean i demanded inwardly marveling that such an unlikely dialogue should ever take place on the earth pay no attention to the i curled my lip holy man abdallah shot me a venomous glance hear me then the creature said and in the deep recesses of the tree seemed once more to unfold and stretch great wings hear me i must kill to live and my nature is such that i cannot choose to die that is the way of things i offer you now however the chance to win safe passage out of my domain these hills we shall have a contest a wager if you like if you best me you shall go freely and i shall turn once more to the musty slowblooded peasants of the local valleys ibn fahad laughed bitterly what are we to fight you then so be it i would snap your spine like a dry branch croaked the black shape no you have held me these many nights telling stories it is storytelling that will win you safe passage we will have a contest one that will suit my whims we shall relate the saddest of all stories that is my demand you may tell three i will tell only one if you can best me with any or all you shall go unhindered by me and if we lose i cried and who shall judge you may judge it said and the deep thick voice took on a tone of grim amusement if you can look into my eyes and tell me that you have bested my sad tale why then i shall believe you if you lose it said then one of your number shall come to me and pay the price of your defeat those are my terms otherwise i shall hunt you down one at a timefor in truth your present taletelling has begun to lose my interest ibn fahad darted a worried look in my direction fawn and the others stared at the demonshape in mute terror and astonishment we shall we shall give you our decision at sunset tomorrow i said we must be allowed to think and talk as you wish said the vampyr but if you accept my challenge the game must begin then after all we have only a few more days to spend together and at this the terrible creature laughed a sound like the bark being pulled from the trunk of a rotted tree then the shadow was gone in the end we had to accede to the creatures wager of course we knew he was not wrong in his assessment of uswe were just wagging our beards over the nightly campfire no longer even listening to our own tales whatever magic had held the vampyr at bay had drained out like meal from a torn sack i racked my poor brains all afternoon for stories of sadness but could think of nothing that seemed to fit that seemed significant enough for the vital purpose at hand i had been doing most of the talking for several nights running and had exhausted virtually every story i had ever heardand i was never much good at making them up as ibn fahad will attest yes go ahead and smile old comrade actually it was ibn fahad who volunteered the first tale i asked him what it was but he would not tell me let me save what potency it may have he said the undervizier walid also had something he deemed suitable i was racking my brain fruitlessly for a third time when young fawn piped up that he would tell a tale himself i looked him over rosy cheeks and longlashed eyes and asked him what he could possibly know of sadness even as i spoke i realized my cruelty standing as we all did in the shadow of death or worse but it was too late to take it back fawn did not flinch he was folding his cloak as he sat crossankled on the ground folding and unfolding it he looked up and said i shall tell a sad story about love all the saddest stories are about love these young shavetails i thoughtalthough i was not ten years his seniora sad story about love but i could not think of better and was forced to give in we walked as fast and far as we could that day as if hoping that somehow against all reason we should find ourselves out of the gloomy mistsodden hills but when twilight came the vast bulk of the mountains still hung above us we made camp on the porch of a great standing rock as though protection at our backs would avail us of something if the night went badly the fire had only just taken hold and the sun had dipped below the rim of the hills a moment before when a cold wind made the branches of the trees whip back and forth we knew without speaking without looking at one another that the creature had come have you made your decision the harsh voice from the trees sounded strange as if its owner was trying to speak lightly carelesslybut i only heard death in those cold syllables we have said ibn fahad drawing himself up out of his involuntary halfcrouch to stand erect we will accept your wager do you wish to begin oh no the thing said and made a flapping noise that would take all of the suspense from the contest would it not no i insist that you begin i am first then ibn fahad said looking around our circle for confirmation the dark shape moved abruptly toward us before we could scatter the vampyr stopped a few short steps away do not fear it grated close to ones ear the voice was even odder and more strained i have come nearer to hear the story and see the tellerfor surely that is part of any talebut i shall move no farther begin everybody but myself stared into the fire hugging their knees keeping their eyes averted from the bundle of darkness that sat at our shoulders i had the fire between myself and the creature and felt safer than if i had sat like walid and abdallah with nothing between the beast and my back but cold ground the vampyr sat hunched as if imitating our posture its eyes hooded so that only a flicker of scarlet light like a halfburied brand showed through the slit it was black this manlike thingnot black as a negro mind you but black as burnt steel black as the mouth of a cave it bore the aspect of someone dead of the plague rags wrapped it mouldering filthy bits of cloth rotten as old bread but the curve of its back spoke of terrible lifea great black cricket poised to jump ibn fahads story many years ago he began i traveled for a good time in egypt i was indigent then and journeyed wherever the prospect of payment for a sword arm beckoned i found myself at last in the household guard of a rich merchant in alexandria i was happy enough there and i enjoyed walking in the busy streets so unlike the village in which i was born one summer evening i found myself walking down an unfamiliar street it emptied out into a little square that sat below the front of an old mosque the square was full of people merchants and fishwives a juggler or two but most of the crowd was drawn up to the facade of the mosque pressed in close together at first as i strolled across the square i thought prayers were about to begin but it was still some time until sunset i wondered if perhaps some notable imam was speaking from the mosque steps but as i approached i could see that all the assembly were staring upward craning their necks back as if the sun itself on its way to its western mooring had become snagged on one of the minarets but instead of the sun what stood on the onionshaped dome was the silhouette of a man who seemed to be staring out toward the horizon who is that i asked a man near me it is haarud alemwiya the sufi the man told me never lowering his eyes from the tower above is he caught up there i demanded will he not fall watch was all the man said i did a moment later much to my horror the small dark figure of haarud the sufi seemed to go rigid then toppled from the minarets rim like a stone i gasped in shock and so did a few others around me but the rest of the crowd only stood in hushed attention then an incredible thing happened the tumbling holy man spread his arms out from his shoulders like a birds wings and his downward fall became a swooping glide he bottomed out high above the crowd then sped upward riding the wind like a leaf spinning somersaulting stopping at last to drift to the ground as gently as a bit of eiderdown meanwhile all the assembly was chanting god is great god is great when the sufi had touched the earth with his bare feet the people surrounded him touching his rough woolen garments and crying out his name he said nothing only stood and smiled and before too long the people began to wander away talking amongst themselves but this is truly marvelous i said to the man who stood by me before every holy day he flies the man said and shrugged i am surprised this is the first time you have heard of haarud alemwiya i was determined to speak to this amazing man and as the crowd dispersed i approached and asked if i might buy him a glass of tea close up he had a look of seamed roguishness that seemed surprising placed against the great favor in which allah must have held him he smilingly agreed and accompanied me to a tea shop close by in the street of weavers how is it if you will pardon my forwardness that you of all holy men are so gifted he looked up from the tea cupped in his palms and grinned he had only two teeth balance he said i was surprised a cat has balance i responded but they nevertheless must wait for the pigeons to land i refer to a different sort of balance he said the balance between allah and shaitan which as you know allah the allknowing has created as an equilibrium of exquisite delicacy explain please master i called for wine but haarud refused any himself in all things care must be exercised he explained thus it is too with my flying many men holier than i are as earthbound as stones many other men have lived so poorly as to shame the devil himself yet they cannot take to the air either only i if i may be excused what sounds selfsatisfied have discovered perfect balance thus each year before the holy days i tot up my score carefully committing small peccadilloes or acts of faith as needed until the balance is exactly exactly balanced thus when i jump from the mosque neither allah nor the archenemy has claim on my soul and they bear me up until a later date at which time the issue shall be clearer he smiled again and drained his tea you are a sort of chessboard on which god and the devil contend i asked perplexed a flying chessboard yes we talked for a long while as the shadows grew long across the street of the weavers but the sufi haarud adhered stubbornly to his explanation i must have seemed disbelieving for he finally proposed that we ascend to the top of the mosque so he could demonstrate i was more than a little drunk and he imbibing only tea was filled nonetheless with a strange gleefulness we made our way up the many winding stairs and climbed out onto the narrow ledge that circled the minaret like a crown the cool night air and the thousands of winking lights of alexandria far below sobered me rapidly i suddenly find all your precepts very sound i said let us go down but haarud would have none of it and proceeded to step lightly off the edge of the dome he hovered like a bumblebee a hundred feet above the dusty street balance he said with great satisfaction but i asked is the good deed of giving me this demonstration enough to offset the pride with which you exhibit your skill i was cold and wanted to get down and hoped to shorten the exhibition instead hearing my question haarud screwed up his face as though it was something he had not given thought to a moment later with a shriek of surprise he plummeted down out of my sight to smash on the mosques stone steps as dead as dead ibn fahad having lost himself in remembering the story poked at the campfire thus the problem with matters of delicate balance he said and shook his head the whispering rustle of our dark visitor brought us sharply back interesting the creature rasped sad yes sad enough we shall see who is the next of your number a cold chill like fever swept over me at those calm words i i am next said fawn voice taut as a bowstring shall i begin the vampyr said nothing only bobbed the black lump of his head the youth cleared his throat and began fawns story there was once fawn began and hesitated then started again there was once a young prince named zufik the second son of a great sultan seeing no prospects for himself in his fathers kingdom he went out into the wild world to search for his fortune he traveled through many lands and saw many strange things and heard tell of others stranger still in one place he was told of a nearby sultanate the ruler of which had a beautiful daughter his only child and the very apple of his eye now this country had been plagued for several years by a terrible beast a great white leopard of a kind never seen before so fearsome it was that it had killed hunters set to trap it yet was it also so cunning that it had stolen babies from their very cradles as the mothers lay sleeping the people of the sultanate were all in fear and the sultan whose best warriors had tried and failed to kill the beast was driven to despair finally at the end of his wits he had it proclaimed in the market place that the man who could destroy the white leopard would be gifted with the sultans daughter rassoril and with her the throne of the sultanate after the old man was gone young zufik heard how the best young men of the country and others from countries beyond one after the other had met their deaths beneath the claws of the leopard or or in its jaws here i saw the boy falter as if the vision of flashing teeth he was conjuring had suddenly reminded him of our predicament walid the undervizier reached out and patted the lads shoulder with great gentleness until he was calm enough to resume so he swallowed so young prince zufik took himself into that country and soon was announced at the sultans court the ruler was a tired old man the fires in his sunken eyes long quenched much of the power seemed to have been handed over to a pale narrowfaced youth named sifaz who was the princesss cousin as zufik announced his purpose as so many had done before him sifazs eyes flashed you will no doubt meet the end all the others have but you are welcome to the attemptand the prize should you win then for the first time zufik saw the princess rassoril and in an instant his heart was overthrown she had hair as black and shiny as polished jet and a face upon which allah himself must have looked in satisfaction thinking here is the summit of my art her delicate hands were like tiny doves as they nested in her lap and a man could fall into her brown eyes and drown without hope of rescuewhich is what zufik did and he was not wrong when he thought he saw rassoril return his ardent gaze sifaz saw too and his thin mouth turned in something like a smile and he narrowed his yellow eyes take this princeling to his room that he may sleep now and wake with the moon the leopards cry was heard around the palaces walls last night indeed when zufik woke in the evening darkness it was to hear the choking cry of the leopard beneath his very window as he looked out buckling on his scabbard it was to see a white shape slipping in and out of the shadows in the garden below he took also his dagger in his hand and leaped over the threshold he had barely touched ground when with a terrible snarl the leopard bounded out of the obscurity of the hedged garden wall and came to a stop before him it was hugebigger than any leopard zufik had seen or heard ofand its pelt gleamed like ivory it leaped claws flashing and he could barely throw himself down in time as the beast passed over him like a cloud touching him only with its hot breath it turned and leaped again as the palace dogs set up a terrible barking and this time its talons raked his chest knocking him tumbling blood started from his shirt spouting so fiercely that he could scarcely draw himself to his feet he was caught with his back against the garden wall the leopard slowly moved toward him yellow eyes like tallow lamps burning in the niches of hell suddenly there was a crashing at the far end of the garden the dogs had broken down their stall and were even now speeding through the trees the leopard hesitatedzufik could almost see it thinkingand then with a last snarl it leaped onto the wall and disappeared into the night zufik was taken his wounds bound and he was put into his bed the princess rassoril who had truly lost her heart to him wept bitterly at his side begging him to go back to his fathers land and to give up the fatal challenge but zufik weak as he was would no more think of yielding than he would of theft or treason and refused saying he would hunt the beast again the following night sifaz grinned and led the princess away zufik thought he heard the pale cousin whistling as he went in the dark before dawn zufik who could not sleep owing to the pain of his injury heard his door quietly open he was astonished to see the princess come in gesturing him to silence when the door was closed she threw herself down at his side and covered his hand and cheek with kisses proclaiming her love for him and begging him again to go he admitted his love for her but reminded her that his honor would not permit him to stop short of his goal even should he die in the trying rassoril seeing that there was no changing the young princes mind then took from her robe a black arrow tipped in silver fletched with the tail feathers of a falcon then take this she said this leopard is a magic beast and you will never kill it otherwise only silver will pierce its heart take the arrow and you may fulfill your oath so saying she slipped out of his room the next night zufik again heard the leopards voice in the garden below but this time he took also his bow and arrow when he went to meet it at first he was loath to use it since it seemed somehow unmanly but when the beast had again given him injury and he had struck three sword blows in turn without effect he at last nocked the silverpointed shaft on his bowstring and as the beast charged him once more let fly the black arrow struck to the leopards heart the creature gave a hideous cry and again leaped the fence this time leaving a trail of its mortal blood behind it when morning came zufik went to the sultan for men so that they could follow the track of blood to the beasts lair and prove its death the sultan was displeased when his vizier the princesss pale cousin did not answer his summons as they were all going down into the garden though there came a great cry from the sleeping rooms upstairs a cry like a soul in mortal agony with fear in their hearts zufik the sultan and all the men rushed upstairs there they found the missing sifaz the pale man lifted a shaking redsmeared finger to point at zufik as all the company stared in horror he has done itthe foreigner sifaz shouted in sifazs arms lay the body of the princess rassoril a black arrow standing from her breast after fawn finished there was a long silence the boy his own courage perhaps stirred by his story seemed to sit straighter ah the vampyr said at last love and its pricesthat is the message or is it perhaps the effect of silver on the supernatural fear not i am bound by no such conventions and fear neither silver steel nor any other metal the creature made a huffing scraping sound that might have been a laugh i marveled anew even as i felt the skein of my life fraying that it had so quickly gained such command of our unfamiliar tongue well it said slowly sad but sad enough again that is the important question who is your last contestant now my heart truly went cold within me and i sat as though i had swallowed a stone walid alsalameh spoke up i am he said and took a deep breath i am the viziers story this is a true storyor so i was told it happened in my grandfathers time and he had it from someone who knew those involved he told it to me as a cautionary tale there once was an old caliph a man of rare gifts and good fortune he ruled a small country but a wealthy onea country upon which all the gifts of allah had been showered in grand measure he had the finest heir a man could have dutiful and yet courageous beloved by the people almost as extravagantly as the caliph himself he had many other fine sons and two hundred beautiful wives and an army of fighting men the envy of his neighbors his treasury was stacked roofbeamhigh with gold and gemstones and blocks of fragrant sandalwood crisscrossed with ivories and bolts of the finest cloth his palace was built around a spring of fragrant clear water and everyone said that they must be the very waters of life so fortunate and wellloved this caliph was his only sadness was that age had robbed his sight from him leaving him blind but hard as this was it was a small price to pay for allahs beneficence one day the caliph was walking in his garden smelling the exquisite fragrance of the blossoming orange trees his son the prince unaware of his fathers presence was also in the garden speaking with his mother the caliphs first and chiefest wife he is terribly old the wife said i cannot stand even to touch him anymore it is a horror to me you are right mother the son replied as the caliph hid behind the trees and listened shocked i am sickened by watching him sitting all day drooling into his bowl or staggering sightless through the palace but what are we to do i have thought on it long and hard the caliphs wife replied we owe it to ourselves and those close to us to kill him kill him the son replied well it is hard for me but i suppose you are right i still feel some love for him thoughmay we at least do it quickly so that he shall not feel pain at the end very well but do it soontonight even if i must feel his foul breath upon me one more night i will die myself tonight then the son agreed and the two walked away leaving the blind caliph shaking with rage and terror behind the orange trees he could not see what sat on the garden path behind them the object of their discussion the wifes old lapdog a scrofulous creature of extreme age thus the caliph went to his vizier the only one he was sure he could trust in a world of suddenly traitorous sons and wives and bade him to have the pair arrested and quickly beheaded the vizier was shocked and asked the reason why but the caliph only said he had unassailable proof that they intended to murder him and take his throne he bade the vizier go and do the deed the vizier did as he was directed seizing the son and his mother quickly and quietly then giving them over to the headsman after tormenting them for confessions and the names of confederates neither of which were forthcoming sadly the vizier went to the caliph and told him it was done and the old man was satisfied but soon inevitably word of what had happened spread and the brothers of the heir began to murmur among themselves about their fathers deed many thought him mad since the dead pairs devotion to the caliph was common knowledge word of this dissension reached the caliph himself and he began to fear for his life terrified that his other sons meant to emulate their treasonous brother he called the vizier to him and demanded the arrest of these sons and their beheading the vizier argued in vain risking his own life but the caliph would not be swayed at last the vizier went away returning a week later a battered shaken man it is done o prince he said all your sons are dead the caliph had only a short while in which to feel safe before the extreme wrath of the wives over the slaughter of their children reached his ears destroy them too the blind caliph insisted again the vizier went away soon to return it is done o prince he reported your wives have been beheaded soon the courtiers were crying murder and the caliph sent his vizier to see them dealt with as well it is done o prince he assured the caliph but the ruler now feared the angry townspeople so he commanded his vizier to take the army and slaughter them the vizier argued feebly then went away it is done o prince the caliph was told a month later but now the caliph realized that with his heirs and wives gone and the important men of the court dead it was the soldiers themselves who were a threat to his power he commanded his vizier to sow lies amongst them causing them to fall out and slay each other then locked himself in his room to safely outlast the conflict after a month and a half the vizier knocked upon his door it is done o prince for a moment the caliph was satisfied all his enemies were dead and he himself was locked in no one could murder him or steal his treasure or usurp his throne the only person yet alive who even knew where the caliph hid was his vizier blind he groped about for the key with which he had locked himself in better first to remove the risk that someone might trick him into coming out he pushed the key out beneath the door and told the vizier to throw it away somewhere it might never be found when the vizier returned he called him close to the locked portal that bounded his small world of darkness and safety vizier the caliph said through the keyhole i command you to go and kill yourself for you are the last one living who is a threat to me kill myself my prince the vizier asked dumbfounded kill myself correct the caliph said now go and do it that is my command there was a long silence at last the vizier said very well after that there was silence for a long time the caliph sat in his blindness and exulted for everyone he distrusted was gone his faithful vizier had carried out all his orders and now had killed himself a sudden horrible thought came to him then what if the vizier had not done what he had told him to do what if instead he had made compact with the caliphs enemies and was only reporting false details when he told of their deaths how was the caliph to know he almost swooned with fright and anxiousness at the realization at last he worked up the courage to feel his way across the locked room to the door he put his ear to the keyhole and listened he heard nothing but silence he took a breath and then put his mouth to the hole vizier he called in a shaky voice have you done what i commanded have you killed yourself it is done o prince came the reply finishing his story which was fully as dreadful as it was sad the undervizier walid lowered his head as if ashamed or exhausted we waited tensely for our guest to speak at the same time i am sure we all vainly hoped there would be no more speaking that the creature would simply vanish like a frightening dream that flees the sun rather than discuss the merits of your sad tales the black tattered shadow said at lastconfirming that there would be no waking from this dreamrather than argue the game with only one set of moves completed perhaps it is now time for me to speak the night is still youthful and my tale is not long but i wish to give you a fair time to render judgment as he spoke the creatures eyes bloomed scarlet like unfolding roses the mist curled up from the ground beyond the firecircle wrapping the vampyr in a cloak of writhing fogs a rotted black egg in a bag of silken mesh may i begin it asked but no one could say a word very well the vampyrs story the tale i will tell is of a child a child born of an ancient city on the banks of a river so long ago this was that not only has the city itself long gone to dust but the later cities built atop its ruins tiny towns and great walled fortresses of stone all these too have gone beneath the millwheels of timerendered like their predecessor into the finest of particles to blow in the wind silting the timeless rivers banks this child lived in a mud hut thatched with straw and played with his fellows in the shallows of the sluggish brown river while his mother washed the familys clothes and gossiped with her neighbors even this ancient city was built upon the bones of earlier cities and it was into the collapsed remnants of onea great tumbled mass of shattered sandstonethat the child and his friends sometimes went and it was to these ruins that the child when he was a little older almost the age of your young romantic companion took a pretty doeeyed girl it was to be his first time beyond the veilhis initiation into the mysteries of women his heart beat rapidly the girl walked ahead of him her slender brown body tigerstriped with light and shade as she walked among the broken pillars then she saw something and screamed the child came running the girl was nearly mad weeping and pointing he stopped in amazement staring at the black shrivelled thing that lay on the grounda twisted something that might have been a man once wizened and black as a piece of leather dropped into the cookfire then the thing opened its eyes the girl ran chokingbut he did not seeing that the black thing could not move the twitching of its mouth seemed that of someone trying to speak he thought he heard a faint voice asking for help begging for him to do something he leaned down to the nearsilent hiss and the thing squirmed and bit him fastening its sharp teeth like barbed fishhooks in the muscle of his leg the manchild screamed helpless and felt his blood running out into the horrible sucking mouth of the thing fetid saliva crept into the wounds and coursed hotly through his body even as he struggled against his writhing attacker the poison climbed through him and it seemed he could feel his own heart flutter and die within his chest delicate and hopeless as a broken bird with final desperate strength the child pulled free the black thing mouth gaping curled on itself and shuddered like a beetle on a hot stone a moment later it had crumbled into ashes and oily flakes but it had caught me long enough to destroy mefor of course i was that childto force its foul fluids into me leeching my humanity and replacing it with the hideous unwanted wine of immortality my childs heart became an icy fist thus was i made what i am at the hands of a dying vampyrwhich had been a creature like i am now worn down at last by the passing of millennia it had chosen a host to receive its hideous malady then diedas i shall do someday no doubt in the grip of some terrible blind insectlike urge but not soon not today so that child which had been in all ways like other childrenloved by its family loving in turn noise and games and sweetmeatsbecame a dark thing sickened by the burning light of the sun driven into the damp shadows beneath stones and the dusty gloom of abandoned places then driven out again beneath the moon by an unshakeable irresistable hunger i fed first on my familymy uncomprehending mother wept to see her child returned standing by her moonlit palletthen on the others of my city not last or least painful of my feedings was on the darkhaired girl who had run when i stayed behind i slashed other throats too and lapped up warm seasalty blood while the trapped child inside me cried without a sound it was as though i stood behind a screen unable to leave or interfere as terrible crimes were committed before me and thus the years have passed sand grains deposited along the riverbank uncountable in their succession every one has contained a seeming infinitude of killings each one terrible despite their numbing similarity only the blood of mankind will properly feed me and a hundred generations have known terror of me strong as i am virtually immortal unkillable as far as i know or can tellblades pass through me like smoke fire water poison none affect mestill the light of the sun causes a pain to me so excruciating that you with only mortal lives whose pain at least eventually ends in death cannot possibly comprehend it thus kingdoms of men have risen and fallen to ashes since i last saw daylight think only on that for a moment if you seek sad stories i must be in darkness when the sun rises so as i range in search of prey my accommodations are shared with toads and slugs bats and blindworms people can be nothing to me anymore but food i know of none other like myself save the dying creature who spawned me the smell of my own corruption is in my nostrils always so there is all of my tale i cannot die until my time is come and who can know when that is until then i will be alone alone as no mere man can ever be alone with my wretchedness and evil and selfdisgust until the world collapses and is born anew the vampyr rose now towering up like a black sail billowing in the wind spreading its vast arms or wings on either side as if to sweep us before it how do your stories compare to this it cried the harshness of its speech seemed somehow muted even as it grew louder and louder whose is the saddest story then there was pain in that hideous voice that tore at even my fastpounding heart whose is saddest tell me it is time to judge and in that moment of all the moments when lying could save my life i could not lie i turned my face away from the quivering black shadow that thing of rags and red eyes none of the others around the campfire spokeeven abdallah the clerk only sat hugging his knees teeth chattering eyes bulging with fear i thought so the thing said at last i thought so night wind tossed the treelimbs above our heads and it seemed as though beyond them stood only ultimate darknessno sky no stars nothing but unending emptiness very well the vampyr said at last your silence speaks all i have won there was not the slightest note of triumph in its voice give me my prize and then i may let the rest of you flee my mountains the dark shape withdrew a little way we all of us turned to look at one another and it was just as well that the night veiled our faces i started to speak but ibn fahad interrupted me his voice a tortured rasp let there be no talk of volunteering we will draw lots that is the only way quickly he cut a thin branch into five pieces one of them shorter than the rest and cupped them in a closed hand pick he said i will keep the last as a part of me wondered what madness it was that had left us wagering on storytelling and drawing lots for our lives we each took a length from ibn fahads fist i kept my hand closed while the others selected not wanting to hurry allah toward his revelation of my fate when all had selected we extended our hands and opened them palms up fawn had selected the short stick strangely there was no sign of his awful fortune on his face he showed no signs of griefindeed he did not even respond to our helpless words and prayers only stood up and slowly walked toward the huddled black shape at the far edge of the clearing the vampyr rose to meet him no came a sudden cry and to our complete surprise the clerk abdallah leaped to his feet and went pelting across the open space throwing himself between the youth and the looming shadow he is too young abdallah shouted sounding truly anguished do not do this horrible thing take me instead ibn fahad the vizier and i could only sit struck dumb by this unexpected behavior but the creature moved swiftly as a viper smacking abdallah to the ground with one flicking gesture you are indeed mad you shortlived men the vampyr hissed this one would do nothing to save himselfnot once did i hear his voice raised in taletellingyet now he would throw himself into the jaws of death for this other mad the monster left abdallah choking on the ground and turned to silent fawn come you i have won the contest and you are the prize i am sorry it must be this way a great swath of darkness enveloped the youth drawing him in come the vampyr said think of the better world you go tothat is what you believe is it not well soon you shall the creature broke off why do you look so strangely manchild the thing said at last its voice troubled you cry but i see no fear why are you not afraid of dying fawn answered his tones were oddly distracted have you really lived so long and alone always alone i told you i have no reason to lie do you think to put me off with your strange questions ah how could the good god be so unmerciful the words were made of sighs the dark shape that embraced him stiffened do you cry for me for me how can i help the boy said even allah must weep for you for such a pitiful thing lost in the lonely darkness for a moment the night air seemed to pulse then with a wrenching gasp the creature flung the youth backward so that he stumbled and fell before us landing atop the groaning abdallah go the vampyr shrieked and its voice cracked and boomed like thunder get you gone from my mountains go amazed we pulled fawn and the chiefclerk to their feet and went stumbling down the hillside branches lashing at our faces and hands expecting any moment to hear the rush of wings and feel cold breath on our necks build your houses well little men a voice howled like the wild wind behind us my life is long and someday i may regret letting you go we ran and ran until it seemed the life would flee our bodies until our lungs burned and our feet blistered and until the topmost sliver of the sun peered over the eastern summits masrur aladan allowed the tales ending to hang in silence for a span of thirty heartbeats then pushed his chair away from the table we escaped the mountains the next day he said within a season we were back in baghdad the only survivors of the caravan to the armenites aaaahh breathed young hassan a long drawnout sound full of wonder and apprehension what a marvelous terrifying adventure i would never have survived it myself how frightening and did the the creature did he really say he might come back someday masrur solemnly nodded his large head upon my soul am i not right ibn fahad my old comrade ibn fahad yielded a thin smile seemingly of affirmation yes masrur continued those words chill me to this very day many is the night i have sat in this room looking at that door he pointed wondering if someday it may open to show me that terrible misshapen black thing come back from hell to make good on our wager merciful allah hassan gasped abu jamir leaned across the table as the other guests whispered excitedly he wore a look of annoyance good hassan he snapped kindly calm yourself we are all grateful to our host masrur for entertaining us but it is an insult to sensible godly men to suggest that at any moment some blooddrinking afreet may knock down the door and carry us the door leaped open with a crash revealing a hideous twisted shape looming in the entrance redsplattered and trembling the shrieking of masrurs guests filled the room master the dark silhouette quavered baba held a wine jar balanced on one shoulder the other had broken at his feet splashing abu jamirs prize stock everywhere master he began again i am afraid i have dropped one masrur looked down at abu jamir who lay pitched fulllength on the floor insensible ah well thats all right baba masrur smiled twirling his black mustache we wont have to make the wine go so far as i thoughtit seems my storytelling has put some of our guests to sleep lifeblood by michael a burstein michael a burstein is a tentime finalist for the hugo award and the winner of the john w campbell award for best new writer his fiction frequently appears in analog science fiction fact magazine and much of his short work was recently collected in i remember the future from apex publications lifeblood takes the vampire mythos out of its usual christian context and adds judaism to the equation ive always been interested in the question of how someone who doesnt use the cross as a religious symbol would turn a vampire burstein said i was interested in the specific question of how a jewish person might turn a vampire could he or she use a cross would a jewish symbol have any sort of power although burstein originally wrote the story just to play with the concept of jews vs vampires the story ended up being a cautionary tale about the dangers of assimilation a lot of debate takes place among the jewish people especially american jews about assimilating into the overall culture he said without my realizing it lifeblood turned out to display my own biases in the debate lincoln kliman burst into the synagogue causing the cantor at the front of the room to halt his chanting momentarily lincoln panted catching his breath and the congregants turned to look at him he knew his disheveled appearance would not endear him to them and he noticed one or two of the congregants scowling the cantor resumed his hebrew chant and lincoln took a moment to study the synagogue it wasnt a synagogue really just a small room where these particular jews gathered to pray there were three rows of folding chairs set up mostly empty of people which gave the room an aura of despair at least for lincoln he was used to much more elaborate synagogues but then again he hadnt been in one for over fifteen years he counted the number of congregants ten men exactly the minimum number of jews required for a minyan technically lincoln s presence made the number eleven he approached a man sitting alone in the back row bent over and murmuring to himself pardon me he said but the man looked up from his siddur his prayer book and waved his hand to quiet lincoln shush he said put on a yarmulka lincoln nodded and went to the back of the room to don a skullcap another thing he hadnt done in a very long time he sat down next to the man and said as quietly as he could i must speak with the cantor its important the man glared at him you must wait were about to do the alenu the service will be over soon his tone was accusatory as if he was questioning lincoln s right to show up at the end of a service lincoln wondered that himself but felt better when he realized that he still remembered to stand and bow at the appropriate times he didnt pray though the man next to him offered his siddur but lincoln shook his head he couldnt read hebrew anymore even well enough to pronounce the words let alone understand them true to the mans word the service ended in a few minutes the congregants began folding the chairs and stacking them up next to the wall lincoln muttered excuse me to his row companion and darted to the front of the room the cantor was just removing his tallis his prayer shawl when lincoln approached he was an old man slightly stooped with a pair of round glasses on his face despite the fact that lincoln had interrupted him before the cantor smiled as he folded his tallis good shabbes he said he spoke with a slight hungarian accent lincoln repeated the phrase it echoed oddly in his ears good shabbes cantor erno gross how may i help you lincoln s eyes darted around the room two congregants were opening boxes of little pastries and setting them out on a table and speaking in a language lincoln didnt recognize another man hummed and poured small cups of red wine out of a dark bottle lincoln almost shuddered at that but controlled himself cantor where is your rabbi i need to speak with him the cantor sighed unfortunately we have no rabbi rabbi weinberg a dear friend of mine was the last rabbi to serve this congregation we are a small group and so cant offer a new rabbi enough of an incentive to join us on a permanent basis not that one is needed for a service you must know lincoln felt embarrassed actually i didnt know but if you have no rabbi then all hope is lost the others he shook his head perhaps all is not lost said the cantor he put his hand on lincoln s shoulder perhaps i can help you mister kliman with a long i lincoln kliman lincoln an odd name for a jew lincoln shrugged my father was a historian studied american history he was used to explaining it very well mr kliman how can i help you not here can we go talk alone some lincoln was interrupted by shouts of erno the cantor said excuse me a moment i must make kiddush he gave lincoln an odd look unless you would rather do the honors lincoln felt his face flush uh no thank you cantor i really would rather not the cantor nodded at least take a cup of wine lincoln assented and tried not to look uncomfortable as the cantor began chanting kiddush and the others joined in the only words he remembered was the last part of the blessing over wine borai pri hagafen and after the cantor sang it lincoln chorused amen with the rest of the congregation the wine tasted sweet going down his throat lincoln walked over to a small bookcase afterwards studying the titles as the cantor circulated among the congregation one by one the elderly men put on their coats and left the room until finally the cantor came over to lincoln i believe you wanted to talk with me alone he said yes thank you what can i do for you mr kliman lincoln looked into the cantors eyes there is a boy my son hes very sick sick shouldnt you be fetching a doctor and not a rabbi unless the cantor looked grim its not that kind of illness not physical spiritual lincoln thought for a moment cantor may i ask you a question certainly have you studied kabakabajewish mysticism kabala why do you ask you believe in god right lincoln blurted the cantor looked shocked an impudent question mr kliman but yes of course i believe in god i devoted my life to helping the jewish people practice our religion there was a chastising tone in his voice lincoln noticed that he slightly stressed the word our i didnt mean to question your faith cantor lincoln said i just dont want you to think im crazy i needed to know that you can accept the possibility of something out there that you have no direct evidence for somethingsomething mystical as a jew the cantor said i have all the evidence i need for god in seeing the wonders of the earth each and every day i rise from bed with praise of him on my lips and i go to sleep the same way that does not necessarily mean that i will believe in anything at all mr kliman im sorry i didnt mean to offend you its just thatwell i needed to find a religious man a religious leader and i didnt feel comfortable going to a catholic priest i thought a rabbi could help as well help with what mr kliman you barge in here claim to be worried about your son and then question my faith what do you need my help with lincoln looked down at his shoes for a moment and wrung his hands ill have to trust you my sons been bitten and i need you to lift the curse bitten by a dog better to see a doctor no not a dog cantor my son joseph has been bitten three times by a vampire and unless i can find a cure by sundown tonight hes going to turn into one himself an hour later lincoln and the cantor arrived at lincoln s apartment building it would have taken only ten minutes if they had driven but the cantor would not ride on the sabbath and so lincoln left his car parked at the synagogue although it was early spring the weather was cold and overcast and lincoln had to bundle himself up in his thin jacket as best as he could while they walked when they got to his building the cantor also refused to take the elevator up to lincoln s ninth floor apartment so they slowly climbed the stairs the cantor had been decidedly uncommunicative during the walk over but as they ascended he began to ask lincoln about the boy tell me exactly what it is you think happened you dont believe me do you the cantor shrugged that remains to be seen but i will tell you this much i find what you describe hard to believe lincoln sighed well youve trusted me this far at least i appreciate that the others refused to even listen to me the others lincoln felt his cheeks redden yours wasnt the first synagogue i went to cantor i tried a reform temple and a conservative synagogue first but neither of the rabbis believed me they wouldnt help the cantor nodded stopped at a landing to catch his breath the boy he prodded yes the boy joseph is a pretty good kid does well in school and all that but recently has been acting very independent hes just turned twelve you know what that means the cantor shook his head go on anyway it started when joseph came home very late from school three weeks ago its only a few blocks away and ive let him run around the neighborhood before i mean i grew up in new york as well and i never got in serious trouble but this time he didnt call dont you meet him after school to bring him home i cant i work what about the boys mother lincoln looked away from the cantor gone these past five years oh i am sorry mr kliman thanks its been hard raising joseph on my own anyway he finally did come home that night well after sundown and he looked terrible his color was bad and he looked sick to his stomach i thought it was food poisoning as he smelled like hed been to a fast food place you know that cheeseburger smell the cantor glared at him no i do not know lincoln felt embarrassed again right well anyway he practically passed out when he came in the door and i rushed him to the doctor nu what did he find anemia loss of blood that and two tiny pinpricks on josephs neck hm did he say anything about that no he gave joseph a shot of something chastised him and me over drug use and that was all only thing is he didnt find drugs in josephs system joseph refused to answer my questions about where he was that night and the next day he acted like he had forgotten the whole thing his color had returned though and he ate a big breakfast so i let him go to school the next day he came home on time and i thought that would be the end of it i presume it was not well it was for about a week then the same thing happened he came home late looking very sick and he almost passed out before i could get him to bed the cantors eyebrows shot up you didnt bring him to the doctor this time lincoln shook his head no i didnt i know what youre thinking but after that first time i didnt want the doctor to chastise me again and did you send joseph to school again the next day no because it was saturday a week ago today that makes two bites the third one was last night same pattern only this time joseph told me the full story apparently the vampire yes the cantor prodded lincoln whispered id rather not say lets just say that she promised to show joseph a good time and being the adolescent that he is i understand you need not elaborate they had reached the door to lincoln s apartment and lincoln let them in the room was dark lincoln turned on the light and then pulled his hand back from the switch sorry i forgot no lights on shabbat right no using electricity replied the cantor but you can leave lights on from the day before where is the boy this way lincoln showed the cantor through the living room to a small bedroom they entered and closed the door behind them it was dark inside a small figure writhed under the blankets of the bed im not going to turn the lights on in here joseph asked me not to he says it hurts his eyes the boy moaned from under the blankets dad is that you yes joseph and ive brought help joseph coughed im so sorry dad i dont know what got into me lily promised so much pleasure but this is all pain its okay son to the cantor he said please look at him youll see that i didnt lie to you then maybe you can tell me what to do the cantor approached the bed and slowly removed the sheets all he could make out was the outline of a shivering child joseph i will need light to see you may i open the shades yes the boy replied weakly but please be quick he moaned again the cantor pulled up a window shade allowing sunlight to fall upon joseph who screamed it hurts it hurts its too hot make it stop quiet joseph lincoln said itll only be for a second he opened the window and a breeze drifted in there that will cool you off the cantor turned back to joseph who quieted down but was clearly in great pain the boys face was pale but his lips were a bright red and there was a reddish tinge in his eyes the cantor cupped the boys chin in his hand and pulled open his mouth his canine teeth were half an inch long and glowing brightly in a sickening mixture of orange red and white he jerked his hand away and the boys head fell to the pillow dear lord you were right a few minutes later lincoln and the cantor sat across from each other in the living room where they could talk joseph had passed out again and lincoln had restored the bedroom to darkness for his sons comfort i find it difficult to believe that a jew could be turned into a vampire even if he were bitten by one possession by a dybbuk perhaps but not transformation into a vampire vampires are not part of the jewish kabala they are part of christian lore not jewish they should only be able to affect christians perhaps said lincoln slowly its because joseph has not yet been bar mitzvahed he wont turn thirteen until next year the cantor looked startled that doesnt make sense at all one does not become jewish when one is bar mitzvah you are jewish at birth and you join the covenant at the age of eight days lincoln s eyes lit up cantor cant you do it anyway do what bar mitzvah the boy so hell be an adult maybe thats the key to saving him the cantor gave lincoln a hard stare mr kliman you seem to be under the impression that a bar mitzvah ceremony is a magical ritual that will establish the boy as jewish and render him immune to the vampirism bar mitzvah is not a ceremony it happens to a jewish boy at the age of thirteen even if no ceremony occurs all it means is that the jew becomes responsible for his own actions in the eyes of god it is akin to turning eighteen and becoming an adult in the eyes of the law cantor gross lincoln leaned forward he felt tears on the side of his face joseph is my only son my only family he is all that i have left i beg of you would you please do this you dont know that it isnt the thing to do it may save him the cantor looked deep into lincoln s eyes there is nothing logical in your request but i must agree i dont know that it wont work he stood up let me return to the synagogue and get a siddur and chumash chumash lincoln asked the torah mr kliman with all the passages we recite aloud on shabbat as the year progresses surely you know what the torah is yes lincoln said quietly very well the cantor said as he headed towards the door i shall return soon and with gods help we shall teach the boy to fight the curse of the dead with the ancient songs of life repeat after me joseph baruch atah baruch atah the boy said weakly no said the cantor sing it as i am why do i have to sing it hurts so much it is a hasidic custom joseph it will help you concentrate your thoughts to the spiritual task at hand listen again lincoln closed the door of the bedroom behind him and sat down to read the song of the cantor filtered out through the closed door haunting and lilting it was a chant that went up and down in pitch but always seemed to hover around the same notes its effects were so hypnotic that lincoln forwent his book closed his eyes and leaned back to contemplate the past he remembered his own bar mitzvah ceremony and the agony that led up to it for almost half a year every wednesday afternoon he had gone to the cantors office to learn his torah portion the verses of the torah that he would be expected to sing on the saturday morning of the ceremony lincoln s voice was not good and its cracking had embarrassed him finally the day arrived he had stood in front of a large synagogue filled with his parents friends and a few of his own he was called to the torah and trembling with nervousness somehow he had managed to get through it the very next week his parents pulled him out of hebrew school they had never been particularly religious anyway lincoln s bar mitzvah had been solely a social thing and once it was over they had felt no need for lincoln to continue his jewish studies perhaps they had been mistaken lincoln blinked and realized that he was back in his apartment he was surprised to see that many hours had passed the cantors music had been so powerful that it had felt to lincoln as if he had actually been sent back in time to relive his own bar mitzvah he strained to hear the final words of song coming from his sons bedroom nosain hatoraah was that his sons voice sounding so strong a minute later the cantor opened the door and approached lincoln he had a sad look on his face it did not work i helped the boy sing todays parsha with the appropriate blessings before and after but it did not work he sat down across from lincoln and said i did not think it would but your musicyour singingso beautiful the cantor nodded thank you but it takes more than beautiful singing to ward off a curse he leaned back removed his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose i still do not understand how this is possible mr kliman how a jew could be turned into a vampire nothing in our history in our legends would account for it a jew simply cannot become a vampire lincoln coughed and cleared his throat ummm the cantor peered at him what is it mr kliman was there something you did not tell me well lincoln shifted in his seat cantor i didnt want to admit this before but he trailed off but what how can i help the boy if you dont tell me what i need to know josephs not jewish he blurted out there was a moment of silence you are jewish are you not the cantor asked yes lincoln whispered then his mother she wasnt the cantor sighed oy you know that by jewish law the boy follows the religion of the mother what was she lincoln shrugged i dont know christian of some sort i guess we were both agnostic when we met and i never really bothered to find out since we never celebrated any holidays anyway you lied to me mr kliman you said your son was jewish i know im sorry but like i said i would never have felt comfortable asking a priest or a reverend for help i may not practice my religion much cantor but i would never the cantor interrupted a thought occurs to me was the boy ever circumcised well yes by a doctor in the hospital when the cantor leaped out of his seat startling lincoln that may be it he marched towards the bedroom door what may be it lincoln asked the cantor stopped short and turned back to lincoln the boy may yet be saved the vampirism is affecting him because technically he is not jewish and yet he has your jewish blood within him so i shall make the vampire think he is jewish you mean i mean that i shall convert him lincoln sputtered butbuti thought conversion was something that took study and time the cantor gave him an odd look you know little of the ways of your own people and yet you are familiar with the conversion ceremony umits a long story my wife wasnt jewish but my parents wanted her to convert the cantor nodded a familiar pattern the parents who never teach their child about judaism and are surprised when he chooses to marry outside the tribe at any rate you are correct a real conversion requires the person converting to study judaism and present his or her knowledge to a bes din a court of three rabbis a man must undergo circumcision or if he is already circumcised a tiny drop of blood is sufficient then he must be brought to the mikvah the ritual pool to be immersed and to make a blessing that declares his decision to become jewish and none of this can be done on shabbes but time here is of the essence mr kliman as the boys life is in danger and god is not without mercy there is a principle called pikuach nefesh which states that saving a life overrides all else indeed the talmud states that he who saves a life it is as if he has saved the entire world i will teach the boy the proper blessings perform the proper rituals i am sure that once the boy is saved you will take steps to ensure that his conversion remains valid otherwise the vampirism may return lincoln nodded weakly if you save joseph i will do anything hes all i have the cantor nodded back and opened the door to josephs bedroom just before entering he said ironic isnt it what the vampire has been drawing blood to doom the boy now i shall draw blood to save him lincoln couldnt stand the sight of blood but he had to know what was going on so after a few minutes of pacing around the apartment and saying what prayers he could recall he entered josephs bedroom the cantor sat on the bed next to joseph holding his hand and cradling his head joseph was crying but his color seemed better joseph was singing something along with the cantor that lincoln did not recognize the cantor stopped when he saw lincoln good joseph very good he said to the boy keep singing he stood up and walked over to lincoln the boy has a way to go but i believe it is working i have him reciting the psalms how much longer lincoln asked i am not sure but he is getting better yes butcantor have you had a chance to look out the window the cantor turned to the window it was dark outside shabbes is over i must recite havdalah thats not exactly what i meant are you sure joseph will be cured according to legend since hes been bitten three times and sundown has now come the cantor smiled fear not mr kliman your son should be fine i dont think there is anything more you need to a loud bang at the window startled the three of them and lincoln looked up for a moment he thought he saw a bat but then smoke swirled around it and into the room blocking his vision oh god oh no oh no oh no the smoke curled around the window and coalesced into a pretty woman with long blonde hair falling over her shoulders she wore a white vneck sweater cut low enough to display her cleavage and a pair of tight blue jeans she smelled of sweet perfume she looked around the room her red eyes peering out over a pair of dark sunglasses lincoln shouted go away we havent invited you in ah but the boy has and i have come for the boy said the vampire she smiled displaying two prominent canine teeth he is mine you cant have him shouted lincoln he rushed at the vampire who laughed and turned to smoke just as lincoln got to where she had been standing lincoln lost his balance and almost fell out the window but the cantor grabbed him the vampire reformed at the bed hello joseph she reached her hand out to josephs head joseph recoiled a look of horror upon his face keep her away joseph shouted why joseph is that the way to treat your good friend lily she cupped his chin and stared into his eyes are you ready to come with me to become one of us the cantor walked over to the bed and spoke directly into the vampires ear you are too late he intoned the boy is lost to you i have ensured it depart the vampire laughed do you think i have not dealt with these last minute conversions before i look into the boy and i see the soul of an agnostic he has no belief in the god of the jews i have encountered many of his type before brought up unprotected from my magic he is mine for the taking why do you want him lincoln asked why cant you leave him alone she grinned at lincoln showing her long canine teeth he shuddered because he is so easy to take so defenseless as are so many of your sons she turned away bent over the boy and began to kiss him all over his face come joseph she crooned forget this religious nonsense your dad didnt let it stop him from marrying out of the faith why should it stop you your friends are waiting for you joseph it is time to join us lincoln felt a chill at the back of his neck and he turned around to look back at the window there were definitely figures out there dark silhouettes hovering outside waiting for joseph to join them entranced by his fear of what lay outside he barely heard josephs next words yes lily it is time to join our friends he began to lift himself out of the bed no shouted the cantor joseph dont listen to her what about all you have gone through today joseph snarled you dont understand lily and her friends have shown me so much of the world i never knew weve gone out and had so much fun every night i want to live in her world lincoln broke out of his trance no he screamed and rushed at the vampire she changed into a bat this time and lincoln stopped short the transformation was too frightening lincoln shouted the cantor grab her lincoln broke out of his trance of fear and lunged at the bat which flew away from him to the other side of the room now the cantor shouted and jumped to josephs side joseph you must sing you must sing the ancient melodies that will protect you from this evil creature or you will become like her you must sing of your faith your belief in the lord sing joseph sing with me the cantor began to sing in sepulchral tones mizmor ldavid repeat it joseph no i he grabbed joseph by the shoulders and shook him come to your senses her world offers you nothing but corruption you shall lose everything that defines who you are joseph your background your ancestorsyou will never see your father again my father he said weakly i love my father then sing mizmor ldavid mizmor ldavid joseph sang in a faint imitation of the cantors voice louder joseph listen to the tune hashem roi lo echsar binot desheh yarbitzaini al me minuchos yinahalayni joseph repeated the song more strongly this time the bat turned back into a woman no she whispered stop lincoln blinked his eyes in surprise as joseph and the cantor sang the room started to glow with a faint yellow light it was a soft comforting glow like that of the afternoon sun in a perfect blue sky no said the vampire much more weakly stop joseph if i ever meant anything to you stop she crouched down and covered her eyes with her arm noticing this lincoln realized that the light had distracted him he turned his attention back to the song and discovered with surprise that he now understood the hebrew words he knew what they meant translating them instantly as they were sung gam ki aylech bgai tsalmavet lo eireh ra ki atah imadi joseph sang though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i fear no evil for you are with me shivtcha umishantecha haymah ynachamuni thy rod and thy staff they comfort me the glow became brighter emanating from all around but as they finished singing it started to gather around the forms of joseph and the cantor the light became so bright and hot that lincoln followed the vampires lead and shielded his eyes then lincoln heard the song change without any prompting from the cantor joseph began singing another psalm he listened carefully omar ladoshem machsee umtsudati elokai evtach bo kee hu yahtseelcha meepach yakoosh midever havot i say of the lord my refuge and stronghold my god in whom i trust that he will save you from the fowlers trap from the destructive plague lincoln opened his eyes and looked over his arm was the light starting to move towards the vampire lo teera meepachad lailah you need not fear the terror by night the light began to coalesce around the vampire she screamed joseph no meedever baofel yahaloch the plague that stalks in the darkness the light surrounded her completely so brightly that her form was completely covered her screams became softer muffled joseph stopped singing begone the cantor and he said in unison lincoln heard one more loud scream and the light flared up forcing him to cover his eyes again when the light faded from beyond his arm he looked up again and noticed three things in succession first he saw joseph lying on his bed asleep with all the normal color back in his face second he saw the cantor holding up in front of him a silver magen david a star of david finally he looked to where the vampire had last stood all that was left of her was a pile of black dust and a pair of sunglasses perhaps she was sent to test you mr kliman perhaps not i would not even guess it was monday afternoon two days later and lincoln had stopped by the synagogue to thank the cantor once again at any rate cantor it was your music that saved my son and your star of david i owe you my eternal gratitude cantor gross shook his head slightly and smiled it was not merely my music mr kliman but what my music represented where it came from as for the star of david it has absolutely no religious significance at all but i counted on the vampire not knowing that and i was right in short i think your gratitude is well meant but misplaced yes well cantor i need to get back home now i want to check on joseph lincoln turned to go but the cantor gripped him by the arm mr kliman remember what we went through a few nights ago what joseph went through do not take his pseudoconversion lightly and assume that he is now safe the vampirism may still return what do you suggest lincoln asked softly the cantor looked him directly in the eye start bringing the boy to synagogue if you are not comfortable with this place then bring him to one easier for you to accept but do bring him to one let him build up an understanding an appreciation of his background his culture his religion lincoln pulled his arm away ill consider it he said and to his surprise realized that he was speaking sincerely the cantor nodded it would be best for the boy to develop his own beliefs his own defenses remember mr kliman religion protects us from the many vampires of the world lincoln nodded and walked out it was a cold day and he sneezed when he got outside he reached into his coat pocket and found the yarmulka that he had been told to wear when he first entered the synagogue he had forgotten to return it he looked back at the synagogue for a moment then returned the yarmulka to his pocket and walked home perhaps he would find use for it soon endless night by barbara roden barbara roden along with her husband christopher roden is the proprietor of ashtree press together they are also the editors of several anthologies including acquainted with the night which won the world fantasy award barbara is also the editor of all hallows the journal of the ghost story society her first collection of short stories northwest passages will be published by prime books in october this story which first appeared in exotic gothic is about an expedition to antarctica in the golden age of south polar exploration the days of shackleton amundsen scott and mawson however when the expedition has to replace a crew member at the last moment it becomes apparent his replacement has his own reasons for wanting to go to a continent where theres no daylight for months on end the story asks how would you feel in such an isolated setting if you became convinced there was someone present who wasnt supposed to be there and how would you feel if in order to ensure the survival of yourself and everyone else you had to do something which goes against all your values and beliefs thank you so much for speaking with me and for these journals which have never seen the light of day im honoured that youd entrust them to me thats quite all right emily edwards smiled a delighted smile like a child surveying an unexpected and particularly wonderful present i dont receive very many visitors and old people do like speaking about the past noshe held up a hand to stop himi am old not elderly not getting on nor any of the other euphemisms people use these days when one has passed ones centenary old is the only word which applies well your stories were fascinating miss edwards as i said there are so few people alive now who remember these men another smile gentle this time one of the unfortunate things about living to my age is that all the people one knew in any meaningful or intimate way have died there is no one left with whom i can share these things perhaps that is why i have so enjoyed this talk it brings them all back to me sir ernest such a charismatic man even when he was obviously in illhealth and worried about money i used to thrill to his stories to hear him talk of that desperate crossing of south georgia island to stromness of how they heard the whistle at the whaling station and knew that they were so very close to being saved and then deciding to take a treacherous route down the slope to save themselves a fivemile hike when they were near exhaustion he would drop his voice then and say to me miss emilyhe always called me miss emily which was the name of his wife as you know it made me feel very grownup even though i was only elevenmiss emily i do not know how we did it yet afterwards we all said the same thing those three of us who made that crossing that there had been another with us a secret one who guided our steps and brought us to safety i used to think it a very comforting story when i was a child but nowi am not as sure why not for a moment he thought that she had not heard her eyes which until that moment had been sharp and blue as antarctic ice dimmed reflecting each of her hundredandone years as she gazed at her fathers photograph on the wall opposite he had an idea that she was not even with him in her comfortable room that she was instead back in the parlour of her parents home in north london ninety years earlier listening to ernest shackleton talk of his miraculous escape after the sinking of the endurance or her fathers no less amazing tales of his own antarctic travels he was about to get up and start putting away his recording equipment when she spoke as i told you my father would gladly speak about his time in antarctica with the mawson and shackleton expeditions but of the james wentworth expedition aboard the fortitude in he rarely talked he used to become quite angry with me if i mentioned it and i learned not to raise the subject i will always remember one thing he did say of it it was hard to know how many people were there i sometimes felt that there were too many of us and it would be frightening to think in that place where so few people are that there was another with you who should not be the statement did not appear to require an answer for which the thin man in jeans and rumpled sweater was glad instead he said if you remember anything else or if by chance you should come across those journals from the expedition please do contact me miss edwards yes i have your card emily nodded towards the small table beside her where a crisp white card lay beside a small ceramic tabby cat crouched as if eyeing a mouse in its hole her gaze rested on it for a moment before she picked it up i had this when i was a child i carried it with me everywhere its really a wonder that it has survived this long she gazed at it for a moment a halfsmile on her lips sir ernest said that it put him in mind of mrs chippy the ships cat her smile faded he was always very sorry you know about what he had to do and sorry that it caused an estrangement between him and mr mcnish he felt that the carpenter never forgave him for having mrs chippy and the pups shot before they embarked on their journey in the boats it was rather cruel though wasnt it a cat after all what harm could there have been in taking it with them ah well emily set it carefully back down on the table i thought that too when i was young but now i see that sir ernest was quite right there was no room for sentimentality or personal feeling his task was to ensure that his men survived sometimes to achieve that hard decisions must be made one must put ones own feelings and inclinations aside and act for the greater good he sensed a closing as of something else she might have said but had decided against no matter it had been a most productive afternoon at the door emily smiled as she shook his hand i look forward to reading your book when it comes out wellhe paused somewhat embarrassedit wont be out for a couple of years yet these things take time and im still at an early stage in my researches emily laughed a lovely sound like bells chiming oh i do not plan on going anywhere just yet you must bring me a copy when it is published and let me read again about those long ago days the past where everything has already happened and there can be no surprises can be a very comforting place when one is old it was past six oclock when the writer left but emily was not hungry she made a pot of tea then took her cup and saucer into the main room and placed it on the table by her chair beside the ceramic cat she looked at it for a moment and ran a finger down its back as if stroking it then she picked up the card and considered it for a few moments i think that i was right not to show him she said as if speaking to someone else present in the room i doubt that he would have understood it is for the best thus reminded however she could not easily forget she crossed the room to a small rosewood writing desk in one corner unlocked it and pulled down the front panel revealing tidily arranged cubbyholes and drawers of various sizes with another key she unlocked the largest of the drawers and withdrew from it a notebook bound in leather much battered and weathered as with long use in difficult conditions she returned with it to her armchair but it was some minutes before she opened it and when she did it was with an air almost of sadness she ran her fingers over the faded ink of the words on the first page robert james edwards science officer hms fortitude no she said aloud as if continuing her last conversation there can be no surprises about the past everything there has happened one would like to think it happened for the best but we can never be sure and that is not comforting at all then she opened the journal and began to read from it even though the story was an old one which she knew by heart november a relief to be here in hobart on the brink of starting the final leg of our sea voyage the endless days of fundraising organisation and meetings in london are well behind us and the guvnor is in high spirits and as usual has infected everyone with his enthusiasm he called us all together this morning and said that of the hundreds upon hundreds of men who had applied to take part in the expedition when it was announced in england we had been handpicked and that everything he has seen on the journey thus far has reinforced the rightness of his choices but that the true test is still to comein the journey across the great southern ocean and along the uncharted coast of antarctica we will be seeing sights that no human has yet viewed and will if all goes to plan be in a position to furnish exact information which will be of inestimable value to those who come after us chief among this information will be noting locations where future parties can establish camps so that they might use these as bases for exploring the great heart of this unknown land and perhaps even establishing a preliminary base for mawsons push rumoured to be taking place in a years time we are not tasked with doing much in the way of exploring ourselves save in the vicinity of any base we do establish but we have the dogs and sledges to enable us at least to make brief sorties into that mysterious continent and i think that all the men are as eager as i to set foot where no man has ever trodden of course we all realise the dangers inherent in this voyage none more so than the guvnor who today enjoined anyone who had the least doubt to say so now while there was still an opportunity to leave needless to say no one spoke until richards gave a cry of three cheers for the fortitude and all who sail in her a cheer which echoed to the very skies and set the dogs barking on the deck so furiously that the guvnor singled out castleton and called goodnaturedly castleton quiet your dogs down theres a good chap or we shall have the neighbours complaining which elicited a hearty laugh from all november such a tumultuous fortyeight hours we have not seen on this voyage and i earnestly hope that the worst is now behind us two days ago the guvnor was praising his handpicked crew and i too was thinking how our party had pulled together on the trip from plymouth which boded well i thought for the trials which surely face us and now we have said farewell to one of our number and made room for another chadwick whose excellent meals brightened the early part of our voyage is to be left in hobart following a freakish accident which none could have foreseen he having been knocked down in the street by a runaway horse and cart his injuries are not thank heaven life threatening but are sufficient to make it impossible for him to continue as part of the expedition it is undoubtedly a very serious blow to the fabric of our party but help has arrived in the form of charles de vere who was actually present when the accident occurred and was apparently instrumental in removing the injured man to a place of safety following the incident he came by the ship the next day to enquire after chadwick and was invited aboard upon meeting with the guvnor he disclosed that he has himself worked as a ships cook having reached hobart in that capacity the long and the short of it is that after a long discussion the guvnor has offered him chadwicks place on the expedition and de vere has accepted needs must when the devil drives the guvnor said to me somewhat ruefully when de vere had left to collect his things we cant do without a cook ah well we have a few days more here in hobart and shall see how this de vere works out what the guvnor did not addbut was i know uppermost in his mindis that a few days on board a ship at dockside is a very different proposition to what we shall be facing once we depart we must all hope for the best november we are set to leave tomorrow the last of the supplies have been loaded the last visiting dignitary has toured the ship and departedglad no doubt to be going home safe to down pillows and a comfortable bedand the men have written their last letters home to be posted when the fortitude has left they are the final words we shall be able to send our loved ones before our return whenever that will be and a thin thread of melancholy pervades the ship tonight i have written to mary and enclosed a message for sweet little emily by the time i return home she will have changed greatly from the little girlscarcely more than a babe in armswhom i left she will not remember her father but she and mary are never far from my mind and their photographs gaze down at me from the tiny shelf in my cabin keeping watch over me as i sleep i said that the men had written their last letters home but there was one exception de vere had no letters to give me and while i made no comment he obviously noted my surprise for he gave a wintry smile i said my goodbyes long ago was all he said and i did not press him for there is something about his manner that discourages chatter not that he is standoffish or unfriendly rather there is an air about him as of a person who has spent a good deal of time alone and has thus become a solitude unto himself the guvnor is pleased with him though and i must say that the mans cooking is superb he spends most of his time in the tiny galley to acquaint himself with his new domain he told me the results coming from it indicate that he is putting his time to good use although i hope he will not have many occasions to favour us with seal consommé or penguin à la emperor castleton had the largest batch of letters to send i found him on the deck as usual near the kennels of his charges he is as protective of his dogs as a mother is of her children and with good cause for on these halfwild creatures the sledge teams shall depend his control over them is quite wonderful some of the men are inclined to distrust the animals which seem as akin to the domesticated dogs we all know as tigers are to tabby cats none more so than de vere who i notice gives them a wide berth on the rare occasions when he is on the deck this wariness appears to be mutual castleton says that it is because the dogs scent food on de veres clothing november at last we are under way and all crowded to the ships rail as the fortitude departed from hobart to take a last look at civilisation even de vere emerged into the sunlight sheltering his sage eyes with his hand as we watched the shore recede into the distance i think it fair to say that despite the mingled wonder and excitement we all share about the expedition the feelings of the men at thus seeing the known world slip away from us were mixed all save de vere whose expression was one of relief before he retreated once more to his sanctum i know that the guvnorwhose judgement of character is second to noneis satisfied with the man and with what he was able to find out about him at such short notice but i cannot help but wonder if there is something which makes de vere anxious to be away from hobart december the southern ocean has not been kind to us the storms of the last three weeks have left us longing for the occasional glimpse of blue sky we had some idea of what to expect but as the guvnor reminds us we are charting new territory every day and must be prepared for any eventuality we have repaired most of the damage done to the bridge and superstructure by the heavy seas of a fortnight ago taking advantage of a rare spell of relative calm yesterday to accomplish the task and working well into the night so as to be ready should the wind and water resume their attack the strain is showing on all the men and i am thankful that the cessation of the tumultuous seas has enabled de vere to provide hot food once more the days of cold rations when the pitching of the ship made the galley unusable told on all of us the cooks complexion which has always been pale has assumed a truly startling pallor and his face looks lined and haggard he spent most of yesterday supplying hot food and a seemingly endless stream of strong coffee for all of us and then came and helped with the work on deck which continued well into the long antarctic summer night i had wondered if he was in a fit state to do such heavy labour but he set to with a will and proved he was the equal of any aboard december yet another accident has claimed one of our party but this one with graver consequences than the one which injured chadwick the spell of calmer weather which enabled us to carry out the muchneeded repairs to the ship was all too short and it was not long after we had completed our work that the storm resumed with even more fury than before and there was a very real possibility that the sea waves would breach our supply of fresh water which would very seriously endanger the fate of the expedition as it was those of us who had managed to drop off into some kind of sleep awoke to find several inches of icy water around our feet and the dogs were in a general state of uproar having been deluged by waves i stumbled on to the deck and began helping castleton and one or two others who were removing the dogs to a more sheltered locationa difficult task given the rolling of the ship and the state of the frantic animals i was busy concentrating on the task at hand and thus did not see one of the kennels come loose from its moorings on the deck but we all heard the terrible cry of agony which followed when we rushed to investigate we found young walker crushed between the heavy wooden kennel and the rail de vere had reached the spot before us and in a fit of energy which can only be described as superhuman managed singlehandedly to shift the kennel out of the way and free walker who was writhing and moaning in pain beddoes was instantly summoned and a quick look at the doctors face showed the gravity of the situation walker was taken below and it was some time before beddoes emerged looking graver than before an equally grimfaced guvnor with him the report is that walker s leg is badly broken and there is a possibility of internal injuries the best that can be done is to make the injured man as comfortable as possible and hope that the injuries are not as severe as they appear december a sombre christmas day de vere in an attempt to lighten the mood produced a truly sumptuous christmas dinner for us all which did go some way towards brightening our spirits and afterwards the guvnor conducted a short but moving christmas day service for all the men save walker who cannot be moved and de vere who volunteered to sit with the injured man one thing for which we give thanks is that the storms which have dogged our journey thus far seem to have abated we have had no further blasts such as the one which did so much damage and the guvnor is hopeful that it will not be very much longer before we may hope to see the coast of antarctica december de vere has been spending a great deal of time with walker who is alas no better beddoess worried face tells us all that we need know on that score he has sunk into a restless feverish sleep which does nothing to refresh him and seems to have wasted away to a mere shell of his former self in a shockingly brief period of time de vere conversely appears to have shaken off the adverse effects which the rough weather had on him i had occasion to visit the galley earlier in the day and was pleased to see that our cooks visage has assumed a ruddy hue and the haggard look has disappeared de veres attendance on the injured man has gone some way to mitigating his standing as the expeditions odd man out several of the men have worked with others here on various voyages and are old antarctic hands while the others were all selected by the guvnor after careful consideration not only of their own qualities but with an eye to how they would work as part of the larger group he did not of course have this luxury with de vere whose air of solitude has gone some way to making others keep their distance add to this the fact that he spends most of his time in the galley and is thus excused from taking part in much of the daily routine of the ship and it is perhaps not surprising that he remains something of a cipher december a melancholy farewell to the old year walker is no better and beddoes merely shakes his head when asked about him our progress is slower than we anticipated for we are plagued with a neverdissipating fog which wreathes the ship reducing visibility to almost nothing brash ice chokes the sea millions of pieces of it which grind against the ship in a neverceasing cacophony we are making little more than three knots for we dare not go any faster and risk running the fortitude against a larger piece which could pierce the hull on the other hand we must maintain speed lest we become mired in a fastfreezing mass it is delicate work and mr andrews is maintaining a nearconstant watch for as captain he bears ultimate responsibility for the ship and her crew and is determined to keep us safe i hope that begins more happily than looks set to end january sad news today walker succumbed to his injuries in the middle of last night the guvnor gathered us all together this morning to inform us de vere was with walker at the end so the man did not die alone a fact for which we are all grateful i think we all knew that there was little hope of recovery i was with him briefly only yesterday and was shocked by how pale and gaunt he looked there was a brief discussion as to whether or not we should bury walker at sea or wait until we made land and bury him ashore however we do not know whenor even ifwe shall make landfall and it was decided by us all to wait until the water around the ship is sufficiently clear of ice and bury him at sea january a welcome break in the fog today enabling us to obtain a clear view of our surroundings for the first time in many days we all knew that we were sailing into these waters at the most treacherous time of the southern summer when the ice breaking up in the ross sea would be swept across our path but we could not wait until later when the way would be clearer or we would risk being frozen in the ice before we completed our work as it is the prospect which greeted us was not heartening the way south is choked as far as the eye can see with vast bergs of ice one which was directly in front of us stretched more than a mile in length and was pitted along its base by caves in which the water boomed and echoed though the icebergs separate us from our goal it must be admitted that they are beautiful when i tell people at home of them they are always surprised to hear that the bergs and massive floes are not pure white but rather contain a multitude of colours shades of lilac and mauve and blue and green while pieces which have turned over display the brilliant hues of the algae which live in these waters their majesty however is every bit as awesome as has been depicted in words and in art coleridges inspired vision in his ancient mariner being a case in point i was standing at the rail this evening listening to the ice as it prowled restlessly about the hull gazing out upon the larger floes and bergs surrounding us and thinking along these lines when i became aware of someone standing at my elbow it was de vere who had come up beside me as soundlessly as a cat we stood in not uncompanionable silence for some moments then as if he were reading my thoughts he said quietly coleridge was correct was he not how does he put it the ice was here the ice was there the ice was all around it cracked and growled and roared and howled like noises in a swound quite extraordinary for a man who was never here and dorés illustrations for the work are likewise inspired of course he made a rather dreadful faux pas with his polar bears climbing up the floes although it does make a fine illustration he was not at all apologetic when his mistake was pointed out to him if i wish to place polar bears on the southern ice i shall well we must allow as great an artist as doré some licence i admitted that i had been thinking much the same thing at least about coleridge de vere smiled truly one of our greatest and most inspired poets we must forever deplore that visitor from porlock who disturbed him in the midst of kubla khan and christabel what might that poem have become had coleridge finished it that is the common cry yet coleridges fate was always to have a vision so vast that in writing of it he could never truly finish in the conventional sense in that he must surely echo life nothing is ever finished not really save in death and it is this last point which plays such a central role in christabel is the lady geraldine truly alive or is she undead he would never confirm it but i always suspected that coleridge was inspired in part to write christabel because of his earlier creation the nightmare lifeindeath who thicks mens blood with cold when she wins the mariner in her game of dice with death does he join her in a deathless state to roam the world forever it is a terrible fate to contemplate surely not i replied only imagine all that one could see and do were one given eternal life more than one man has sought it de vere whose eyes had focussed on the ice around us turned and fixed me with a steady gaze the summer night was upon us and it was sufficiently dark that i could not see his face distinctly yet his grey eyes were dark pools which displayed a grief without a pang one so old that the original sting had turned to dull unvarying sorrow eternal life he repeated and i heard bitterness underlying his words i do not think that those who seek it have truly considered it in all its consequences i did not know how to respond to this statement instead i remarked on his apparent familiarity with the works of doré and coleridge de vere nodded i have made something of a study of the literature of the undead if literature it is varney the vampyre certainly not literature yet possessed of a certain crude power although not to be mentioned in the same breath as works such as mr poes berenice or the irishman le fanus sublime carmilla i consider myself to be a wellread man but not in this field as i have never had an inclination for bogey stories i made a reference to the only work with which i was familiar that seemed relevant and my companion shook his head stokers novel is certainly powerful but he makes of the central character too romantic a figure lord byron has much for which to answer and such a jumble of legends and traditions and lore picked up here and there and then adapted to suit the needs of the novelist stoker never seems to consider the logical results of the depredations of the count if he were as bloodthirsty as depicted and leaving behind such a trail of victims who become in time like him then our world would be overrun he shook his head one thing that the author depicted well was the essential isolation of his creation stoker does not tell us how long it was before the count realised how alone he was even in the midst of bustling london not long i suspect it was an odd conversation to be having at such a time and in such a place de vere must have realised this for he gave an apologetic smile i am sorry for leading the conversation in such melancholy channels especially in light of what has happened did you know walker very well no i replied i did not meet him until shortly before we sailed from england this was his first antarctic voyage he hoped if the guvnor gave him a good report at the end of it to sign on with mawsons next expedition or even with shackleton or scott good antarctic hands are in short supply i know that the guvnor who has never lost a man on any of his expeditions appreciates the time that you spent with walker so that he did not die alone we all do being alone is a terrible thing said de vere in so soft a voice that i could scarce hear him i only wish that he stopped i wish that it could have been avoided that i could have prevented it i had hoped he stopped once more but what could you have done i asked in some surprise when he showed no sign this time of breaking the silence you did more than enough as i said we are all grateful he appeared not to hear my last words more than enough he repeated in a voice of such emptiness that i could make no reply and before long the cook excused himself to tend his duties before retiring for the night i stayed on deck for a little time after smoking a pipe and reflecting on our strange conversation that de vere is a man of education and intelligence i had already guessed from his voice and manner and speech he is clearly not a common sailor or seacook what had brought him to australia however and in such a capacity i do not know perhaps he is one of those men illsuited to the rank and expectations of his birth who seeks to test himself in places and situations which he would not otherwise encounter or one of the restless souls who finds himself constrained by the demands of society it was by this time quite late the only souls stirring on deck were the men of the watch whom it was easy to identify richards with his yellow scarf about which he has taken some goodnatured ribbing wellington the shortest man in our crew but with the strength and tenacity of a bulldog and mcallister with his ferocious red beard all eyes would i knew be on the ice for an accident here would mean the end the dogs were agitated i could hear whining and a few low growls from their kennels i glanced in that direction and was startled to see a man or so i thought standing in the shadows beside them there was no one on the watch near that spot i knew and while it was not unthinkable that some insomniac had come up on deck what startled me was the resemblance the figure bore to walker the thin eager face the manner in which he held himself even the clothing called to mind our fallen comrade i shook my head to clear it and when i looked again the figure was gone this is i fear what comes of talks such as the one which i had with de vere earlier i must banish such thoughts from my head as having no place on this voyage january there was a sufficient clearing of the ice around the ship today to enable us to commit walker s body to the deep the service was brief but very moving and the faces of the men were solemn none more so than de vere who still seems somewhat distraught and who lingered at the rails edge for some time watching the spot where walkers remains slipped beneath the water the ice which is keeping us from the coastline is as thick as ever yet we are noting that many of the massive chunks around us are embedded with rocky debris which would seem to indicate the presence of land nearby we all hope this is a sign that before long we will sight that elusive coastline which hovers just outside our view january we have reached our el dorado at last early this morning the watch wakened the guvnor and mr andrews to announce that they had sighted a rocky beach which looked suitable for a base camp this news coming as it does on the heels of all that we have seen and charted in the last few days has inspired a celebration amongst the expedition members that equals that which we displayed when leaving plymouth to begin our voyage the glad news spread quickly and within minutes everyone was on decksome of the men only halfdressedto catch a glimpse of the spot on a sheltered bay where the fortitude will be able to anchor safely there was an excited babble of voices and even some impromptu dancing as the prospect of setting foot in this unknown land took hold i suspect that we will be broaching some of the twenty or so cases of champagne which we have brought with us and yet i found myself scanning the faces on deck and counting for ever since the evening of that conversation with de vere i have halfconvinced myself that there are more men on board the ship than there should be quite how and why this idea has taken hold i cannot say and it is not something which i can discuss with anyone else aboard but i cannot shake the conviction that this shadowy other is walker if i believed in ghosts i could think that our late crewmate has returned to haunt the scene of his hopes and dreams but i do not believe and even to mention the idea would lead to serious concerns regarding my sanity de veres talk has obviously played on my mind bogeys indeed the man himself seems to have regretted his speech that night he spends most of his time in the galley only venturing out on deck in the late evening but he has restricted his comments to commonplaces about the weather or the days discoveries the dogs are as uncomfortable with him as ever but de vere appears to be trying to accustom them to his presence for he is often near them speaking with castleton the dog master spends most of his time when not on watch or asleep with his charges ensuring that they are kept healthy for when we need them for the sledging parties a task which we are all well content to leave him to if he doesnt stop spending so much time alone with those brutes hell soon forget how to talk and start barking instead said richards one evening the dogs may be robust but castleton himself is not looking well he appears pale and more tired than usual it cannot be attributed to anything lacking in our diet for the guvnor has ensured that our provisions are excellent and should the need arise we can augment our supplies with seal meat which has proven such an excellent staple for travellers in the north polar regions it could be that some illness is doing the rounds for de vere was once again looking pale some days ago but seems to have improved i saw him only a few minutes ago on the deck looking the picture of health while the rest of us have focussed our gazes landward the cook was looking back the way we had come as if keeping watch for something he expected to see behind us january it has been a herculean task landing all the supplies but at last it is finished the men who have remained on the beach constructing the hut have done yeomens work and when the fortitude departs tomorrow to continue along the coast on its charting mission we shall have a secure roof over our heads that it shall also be warm is thanks to the work of de vere when we went to assemble the stove we found that a box of vital parts was missing mcallister recalled seeing a box fall from the motor launch during one of its landings and when we crowded to the waters edge we did indeed see the box lying approximately seven feet down in a bed of the kelp which grows along the coast as we debated how best to grapple it to the surface de vere quietly and calmly removed his outer clothing and boots and plunged into the icy water he had to surface three times for great gulps of air before diving down once more to tear the kelp away from the box and then carry it to the surface it was a heroic act but he deflected all attempts at praise it needed to be done he said simply i have erected a small shed for my scientific equipment at a little distance from the main hut the dogs are tethered at about the same distance in the other direction and we are anticipating making some sledging runs soon although castleton advises that the animals will be difficult to handle at first which means that only those with some previous skill in that area will go on the initial journeys it is debatable whether castleton himself will be in a fit state to be one of these men for he is still suffering from some illness which is leaving him in a weakened state it is all he can do to manage his tasks with the dogs and de vere has had to help him and stilli hesitate to confess iti cannot shake myself of this feeling of someone with us who should not be here with all the bustle of transferring the supplies and erecting the camp it has been impossible for me to keep track of everyone but i am sure that i have seen movement beyond the science hut when there should be no one there if these delusionsfor such they must becontinue then i shall have to consider treatment when we return to england or risk being unable to take part in future expeditions i am conscious it is hallucination but it is a phantasm frozen in place at once too fixed to dislodge and too damaging to confess to another we have but seven weekseight at mostbefore the ship returns to take us back to hobart in advance of the antarctic winter i pray that all will be well until then january our first sledging mission has been a success two parties of three men each ascended the pathway that we have carved from the beach to the plateau above and behind us and from there we travelled about four miles inland attaining an altitude of feet the feelings of us all as we topped the final rise and saw inland across that vast featureless plateau are indescribable we were all conscious that we were gazing upon land that no human eye has ever seen as we gazed southwards to where the ice seemed to dissolve into a white impenetrable haze the enormity of the landscape and our own insignificance within it struck us all for it was a subdued party that made its way back to the camp before the night began to draw in to make travel impossible there are crevassessome hidden some notall about which will make travel in anything other than daylight impossible we were prepared to spend the night on the plateau should the need arise but we were all glad to be back in the icicled hut with our fellows the mood there was subdued also castleton assisted this morning in harnessing the dogs to the sledges but a task of which he would have made short work only a month ago seemed almost beyond him and the look in his eyes as he watched us leave on a mission of which he was to have been a part tore at the soul de veres health contrasted starkly with the wan face of the man beside him yet the cook had looked almost as stricken as the dog master as we left the camp february i did not think that i would find myself writing these words but the fortitude cannot return too quickly it is not only castletons health that is worrisome it is the growing conviction that there is something wrong with me the fancy that someone else abides here grows stronger by the day and despite my best efforts i cannot rid myself of it i have tried as delicately as possible to raise the question with some of the others but their laughter indicates that no one else is suffering get better snow goggles old man was richardss response the only person who did not laugh was de vere whose look of concern told me that he too senses my anxiety february the end has come and while it is difficult to write this i feel i must as if setting it down on paper will go some way to exorcising it from my mind i know however that the scenes of the last two days will be with me until the grave two nights ago i saw walker again as plainly as could be it was shortly before dark and i was returning from the hut which shelters my scientific equipment the wind which howls down from the icy plateau above us had ceased for a time and i took advantage of the relative calm to light my pipe all was quiet save for a subdued noise from the men in the hut and the growling of one or two of the dogs i stood for a moment gazing about me marvelling at the sheer immensity of where i was save for the fortitude and her crew and scotts partywherever they may bethere are no people within miles of us and we are as isolated from the rest of the world and her bustle as if we were on the moon once again the notion of our own insignificance in this uninhabited land struck me and i shivered knocked the ashes out of my pipe and prepared to go to the main hut a movement caught my eye behind the shed containing my equipment it appeared to be the figure of a man thrown into relief against the backdrop of ice i called out sharply whos there and not receiving an answer took a few steps in the direction of the movement but moments later stopped short when the other figure in turn took a step towards me and i saw that it was walker and yet that does not convey the extra horror of what i saw it was not walker as i remembered him either from the early part of the voyage or in the period just before his death then he had looked ghastly enough but it was nothing as to how he appeared before me now he was painfully thin the colour of the ice and snow behind him and in his eyes was a terrible light they seemed to glow like twin lucifers his nose was eaten away and his lips purple and swollen were drawn back from his gleaming teeth in a terrible parody of a smile yet there was nothing of mirth in the look which was directed towards me i felt that i was frozen where i stood unable to move and i wondered what i would do if the figure advanced any further towards me it was de vere who saved me a cry must have escaped my lips and the cook heard it for i was aware that he was standing beside me he said something in a low voice words that i was unable to distinguish and then he was helping menot towards the main hut thank god for i was in no state to present myself before the others but to the science hut he pulled open the door and we stumbled inside and de vere lit the lantern which was hanging from the ceiling for a moment as the match flared his own eyes seemed to glow then the lamp was sending its comforting light and all was as it should be he was obviously concerned i could see that in his drawn brow in the anxious expression of his eyes i found myself telling him what i had seen but if i thought that he would immediately laugh and tell me that i was imagining things i was much mistaken he again said some words in a low voice guttural and harsh in a language i did not understand when he looked at me his grey eyes were filled with such pain that i recoiled slightly he shook his head i am sorry he said in a quiet voice sorry that you have seen what you did and for other things i had hoped his voice trailed off when he spoke again it was more to himself than to me he seemed almost to have forgotten my presence i have lived a long time mr edwards and travelled a great deal all my years in fact from place to place never staying long in one location at length i arrived in australia travelling ever further south away from civilisation until i found myself in hobart and believed it was the end then the fortitude arrived bound on its mission even further south to a land where for several months of the year it is always night paradise indeed i thought his smile was twisted i should have remembered the words of blake some are born to sweet delight some are born to endless night it is not a paradise at all i tried to speak but he silenced me with a gesture of his hand and a look from those haunted eyes if i needed something from you would you help me he asked abruptly i nodded and he thought for a moment there are no sledge trips tomorrow am i correct yes i replied somewhat bewildered by the sudden change in the direction of the conversation the guvnor feels that the men need a day of rest so no trips are planned why can you arrange that a single trip should be made and that it shall be only you and i who travel it would be highly irregular usually there are three men to a sledge because of the difficulty of yes yes i understand that but it is important that it should be just the two of us can it be managed if it is important enough then yes i should think so it is more important than you know he gave a small smile and some of the pain seemed gone from his eyes far more important tomorrow night this will be over i promise you i had little sleep that night and next day was up far earlier than necessary preparing the sled and ensuring that all was in order there had been some surprise when i announced that de vere and i would be off taking one of the sledges ourselves but i explained it by saying that the cook merely wanted an opportunity to obtain a glimpse of that vast land for himself and that we would not be travelling far when de vere came out to the sledge he was carrying a small bag it was surprisingly heavy but i found a place for it and moments later the dogs strained into their harnesses and we were away the journey up to the plateau passed uneventfully under the leaden sun and we made good time on the trail which was by now well established when we topped the final rise i stopped the sledge so that we could both look out across that vast wasteland of ice and snow stretching away to the south pole hundreds and hundreds of miles distant de vere meditated upon it for some minutes then turned to me thank you for bringing me here he said in his quiet voice we are about four miles from camp i think you said when i concurred he continued that is a distance which you can travel by yourself is it not yes of course i replied somewhat puzzled i thought as much or i would not have brought you all this way and i did want to see thishe gestured at the silent heart of the continent behind usjust once such a terrible beauty on the surface and underneath treachery you say here there are crevasses yes i said we must be careful when breaking new trails lest a snow bridge collapse under us three days ago a large crevasse opened up to our righti pointedand there was a very real fear that one of the sledges was going to be carried down into it it was only some quick work on the part of mcallister that kept it from plunging through could you find the spot again easily we are not far good he turned to the sledge ignoring the movement and barking of the dogs they had not been much trouble when there had been work to do but now stopped they appeared restless even nervous de vere rustled around among the items stowed on the sledge and pulled out the bag he had given me he hesitated for a moment then he walked to where i stood waiting and passed it to me i would like you to open that he said and when i did so i found a small ornate box made of mahogany secured with a stout brass hasp open the box and remove what is inside i had no idea what to expect but any words i might have said failed me when i undid the hasp opened the lid and found inside the box a revolver i looked up at de vere who wore a mirthless smile it belonged to a man who thought to use it on me some years ago he said simply that man died i think you will find if you look that it is loaded i opened the chamber and saw that it was so i am by no means an expert with firearms but the bullets seemed to be almost tarnished as with great age i closed the chamber and glanced at de vere now we are going to go over to the edge of the crevasse and you are going to shoot me the words were said matteroffactly and what followed was in the same dispassionate tone as if he were speaking of the weather or what he planned to serve for dinner that evening stand close so as not to miss when you return to camp you will tell them that we came too near to the edge of the crevasse that a mass of snow collapsed under me and that there was nothing you could do i doubt that any blame or stigma will attach to younot with your reputationand while it may be difficult for you for a time you will perhaps take solace in the fact that you will not see walker again and that castletons health will soon improve he paused i am sorry about them both more than i can say then he added some words in an undertone which i did not quite catch one word sounded like hungry and another like tired but in truth i was so overwhelmed that i was barely in a position to make sense of anything one monstrous fact alone stood out hard and clear and i struggled to accept it are you are you ill then i asked at last trying to find some explanation at which my mind did not rebel some disease that will claim you if you want to put it that way yes a disease if that makes it easier for you he reached out and put a hand on my arm you have been friendly and i have not had many that i could call a friend i thank you and ask you to do this one thing for me and in the end for all of you i looked into his eyes dark as thunderclouds and recalled our conversation on board the ship following walker s death and for a moment had a vision of something dark and terrible i thought of the look on walker s faceor the thing that i had thought was walker when i had seen it the night before will you end up like him i asked suddenly and de vere seemed to know to what i referred for he shook his head no but if you do not do this then others will he said simply i knew then how i must act he obviously saw the look of resolution in my face for he said again quietly thank you then turned and began walking towards the crevasse in the ice i cannot write in detail of what followed in the next few minutes i remained beside the crevasse staring blankly down into the depths which now held him and it was only with considerable effort that i finally roused myself enough to stumble back to the dogs which had at last quietened the trip back to camp was a blur of white and i have no doubt that when i stumbled down the final stretch of the path i appeared sufficiently wildeyed and distraught that my story was accepted without question the guvnor had a long talk with me this morning when i woke unrefreshed from a troubled sleep he appears satisfied with my answers and while he did upbraid me slightly for failing to take a third person with usas that might have helped avert the tragedyhe agreed that the presence of another would probably have done nothing to help save de vere pray god he never finds out the truth february more than a week since de veres death and i have not seen walker in that time castleton too is much improved and appears well on the way to regaining his full health subsequent sledge parties have inspected the crevasse and agree that it was a terrible accident but one that could not have been avoided i have not been up on the plateau since my trip with de vere my thoughts continually turn to the man whom i left there and i recall what cook wrote more than one hundred years ago he was speaking of this place but the words could i think equally be applied to de vere doomed by nature never once to feel the warmth of the suns rays but to be buried in everlasting snow and ice a soft flutter of leaves whispered like a sigh as emily finished reading the last traces of day had vanished leaving behind shadows which pooled at the corners of the room she sat in silence for some time her eyes far away then she closed the journal gently almost with reverence and placed it on the table beside her the writers card stared up at her and she considered it he would not understand she said at last and they are all dead they can neither explain nor defend themselves or their actions she looked at her fathers photograph now blurred in the gathering darkness yet you did not destroy this she touched the journal with fingers delicate as a snowflake you left it for me to decide keeping this a secret even from my mother you must have thought that i would know what to do pray god he never finds out the truth she remained in her chair for some moments longer then with some effort emily rose from her chair and picking up the journal crossed once more to the rosewood desk and its shadows she placed the journal in its drawer where it rested beside a pipe which had lain unsmoked for decades the ceramic cat watched with blank eyes as she turned out the light in so doing she knocked the card to the floor where it lay undisturbed infestation by garth nix garth nix

by the outside world but there are notable exceptions in richard mathesons classic i am legend vampires have completely taken over the world and a lone survivor uses science to try to puzzle out their nature in laurell k hamiltons anita blake series various bureaucracies have grown up to deal with vampires who live openly this story is another in that mode here vampires law and technology all intersectin more ways than you might expect youve probably never read a vampire story quite like this one they were the usual motley collection of freelance vampire hunters two men wearing combinations of jungle camouflage and leather two women one almost indistinguishable from the men though with a little more style in her leather armour accessories and the other looking like she was about to assault the south face of a serious mountain only her mouth was visible a small oval of flesh not covered by balaclava mirror shades climbing helmet and hood they had the usual weapons four or five short wooden stakes in belt loops snapholstered handguns of various calibers all doubtless chambered with woodndeath lowvelocity timbertipped rounds big silveredged bowie or other hunting knife worn on the hip or strapped to a boot and crystal vials of holy water hung like small grenades on pocket loops protection likewise tick the usual boxes leather neck and wrist guards leather and wovenwire reinforced chaps and shoulder pauldrons over the camo leather gloves with metal knuckle plates army or climbing helmets and lots of crosses oh yeah particularly on the two men big silver crosses little wooden crosses mediumsized turned ivory crosses hanging off of everything they could hang off in other words all four of them were lumbering bumbling mountains of stuff that meant that they would be easy meat for all but the newest and dumbest vampires they all looked at me as i walked up i guess their first thought was to wonder what the hell i was doing there in the advertised meeting place outside a church at pm on a winters day while the last rays of the sun were supposedly making this consecrated ground a double nogo zone for vampires youre in the wrong place surfer boy growled one of the men i was used to this reaction i guess i dont look like a vampire hunter much anyway and i particularly didnt look like one that afternoon id been on the beach that morning not knowing where i might head to later so i was still wearing a yellow quiksilver tshirt and what might be loosely described as old and faded blue board shorts but ragged might be more accurate i hadnt had shoes on but id picked up a pair of sandals on the way tan birkenstocks very comfortable i always prefer sandals to shoes old habits i guess i dont look my age either i always looked young and nothings changed though boy was a bit rough coming from anyone under fortyfive and the guy whod spoken was probably closer to thirty people older than that usually leave the vampire hunting to the government or paid professionals im in the right place i said matteroffact not getting into any aggression or anything i lifted my vintage vinyl panam airline bag got my stuff here this is the meeting place for the vampire hunt yes said the mountainclimbing woman are you crazy asked the man whod spoken to me first this isnt some kind of doper excursion were going up against a nest of vampires i nodded and gave him a kind smile i know at least ten of them i would say i swung past and had a look around on the way here at least i did if youre talking about that condemned factory up on the river heights what but its cordoned offand the vampsll be dug in till nightfall i counted the patches of disturbed earth i explained the cordon was off i guess they dont bring it up to full power till the sun goes down so who are you guys ten exclaimed the second man not answering my question youre sure at least ten i replied but only one ancient the others are all pretty new judging from the spoil youre making this up said the first man theres maybe five tops they were seen together and tracked back thats when the cordon was established this morning i shrugged and halfunzipped my bag im jenny said the mountainclimber belatedly answering my question the the vampires got my sister three years ago when i heard about this infestation i claimed the relatives right ive got a twelvemonth permit said the second man plan to turn professional oh yeah my names karl im susan said the second woman this is our third vampire hunt mikes and mine i mean shes my wife said the belligerent mike weve both got twelvemonth permits youd better be legal too if you want to join us i have a special licence i replied the sun had disappeared behind the church tower and the street lights were flicking on with the bag unzipped i was ready for a surprise not that i thought one was about to happen at least not immediately unless i chose to spring one you can call me j jay asked susan close enough i replied does someone have a plan yeah said mike we stick together no hotdogging off or chasing down wounded vamps or anything like that we go in as a team and we come out as a team interesting i said is there more to it mike paused to fix me with what he obviously thought was his steely gaze i met it and after a few seconds he looked away maybe its the combination of very pale blue eyes and dark skin but not many people look at me directly for too long it might just be the eyes thereve been quite a few cultures who think of very light blue eyes as the colour of death perhaps that lingers resonating in the subconscious even of modern folk we go through the front door he said we throw flares ahead of us the vamps should all be digging out on the old factory floor its the only place where the earth is accessible so we go down the fire stairs throw a few more flares out the door then go through and back up against the wall well have a clear field of fire to take them down theyll be groggy for a couple of hours yet slow to move but if one or two manage to close we stake them the young ones will be slow and dazed i said but the ancient will be active soon after sundown even if it stays where it isand its not dug in on the factory floor its in a humungous clay pot outside an office on the fourth floor we take it first then said mike not that im sure i believe you its up to you i said i had my own ideas about dealing with the ancient but they would wait no point upsetting mike too early theres one more thing what asked karl theres a freshmade vampire around from last night it will still be able to pass as human for a few more days it wont be dugin and it may not even know its infected so asked mike we kill everything in the infested area thats all legal how do you know this stuff asked jenny youre a professional arent you said karl how long you been pro im not exactly a professional i said but ive been hunting vampires for quite a while cant have been that long said mike or youd know better than to go after them in just a tshirt whatve you got in that bag sawnoff shotgun just a stake and a knife i replied im a traditionalist shouldnt we be going the sun was fully down and i knew the ancient at least would already be reaching up through the soil its mildewed mottled hands gripping the rim of the earthenware pot that had once held a palm or something equally impressive outside the factory managers office trucks over there said mike pointing to a flashy new silver pickup you can ride in the back surfer boy fresh airs a wonderful thing as it turned out karl and jenny wanted to sit in the back too i sat on a tool box that still had shrinkwrap around it jenny sat on a spare tire and karl stood looking over the cab scanning the road as if a vampire might suddenly jump out when we were stopped at the lights do you want a cross jenny asked me after wed gone a mile or so in silence unlike mike and karl she wasnt festooned with them but she had a couple around her neck she started to take a small wooden one off lifting it by the chain i shook my head and raised my tshirt up under my arms to show the scars jenny recoiled in horror and gasped and karl looked around hand going for his glock i couldnt tell whether that was jumpiness or good training he didnt draw and shoot which i guess meant good training i let the tshirt fall but it was up long enough for both of them to see the hackwork tracery of scars that made up a kind of t shape on my chest and stomach but it wasnt a t it was a tau cross one of the oldest christian symbols and still the one that vampires feared the most though none but the most ancient knew why they fled from it is that a cross asked karl i nodded thats so hardcore said karl why didnt you just have it tattooed it probably wouldnt work so well i said and i didnt have it done it was done to me i didnt mention that there was an equivalent tracery of scars on my back as well these two tau crosses front and back never faded though my other scars always disappeared only a few days after they healed who would jenny started to ask but she was interrupted by mike banging on the rear window of the cabwith the butt of his pistol reconfirming my original assessment that he was the biggest danger to all of us except for the ancient vampire i wasnt worried about the young ones but i didnt know which ancient it was and that was cause for concern if it had been encysted since the drop it would be in the first flush of its full strength i hoped it had been around for a long time lying low and steadily degrading only recently resuming its mission against humanity were there said karl unnecessarily the cordon fence was fully established now sixteen feet high and lethally electrified with oldfashioned limelights burning every ten feet along the fence the sound of the hissing oxygen and hydrogen jets music to my ears vampires loathe limelight gaslight has a lesser effect and electric light hardly bothers them at all its the intensity of the naked flame they fear the fire brigade was standing by because of the limelights which though modernized were still occasionally prone to massive accidental combustion and the local police department was there en masse to enforce the cordon i saw the bright white bulk of the state vampire eradication teams semitrailer parked off to one side if we volunteers failed they would go in though given the derelict state of the building and the reasonable space between it and the nearest residential area it was more likely theyd just get the air force to do a fuelair explosion dump the vet personnel would be out and about already making sure no vampires managed to get past the cordon there would be crossbow snipers on the upper floors of the surrounding buildings ready to shoot firehardened oak quarrels into vampire heads it wasnt advertised by the ammo manufacturers but a big old vampire could take forty or fifty woodndeath or equivalent rounds to the head and chest before going down a good inchdiameter yardlong quarrel or stake worked so much better there would be a vet quick response team somewhere close as well outfitted in the latest metalmesh armour carrying the automatic weapons the volunteers were not allowed to usewith good reason given the frequency with which volunteer vampire hunters killed each other even when only armed with handguns stakes and knives i waved at the window of the threestorey warehouse where id caught a glimpse of a crossbow sniper earning a puzzled glance from karl and jenny then jumped down a police sergeant was already walking over to us his long harsh limelit shadow preceding him naturally mike intercepted him before he could choose who he wanted to talk to were the volunteer team i can see that said the sergeant whos the kid he pointed at me i frowned the kid stuff was getting monotonous i dont look that young twenty at least i would have thought he says his names jay hes got a special licence thats what he says lets see it then said the sergeant with a smile that suggested he was looking forward to arresting me and delivering a threehour lecture or perhaps a beating with a piece of rubber pipe it isnt always easy to decipher smiles ill take it from here sergeant said an officer who came up from behind me fast and smooth he was in the new metalmesh armour like a wetsuit with webbing belt and harness over it to hold stakes knife wp grenades which actually were effective against the vamps unlike the holy water ones and handgun he had an h k mppdw slung over his shoulder you go and check the cordon but lieutenant dont you want me to take i said check the cordon the sergeant retreated smile replaced by a scowl of frustration the vet lieutenant ignored him licences please he said he didnt look at me and unlike the others i didnt reach for the plasticated hologrammed datachipped card that was the latest version of the volunteer vampire hunter licence they held their licences up and the reader that was somewhere in the lieutenants helmet picked up the data and his earpiece whispered whether they were valid or not since he was nodding we all knew they were valid before he spoke ok youre good to go whenever you want good luck what about him asked mike gesturing at me with his thumb him too said the lieutenant he still didnt look at me some of the vet are funny like that they seem to think im like an albatross or something a sign of bad luck i suppose its because wherever the vampire infestations are really bad then i have a tendency to show up as well hes already been checked in well open the gate in five if that suits you sure said mike he lumbered over to face me theres something funny going on here and i dont like it so you just stick to the plan ok actually your plan sucks i said calmly so ive decided to change it you four should go down to the factory floor and take out the vampires there ill go up against the ancient alone asked jenny shouldnt we stick together like mike says nope i replied itll be out and unbending itself now youll all be too slow call this sl mike started to say as he tried to poke me forcefully in the chest with his forefinger but i was already standing behind him i tapped him on the shoulder and as he swung around ran behind him again we kept this up for a few turns before karl stopped him see what i mean and an ancient vampire is faster than me that was blarney or at least i hoped it was id met ancient vampires who were as quick as i was but not actually faster sometimes i did wonder what would happen if one day i was a fraction slower and one finally got me for good and all some days i kind of hoped that it would happen but not this day i hadnt had to go up against any vampires or anything else for over a month id been surfing for the last two weeks hanging out on the beach eating well drinking a little wine and even letting down my guard long enough to spend a couple of nights with a girl who surfed better than me and didnt mind having sex in total darkness with a guy who kept his tshirt on and an old airline bag under the pillow i was still feeling good from this little holiday though i knew it would only ever be that a few weeks snatched out of ok panted mike he wasnt as stupid as id feared but he was a lot less fit than he looked you do your thing well take the vampires on the factory floor good i replied presuming i survive ill come down and help you what do what do we do if we if were losing asked jenny she had her head well down her chin almost tucked into her chest and her bodylanguage screamed out that she was both scared and miserable i mean if there are more vampires or if the ancient one we fight or we die said karl no one is allowed back out through the cordon until after dawn oh i didnt i mean i read the brochure you dont have to go in i said you can wait out here i i think i will she said without looking at the others i just cant now im here i just cant face it great muttered mike one of us down already shes too young said susan i was surprised shed speak up against mike i had her down as his personal doormat dont give her a hard time mike no time for anything i said theyre getting ready to power down the gate a cluster of regular police officers and vet agents were taking up positions around the gate in the cordon fence we walked over the others switching on helmet lights drawing their handguns and probably silently uttering lastminute prayers the sergeant whod wanted to give me a hard time looked at mike who gave him the thumbs up a siren sounded a slow whoopwhoopwhoop as a segment of the cordon fence powered down the indicators along the top rail fading from a warning red to a dull green go go go shouted mike and he jogged forward with susan and karl at his heels i followed a few metres behind but not too far that sergeant had the control box for the gate and i didnt trust him not to close it on my back and power it up at the same time i really didnt want to know what volts at milliamps would do to my unusual physiology or show anyone else what didnt happen more to the point on the other hand i didnt want to get ahead of mike and co either because i already know what being shot in the back by accident felt like with lead and wooden bullets not to mention ceramiccased tungstentipped penetrator rounds and i didnt want to repeat the experience they rushed the front door mike kicking it in and bulling through the wood was rotten and the top panel had already fallen off so this was less of an achievement than it might have been karl was quick with the flares confirming his thorough training mike on the other hand just kept going so the light was behind him as he opened the fire door to the left of the lobby bad move there was a vampire behind the door and while it was no ancient it wasnt newly hatched either it wrapped its arms around mike holding on with the filaments that lined its forelegs though to an uneducated observer it just looked like a fairly slight tattered ragwearing human bearhugging him with rather longer than usual arms mike screamed as the vampire started chewing on his helmet ripping through the kevlar layers like a buzzsaw through softwood pausing only to spit out bits of the material old steel helmets are better than the modern variety but we live in an age that values only the new vamps like to get a good grip around their prey particularly ones who carry weapons there was nothing mike could do and as the vamp was already backing into the stairwell only a second or two for someone else to do something the vampire fell to the ground its forearm filaments coming loose with a sticky popping sound though they probably hadnt penetrated mikes heavy clothes i pulled the splinter out of its head and put the stake of almost twothousandyearold timber back in the bag before the others got a proper look at the odd silver sheen that came from deep within the wood karl dragged mike back into the flarelight as susan covered him both of them were pretty calm i thought at least they were still doing stuff rather than freaking out oh man said karl hed sat mike up and then had to catch him again as he fell backwards out in the light i saw that id waited just that second too long perhaps from some subconscious dislike of the man the last few vampire bites had not been just of mikes helmet what what do we do asked susan she turned to me pointedly not looking at her dead husband im sorry i said i really meant it particularly since it was my slackness that had let the vamp finish him off mike was an idiot but he didnt deserve to die and i could have saved him but hes got to be dealt with the same way as the vampires now then you and karl have to go down and clean out the rest otherwise theyll kill you too it usually helps to state the situation clearly stave off the shock with the need to do something lifesaving adrenalin focuses the mind wonderfully susan looked away for a couple of seconds i thought she might vomit but id underestimated her again she turned back and still holding her pistol in her right hand reached into a thigh pocket and pulled out a quickflame i should be the one to do it she said karl stepped back as she thumbed the quickflame and dropped it on the corpse the little cube deliquesced into a jelly film that spread over the torso of what had once been a man then as it splashed on the floor it woofed alight burning blue susan watched the fire i couldnt see much of her face but from what i could see i thought shed be ok for about an hour before the shock knocked her off her feet provided she got on with the job as soon as possible youd better get going i said if this one was already up here the others might be out and about dont get ahead of your flares right muttered karl he took another flare from a belt pouch ready susan yes karl tossed the flare down the stairs they both waited to see the glow of its light come back up then karl edged in working the angle his pistol ready he fired almost immediately two double taps followed by the sound of a vamp falling back down the stairs put two more in i called out but karl was already firing again and stake it before you go past i added as they both disappeared down the stair as soon as they were gone i checked the smouldering remains of mike quickflame cubes are all very well but they dont always burn everything and if theres a critical mass of organic material left then the vamp nanos can build a new one a little slow one but little slow ones can grow up i doubted thered been enough exchange of blood to get full infestation but its better to be sure so i took out the splinter again and waved it over the fragments that were left the sound of rapid gunshots began to echo up from below as i took off my tshirt and tucked it in the back of my board shorts the tau cross on my chest was already glowing softly with a silver light the smart matter under the scars energizing as it detected vamp activity close by i couldnt see the one on my back but it would be doing the same thing together they were supposed to generate a field that repulsed the vampires and slowed them down if they got close but it really only worked on the original versions the latterday generations of vampires were such bad copies that a lot of the original tech built to deter them simply missed the mark fortunately being bad copies the newer vampires were weaker slower less intelligent and untrained i took the main stairs up to the fourth floor the ancient vampire would already know i was coming so there was no point skulking up the elevator shaft or the outside drain like its broodmates it had been bred to be a perfect soldier at various levels of conflict from the nanonic frontline where it tried to replicate itself in its enemies to the gross physical contest of actually duking it out back in the old days it might have had some distance weapons as well but if there was one thing wed managed right in the original mission it was taking out the vamp weapons caches and resupply nodes we did a lot of things right in the original mission we succeeded rather too well or at least so we thought at the time if the victory hadnt been so much faster than anticipated the boss would never have had those years to fall in love with humans and then work out his crazy scheme to become their living god not so crazy perhaps since it kind of worked even after i tried to do my duty and stop him in a halfhearted way i suppose because he was team leader and all that but he was going totally against regulations i reported it and i got the order and the rest as they say is history using the splinter always reminds me of him and the old days theres probably enough smart matter in the wood encasing his dna and his last download to bring him back complete if and when i ever finish this assignment and can signal for pickup though a court would probably confirm hqs original order and hed be slowed into something close to a full stop anyway but my mission wont be over till the last vamp is burned to ash and this infested earth can be truly proclaimed clean which is likely to be a long long time and i remind myself that daydreaming about the old days is not going to help take out the ancient vampire ahead of me let alone the many more in the world beyond i took out the splinter and the silver knife and slung my panam bag so it was comfortable and got serious i heard the ancient moving around as i stepped into what was once the outer office the big pot was surrounded by soil and there were dirty footprints up the wall but i didnt need to see them to know to look up the vamps have a desire to dominate the high ground heavily programmed into them they always go for the ceiling up trees up towers up lampposts this one was spreadeagled on the ceiling gripping with its foreleg and trailing leg filaments as well as the hooks on what humans thought were fingers and toes it was pretty big as vamps go perhaps nine feet long and weighing in at around pounds the ultrathin waist gave away its insectoid heritage almost as much as a real close look at its mouth would not that you would want a real close look at a vamps mouth it squealed when i came in and it caught the tau emissions the squeal was basically an ultrasonic alarm oscillating through several wavelengths the cops outside would hear it as an unearthly scream when in fact it was more along the lines of a distress call and emergency rally beacon if any of its brood survived down below theyd drop whatever they might be doingor chewingand rush on up the squeal was standard operating procedure straight out of the manual it followed up with more orthodox stuff dropping straight on to me i flipped on my back and struck with the splinter but the vamp managed to flip itself in midair and bounce off the wall coming to a stop in the far corner it was fast faster than any vamp id seen for a long time id scratched it with the splinter but no more than that there was a line of silver across the dark red chitin of its chest where the transferred smart matter was leeching the vampires internal electrical potential to build a bomb but it would take at least five seconds to do that which was way too long i leapt and struck again and we conducted a kind of crazy ballet across the four walls the ceiling and the floor of the room anyone watching would have got motion sickness or eyeball fatigue trying to catch blurs of movement at seconds in it got a forearm around my left elbow and gave it a good hard pull dislocating my arm at the shoulder i knew then it really was ancient and had retained the programming needed to fight me my joints have always been a weak point it hurt a lot and it kept on hurting through several microseconds as the vamp tried to actually pull my arm off and at the same time twist itself around to start chewing on my leg the tau field was discouraging the vamp making it dump some of its internal nanoware so that blood started geysering out of pinholes all over its body but this was more of a nuisance for me than any major hindrance to it in midsomersault somewhere near the ceiling with the thing trying to wrap itself around me i dropped the silver knife it wasnt a real weapon not like the splinter i kept it for sentimental reasons as much as anything though silver did have a deleterious effect on younger vamps since it was pure sentiment i suppose i could have left it in coin form but then id probably be forever dropping some in combat and having to waste time later picking them up besides when silver was still the usual currency and they were still coins id got drunk a few times and spent them and it was way too big a hassle getting them back the vamp took the knifedropping as more significant than it was which was one of the reasons id let it go in the old days i would have held something serious in my left hand like a deweaving wand which the vampire probably thought the knife wasand it wanted to get it and use it on me it partially let go of my arm as it tried to catch the weapon and at that precise moment second i feinted with the splinter slid it along the things attempted forearm block and reversing my elbow joint stuck it right in the forehead with the smart matter already at work from its previous scratch internal explosion occurred immediately i had shut my eyes in preparation so i was only blown against the wall and not temporarily blinded as well i assessed the damage as i wearily got back up my left arm was fully dislocated with the tendons ripped away so i couldnt put it back it was going to have to hang for a day or two hurting like crazy till it selfhealed besides that i had severe bruising to my lower back and ribs which would also deliver some serious pain for a day or so i hadnt been hurt by a vamp as seriously for a long long time so i spent a few minutes searching through the scraps of mostly disintegrated vampire to find a piece big enough to meaningfully scan once i got it back to the jumper id be able to pick it apart on the atomic level to find the serial number on some of its defunct nanoware i put the scrap of what was probably skeleton in my flight bag with the splinter and the silver knife and wandered downstairs i left it unzipped because i hadnt heard any firing for a while which meant either susan and karl had cleaned up or the vamps had cleaned up susan and karl but i put my tshirt back on no need to scare the locals it was surprisingly clean considering my skin and hair sheds vampire blood so the rest of me looked quite respectable as well apart from the arm hanging down like an orangutangs that is id calculated the odds at about that susan and karl would win so i was pleased to see them in the entrance lobby they both jumped when i came down the stairs and i was ready to move if they shot at me but they managed to control themselves did you get them all i asked i didnt move any closer nine said karl like you said nine holes in the ground nine burned vampires you didnt get bitten does it look like we did asked susan with a shudder she was clearly thinking about mike vampires can infect with a small tidy bite i said or even about half a cup of their saliva via a kiss susan did throw up then which is what i wanted she wouldnt have if shed been bitten i was also telling the truth while they were designed to be soldiers the vampires were also made to be guerilla fighters working amongst the human population infecting as many as possible in small subtle ways they only went for the big chowdown in full combat what about you asked karl you ok you mean this i asked threshing my arm about like a tentacle wincing as it made the pain ten times worse dislocated but i didnt get bitten neither had karl i was now sure even newly infected humans have something about them that gives their condition away and i can always pick it which means we can go and sit by the fence and wait till morning i said cheerily youve done well karl nodded wearily and got his hand under susans elbow lifting her up she wiped her mouth and the two of them walked slowly to the door i let them go first which was kind of mean because the vet have been known to harbour triggerhappy snipers but there was no sudden death from above so we walked over to the fence and then the two of them flopped down on the ground and karl began to laugh hysterically i left them to it and wandered over to the gate you can let me out now i called to the sergeant my work here is almost done no one comes out till after dawn replied the guardian of the city except me i agreed check with lieutenant harman which goes to show that i can read id labels even little ones on metalmesh skinsuits the sergeant didnt need to check lieutenant harman was already looming up behind him they had a short but spirited conversation the sergeant told karl and susan to stay where they were which was still lying on the ground essentially in severe shock and they powered down the gate for about thirty seconds and i came out two medics came over to help me fortunately they were vet not locals so we didnt waste time arguing about me going to hospital getting lots of drugs injected having scans etc they fixed me up with a collar and cuff sling so my arm wasnt dragging about the place i said thank you and they retired to their unmarked ambulance then i wandered over to where jenny was sitting on the far side of the silver truck her back against the rear wheel shed taken off her helmet and balaclava letting her bobbed brown hair spring back out into shape she looked about eighteen maybe even younger maybe a little older a pretty young woman her face made no worse by evidence of tears though she was very pale she jumped as i tapped a little rhythm on the side of the truck oh i thought arent you meant to stay inside the the cordon i hunkered down next to her yeah most of the time they enforce that but it depends i said how are you doing me im im ok so you got them we did i confirmed i didnt mention mike she didnt need to know that not now good she said im sorry i thought i would be braver only when the time came i understand i said i dont see how you can she said i mean you went in and you said you fight vampires all the time you must be incredibly brave no i replied bravery is about overcoming fear not about not having it theres plenty im afraid of just not vampires we fear the unknown she said you must know a lot about vampires i nodded and moved my flight bag around to get more comfortable it was still unzipped but the sides were pushed together at the top how to fight them i mean she added since no one really knows anything else thats the worst thing when my sister was in infected and then later when she was was killed i really wanted to know and there was no one to tell me anything what did you want to know i asked ive always been prone to showoff to pretty girls if it isnt surfing its secret knowledge though sharing the secret knowledge only occurred in special cases when i knew it would go no further everything we dont know sighed jenny what are they really why have they suddenly appeared all over the place in the last ten years when we all thought they were just just madeup theyre killing machines i explained bioengineered selfreplicating guerilla soldiers dropped here kind of by mistake a long time ago theyve been in hiding mostly waiting for a signal or other stimuli to activate certain frequencies of radiowaves will do it and the growth of cellphone use so what vampires get irritated by cellphones a smile started to curl up one side of her mouth i smiled too and kept talking you see way back when there were these good aliens and these bad aliens and there was a gigantic space battle jenny started laughing do you want me to do a personality test before i can hear the rest of the story i think youd pass i said i had tried to make her laugh even though it was kind of true about the aliens and the space battle only there were just bad aliens and even worse aliens and the vampires had been dropped on earth by mistake they had been meant for a world where the nights were very long jenny kept laughing and looked down just for an instant i moved at my highest speedand she died laughing the splinter working instantly on both human nervous system and the twentyfourhoursold infestation of vampire nanoware we had lost the war which was why i was there cleaning up one of our mistakes why i would be on earth for countless years to come i felt glad to have my straightforward purpose my assigned task it is too easy to become involved with humans to want more for them to interfere with their lives i didnt want to make the bosss mistake im not human and i dont want to become human or make them better people i was just going to follow orders keep cleaning out the infestation and that was that the bite was low on jennys neck almost at the shoulder i showed it to the vet people and asked them to do the rest i didnt stay to watch my arm hurt and i could hear a girl laughing somewhere deep within my head life is the teacher by carrie vaughn carrie vaughn is the bestselling author of the kitty norville series which started with kitty and the midnight hour the seventh kitty novel kittys house of horrors is due out in january her short work has appeared many times in realms of fantasy and in a number of anthologies such as the mammoth book of paranormal romance and fast ships black sails and is forthcoming in warriors edited by george r r martin and gardner dozois vaughn says that the modern seductive vampire is very different from the oldschool folklore vampire its an interesting evolution seeing how the one became the other in film and fiction she said i think audiences are intrigued by the powersupernatural power seductive power political powerthat vampires are made to wield they become these avatars for the dangerous and alluring this story which first appeared in the anthology hotter than hell is about a new vampire learning to hunt using her newfound powers of supernatural seduction emma slid under the surface of the water and stayed there she lay in the tub on her back and stared up at a world made soft blurred with faint ripples an unreal world viewed through a distorted filter for minutesfour six tenshe stayed under water and didnt drown because she didnt breathe would never breathe again the world looked different through these undead eyes thicker somehow and also strangely clearer survival seemed like such a curious thing once youd already been killed this was her life now she didnt have to stay here she could end it any time she wanted just by opening the curtains at dawn but she didnt sitting up she pushed back her soaking hair and rained water all around her with the noise of a rushing stream outside the bloodwarm bath her skin chilled in the air she felt every little thing every little currentfrom the vent from a draft from the window coolness eddying along the floor striking the walls she shivered put the fingers of one hand on the wrist of the other and felt no pulse after spreading a towel on the floor she stepped from the bath she looked at herself she didnt look any different same slim body smooth skin young breasts the right size to cup in her hands nipples the color of a bruised peach her skin was paler than she remembered so pale it was almost translucent bloodless not for long she dried her brown hair so it hung straight to her shoulders and dressed with more care than she ever had before not that the clothes she put on were by any means fancy or new or anything other than what shed already had in her closet a tailored silk shirt over a black lace camisole jeans black leather pumps and a few choice pieces of jewelry a couple of thin silver chains and dangling silver earrings every piece every seam every fold of fabric produced an effect and she wanted to be sure she produced the right effect young confident alluring without of course looking like she was trying to produce such an effect it must seem casual thrown together effortless she switched the earrings from one ear to the other because they didnt seem to lay right the other way this must be what a prostitute felt like dissatisfied she went upstairs to see alette the older woman was in the parlor waiting in a wingback chair the room was decorated in tasteful antiques persian rugs and velvetupholstered furniture with thick rich curtains hanging over the windows books crammed into shelves and a silver tea service ornamented the mantel for all its opulent decoration the room had a comfortable natural feel to it its owner had come by the décor honestly the victorian atmosphere was genuine alette spoke with a refined british accent you dont have to do this alette was the most regal elegant woman emma knew an apparent thirty years old she was poised dressed in a silk skirt and jacket her brunette hair tied in a bun her face like porcelain she was over four hundred years old emma was part of her clan her family by many ties from many directions by blood alette was emmas ancestor a manygreats grandmother closer alette had made the one who in turn had made emma that had been unplanned emma hadnt wanted it the man in question had been punished he was gone now and alette had taken care of her mother mentor mistress you cant bottle feed me forever emma replied in this existence that meant needles iv tubes and a willing donor it was so clinical i can try alette said her smile wry if emma let her alette would take care of her forever literally forever but that felt wrong somehow if emma was going to live like this then she ought to live not cower like a child thank you for looking after me im not trying to sound ungrateful but but you want to be able to look after yourself emma nodded and again the wry smile touched alettes lips our family has always had the most awful streak of independence emmas laugh startled her she didnt know she still could remember what ive taught you alette said rising from her chair and moving to stand with emma how to choose how to lure him how to leave him remember how ive taught you to see and to feel and remember to only take a little if you take it all youll kill him or risk condemning him to this life i remember the lessons had been difficult shed had to learn to see the world with new eyes alette smoothed emmas hair back from her face and arranged it over her shouldersan uncharacteristic bit of fidgeting i know you do and i know youll be fine but if you need anything please ill call emma finished you wont send anyone to follow me will you no she said i wont thank you alette kissed her cheek and sent her to hunt alone for the first time alette had given her advice go somewhere new in an unfamiliar neighborhood where she wasnt likely to meet someone from her old life therefore making her less likely to encounter complications of emotion or circumstance emma didnt take this advice shed been a student at george washington university officially shed taken a leave of absence but she wasnt sure shed ever be able to continue her studies and finish her degree there were always night classes surebut it was almost a joke and like most anything worth doing easier said than done there was a place a bar where she and her friends used to go sometimes when classes got out theyd arrive just in time for happy hour when they could buy twodollar hamburgers and cheap pitchers of beer theyd eat supper play a few rounds of pool bitch about classes and papers they hadnt written yet on weekends theyd come late and play pool until last call a completely normal life that was what emma found herself missing a few months into this new life laughing with her friends maybe she should have gone someplace else for this found new territory but she wanted to see the familiar she came in through the front and paused blinked a couple of times took a deep breath through her nose to taste the air and the world slowed down noise fell to a low hum the lights seemed to brighten and just by turning her head a little she could see it all thirtyfour people packed into the first floor of this converted townhouse twelve sat at the bar two worked behind the bar splashing their way through the fumes of a dozen different kinds of alcohol their sweat mixed with those fumes two kinds of heat blending with the third ashy odor of cigarette smoke this place was hot with bodies five beating hearts played pool around two tables in the back three more watchedthese were female girlfriends the smell of competing testosterone was ripe all the rest crammed around tables or stood in empty spaces putting alcohol into their bodies their bloodemma could smell it through their pores she caught all this in a glance in a second she could feel the clear paths by the way the air moved incredibly she could feel the whole room all of it pressing gently against her skin as if she looked down on it from above as if she commanded it therethat couple at the table in the corner was fighting the woman stared into her tumbler of gin and tonic while her foot tapped a nervous beat on the floor her boyfriend stared at her frowning hard his arms crossed his scotch forgotten emma could have him if she wanted his blood was singing with need he would be easy to persuade to lure away from his difficulty a chance meeting by the bathrooms an unseen exit out the back no not like that a quartet of boisterous drunken men burst into laughter in front of her raucous business school types celebrating some exam or finished project she knew how to get to them too stumble perhaps lean an accidental arm on a shoulder gasp an apologyand the one who met her gaze first would be the one to follow her instead she went to the bar and despite the crowd the press of bodies jostling for space her path there was clear and a space opened for her just as she arrived because she knew it would be there she wanted to miss the taste of alcohol she could remember the taste of wine the tang on the tongue the warmth passing down her throat she remembered great dinners her favorite mexican food overstuffed burritos with sour cream and chile verde with a big salty margarita she wanted to miss it with a deep and painful longing but the memories turned her stomach the thought of consuming anything made her feel sick anything except blood the glass of wine before her remained untouched it was only for show she never would have done this in the old days sitting alone at the bar like this staring into her drinkshe looked like she was trying to get picked up well wasnt she when the door opened and a laughing crowd of friends entered emma turned and smiled in greeting even before the door had opened shed known somehow shed sensed the sound of a voice the tone of a footstep the scent of skin a ripple in the air she couldnt have remembered such fine details from her old life but somehow shed known she knew them emma hey chris finally her smile felt like her old smile her old friends gathered around leaned in for hugs and she obliged them but the one who spoke to her the one she focused on was chris he was six feet tall with wavy blond hair and a cleanshaven handsome face still boyish but filling out nicely he had a shy smile and laughing eyes whereve you been i havent seen you in weeks the registrars office said you took a leave of absence she had her story all figured out it wasnt even a lie really ive been sick she said you couldnt even call really sick she pressed her lips in a thin smile hoping she sounded sad yeah i guess he took the cue not to press the question further he brightened but you look great now really great there it was a spark in his eye a flush in his cheek shed always wondered if he liked her shed never been sure now she had tools she had senses and she looked great it wasnt her a bitter voice sounded inside her it was this thing riding her this creature inside her it was a lure a trap looking great made men like chris blush now she could use it she knew how to respond shed always been uncertain before she lowered her gaze smiled then looked at him warmly searching thanks ii guess you already have a drink the others had moved off to claim one of the pool tables chris remained leaning on the bar beside her nervously tapping his foot compared to him emma had no trouble radiating calm she was in control here let me get you something she said for a momentfor a long lingering blissful momentit felt like old times they only talked but the conversation was long and heartfelt he really listened to her so she kept talkingso much so that she almost got to the truth ive had to reassess everything what am i going to do with my life whats the point of it all she shrugged letting the implications settle you must have been really sick he said his gaze intent i thought i was going to die she said and it wasnt a lie she didnt remember much of itthe man the monsters hand on her face on her arms pinning her to the bed she wanted to scream but the sound caught in her throat and however frightened she was her body responded to his touch flushed shuddered toward him and this made her ashamed she hoped that he would kill her rather than turn her but she awoke again and the world was different you make it sound like youre not coming back hm she murmured startled out of her memory to school you arent coming back are you i dont know she said wanting to be honest knowing she couldnt tell him everything itd be hard after whats happened i just dont know this felt so casual so normal that she almost forgot she had a purpose here that she was supposed to be guiding this conversation she surprised herself by knowing what to say next this is going to sound really cliché but when you think you arent going to make it like that it really does change how you look at things you really do try to live for the moment you dont have time to screw around anymore which was ironic because really she had all the time in the world chris hung on her words no it doesnt sound cliché at all it sounds real i just dont think i have time anymore for school id rather you knowlive this sounded awfulso false and ironic dont listen to me im immortal part of her almost yelled but she didnt because another part of her was hungry when he spoke he sounded uncertain dodo you want to get out of here go to my place maybe her shy smile widened shed wanted him to say that she wanted him to think this was his idea she rounded her shoulders aware of her posture her body language wanting to send a message that she was open willing and ready yeah she said touching his hand as she stood his skin felt like fire chris took her back to his place he lived within walking distance in a gardenlevel unit in a block of apartments a nice place small but functional and very student it felt like a foreign country emma watched chris unlock the door and felt some trepidation nerves that was all anticipation unknown territoryto be expected going home with a new guy for the first time chris fumbled with the key there was more to this than the unknown or the thrill of anticipation she stood on the threshold literally and felt something a force outside of herself nothing solid rather a feeling that made her want to turn away like a voice whispering go you are not welcome this is not your place your blood does not dwell here she couldnt ignore it the voice fogged her senses if she turned away even just a littlestepped back tilted her head awayher mind cleared she didnt notice when chris finally unlocked the door and pushed his way inside she didnt know how long hed been standing on the other side of the threshold looking back at her expectantly she simply couldnt move forward come on in he said giving a reassuring smile the feeling fog and voice disappeared the unseen resistance fell away the barrier was gone shed been invited returning his smile she went in inside was what shed expected from a male college student the front room had a ripe welllivedin smell of dirty laundry and pizza boxes mostly though it smelled like him in a moment she took it all in the walls and the carpet despite how many times the former had been repainted and the later replaced the sense that generations of college students had passed through here lingered the years of life pressed against her skin and she closed her eyes to take it all in to feel it eddy around her it tingled against her like static do you want something to drink chris was sweating just a little yes no im okay seduction wasnt a quick thing though she supposed if she wanted she could just take him she could feel in her bones and muscles that she could he wouldnt know what hit him it would be easy use the currents of the room slow down the world move in the blink of an eye no no speed no fear no mess better to do it cleanly nicer for everyone now that they were alone away from the crowd her purpose became so very clear her need became crystalline she planned it out a brief touch on his arm press her body close and let him do the rest fake it was fake manipulative she liked him she really did she wished shed done this months ago she wished shed had the nerve to say something to touch his handbefore shed been attacked and turned then she hadnt had the courage and now she wanted something else from him it felt like deception this was why alette had wanted her to find a stranger she wouldnt be wishing that it had all turned out different maybe she wouldnt care she wanted to like chrisshe didnt want to need him like this didnt want to hurt him and she didnt know if shed have been so happy to go home with anyone else that was why she was here that was why shed gone to that particular bar and waited for him that doesnt matter her instinctsnew instincts like static across her skin like the heat of blood drawing hertold her the emotion is a byproduct of need he is yours because youve won him youve already won him you have only to claim him she reached outshe could feel him without looking by sensing the way the air folded around his bodyand brushed her fingers across the back of his hand he reacted instantly curling his hand around hers squeezing pulling himself toward her and kissing herhalf on cheek half on lip he pulled back waiting for a reaction his breath coming fast and brushing her cheek she didnt breathe at allwould he notice should she gasp to fool him into thinking she breathed so he wouldnt notice that she didnt another deception rather than debating the question she lunged for him her lips seeking his kissing forcefully distract him in a minute he wouldnt notice anything she devoured him and he was off balance lagging behind as she sucked his lips and sought his tongue shed never been this hungry for someone before the taste of his skin his sweat his mouth burst inside her and fired her brain he tasted so good on the outside she couldnt wait to discover what the inside of him tasted like that warm blood flushing just under the surface her nails dug into his arm wanting to pull off the sleeves of his shirt all his clothes to be closer to his living skin she wanted nothing more than to close her teeth bite into him she pulled back almost ripping herself away broke all contact and took a step back so that she was surrounded by cool air and not flesh she could hear the blood rushing in his neck this wasnt her this wasnt her doing this she couldnt do this chris gave a nervous chuckle wow that was emma whats wrong she closed her eyes took a moment to gather herself drew breath to speak it would look like a deep sigh to him im sorry she said i cant do this she couldnt look at him if he saw her eyes saw the way she looked at him hed know about the thing inside her hed know she only wanted to rip him open how could she explain to him without explaining i had a really nice time but im sorry holding the collar of her jacket closed she fled before he could say a word in argument alette had had to force her to drink blood the first time emma hadnt wanted to become this thing shed threatened to leave the house at dawn and die in the sunlight but alette persuaded her to stay a haunted need inside her listened to that wanted to survive and stayed inside in the dark still she gagged when the mistress showed her the glass tumbler full of viscous red its only your first night in this life she said youre too new to hunt but you still need this alette had then stood behind her embraced emma and locked her arms tight with one hand while tipping the glass to her mouth with the other emma had struggled fought to pull out of her grasp but alette was deceptively powerful and emma was still sick and weak emma had recognized the scent of the blood even before it reached her lips tangy metallic like a butchers shop even as she rebelled even as her mind quailed part of her reached toward it her mouth salivated this contradiction was what had caused her to break down screaming that she didnt want this that she couldnt do this kicking and thrashing in alettes grip but alette had been ready for it and very calmly held her still forced the glass between her lips and made her drink as much spilled out of her mouth and down her chin as slid down her throat then shed fallen still helpless shed surrendered even as that single sip returned her strength to her eventually she could hold the glass herself and drain it she even realized she should learn to find the blood herself she thought shed been ready alette found her in the parlor sitting curled up on one of the sofas what happened emma hugged her knees and stared into space shed spent hours here almost until dawn watching dust motes watching time move this was fascinatingthe idea that she could see time move almost if she concentrated she could reach out and touch it twist it cross the room in a second she would look like she was flying shed almost done it earlier tonight shed have taken him so quickly he wouldnt have known alette waited patiently for her to answer like she could also spend all night watching time move i dont know even after all that had happened her voice sounded like a little girls she still felt like a child i liked him it wasit felt good i thought she shook her head the memory was a distant thing she didnt want to revisit it i got scared i had him in the palm of my hand he was mine i was strong and this thing rose up in me this amazing poweri could do anything but it wasnt me so i got scared and ran poised and regal alette sat hands crossed in her lap the elegant noblewoman of an old painting nothing shook her nothing shattered her thats the creature thats what you are now how you control it will determine what your life will look like from now on it was a pronouncement a judgment a knell of doom alette continued some of our kind give free rein to it they revel in it it makes them strong but often leaves them vulnerable if you try to ignore it it will consume you youll lose that part of yourself that is yours in her bones in the tracks of her bloodless veins emma knew alette was right and this was what she feared that she wasnt strong that she wouldnt control it that she would lose her self her soul to the thing her eyes ached with tears that didnt fall how did alette control it how did she manage to sit so calm and dignified with the creature writhing inside of her desperate for power emma felt sure she wouldnt last long enough to develop that beautiful selfpossession oh my dear hush there alette moved to her side and gathered her in her arms shed seen emmas anguish and now sought to wrap her in comfort emma clung to her pressing her face against the cool silk of her jacket holding tight to her arms for just a moment she let herself be a child protected within the older womans embrace i cant teach you everything some steps you must take alone i can take care of you if you likekeep you here watch you always hold the creature at bay and bring you cups of blood but i dont think youd be happy i dont know that ill ever be happy i dont think i can do this the power is a tool you use to get what you need it should not control you not much of the night remained emma felt dawn tugging at her nervesanother new sensation to catalog with the rest the promise of sunlight was a weariness that settled over her and drove her underground to a bed in a sealed windowless room at least she didnt need a coffin small comfort come alette said urging her to her feet sleep for now vanquish this beast another night her mind was still her own and she still dreamed the fluttering disjointed scenes took place in daylight already the sunlit world of her dreaming memories had begun to look odd to her unreal and uncertain as if these things could never really have happened at dusk she woke and told herself all kinds of platitudes she had to get back on the horse if at first you dont succeed but it came down to wanting to see chris again she wanted to apologize she found his phone number and called him half hoping he wouldnt answer so she could leave a message and not have to face him but he picked up hi hi chris emma he sounded surprised and why wouldnt he be hey are you okay her anxiety vanished and she was glad that shed called im okay i just wanted to say im so sorry about last night i got scared i freaked i know youll probably laugh in my face but i want to see you again id like to try again an unspoken desire she couldnt quite give voice to i wouldnt laugh i was just worried about you i thought maybe id done something wrong no no of course you didnt its justi guess since this was my first time out since i was sick my first time being with anyone since then i got scared like i said i dont know it seemed like you were really into it he chuckled nervously you were really hot i was into it she wasnt sure this was going to sound awkwardendearing or just awkward she tried to put that lust that power that shed felt last night into her voice like maybe she could touch him over the phone she held that image in her mind id like to see you again the meaning behind the words said i need you somehow he heard that she could tell by the catch in his breath an added huskiness in his voice okay why dont you come over ill be right there she shut the phone off not giving him a chance to change his mind not letting herself doubt emma could screw this up again there was a gnawing in her belly an anxious thought that kept saying this isnt right im using him and he doesnt deserve that she was starting to think of that voice as the old emma the emma who could walk in daylight and never would again the new emma the voice she had to listen to now felt like she was about to win a race she had the power here and she was buzzed on it almost drunk the new emma didnt miss alcohol because she didnt need it it felt good everything she moved toward felt so physically fundamentally good all she had to do was let go of doubt and revel in it that nearecstasy shone in her eyes when chris opened the door for a moment they only looked at each other he was tentativeexpecting her to flee again she caught his gaze and he saw nothing but her she could see him see through him everything about him he wanted herhad watched her for a long time dreaming of a moment like this not thinking it would happen not brave enough to make it happen assuming she wasnt the kind of girl who would let him in yet here she was she saw all of this play behind his eyes she touched his cheek and gave him a shy smile thanks for letting me come over gazing at him through lowered lids she pushed him over the edge he grabbed her hand and pulled her against him bringing her lips to his hungry and she was ready for him opening her mouth to him letting him devour her with kisses and sending his passion back to him he clutched at her wrinkling the back of her shirt as if he were trying to rip through it to get to her skin kneading moving his hand low to pin her against him these werent the tender careful assured movements he might have used if he were attempting to seduce herif hed had to persuade her if she had shown some hesitation these were the clumsy desperate gropings of a man who couldnt control himself she made him lose control if she could now pick up those reins that he had dropped she pulled back her head to look at him kissed him lightly then slowlystaying slow forcing him to match her pace she controlled his movements now she unbuttoned his shirt drawing out every motion brushing the bare skin underneath with fleeting touches lingering teasing heightening his need feeding his desire driving him mad he was melting in her arms she could feel his muscles tremble taking hold of his handsshe practically had to peel them off her backsideshe guided them to her breasts and pressed them there his eyes widened like hed just won a prize and she smiled letting her head fall back feeling the weight of her hair pull her back rolling her shoulders and putting her chest even more firmly into his grasp quickly he undid the buttons of her shirt tugged aside her bra and bent to kiss her tracing her right breast with his tongue taking her nipple between his teeth for all that had happened for all that shed become her nerves her senses still worked still shuddered at a lovers touch her hands clenched on his shoulders then tightened in his hair she gasped with pleasure she wanted this she wanted this badly she pulled him toward the bedroom didnt stop looking at him held his gaze would not let him break it her own veins were firecontrolled fire in a very strong furnace directed to some great purpose a driving machine she needed him the blood that flushed along his skin his very capillaries opened for her she did not have a heartbeat but something in her breast cried out in triumph he was hers to do with as she pleased she ran her tongue along her top row of teeth scraping it on needle sharp fangs he tugged at her shirt searching for more bare skin she shivered at his touch on the small of her back his hands were hot burning up and for all her desire her skin felt cold bloodless she would revel in his heat instead she pushed his shirt off his shoulders and let it drop to the floor then wrapped herself around him pulling as much of that skin and heat to her as she could youre so warm she murmured not meaning to speak at all but she was amazed at the heat of him she hadnt felt so much heat since beforebefore she became this thing he kept his mouth against her lips working around her neck pressing up to her ear tasting every inch her nerves flared at the touch and suddenly finally she understood it wasnt just the blood that drew her kind to living humans it was the heat the life itself they were bright sunlight to creatures who lived in darkness they held the energy that kept her kind alive and immortalfor there would always be people an endless supply of people to draw that energy from she was a parasite and the host would never die neither then would she with new reverence she eased him to the bed made him lay back and finished stripping him tugging down his jeans and boxers touching him at every opportunity fingertips around his hips along his thighs she paused to regard him stretched out on his back naked before her member erect whole body flush and almost trembling with need she had brought him to this moment with desire burning in his eyes he would do anything she asked now she found herself wanting to be kindto reward him for the role hed played in her education in bringing about the epiphany that so clarified her place in the world this exchange would be fair she would not simply take from him he would have pleasure as well she rubbed her hands down his chest down his belly he moaned shivered under her touch but did not interfere she traced every curve of his body down his ribs his hips stretched out on the bed beside him she took his penis in her hand again their mouths met his kissing was urgent fevered and she kept pace with him he was growing slick with sweat and smelled of musk she laughed the sound just bubbled out of her lips apart eyes gleaming she found joy in this she would live she would not open the curtains on the dawn she had power in this existence and she would learn to use it oh my god chris murmured he froze his eyes wide his blood suddenly cooled in only a second she felt the sweat on his body start to chill as fear struck him he wouldnt even notice it yet he was staring at her her open laughing mouth the pointed canine teeth shed been so careful to disguise until this moment when euphoria overcame her in a moment of panic like this it might all fall apart an impulse to run struck her but shed come too far she was too close to success if she fled now she might never regain the nerve to try again shh shh its all right she whispered stroking his hair nuzzling his cheek breathing comfort against him its fine itll be fine she brought all her nascent power to bear seduction persuasion the creatures allure the ability to fog his mind to erase all else from his thoughts but his desire for her to fill his sight only with her its all right chris ill take care of you ill take good care of you the fear in his eyes ebbed replaced by puzzlementsome part of his mind asking what was happening who was she what was she and why was she doing this to him she willed him to forget those questions all that mattered were her him their joint passion that would feed them both his desire and her life he was still hard against her hand and she used that gently carefully she urged him back to his heat brought him again to that point of need she stroked him first with fingertips then with her whole hand and his groan of pleasure gratified her when he tipped back his head his eyes rolling back a little she knew he had returned to her the next time she kissed him his whole body surged against her she twined her leg around his he moved against her insistent but she held him pinned him and closed her mouth over his neck there she kissed suckedfelt the hot river of his blood so close to his skin just under her tongue she almost lost control in her need to take that river into herself oh so carefully slowly to make sure she did this right and made no mistakes she bit let her needle teeth tear just a little of his skin the flow of blood hit her tongue with a shock and instantly translated to a delicious rush that shuddered through her body blood slipped down her throat like honey burning with richness clenching all her muscles groaning at the flood of it she drank her hand closed tight around his erection moved with him and his body responded his own wave of pleasure bringing him to climax a moment later she held him while he rocked against her and she drank a dozen swallows of his blood no more than that do not kill alettes first lesson but a dozen mouthfuls would barely weaken him he wouldnt even notice she licked the wound shed made to hasten its healing he might notice the marks and believe them to be insect bites he would never know shed been here his body radiated the heat of spent desire she lay close to him gathering as much of it as she could into herself she now felt hotvivid and alive she could feel his blood traveling through her keeping her alive stroking his hair admiring the lazy smile he wore she whispered to him you wont remember me you wont remember what happened tonight you had a nice dream thats all a vivid dream emma he murmured flexing toward her for more almost her resolve broke almost she saw that pulsing artery in his neck and went to drink again but she continued if you see me again you wont know me your life will go on as if you never knew me go to sleep youll sleep very well tonight she brushed his hair with her fingers and a moment later he was snoring gently she pulled a blanket over him kissed his forehead straightening her bra buttoning her blouse she left the room made sure all the lights were off locked the door on her way out she walked home it was the deepest stillest hour of night or early morning streetlights turned colors but no cars waited at intersections no voices drifted from bars and all the storefronts were dark a cold mist hung in the air ghostlike emma felt that she swam through it the stillest part of night and she had never felt more awake more alive every pore felt the touch of air around her warm blood flowed in her veins firing her heart she walked without fear along dark streets secure in the feeling that the world had paused to notice her passage through it she entered alettes town home through the kitchen door in back rather than through the front door because shed always come in through the back in her student days when she studied in alettes library and paid for school by being alettes parttime housekeeper that had all changed those daysnightswere finished but shed never stop using the back door emma alette called from the parlor selfconscious emma followed the voice and found alette in her favorite chair in the corner reading a book emma tried not to feel like a kid sneaking home after a night of mischief alette replaced a bookmark and set the book aside well her unnecessary coat wrapped around her hands folded before her emma stood before the mistress of the house almost she reverted to the teenagers response fine okay whatever monosyllables and a fast exit but she felt herself smile broadly happily it was good and the gentleman he wont remember me good alette said and smiled welcome to the family my dear she went back to the bar once more a week later sitting at the bar she traced condensation on the outside of a glass of gin and tonic on the rocks she hadnt sipped only tasted drawing a lone breath so she could take in the scent of it the door opened bringing with it a cold draft and a crowd of college students chris was among them laughing at someones joke blond hair tousled he walked right by her on his way to the pool tables flashed her a hurried smile when he caught her watching him didnt spare her another glance in the way of two strangers passing in a crowded bar smiling wryly to herself emma left her drink at the bar and went out to walk in the night the vechi barbat by nancy kilpatrick nancy kilpatrick is the author of the power of the blood vampire series which includes the novels child of the night near death reborn bloodlover and a fifth volume which is currently in progress she is also the editor of several anthologies including an allnew vampire anthology called evolve due out in shes a prolific author of short fiction as well and her work is frequently nominated for awards nancy was a guest of honor at the world horror convention she lives in montréal québec this story is about the old world clashing with the modern world there are places in this world today despite computers cellphones tv and other modern technologies that still have a lot of cultural mythology and ancient lore embedded in the lives of the ordinary person who live by our standards very primitive lives kilpatrick said how much of a shock would it be for someone who comes from such a place and is thrust into the first world hauling with them every one of their beliefs learned at the knee of their mother into this more or less godless and mythfree zone of nita sat hunched at the scarred table studying the black gouges in the wood made by knives pens fingernails hard as talons thinking about the words and symbols jc had been scratched in about the center and a rough drawing of an eye with long lashes that looked mystical or psychotic depending on how nita let her mind wander a cruder sketch of what might have been a penis but slightly deformed with two long eye teeth and bite me deeply carved into the birch had been positioned to the right the letters cas romanian for home stretched above the rest we are nearly ready dr sauers said a bit gruffly to nitas ear then sit linite telling her to sit quietly in her native tongue as if that would have more impact the doctor didnt really approve of having anyone else in the room and likely was worried that nita would misbehave as she had warned her against so often not that she could even if there were no chains circling her wrists and ankles the drugs they pumped into her kept her weighed down emotionally as if there were also heavy chains clamped to her heart sauers was a control freak she preferred running the show by herself nita had quickly realized to her dismay suddenly nita felt her heart grow even heavier what had happened it had escalated she felt so alone she didnt know if she could go over the events again no one had believed her the first time no one believed her now or cared how she missed her home she glanced up at dr sauers but the sharpfeatured woman fiddling with the video camera did not return her look eventually though the older woman turned to the silverhaired man standing by the door he couldnt have been more than forty he had not yet been introduced to nita as if sensing her insecurities he glanced at nita and presented her with a quick benign smile then faced sauers to say in english perhaps you should test the audio sauers scowling twisted knobs on the tripod aimed the small video cameras eye and adjusted the panel at the back of the camera making sure the focus was on nita was the camera lens the eye of god watching her judging her the doctors long hard nail stabbed at a button on the camera twice maybe she was nudging god to pay attention too alright dr sauers said abruptly impatiently jerking herself away from the equipment she glanced at her watch with the large face we must begin she sounded as if there had been a delay that nita or maybe the greyhaired man was responsible for the doctor took a seat to the right of nita the man in the wellfitting grey suit took the chair directly in front of her both of them out of the cameras view almost enough for a card game nita thought wryly her mind flew to the old beatup decks of cards the men in her village played with as they drank the strong local brandy and quickly jettisoned those images in favor of larger cards with faded pastel pictures that her grandmotherher bunickept hidden wrapped in a soiled scrap of green satin buried in the rich brown earth with a rock over top as if it were a grave hiding a body that refused to stay interred in her memory nita envisioned only one card a black and white and grey picture with a few smudges the color of blood bunic patiently explained that this was artwork from five hundred or more years ago danse macabre she had called it a grisly skeleton with tufts of hair adhering to its skull and fragments of meat on its bones holding the hand of a richly adorned king on one side of his boney body and clutching about the waist what looked to be a peasant woman in rags on the other the three drawn so that they appeared to be in motion nita thought the king and the woman were trying to get away from the skeleton but bunic interpreted it differently he leads the dance we all must dance with him one day nita smiled at the memory so caught up in her mental picture of the stark yet mesmerizing image and of her bunics rough but soothing tone of voice that she missed the first part of what the man at the table was saying which apparently had included his name and i understand you speak english im a behavioral psychologist with the icscs thats the international centre for studies of the criminally but im not a criminal nita said flatly youre a patient convicted of a crime in an institution for the criminally insane dr sauers reminded her as if nita might have forgotten about the trial about being in jail now the hospital the humiliation the alienation about all of it she turned away from sauers and stared at the mans cool ashcolored eyes which reminded her so much of the winter sky above the unforgiving mountains of her village mountains strong and permanent formed of orange and red molten rock that had burst forth from below the surface and forced its way upward towards the snowy clouds piercing the steelblue sky like stalagmites until the heavens were dominated by soil and rock and trees that could withstand the fierce climatesurvivor of every cataclysm what had existed before she was born before her grandmother and her great great great grandmother a buzzer down the hall sounded and nita jolted furtively she glanced around her at the sterile environment its only richness in the dead gleam of stainless steel its only life the color corpsewhite no this was not the mountains she had little power here she looked down at her wrists chained together and her pale small hands clasped tightly in her lap as if all they could clutch all they could hold onto to keep body and soul together was each other were not here about the legalities the grey man whose name she had not learned said in a comforting tone accented by a slight smile but nita knew that both people in the room with her thought she was not just guilty but also insane hopelessly insane not much to do about that bunic believed you cant change peoples minds with words just with actions trust only what you taste and touch and smell shed said what others believe this cannot matter i see your name is luminita everyone calls me nita yes a diminutive very nice what does luminita mean something about light in romanian it means little light meaning a bright personality yes but also someone who lights the way for others a beacon nita remembered her bunic with so much longing the woman after whom she had been named who had meant the world to her was gone now and that thought stabbed nitas heart like a rusty knife bunic in nitas youthful view had always been old snowy hair like goose down covered by a headscarf the color of the purple loostrife that grew in the wetlands a face earthbrown and crinkly as baltic fruit shriveled by a sudden frost but her smile that wasnt old at all her smile lit wise honey eyes and changed the wrinkles around her mouth until she appeared young to young nita as if they were sisters and sometimes nita believed that they were sisters more than sisters identical as a child she had wanted to grow up to be just like bunic and how do you feel about that nitas vision of the past cleared returning her to the present the man had spoken and she had no idea what he was asking her im sorry could you repeat that please she said wake sus sauers snapped the man said gently i asked if we could begin at the beginning if you would be willing to tell me about how you came to be in bucharest nita knew this man had read her file and was aware of every bit of information about her that the courts and the doctors had been able to ascertain why he wanted it now she did not know she was about to ask him this when sauers ordered completat and nita decided that complying was in fact the easiest way to go once this was over she could return to the vomitgreen cell they called her room in this small asylum and fall into the world inside her where they could not penetrate let me ask you specific questions the man said it might be easier that way why did you come to bucharest to go to school she could see him struggle to recall the information from her files i seem to have read that you did very well in school exceptionally well yes my grades were excellent he smiled its unusual for a girl from a small mountain village to be accepted at university i studied with my grandmother she taught me to read three languages and to learn numbers she wanted me to be modern and welleducated your grandmother must have been very proud of you earning a scholarship yes the whole village took pride in me i see so you came here for university no i studied first at the secondary school level i then matriculated to the university i see she wondered if he saw much of anything his dove eyes revealed nothing did he understand how life could be how her life had been could he sense a clash of worlds she doubted it did you enjoy school yes did you make friends yes a few when she said no more he waited and she filled in the blank space hovering between them i had two girlfriends magda and anya and a guy toma we all went to coffee houses together and clubs we listened to music and danced and talked a lot more than i was used to she felt exhausted from talking now as if all this depleted her and to what end she knew she was destined to be a name in some research study that a girl her age would read about in a text book one day did you have a boyfriend no what about the young man you just mentioned toma and i were friends only friends and the girls were you just friends as well she did not know what he was implying and at first could not form an answer finally she took the easiest route we were friends only close she hesitated i suppose and did you confide in them confide what anything your thoughts feelings anything about your life your past he said past as if she might have accidentally conveyed to anya or magda a dark secret or even toma but they had not talked of the past only the present and the future a future that no longer existed we talked of school and movie stars and music she hoped that would satisfy him and it appeared to tell me nita while you were in bucharest did you miss your village of course sometimes not all the time i had my studies the man had been making notes on a pad of paper and now turned the page she wondered why he made notes when he would have the videotape in the pause nita snuck a glance at dr sauers the womans manure eyes pierced her and threatened retribution but nita did not know for what nita looked down again but a small smile spread her lips apart as she thought to herself we all must dance with him one day nita id like to hear what your village was like can you tell me something about it im from north america so this is all new to me she stared at him as he tried to look sincere yes her village would not be known to him and yet she wondered if he truly appreciated the differences while she had not been to north america or even to western europe she had seen his land on television and in movies and knew how it looked how people acted he would have no such markers for her world she could tell him anything and he would believe it of course sauers knew her village or claimed to the doctor was probably german or austrian but clearly she spoke the language well and must have lived in romania for some time but even if she didnt know nitas village she would know the region she would have passed through villages like nitas although there was no village like nitas of that she was quite certain a fi honest sauers said slowly nita stared at the camera the most humane element in the room to her thinking at least the camera eye of god was not judgmental today or analytical it recorded what was without interpretation or hidden agendas the way she had learned to think at the university the village i grew up in was like many small the people simple kind and generous they looked after one another the people were old because the young ones moved away like i did she felt a short sharp pain in her heart an image floated to mind of the village colorless empty of living beings the houses abandoned the cold mountain breezes blowing through broken windows forcing wooden shutters to bang against walls the yards littered with the bones of dead chickens paper and fabric rushing across the ground and into the nearby woods a village of ghosts she felt tears forming in her right eye and looked down she did not want either of these two to see her vulnerable how many people lived there he asked one hundred no more your parents my motherdied when i was a child and your father she shook her head who looked after you she felt annoyed he must have read all this in the reports still she tried to keep her voice from sounding impatient which would only bring trouble my grandmother raised me my mothers mother then she added before he could ask my fathers family was from somewhere far away he nodded as if she had said or done something right nita did not dare look at sauers the man continued but he could not disguise the energy in his voice now that he thought he was onto something was there anyone unusual in your village anyone different than the others everyone was unique she kept her smile hidden she wanted to toy with him a little yes of course but what i meant was would you say there was anyone living in the village who maybe did not feel they belonged there who might have felt like a prisoner she knew what he was getting at and she knew what he wanted her to say he wanted her to say it was her instead she told him yes one man we called him vechi brbat it means ancient man this was not what the greyhaired man was expecting out of the corner of her eye she saw him move back in his chair slightly as if regrouping his thoughts to her right she heard sauers make a small sound like a snake hissing they insisted she be here they controlled her life she had no options but this one to play with them as much as she could and she would they did not care about her about her village about vechi brbat and nita did not care about them not at all what could a prisoner feel but to desire the end of her captors the man at the table leaned forward and scribbled in his notebook when he looked up at her she met his gaze forcing her eyes to reflect innocence guilelessness in an instant his demeanor altered and he again looked hopeful as if he had made a good decision and even before he spoke she knew where he wanted to go tell me about this vechi brbat he said badly mispronouncing the words and she knew he had decided to humor her she smiled which from his reaction he interpreted as her being more at ease with him but of course she did not trust him not at all vechi brbat was old when my grandmother was young she told me stories what her grandmother had told her and her grandmother before her i see the man said jotting a note he looked up at nita with an encouraging smile could you describe this vechi brbat for me grey hair like yours but brittle she said he was thin very thin because he did not eat much and hunched but i think he must have been shorter than me his eyes could not focus well and he had trouble with light especially the sun where did he live in the village i mean did he have a house he lived with us in a cage in the back room my grandmother fed him from time to time and let him out when she felt he was not a threat what kind of threat the mans voice held anticipation as if nita were on the edge of divulging something important he might hurt someone if he were kept weak he could not harm us thats why my grandmother fed him little and the rest of the villagers were they afraid of him no one was afraid of him but if he was a danger when he was well fed but he never was and at night but he was kept on chains and ropes he was not dangerous in the day and not when he was weak the man paused did your grandmother ever keep you in the cage of course not nita snapped she saw sauers tense ready for action i was not a threat only vechi brbat alright that makes sense the man said trying to mollify her fearful that she would stop talking to him tell me more about him did you ever speak with him no why should i there was no reason to and besides he could not talk he only knew the language of long ago he had nothing to say did he ever try to speak to you she thought for a moment once when i was very young i had gone into the woods to hunt for mushrooms too late in the day and he appeared you were not afraid nita looked at him with disdain of course not i told you i did not fear him and what did he do he walked up to me and reached out his hand to touch my face but i stepped back and anyway the chains and ropes were caught around a tree trunk so he could not reach me it was dark in those woods where the trees grew close together and little sunlight got through he might have had more power what did you do when he tried to touch you i picked up my bucket and went home did he follow you yes for a while when he unraveled himself did you tell anyone about this yes i told my grandmother and what did she do she beat him they were all silent for a moment nita recalled watching the crimson welts form on vechi brbats bare back as bunic laid on the thick black leather strap the blood was not red like nitas and bunics but pale almost colorless barely pinktinged vechi brbat took the beating with barely a sound coming from his lips but his body hunched over even more until he was curled into a ball like a baby nita had felt sorry for him how did you feel about that he had to be taught a lesson my grandmother said otherwise he would cause harm to others the man took more notes dr sauers got up and checked the camera nita looked down at the shackles locking her wrists and ankles and thought that she was as much of a prisoner here as vechi brbat had been in the village she too was kept in a cage controlled not by near starvation but through drugs they injected into her daily she knew how much vechi brbat had longed to break free she grew to understand him very well when sauers returned to her seat and the man whose name she still did not know had finished his note taking he turned to nita and asked if she would like some water or a juice no thank you all right then can we continue she knew he did not expect an answer and she gave none he would continue whether she wanted to or not that was the nature of being held prisoner id like to talk about the last time you visited your village back in the summer her mind went to a picture like a postcard an overview of the village in shades of verdant green with rich ochre mixed in and the azure of the sky above there were people pretty tanskinned oana and her four rosycheeked children and her belly swollen with the fifth and radu her blondhaired hardworking husband little gheroghe who played the flute so well and ilie who made such beautiful wellconstructed boots with his long graceful fingers colored nearly black from the russian cigarettes he liked to smoke she saw them all as dabs of paint on a canvas a human stilllife paralyzed in the thickness of time depicted in her mind as they went about their day as they had always done as their children would unless they left the village as nita had tell me about that visit why did you go home my studies were complete for the year i had gotten a position serving food and drink in a taverna in bucharest but the owner did not need me for three weeks until the tourists would come so i went home to see my grandmother were you happy to be visiting her and your village yes of course and how did everyone react to you they were all excited to see me they wanted to know what it was like in bucharest and at the school and what did you tell them that the city is full of people who dress in all the colors of the world and walk the narrow streets at every hour and that lamp posts shine warm light at night like stars i told them that the school gave me knowledge and i learned about things i had not known existed for example mythologies legends the stories of cultures the man checked a file report obviously filled with information about her ah yes you were studying cultural anthropology is that correct yes he closed the file folder folded his arms on top of it and stared at her she did not meet his gaze were there legends stories and myths in your village yes suddenly she felt ashamed forlorn how could she not have known what would happen and one was about the vechi brbat was it not yes she said struggling to release the dark memory and keep living in the present tell me the story of the vechi brbat she sighed heavily surprised at this new even heavier weight she felt in her chest as if her lungs had turned to pumice and the clear pure air had trouble getting inside her dr sauers tapped her fingernails on the table she did not subscribe to talk therapy as she called it she believed in drugs sedate patients give them antipsychotics gradually reduce their medication and see if they improved if so they were released if not up the meds since nita would never be released she had no hope in either direction my grandmother told me the story of the vechi brbat he came to our village centuries ago he had met a girl from the village you see by the river and they fell in love they married then the woman died of a fever that spread through the mountains killing humans and animals alike it reduced the numbers in our small village to twenty only plus the vechi brbat and the people did not know how to survive the vechi brbat was not the oldest in the village but he held the most power and was the one with a quick brain and he should have told the people what to do but he was caught by grief and unable to lead another man who had survived became the leader and managed to save the remaining livestock and the crops so the people did not starve and could bear more children and their numbers increased and the vechi brbat you say he was grieving for his lost wife yes he loved her very much so much that he would do anything to be with her again and did what did he do he roamed the forest at night calling on the bad spirits of the old gods the ones from his life before the village when he lived with the gypsies before the christian god became the one god he begged the darkest elementals the angriest spirits of nature to aid him he promised them that he would do anything if they would allow him to again be with his wife nita felt her heart race she knew her eyes darted around the room looking for what escape yes she wanted to escape this room these people the story that had gone so very wrong then what happened the storms came the village is nestled in a valley and the land flooded blinding lightning shot from the sky and struck the vechi brbat his skin blackened and the pale brown color of his eyes turned white as did his hair and beard when he returned to the village he had becomedifferent different how she tried to avoid his questions the villagers they were so busy trying to save themselves the crops the animals to recapture their way of life the flood forced mud down the side of the mountain that buried much of what had been rescued redstreaked mud as if the mountain were bleeding their numbers dwindled further they saw it as a sign that there were demons in the village the vechi brbat had brought havoc to their lives when they were struggling to recover naturally they blamed him there was silence for a moment the man said softly what did they do to the vechi brbat nita swallowed hard they could not kill him he had been with them many years and was now one of their own but they had to protect themselves from what from the curse what curse is that nita felt her legs begin to tremble uncontrollably rattling the chains under the table the room seemed too hot the color of scorching yellow id like some water now if you please she said trying yet again to redirect the grey man he got up and went to a side table and poured a glass of clear water he set it in front of her but she did not touch it once he was seated again he said tell me about the curse maybe she thought maybe if i tell it now here maybe someone will understand the others before the police the medical men dr sauers they had all been impatient believing what they wanted to believe not the truth and she knew the truth this man with hair and eyes the color of a vole who said he was listening maybe he was listening maybe he would believe her she heard dr sauers nails again tapping on the table talons painted violent purple eager to rend flesh dr sauers would you mind terribly if i spoke with nita alone for a few minutes why sauers snarled this is irregular yes it is but i wonder if i might try a technique ive found that has had great success if you wouldnt mind reluctantly sauers got up from the table and obviously she did not appreciate this shift in the plan sauers checked the camera for film thank you the greyheaded man said cheerfully the doctor went out the door closing it loudly behind her not acknowledging him when she was gone the man turned his head and smiled at nita there now you can take your time telling me what happened for some reason nita found this both reassuring and intimidating she picked up the water with shaking hands and took a small sip then set the glass back down spilling a little that she wiped up with her sleeve she held onto the glass as if letting go might leave her floating in a colorless universe what did the villagers do to the vechi brbat they put him in a cage and kept him there he lived in the cage day and night they fed him only a little blood from time to time to keep him alive but this is how he existed and when the original villagers died for the first season all the villagers cared for him but soon as winter approached one woman offered to take the vechi brbat into her home and it was then that he lived in the cage all the time shelooked after him and then her daughter and so on it soon became the unspoken rule that only one took responsibility for him one woman of each generation the task handed down to the next in line the eldest eventually my grandmother was responsible and with your mother gone you were next in line nitas hands trembled and felt white cold yes the man paused and this responsibility to take care of to live with the vechi brbat is this something you wanted for yourself ii dont know she said no one had asked her this bunic had not it was assumed that nita would go to school then return home to the village and bear children raising only one girl child and that she would look after the ancient one who would live with her in the cage as it had been with all the women before her tell me you said the vechi brbat walked in the village and he tried to touch you in the forest so he was no longer in a cage somewhere back in time it was determined by a woman who cared for him that if he were not permitted to eat he would be weak and he could then be allowed to roam free at dusk provided a chain was attached to his ankle with a long rope this seemed to work out and the villagers agreed anyway he could not tolerate the sun and always returned to the cage during the day like a vampire the greyhaired man said exactly like a vampire and he was fed blood yes what kind of blood the blood of the village the man looked a little shocked by this revelation not animals no his body could not tolerate their blood only human did he drink your blood sometimes howhow was this done did he bite you of course not she said feeling the tension building in her we would make cuts on our arms and legs each person in the village taking a turn and would provide a tin cup every day and he would drink that it kept him alive why over the centuries did the villagers want to keep him alive because it would be bad luck to kill him but hed brought disaster to the village or so everyone thought but more disaster would come from killing him he was a gypsy he had been in touch with the most evil spirits they had come to him heeded him given him what he asked for the villagers did not know what would happen if he were killed or released but they knew they would be cursed and harm would come to them they just did not know the nature of that harm but you didnt believe that did you that his curse would bring disaster that he was ancient that he had brought back his dead wife a small sound slipped from nitas lips she felt a tear form in one eye and tried to brush it away but the sparkly multicolored drop slid down her cheek maybemaybe he understood ii the university they said it could not be so that he was not old that he was just a crazy man that everyone kept caged and starved and that his dead wife had not returned but a woman in the villagemy grandmother and my motherhad slept with him to get pregnant how did your mother die that was too horrible nita could not bring herself to admit the suicide instead of answering his question her mind raced on as if he hadnt interrupted the university professor said it was an example of a mythology that had gone terribly wrong and the people wanted to blame someone for all their problems and to torture him she looked up at the grey man i went home to make it right the man nodded imperceptibly now the words spilled from nita like the scorching lava that had formed the mountains i tried to tell the others i told them that he could not be ancient that he was not responsible for catastrophes that the gods had not returned his wife to him i explained that my grandmother who kept him she was his wife they would not believe me what did you do after the sun set i cut his chain and took him far from the village up into the mountains a nights journey by foot i gave him food i had brought home with me liquid food with nutrients some blood because he was used to that but other beverages because he had not eaten solid food that i knew of i tried to feed him grains but he could not digest them and then i pointed to the much larger village just over the mountain peak and told him to go there to begin a new life that he was free i told him that he would be caged no more nita shook her head tears streamed down her face and though her voice wavered she needed no encouragement to finish her story i returned to my village the following day my grandmother was furious with me she struck me and called me a fool ranting that i had brought down the curse and put them all in danger the villagers were angry and afraid some wanted to run away others found weapons to defend themselves one suggested i take the place of the vechi brbat in the cage as if that would make things right i told them they had nothing to fear that the old man the vechi brbat was gone for good and they were all free now just as i was free from the life that had awaited me no more wrong legends to rule their lives or mine i could return to the university i would not have to marry the vechi brbat or spend my life taking care of him but the people were not pleased by this they were so enraged and terrified my grandmother struggled to keep them from hurting me after a moment the man said and then what happened he returned two nights later he murdered people in their beds outside their homes as they fled into the forest women children meneven the strongest who tried to fight him off mymy grandmother he had been strengthened by the nourishment id provided and he took blood until he became bloated and then took more he killed everyone and it was my fault her body trembled uncontrollably the room had become icy the colors surrounding her even the white paled as if glaciers had formed over everything and the opaqueness that reminded her of the vechi brbats eyes as he stared into hers began to spin and swirl like a snowstorm but he didnt kill you the man said no she gasped he spared me why she stared at him watching his grey features shift and twist and the shape of his face change from human to animal then change again from animal to something dark and otherworldly until the images that formed petrified her nita they found you covered with blood you not the vechi brbat you killed the villagers because you felt trapped there destined to a life you did not want her head jerked from side to side nita if there were a vechi brbat why wasnt he found where is he now she screamed idontknow take it easy youre safe here but his words could not quell the horror that gripped her heart he disappeared and i remained with the bodies the bloodred bodies stained by color that seeped into the hungry brown soil as if it were a mouth that had longed for this nourishment the land of my foremothers of the villagers those who imprisoned the vechi brbat dont you see the blood went back into the earth where it should have gone centuries ago because they imprisoned him her raised voice brought dr sauers storming into the room whats going on here youre upsetting my patient she hit an intercom button on the wall and told a nurse to hurry with an injection no no more drugs let me be free nita jumped to her feet remove these chains i did nothing to you why are you holding me prisoner help someone help me vechi brbat free me as i freed you but nitas cries faded soon after the needle pierced her flesh the world around her receded the colors dimming and fading to nothing until she could neither see nor hear those outside her with their demands and judgments and limitations but she clearly heard the vechi brbat for now he could speak and he spoke to her calling her his bride assuring her that he would be with her always that she would not be a prisoner forever one day he promised you too must dance with me the beautiful the damned by kristine kathryn rusch kristine

as a kind of sequel to the great gatsbywith vampires for some reason i reread the great gatsby every two or three years whether i need to or not she said like nick carraway i am a child of the middle west a person who has moved away to a land thats not quite familiar and people who are a bit strange i have always seen ties between vampirism and alcoholism and i am the child of two alcoholics i dealt with that tie in my novel sins of the blood a vampire book and i deal with it here too on one rereading of gatsby rusch realized that the characters were metaphorical vampires and that was all the inspiration she needed to come up with the tale that follows chapter i i come from the middle west an unforgiving land with little or no tolerance for imagination the wind blows harsh across the prairies and the snows fall thick even with the conveniences of the modern age life is dangerous there to lose sight of reality even for one short romantic moment is to risk death i didnt belong in that country and my grandfather knew it i was his namesake and somehow being the second nick carraway in a family where the name had a certain mystique had forced that mystique upon me he had lived in the east during the twenties and had had grand adventures most of which he would not talk about when he returned to st paul in he met a womanmy grandmother nelland with her solid common sense had shed himself of the romance and imagination that had led to his adventures in the first place although not entirely for when i announced fifty years later that i intended to pursue my education in the east he paid four years of ivy league tuition and when i told him in the early s that despite my literary background and romantic nature i planned a career in the securities business he regaled me with stories of being a bond man in new york city in the years before the crash he died while i was still learning the art of the cold call stuck on the sixteenth floor of a windowless high rise in a tiny cubicle that matched a hundred other tiny cubicles distinguished only by my handprint on the phone set and the snapshots of my family thumbtacked to the indooroutdoor carpeting covering the small barrier that separated my cubicle from all the others he never saw the house in connecticut which although it was not grand was respectable and he never saw my rise from a cubicle employee to a man with an office he never saw the heady reagan years although he would have warned me about the awful black monday well before it appeared for despite the computers jets and televised communications the years of my youth were not all that different from the years of his he never saw fitz either although i knew later that year when i read the book that my grandfather would have understood my mysterious neighbor too my house sat at the bottom of a hill surrounded by trees whose russet leaves arein my mindin a state of perpetual autumn i think the autumn melancholy comes from the overlay of hindsight upon what was i think the strangest summer of my life a summer which like my grandfathers summer of i do not discuss even when asked in that tiny valley the air always had a damp chill and the rich smell of loam the scent grew stronger upon that winding dirt path that led to fitzs house on the hills crestnot a house really but more of a mansion in the conservative new england style white walls hidden by trees with only the wide walk and the entry visible from the gate once behind the walls and windows seemed to go on forever and the manicured lawn with its neatly mowed grass and carefully arranged marble fountains seemed like a throwback from a simpler time the house had little life in the daytime but at night the windows were thrown open and cars filled the driveway the cars were all sleek and darkblue saabs and midnight bmws black jaguars and ebony carreras occasionally a white stretch limo or a silver delorean would mar the darkness but those guests rarely returned for a second visit as if someone had asked them to take their ostentation elsewhere music trickled down the hill with the light usually music of a vanished era waltzes and marches and dixieland jazz music both romantic and danceable played to such perfection that i envied fitz his sound system until i saw several of the better known new york philharmonic members round the corner near my house early on a particular saturday evening laughter conversation and the tinkle of ice against fine crystal filled the gaps during the musicians break and in those early days as i sat on my porch swing and stared up at the light i imagined parties like those i had only seen on filmslender beautiful women in glittery gowns and athletic men who wore tuxedos like a second skin exchanging witty and wry conversation under a dying moon in those early days i didnt trudge up the hill although later i learned i could have and drop into a perpetual party that never seemed to have a guest list i still had enough of my midwestern politeness to wait for an invitation and enough of my practical midwestern heritage to know that such an invitation would never come air conditioners have done little to change manhattan in the summer if anything the heat from their exhausts adds to the oppression in the air the stench of garbage rotting on the sidewalks and the smell of sweaty human bodies pressed too close had my cousin arielle not discovered me i might have spent the summer in the cool loam of my connecticut home monitoring the markets through my personal computer and watching fitzs parties with a phone wedged between my shoulder and ear arielle always had an ethereal otherworldly quality my sensible aunt with her thick ankles and dishwaterblond hair must have recognized that quality in the newborn she had given birth to in new orleans and committed the only romantic act of her life by deciding that arielle was not a mary or a louise family names that had suited carraways until then i had never known arielle well at family reunions held on the shores of lake superior she was always a beautiful unattainable ghost dressed in white gauze with silverblond hair that fell to her waist wide blue eyes and skin so pale it seemed as fragile as my mothers bone china we had exchanged perhaps five words over all those reunions held each july and always i had bowed my head and stammered in the presence of such royalty her voice was sultry and musical lacking the long as and soft ds that made my other relations sound like all their years of education had made no impression at all why she called me when she and her husband tom discovered that i had bought a house in a village only a mile from theirs i will never know perhaps she was lonely for a bit of family or perhaps the otherworldliness had absorbed her even then chapter ii i drove to arielle and toms house in my own car a bmw navy blue and spitpolished bought used because all of my savings had gone into the house they lived on a knoll in a mocktudorstyle house surrounded by young saplings that had obviously been transplanted the lack of tall trees gave the house a vulnerable air as if the neighbors who lived on higher hills could look down upon it and find it flawed the house itself was twice the size of mine with a central living area flanked by a master bedroom wing and a guest wing the wings more of an architects affectation than anything else tom met me at the door he was a beefy man in his late twenties whose athletic build was beginning to show signs of softening into fat he still had the thick neck square jaw and massive shoulders of an offensive lineman which of course he had been after one season with the green bay packersin a year unremarked for its lackluster performancehe was permanently sidelined by a knee injury not wanting to open a car dealership that would forever capitalize on his one season of glory he took his wife and his inheritance and moved east when he saw me he clapped his hand on my back as if we were old friends when in fact we had only met once at the last and least of the family reunions aris been waiting ta see ya he said and the broad flat uneducated vowels of the midwest brought with them the sense of the stifling summer afternoons of the reunions childrens laughter echoing over the waves of the lake as if their joy would last forever he led me through a dark foyer and into a room filled with light nothing in the front of the house had prepared me for this room with its floor to ceiling windows and their view of an english garden beyond the patio arielle sat on a loveseat beneath the large windows the sunlight reflecting off her hair and white dress giving her a radiance that was almost angelic she held out her hand and as i took it she pulled me close and kissed me on the cheek nicky she murmured i missed you the softness with which she spoke the utter sincerity in her gaze made me believe her and as on those summer days of old i blushed not much ta do in connecticut toms booming voice made me draw back we been counting the nails on the walls now tom ari said without taking her hand from mine we belong here i placed my other hand over hers capturing the fragile fingers for a moment before releasing her i rather like the quiet i said you would tom said he turned and strode across the hardwood floor always in shadow despite the light pouring in from the windows his abruptness took me aback and i glanced at ari she shrugged i think well eat on the terrace the garden is cool this time of day will tom join us she frowned in a girlish way furrowing her brow and making her appear for a moment as if she were about to cry he will when he gets off the phone i hadnt heard a phone ring but i had no chance to ask her any more for she placed her slippered feet on the floor and stood i had forgotten how tiny she was nearly half my height but each feature perfectly proportioned she took my arm and i caught the fresh scent of lemons rising from her warm skin you must tell me everything thats happened to you she said and i did under her intense gaze my life felt important my smallest accomplishments a pinnacle of achievement we had reached the terrace before i had finished a glass table already set for three stood in the shade of a maple tree the garden spread before us lush and green each plant had felt the touch of a pruning shears and were trimmed back so severely that nothing was left to chance i pulled out a chair for ari and she sat daintily her movements precise i took the chair across from her feeling cloddish afraid that my very size would cause me to break something i wondered how tom with his linebackers build felt as he moved through his wifes delicate house she shook out a linen napkin and placed it on her lap a man appeared beside her dressed as a waiterhe had moved so silently that i hadnt noticed himand poured water into our crystal glasses he filled toms as well and ari stared at the empty place i wish he wouldnt call her before lunch she said it disturbs my digestion i didnt want to ask what ari was referring to i didnt want to get trapped in their private lives she sighed and brushed a strand of hair out of her face but i dont want to talk about toms awful woman i understand you live next door to the man they call fitz i nodded as the waiter appeared again bringing fresh bread in a ceramic basket i would love she said leaning forward just enough to let me know this was the real reason behind my invitation to see the inside of his home tom never joined us we finished our lunch walked through the garden and had mint juleps in the late afternoon after which everything seemed a bit funnier than it had before as i left in the approaching twilight it felt as if ari and i had been friends instead of acquaintances linked by a happenstance of birth by the time i got home it was dark the house retained the heat of the day and so i went into the back yard and stared at the path that led up to fitzs mansion the lights blazed on the hillside and the sound of laughter washed down to me like the blessing of a god perhaps aris casual suggestion put something in my mind or perhaps i was still feeling the effects of the mint juleps but whatever the cause i walked up the path feeling drawn to the house like a moth to light my shoes crunched against the hardpacked earth and my legs unused to such strenuous exercise began to ache midway up the coolness of the valley had disappeared and perspiration made my shirt cling to my chest the laughter grew closer and with it snatches of conversationwomens voices rising with passion men speaking in low tones pretending that they couldnt be overheard i stopped at a small rock formation just before the final rise to fitzs house the rocks extended over the valley below like a platform and from them i could see the winding road i had driven that afternoon to aris house a car passed below and i followed the trail of its headlights until they disappeared into the trees as i turned to leave the platform my desire to reach the party gone i caught a glimpse of a figure moving against the edge of the path a man stood on the top of the rise staring down at the road as i had he wore dark evening dress with a white shirt and a matching white scarf draped casually around his neck the light against his back caused his features to be in shadowonly when he cupped his hands around a burning match to light a cigarette already in his mouth did i get a sense of his face he had an older beautycleanshaven almost womanish with a long nose high cheekbones and wide dark eyes a kind of beauty that had been fashionable in men when my grandfather was youngthe rudolph valentino leslie howard look that seemed almost effete by the standards of today as he tossed the match away a waltz started playing behind him and it gave him context he stared down at the only other visible point of lightaris knolland his posture suggested such longing that i half expected the music to swell to add too much violin in the suggestion of a world halfforgotten i knew without being told that this was my neighbor i almost called to him but felt that to do so would ruin the perfection of the moment he stared until he finished his cigarette then dropped it ground it with his shoe and slipping his hands in his pockets wandered back to the partyalone chapter iii the next afternoon i was lounging on my sofa with the air conditioning off lingering over the book review section of the sunday times when the crunch of gravel through the open window alerted me to a car in my driveway i stood up in time to see a black rolls royce stop outside my garage the drivers door opened and a chauffeur got out wearing unbelievably a uniform complete with driving cap he walked up to the door and i watched him as though he were a ghost he clasped one hand behind his back and with the other rang the bell the chimes pulled me from my stupor i opened the door feeling ridiculously informal in my polo shirt and my stocking feet the chauffeur didnt seem to notice he handed me a white invitation embossed in gold and said mr fitzgerald would like the pleasure of your company at his festivities this evening i stammered something to the effect that i would be honored the chauffeur nodded and returned to the rolls backing it out of the driveway with an ease that suggested years of familiarity i watched until he disappeared up the hill then i took the invitation inside and stared at it thinking that for once my midwestern instincts had proven correct the parties began at sundown in the late afternoon i would watch automobiles with words painted on their sides climb the winding road to fitzs mansion apple valley caterers signal wood decorators musicians of all stripes and extra service personnel preparing for an evening of work that would last long past dawn by the time i walked up the hill the sun had set and the lights strung on the trees and around the frame of the house sent a glow bright as daylight down the walk to greet me cars still drove pastthe sleek models this timedrivers often visible but the occupants hidden by shaded windows as i trudged my face heated i looked like a schoolboy prowling the edges of an adult gathering at which he did not belong by the time i arrived people flowed in and out of the house like moths chasing the biggest light the women wore their hair short or up showing off cleavage and dresses so thin that they appeared to be gauze most of the men wore evening clothes some of other eras longwaisted jackets complete with tails and spats one man stood under the fake gaslight beside the door his skin so pale it looked bloodless his hair slicked back like a thirties gangster his eyes hollow dark points in his empty face he supervised the attendants parking the cars giving directions with the flick of a bejeweled right hand when he saw me he nodded as if i were expected and inclined his head toward the door i flitted through a blond woman her hair in a marcel gripped my arm as if we had come together her bowshaped lips painted a dark wine red the crowd parted for us and she said nothing just squeezed my arm and then disappeared up a flight of stairs to the right it was impossible to judge the houses size or decor people littered its hallways sprawled along its stairs waiters carrying trays of champagne aloft slipped through the crowd tables heaped in ice and covered in food lined the walls the orchestra played on the patio and couples waltzed around the pool some of the people had a glossy aura as if they were photographs come to life i recognized a few faces from the jumble of wall street others from the occasional evening at the met but saw no one i knew well enough to speak to no one with whom to have even a casual conversation when i arrived i made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom i asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that i slunk off in the direction of the open barthe only place on the patio where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone i ordered a vodka martini although i rarely drank hard liquorit seemed appropriate to the moodand watched the crowds mood switch as the orchestra slid from the waltz to a jitterbug women dressed like flappers wearing nowaisted fringed dresses and pearls down to their thighs danced with an abandon i had only seen in movies men matched their movements sweat marring the perfection of their tailored suits a hand gripped my shoulder the feeling tight but friendly unlike toms clap of the week before as i looked up i realized that the crowd of single men around the bar had eased and i was standing alone except for the bartender and the man behind me up close he was taller and more slender than he had looked in the moonlight his cheekbones were high his lips thin his eyes hooded your face looks familiar he said perhaps youre related to the carraways of st paul minnesota yes i said the drink had left an unpleasant tang on my tongue i grew up there and nick carraway the bondsman would be yourgrandfather greatgrandfather that he knew my grandfather startled me fitz looked younger than that more of an age with me perhaps there were family ties i did not know about grandfather i said odd he murmured how odd the way things grow beyond you he had kept his hand on my shoulder making it impossible to see more than half of his face i wanted to thank you for inviting me i said it would be churlish not to he said perhaps in the future well actually be able to talk he let go of my shoulder i could still feel the imprint of his hand as he walked away he had an air of invisibleness to him a way of moving unnoticed through a crowd when he reached the edge of the dancers he stopped and looked at me with a gaze piercing with its intensity next time old sport he said the oldfashioned endearment tripping off his tongue like a new and original phrase bring your cousin i think she might like the light at least that was what i thought he said later when i had time to reflect i wondered if he hadnt said i think she might like the night chapter iv men with little imagination often have a clarity of vision that startles the mind for all their inability to imagine beauty they seem able to see the ugliness that lies below any surface they have a willingness to believe in the baser cruder side of life on the following wednesday afternoon i found myself in a bar at the edge of the financial district a place where men in suits rarely showed their faces where the average clientele had muscles thick as cue balls and just as hard tom had corralled me as i left the office claiming he wanted to play pool and that he knew a place but as we walked in it became clear that we were not there for a game but for an alibi the woman he met was the antithesis of ari she was tall bigchested with thick ankles more a child of my aunt than ari ever could be the womanritawore her clothes like an illfitting bathrobe slipping to one side to reveal a mound of flesh and a bit of nipple lipstick stained the side of her mouth and the edges of her teeth she laughed loud and hard like a man and her eyes were bright with too much drink she and tom disappeared into the back and i remained forgotten in the smoky haze i stuck my tie in my pocket pulled off my suitjacket and draped it over a chair rolling up my sleeves before i challenged one of the large men in a ripped tshirt to a game of eightball i lost fifty dollars to him before he decided there was no challenge in it by then tom and rita had reappeared her clothing straight and her lipstick neatly applied tom clapped my back before i could step away and the odors of sweat musk and newly applied cologne swept over me thanks man he said as if my accompanying him on this trip had deepened our friendship i could not let the moment slide without exacting my price my neighbor asked that ari come to one of his parties this week rita slunk back as if aris name lessened ritas power tom stepped away from me fitzgeralds a ghoul he said they say people go ta his house and never come back i was there on sunday youre lucky ta get out alive hundreds of people go each night i unrolled my sleeves buttoned them and then slipped into my suitcoat i plan to take ari tom stared at me for a moment the male camaraderie gone finally he nodded the acknowledgment of a price paid next time you go rita said addressing the only words she would ever say to me take a good look at his guests i drove ari up in my car even though i spent the afternoon washing and polishing it the cars age showed against the sleek new models something in the lack of shine of the bumpers the crude design of a model year now done the attendant was polite as he took my place but lacked the enthusiasm he had shown over a rolls just moments before ari stared at the house her tiny mouth agape her eyes wide the lights reflected in her pupils like a hundred dancing stars she left my side immediately and ran up the stairs as if i were not even there i tipped the attendant and strode in remembering ritas admonishment the faces that looked familiar had a photographic edge to themthe patina of images i had seen a thousand times in books in magazines on film but as i scanned i could not see ari it was as if she had come into the mammoth house and vanished i grabbed a flute of champagne from a passing waiter and wandered onto the patio the orchestra was playing alexanders ragtime band and the woman with the marcel danced in the center alone as if she were the only one who understood the music beside me a burly man with dark hair and a mustache that absorbed his upper lip spoke of marlin fishing as if it were a combat sport a lanky and lean man who spoke with a mississippi accent told a familiar story about a barnburning to a crowd of women who gazed adoringly at his face behind him a tiny woman with an acid tongue talked in disparaging terms of the algonquin and another man with white hair a face crinkled from too much drink and a body so thin it appeared dapper studied the edges of the conversation as if the words were written in front of him they all had skin as pale as fitzs and a life force that seemed to have more energy than substance there were others scattered among the crowd a man with an unruly shock of white hair who spoke of his boyhood in illinois his cats and the workings of riverboats powered by steam the demure brownhaired woman wearing a long white dress standing in a corner refusing to meet anyones gaze shes a poet a young girl beside me whispered and i nodded recognizing the heartshaped face the quiet steady eyes in that house on that night i never questioned their presence as if being in the company of people longdead were as natural as speaking to myself i avoided them they had nothing to do with me i was drawn to none of them except perhaps fitz himself he was as invisible as ari i wandered through the manse three times pushing past bodies flushed from dancing bright with too much drink letting the conversation flow over me like water over a stone most of my colleagues spoke of fitz himself how he had favored them in one way or another with a commission or in the case of the women with time alone they spoke with a sigh their eyes a bit glazed as if the memory were more of a dream and as they spoke they touched their throats or played with pearl chokers around their necks a shudder ran through me and i wondered what i had brought arielle into i found her at am waltzing in the empty grand ballroom with fitz he wore an ice cream suit perfectly tailored his hair combed back and she wore a white gown that rippled around her like her hair she gazed at him like a lover her lips parted and moist her body pressed against his and as they whirled to the imaginary music i caught glimpses of his face his brows brought together in concentration his eyes sparkling and moist he looked like a man caught in a dream from which he could not wake a dream which had gone bad a dream which when he remembered it he would term a nightmare then she saw me and her expression changed nick she said nick carraway and she laughed the voice was not hers it had more music than before but beneath it a rasp older women gained from too many cigarettes too much drink he will never leave us alone scott fitz looked at me if anything he appeared paler than he had before the sparkle in his eyes was not tears but the hard glare of a man who could not cry thanks for all your help old man he said and with that i knew i had been dismissed chapter v about a week before an ambitious young reporter appeared on fitzs doorstep as one of the parties began he managed to find fitz at the edge of the pool and asked him if he had anything to say about what fitz asked about anything it transpired after a few minutes that the young man had heard fitzs name around the office in a connection he wouldnt or couldnt reveal and it being his day off had hurried out to connecticut to see it was a random shot and yet the reporters instinct had been right fitzs reputation as spread by the people who saw him the people who came to his gatherings had that summer fallen just short of news stories of his mysterious past persisted and yet none came close to the truth you see he did not die of a heart attack in instead he fell in as he later said with the ghouls of the hollywood crowd obsessed with immortality glamour and youth they convinced him to meet a friend a person whose name remains forever elusive he succumbed to the temptation as he had so often before and discovered only after he had changed that in giving up life he had given up living and that the needs which drove his fiction disappeared with his need for food and strong drink he watched his daughter from afar and occasionally brought others into the fold as the loneliness ate at him he began throwing large parties and in them found sustenance and others like him who had managed to move from human fame into a sort of shadowed mythical existence but the loneliness did not abate and over time he learned that he had only one more chance another opportunity to make things right and so he monitored the baby wards in the south allowing his own brush with the supernatural to let him see when her soul returned for his love affair with her was more haunting and tragic than those he wrote about and he hoped with his new understanding that he could make amends some of this i learned and some of this he told me i put it down here as a way of noting that the rumors about him werent even close to the truth that the truth is in fact as strange as fiction and i would not believe it if i had not seen it with my own eyes what he did tell me he said at a time of great confusion and i might not have believed him even then if later that year i hadnt found the books the novels the biographies that somehow even with my literary education i had managed to overlook that night i did not sleep the phone rang three times and all three times the machine picked up toms coarse accent echoed in the darkness of my bedroom demanding to know why ari had not returned home finally i slipped on a faded pair of jeans and loafers and padded up the hill to see if i could convince her to leave before tom created trouble only the light in the ballroom remained on casting a thin glow across the yard the cars were gone as were their occupants discarded cigarette butts broken champagne glasses and one womans shoe with the heel missing were the only evidence of the gaiety that had marked the evening inside i heard ari sobbing hysterically and as i walked up the steps a hand pushed against my chest i hadnt seen him in the dark he had been sitting on the steps staring at the detritus in the driveway an unlit cigarette in his hands you cant help her he said and in his voice i heard the weariness of a man whose dreams were lost still i pushed past him and went inside ari sat on the floor her bare feet splayed in front of her her dress still the white of pure snow when she saw me the crying stopped nicky she said in that raspy nother voice and then the laughter started as uncontrolled as the crying i went to her put my arm around her shoulder and tried to lift her up she shook her head and pulled out of my grasp for a moment the horrible laughter stopped and she gazed up at me her eyes as clear as the sky on a summer morning you dont understand do you she asked when im here this is where i belong then the laughter began again a harsh almost childish sound too close to tears fitz glided past me still wearing the white suit he had worn earlier he picked her up and shushed her and she buried her face against his shoulder as if he gave her strength her thin fragile neck was clear and unmarked god help me i checked but he had not touched her at least in that way he carried her to the plush sofa pushed back to the wall beneath the windows then he pushed the hair off her face wiped the tears from her cheeks and whispered to her hauntingly sleep her eyes closed and her breathing evened and once again she was the arielle i had always known pinkcheeked and delicate he looked at me and said this is why daisy had to leave gatsby because he was wrong for her the better part of me knew that being with me shattered her spirit but we are not daisy and gatsby and i could not let her go you knew that didnt you old man that i could not let her go but i didnt know and i didnt understand until much later so i remained quiet wisely as it turned out ah nick he said his fingers brushing her brow your arrival surprised me i never thoughti never realizedhow the characters live on even when the storys over i could believe in my own transformation but not your existence and i never understood the past so here i am repeating it he smiled then a selfdeprecating smile that made all his words seem like the foolish ravings of a man who had had little sleep and yet he continued telling me some of the things of which i have already wrote and others which i shall never commit to the page go home old sport he finally said everything will look different in the light of day i must have glanced at arielle with concern for he cupped her cheek possessively dont worry he said ill take good care of her something in the throb of his voice made me trust him made me turn on my heel even though i knew it was wrong and leave him there with her some warble some imperative moved me as if he were the creator and i the created i wandered down the hill in the dark and didnt return until the light of day chapter vi i had slept maybe twenty minutes when i woke to the sound of tires peeling on the road outside my house an engine raced powering a fastmoving car up the hill as i sat up brakes squealed and a voice raised in a shout that echoed down the valley the shouts continued until they ended abruptlymidsentencefollowed by a moment of silence and a womans highpitched scream it was still dark although the darkness had that gray edge that meant dawn wasnt far away i picked up the phone and called the police which in my compulsionfogged mind felt like an act of defiance then i rose from my bed a second time dressed and ran out of the house i didnt think to take the car until i was halfway up the path by then to run back and get it would have taken twice as long as continuing the sun rose casting orange and gold tendrils across the sky the silence in fitzs house unnerved me and i was shaking by the time i reached the driveway i had never seen the car beforea light gray sedan that lacked pretensionbut the wisconsin vanity plate made its ownership clear it had parked on the shattered glasses a womans black glove lay beneath one of the tires in the early morning glow fitzs manse seemed ancient and old the lawn filled with bottles and cans from the night before the shutters closed and unpainted the steps cracked and littered with ashes and gum the door stood open and i slipped inside careful to touch nothing a great gout of blood rose in an arch along one wall and dripped to the tile below drops led me to the open french doors through them i saw the pool tiny waves still rippled the water the laden air mattress moved irregularly along the surface the mans dark suit already telling me this was not whom i had expected his eyes were open and appeared to frown in confusion his skin chalkwhite and his neck a gaping hole that had been licked clean of blood of ari and fitz we never found a trace a man who had lived on the fringes as long as he had known how to disappear i had half hoped for an acknowledgmenta postcard a fax a phone messagesomething that recognized the dilemma he had put me in but as he said an author never realizes that the characters live beyond the story and i suspect he never gave me a second thought although i thought of him as i read the articles the biographies the essays and dissertations based on his lifehis true life i saved his novels for last and his most famous for last of all and in it i heard my grandfathers voice and understood why he never spoke of his life before he returned from the east all those years ago for that life had not been his but a fiction created by a man my grandfather had never met my grandfathers life began in and he lived it fully until the day he died i sold the house at the bottom of the hill and moved back to the middle west i found that i prefer the land harsh and the winds of reality cold against my face it reminds me that i am alive and although i bear my grandfathers name in a family where that name has a certain mystique that mystique does not belong to me nor must i hold it hallowed against my breast the current my grandfather saw drawing him into the past pushes me toward the future and i shall follow it with an understanding of what has come before for although we are all created by someone that someone does not own us we pick our own paths to do anything else condemns us to a glittering world of allnight parties hosted by fitz and his friends the beautiful and the damned pinecones by david wellington david wellington is the author of the zombie novels monster island monster nation and monster planet and the vampire novels bullets coffins vampire zero and hours a werewolf novel frostbite is due out in october wellington says that for him vampires have always been the ultimate predator we have no predators in our human world anymorethe only people who are ever attacked by bears or tigers are people who are doing stupid things to start with he said but for a lot of human history we were prey animals its why we got so smart and so adaptable as a species to survive in a hostile world the vampire is the metaphor for what that must have been like when there was something out there in the dark stronger faster and far more deadly than you were something that only wanted to destroy you so many modern vampire writers seem to miss this point that vampire are supposed to be a threat an enemy pinecones is the story of the first american vampireat the very beginning at the roanoke colony before jamestown before the puritans before the colonists even thought of themselves as americans when i took my son isaac away from the colony on roanoke island it was fear that drove me i freely admit it i wished to save his life my own that is all in the year of our lord we came to this haunted place thinking god walter raleigh would follow where good christians first tread we did not think to stop at roanoke but put in only to bring rescue succor to the fifteen lonely men richard grenville had left there we expected to find cheery faces bright with the first white company theyd had in many a month instead we found the fortress of roanoke abandoned the men were gone slaughtered by americans surely only the bones of one man remaining those brining in a barrel as if to preserve them for a proper burial this we provided then returned to our ships we would for the mainland of virginia well to the south where good land had been sighted there to become planters farmers wealthy gentlemen all yet it was that the navigator of our little fleet one simon fernandez refused to sail one league farther for he must make for england at once or risk the storm season in the midst of the ocean our entreaties offers of shares in the corporation were rebuffed without ships we must make our colony on roanoke or swim for home all was well at first our little community was blessed with a child virginia dare the first english child born in all the new world it was only afterward the killing began when september was shedding her radiant bounty of leaves upon the earth the nights were already drawing long it was george howe who died the first while crabbing in albemarle sound we found of him his nets his kerchief nothing else when his body appeared at the shore of the island returned to us by leviathan it was pale bloodless but we thought nothing of it americans had butchered him we believed or else he had drowned when patience goode was found below an oak tree on hatterask her favor as pale drawn as a good wax candle there were murmurs governor white spoke with each man alone when he came to me he asked if id grown jealous wroth for my wife was taken on the voyage by a fever i was known to be lonesome i spat at his feet told him i was an englishman no killer of women he said he believed me the very next morning little benjamin holcombe was found in his bed his neck torn in some places broken his blood drained it was then we begged john white to return home fetch aid for our defense a company of soldiers to protect us from the americans his face grew sharp he repeated the warnings of the blackguard fernandez that the storm season was upon us yet he went for we were fearful in truth we knew it was too late already some claimed they saw signs of a wreck when the tide came in that very day boards sailcloth floating on the oily tide for myself i saw nothing wished our governor gods speed the next day robbie caithness the scotch carpenter who had signed on with the corporation only after we were well asea knocked on my door as if he were pounding to get into heaven on the day of judgment his face was pale as death when i answered in troth he lived but moments longer his clothing was bloody but his skin was white as a new made shirt ye bownes onlie we fownd he said to me before god took him the bones in the barrel he meant i knew it the next day i took isaac my son i told him we would leave the colony make a new establishment of our own elsewhere whut doth ye wright thir son i asked when i found isaac carving on a tree one hour later only i had been gathering up my nets my gun as much food as we two could carry i had set issac to choosing our clothes finding a tarpalling we might make into makeshift shelter during our journey instead i found him playing at woodcarving cro he carved he had made the letters tall deep so all could see them i stopped him at once but it was his second effort for on a post of the fort already he had written it out in full our destination croatoan for such was the name of the island where i thought to take my refuge i clouted him on the ear but could not explain why he begged of me why we should go alone why i wished none other of the colony to follow i could tell him nothing we took a short boat out in the mists of days first dawning paddled softly across the sound walked inland through the trees all that day there were americans about i was sure of it yet i feared them less than the bones of a dead man set to brine in an oaken barrel of the colony at roanoke what my friends partners did after i can not add more it was a fortnight afore we found good water a place to make a home we had been unassailed for once i rested easy thinking the lord had provided we made of our tarpalling a leanto a canvas roof under which to sleep isaac built a good fire for he was a fine boy clever if only ten years old we ate a rabbit that i shot prepared ourselves to sleep rise in the morning begin to construct a house fitting for two such gentlemen of virginia as we i sent isaac into the tent to say his prayers lay himself down while i poured out water on the fire watched it steam it hissed spat a halfburnt log cracked with a loud report as of a gun firing i laughed so that isaac would hear me be not afraid it was then in the darkness between the trees which were not well lit by the dying fire that i was sure i spied some movement speeke up that i shuld heere ye praye lad i called thinking it was some simple animal would be frightened by mans speech our father whiche art in heuen halowed be thy name isaac said raising his voice to me to the father of us all the motion in the woods stopped at once i was eased it were some dumb animal surely that was driven off by christian prayers let thy kingdome cum unto us thy wyll be fulfylled as well in erthe as it is in heuen isaac said i thought to calm him for he sounded afeared yet even as i turned to say somewhat i saw red eyes two of them no more than one dozen yards from me betwixt the trees i turned to ice sat stock still did not move the eyes blinked lazily was it a wolf was it a bear one of those titans of the forest that dwarf our english breed the eyes were of a height above the ground that i thought it was no wolf lede vs nat in to temtacyon but delyuer vs from euyll so be it as the words stopped isaac fell silent i felt a cold draught flood through the clearing as if winter had come on at once the red eyes took one step closer to me i sought for something some weapon for a missile i found pine cones only which lay all about in good supply i thurst forward my arm cast the pine cone at the eyes they disappeared at once yet in a moment i saw them again this time a step to my right i grasped another pine cone threw it with all my strength directly at the eyes they blinked but this time they did not move they took a step closer in fact i slung one last missile saw it fly through the dark air kept my eyes upon it thus i saw when a hand the color of bleached linen caught the cone in midflight caught it threw it back isaac i shouted isaac sonne saye ye praier againe but already i knew it was too late for us do not hasten to bid me adieu by norman partridge norman partridge is a threetime stoker awardwinner and author of the novels saguaro riptide the ten ounce siesta slippin into darkness wildest dreams and dark harvest which was named one of the best books of by publishers weekly partridges short fiction has been collected in three volumes mr fox and other feral tales bad intentions and the man with the barbedwire fists a new collection is due out in october called lesser demons which features an original vampire novella called the iron dead this story which first appeared in the landmark vampire anthology love in vein riffs off bram stokers dracula telling the story of quincey morris the american cowboy who along with jonathan harker kills the count at the climax of the novel my version of the tale is different than stokers and it involves morriss texas homecoming after the events of dracula partridge said its about demons old and new on both sides of the pond one he was done up all mysteriouslikeblack bandana covering half his face black duster black boots and hat traveling incognito just like that coachman who picked up harker at the borgo pass yeah as a red man might figure it that was many moons ago at the beginning of the story stokers story anyway but that tale of mannered woe and stiffupperlip bravado was as crazy as the lies texans told about crockett and his alamo bunch harker didnt exist leastways the man in black had never met him nobody argued sweettold lies though nobody in england anyhow especially with stoker tying things up so neat and proper and the count gone to dust and dirt and all a grin wrinkled the masked mans face as he remembered the vampire crumbling to nothing fingersnap quick like the remnants of a cowflop campfire worried by an unbridled prairie wind son of a bitch must have been mucho old count dracula had departed this vale of tears gone off to suckle the devils own titthough the man in black doubted that draculas scientific turn of mind would allow him to believe in old scratch you could slice it fine or thickultimately the fate of count dracula didnt make no never mind the man in black was one hell of a long way from whitby and his dealings with the count seemed about as unreal as stokers scribblings leastways that business was behind him this was to be his story and he was just about to slap the ribbons to it slap the ribbons he did and the horses picked up the pace the wagon bucked over ruts creaking like an arthritic dinosaur big black box jostling in the back tired horses sweating steam up front west texas sky a quilt for the night patched blood red and bruise purple and shot through with bluepink streaks same color as the meat that lines a womans heart and black thick black squares in that quilt too more coming every second awful soon thered be nothing but those black squares and a round white moon not yet though the man could still see the faint outline of a town on the horizon there was morrisville up ahead waiting in the red and purple and bluepink shadows he wondered what shed make of morrisville it was about as far from the stone manors of whitby as one could possibly get no vinecovered mysteries here no cool salt breezes whispering from the green sea blanketing emerald lawns traveling lush garden paths not much of anything green at all no crumbling carfax estate either and no swirling fog to mask the nighteverything right out in the open just as plain as the nose on your face a west texas shitsplat cattle business mostly a matchstick kind of town wooden buildingswinddried sunbleachedthat werent much more than tinder dreading the match the people who lived there were the same way but it wasnt the town that made this place hed told her that it was that big blanket of a sky an eternal wave threatening to break over the dead dry husk of the prairie fading darker with each turn of the wagon wheelscresting crestingready to smother the earth like a hungry thing not a bigger blacker night anywhere on the planet when that nightwave broke as it did all too rarelywide and mean and full up with mad lightning and thunderit was something to see hed promised her that hed promised to show her the heart of a wild texas night the way shed shown him the shadows of whitby not that he always kept his promises but this one was a promise to himself as much as it was a promise to her hed hidden from it for a while sure in the wake of all that horror hed run but finally hed returned to whitby and to her hed returned to keep his promise and now he was coming home not another place like it anywhere miss lucy damn sure not on this side of the pond anyhow she didnt fake a blush or get all offended by his language like so many of the english missies did and he liked that she played right with him like she knew the game not just knew it but thrived on it no she said nothing here could possibly resemble your texas quincey p morris because no one here resembles you she took him by the lapels and kissed him like she was so hungry for it like she couldnt wait another moment and then he had her in his arms and they were moving together off the terrace away from the house and the party and the dry rattle of polite conversation he was pulling her and she was pushing him and together they were going back back into the shadows of whitby deep into the garden where fog settled like velvet and the air carried what for him would always be the green scent of england and then they were alone the party sounds were a world away but those sounds were nothing worth hearingthey were dead sounds compared to the music secret lovers could make matched with the rustle of her skirts and the whisper of his fingers on her tender thighs and the sweet duet of hungry lips the sounds locked up in the big stone house were as sad and empty as the cries of the damned souls in dr sewards loony bin and he drew her away from them and she pushed him away from them and together they entered another world where strange shadows met cloaking them like fringed buckskin like gathered satin buckskin and satin it wasnt what youd call a likely match theyd been dancing around it for months but now the dancing was over god i want you he said she didnt say anything there was really nothing more to say she gave she took and he did the same he reined in the horses just short of town everything was black but that one circle of white hanging high in the sky he stepped down from the drivers box and stretched he drew the night air deep into his lungs the air was dry and dusty and there wasnt anything in it that was pleasant he was tired he lay down on top of the big black box in the back of the wagon and thought of her his fingers traveled wood warped in the leaky cargo hold of a british ship splinters fought his callused hands lost the battle but he lost the war because the dissonant rasp of rough fingers on warped wood was nothing like the music the same rough fingers could make when exploring a young womans thighs he didnt give up easy though he searched for the memory of the green scent of england and the music hed made there and shadows of satin and buckskin he searched for the perfume of her hair and her skin the ready eager perfume of her sex his hands traveled the wood scurrying like scorpions damn things just wouldnt give up and he couldnt help laughing raindrops beaded on the box the nightwave was breaking no not raindrops at all only his tears the sky was empty no clouds no rain no lightning but there was lightning in his eyes two the morning sunlight couldnt penetrate the filthy jailhouse window that didnt bother the man in black he had grown to appreciate the darkness sheriff josh muller scratched his head this is the damnedest thing quincey you got to admit that that stoker fella made it pretty plain in his book quincey smiled you believe the lies that buntline wrote about buffalo bill too shit no quince but hell that stoker is a silver stickpin gentleman i thought they was different and all i used to think that until i got to know a few of the bastards that is well the sheriff said that may bebut the way it was waswe all thought that you had been killed by them transylvanian gypsies like you was in the book ive been some places before and since but we never got to transylvania not one of us and i aint even feelin poorly but in the book just how stupid are you josh you believe in vampires too your bowels get loose thinkin about count dracula hell no of course not but shit josh i didnt mean that like a question you were supposed to answer huh quincey sighed lets toss this on the fire and watch it sizzle its real simplei aint dead im back things are gonna be just like they used to be we can start with this here window quincey morris shot a thumb over his shoulder the sheriff looked up and saw how dirty the window was he grabbed a rag from his desk ill take care of it quince you dont get it the man in black said huh again quincey sighed i aint dead im back things are gonna be just like they used to be and this is morrisville right the sheriff squinted at the words painted on the window he wasnt a particularly fast readerhed been four months reading the stoker book and that was with his son doing most of the reading out loud on top of that he had to read this backwards he started in reading right to left owensvill that was as far as he got quincey morris picked up a chair and sent it flying through the glass and then the word wasnt there anymore morris stepped through the opening and started toward his wagon he stopped in the street which was like a river of sunlight turned and squinted at the sheriff get that window fixed he said before i come back where are you headed the words were out of josh mullers mouth before he could stop himself and he flinched at the grin morris gave him in return im goin home was all he said there in the shadows none of it mattered because it was only the two of them two creatures from different worlds but with hearts that were the same hed come one hell of a long way to find this searched the world over hed known that hed find it once he went looking same as hed known that it was something he had to go out and find if he wanted to keep on living his gut told him find it or put a bullet in your brainpan but he hadnt known it would feel like this it never had before but this time with this personshe filled him up like no one else and he figured it was the same with her i want you i think you just had me mr morris her laughter tickled his neck warm breath washing a cool patch traced by her tongue drawn by her lips just a bruise but as sure and real as a brand he belonged to her he knew that but he didnt know the words slipped out before he could think them through i want you forever that about said it all right he felt her shiver and then her lips found his forever is a long time she said they laughed about that embracing in the shadows they actually laughed she came running out of the big house as soon as he turned in from the road seeing her he didnt feel a thing that made him happy because in england in the midst of everything else hed thought about her a lot hed wondered just what kind of fuel made her belly burn and why she wasnt more honest about it in the way of the count he wondered why shed never gone ahead and torn open his jugular the way a vampire would because she sure as hell had torn open his heart leonora ran through the blowing dust her hair a blond tangle and she was up on the drivers box sitting next to him before he could slow the horsesher arms around him her lips on his cheek her little flute of a voice all happy quince oh quince it is you we thought you were dead he shook his head his eyes were on the big house it hadnt changed not in the looks department anyway the occupantsnow that was a different story miss me he asked and his tone of voice was not a pleasant thing im sorry she said it like shed done something silly like maybe shed spilled some salt at the supper table or something im glad you came back she hugged him itll be different now weve both had a chance to grow up he chuckled at that one and she got it crossed up oh quince well work it outyoull see we both made mistakes but its not too late to straighten them out she leaned over and kissed his neck her tongue working between her lips quincey flushed with anger and embarrassment the bitch and with the box right there behind them in plain view with him dressed head to toe in black god leonora had the perceptive abilities of a blind armadillo he shoved her hard she tumbled off the drivers box her skirts caught on the seat tearing as she fell she landed in the dirt petticoats bunched up around her waist she cussed him real good but he didnt hear her at all because suddenly he could see everything so clearly the golden wedding band on her finger didnt mean much not to her it didnt so it didnt mean anything to him but the fistsized bruises on her legs did hed seen enough hed drawn a couple conclusions hal owens hadnt changed looking at those bruises that was for damn sure and it was misery that filled up leonoras bellythat had to be the answer which had eluded him for so longand at present it seemed that she was having to make do with her own knowing leonora as he did he figured that she was probably about ready for a change of menu and he wanted to make it real clear that he wasnt going to be the next course you bastard she yelled youre finished around here you cant just come walkin back into town big as you please this aint morrisville anymore quincey its owensville and hals gonna kill you im his wife dammit and when i tell him what you did to me hes gonna flatout kill you she scooped up fistfuls of dirt threw them at him you dont belong here anymore you bastard she was right about that he didnt belong here anymore this wasnt his world his world was contained in a big black box that was the only place for him anymore anywhere else there was only trouble didnt matter where he went these days folks were always threatening him threats seemed to be his lot in life take arthur holmwood for instance he was a big one for threats the morning after the westenras party hed visited quinceys lodgings bringing with him dr seward and a varnished box with brass hinges i demand satisfaction hed said opening the box and setting it on the table quincey stared down at the pistols flintlocks real pioneer stuff hell art he said snatching his peacemaker from beneath his breakfast napkin texas habits died hard after all lets you and me get real satisfied then the doctor went ahead and pissed in the pot look here morris youre in england now a man does things in a certain way here a gentleman i should say quincey was sufficiently cowed to table his peacemaker maybe i am a fish out of water like you say doc he examined one of the dueling pistols but aint these a little oldfashioned even for england i thought this kind of thing went out with powdered wigs and such a concession to you holmwood sneered we understand that in your texas men duel in the streets quite regularly quincey grinned thats kind of an exaggeration the fact remains that you compromised miss lucys honor who says seward straightened i myself observed the way you thrust yourself upon her last night on the terrace and i saw miss lucy leave the party in your charge you get a real good look doc quinceys eyes narrowed you get a right proper flyonadungpile closeup view or are you just telling tales out of school holmwoods hand darted out fisted but he did his business with a pair of kid gloves knotted in his grip the gloves slapped the texans left cheek and came back for his right at which time quincey morris exploded from his chair and kneed arthur holmwood in the balls holmwood was a tall man he seemed to go down in sections doctor seward trembled as quincey retrieved his peacemaker and he didnt calm down at all when the texan holstered the weapon quincey didnt see any point to stretching things out not when there was serious fencemending to do at the westenras house i hope you boys will think on this real seriously he said as he stepped over holmwood and made for the door there was a mexican kid pretending to do some work behind the big house quincey gave him a nickel and took him around front the kid wasnt happy to see the box he crossed himself several times then he spit on his palms and took one end delighted to find that the box wasnt as heavy as it looked they set it in the parlor quincey had to take a chair and catch his breath after all that time on the ship and then more time sitting on his butt slapping reins to a pair of swaybacks he wasnt much good of course this wasnt as tough as when hed had to haul the box from the westenra family tomb all by his lonesome but it was bad enough by the time he remembered to thank the kid the kid had already gone nothing for it then nothing but to do it the words came back to him echoing in his head and it wasnt the voice of some european doctor like in stokers book it was sewards voice one moments courage and it is done he shook those words away he was alone here the parlor hadnt changed much since the day hed left to tour the world the curtains were heavy and dark and the deep shadows seemed to brush his cheek one moment buckskinrough next moment satinsmooth like the shadows in the westenras garden the shadows where hed held lucy to him held her so close no he wouldnt think of that not now he had work to do he couldnt start thinking about how it had been because then hed certainly start thinking about how it might be again one moments courage and it is done god how he wanted to laugh but he kept it inside his big bowie knife was in his hand he didnt know quite how it had gotten there he went to work on the lid of the box first removing brass screws then removing the hinges one moments courage the lid crashed heavily to the floor but he never heard it his horror was too great for that after all this time the stink of garlic burned his nostrils scorched his lungs but that wasnt the hell of it the hell of it was that she had moved oh she hadnt moved he knew that he could see the stake spearing her poor breast the breast that he had teased between his own lips she couldnt move not with the stake there but the churning atlantic had rocked a sailing ship and that had moved her and a bucking wagon had jostled over the rutted roads of texas and that had moved her and now her poor head her poor severed head with all that dark and beautiful hair was trapped between her own sweet legs nestled between her own tender thighs just as his head had been once a long time ago maybe once again no he wouldnt start thinking like that he stared at her head knowing hed have to touch it there was no sign of decay no stink of corruption but he could see the buds of garlic jammed into the open hole of her throat the ragged gashes and severed muscles the dangling ropes of flesh in his minds eye he saw seward standing stiff and straight with a scalpel in his bloodstained grip and that bastard called himself a doctor there were shadows of course in their secret place in the westenra garden and he held her as he had before but now she never stopped shaking you shouldnt have done it she said arthur is behaving like one of sewards lunatics you must be careful youre the one has to be careful lucy he said no she laughed mother has disregarded the entire episode well nearly so shes convinced that i behaved quite recklesslyand this judging from one kiss on the terrace i had to assure her that we did nothing more than tour the garden in search of a better view of the moon i said that was the custom in texas im not certain that she accepted my story but she kissed him very quickly ive feigned illness for her benefit and she believes that i am in the grip of a rare and exotic fever seward has convinced her of this i think once im pronounced fit im certain that she will forgive your imagined indiscretion now miss lucy i dont think that was my imagination he joked she laughed trembling laughter there in his arms seward has consulted a specialist a european fellow hes said to be an expert in fevers of the blood im to see him tomorrow hopefully that will put an end to the charade he wanted to say it more than anything he wanted to say forget tomorrow lets leave here tonight but he didnt say it because she was trembling so you english he said you do love your charades moonlight washed the shadows he caught the wild look in her eye a twin to the fearful look a colt gets just before its broken he kept his silence he was imagining things he held her it was the last time he would hold her alive three quincey pushed through the doubledoors of the saloon and was surprised to find it deserted except for a sleepyeyed man who was polishing the piano you the piano player quincey asked sure the fellow said quincey brought out the peacemaker can you play red river valley ssure the man sat down rolled up his sleeves not here quincey said hhuh i got a big house on the edge of town the man swallowed hard you mean mr owens place no i mean my place hhuh anyway you go on up there and you wait for me the man rose from the piano stool both eyes on the peacemaker and started toward the doubledoors wait a minute quincey said youre forgetting something wwhat well i dont have a piano up at the house yyou dont nope well hell mister what do you want me to do quincey cocked the peacemaker i guess youd better start pushing you meanyou want me to take the piano with me quincey nodded now ill be home in a couple hours or so you put the piano in the parlor then you help yourself to a glass of whiskey but dont linger in the parlor hear the man nodded he seemed to catch on pretty quick had to be that he was a stranger in these parts quincey moved on he stopped off at murphys laundry asked a few questions about garlic received a few expansive answers detailing the amazing restorative power of mrs murphys soap after which he set a gunnysack on the counter he set it down real gentlelike and the rough material settled over something kind of round and seeing this mr murphy excused himself and made a beeline for the saloon next quincey stopped off at the church with a bottle of whiskey for the preacher they chatted a bit and quincey had a snort before moving on just to be sociable he had just stepped into the home of mrs danvers the best seamstress in town when he glanced through the window and spotted hal owens coming his way two men in tow one of them being the sheriff things were never quite so plain in england oh they were just as dangerous that was for sure but with the exception of lunatics like arthur holmwood the uppercrust of whitby cloaked their confrontational behavior in a veil of politeness three nights running quincey stood alone in the garden just waiting finally he went to lucys mother in the light of day hat literally in hand he inquired as to lucys health mrs westenra said that lucy was convalescing three similar visits and his testiness began to show through so did mrs westenras she blamed quincey for her daughters poor health he wanted to tell her that the whole thing was melodrama and for her benefit too but he held off and that was when the old woman slipped up or maybe she didnt because her voice was as sharp as his bowie and it was plain that she intended to do damage with it lucys condition is quite serious she said her behavior of late which dr seward has described in no small detail well i mean to tell you that lucy has shown little consideration for her family or her station and there is no doubt that she is quite ill we have placed her in hospital under the care of dr seward and his associates mrs westenra had torn away the veil he would not keep silent now he made it as plain as plain could be you want to break her you want to pocket her heart and soul she seemed to consider her answer very carefully finally she said we only do what we must nobody wants you here owens said quincey grinned funny that owens should say that those were the same words that had spilled from sewards lips when quincey confronted him at the asylum of course that had happened an ocean away and dr seward hadnt had a gun but hed had a needle and that had done the job for him right proper quincey stared down at mrs danvers sewing table there were needles here too sharp ones little slivers of metal but these needles werent attached to syringes they werent like dr sewards needles at all something pressed against quinceys stomach he blinked several times but he couldnt decide who was standing in front of him owens or seward or someone said get out of town or ill make you wish you was dead there was a sharp click the pressure on quinceys belly increased and a heavy hand dropped onto his shoulder the hand of count dracula a european nobleman and scientist stoker had split him into two charactersa kindly doctor and a hellborn monster but quincey knew that the truth was somewhere in between start movin quince otherwise ill spill your innards all over the floor the count had only held him he didnt make idle threats he didnt use his teeth he didnt spill a single drop of quinceys blood he let seward do all the work jabbing quinceys arm with the needle day after day week after week that wasnt how the count handled lucy though he had a special way with dr sewards most combative patient a method that brought real results he emptied her bit by bit draining her blood and with it the strength that so disturbed lucys mother and the independent spirit that so troubled unsuccessful suitors such as seward and holmwood the blind fools had been so happy at first until they realized that theyd been suckered by another outsider a transylvanian bastard with good manners who was much worse than anything that had ever come out of texas theyd come to him of course the stranger with the wild gleam in his eyes told him the whole awful tale cut him out of the straitjacket with his own bowie placed the peacemaker in one hand a silver crucifix and an iron stake jammed in a cricketing bag filled the other you make your play quince owens said im not goin to give you forever forever is a long time you aint listenin to me quince a moments courage and it is done count dracula waiting for him in the ruins of the chapel at carfax his fangs gleaming in the darkfangs that could take everything the pistol bucked against quinceys belly the slug ripped straight through him shattered the window behind blood spilled out of him running down his leg lucys blood on the counts lips spilling from her neck as he took and took and took some more quincey could see it from the depths of sewards hell he could see the garden and the shadows and their love flowing in lucys blood her strength her dreams her spirit this is my town owens said his hand still heavy on quinceys shoulder i took it and i mean to keep it quincey opened his mouth a gout of blood bubbled over his lips he couldnt find words only blood rushing away running down his leg spilling over his lips it seemed his blood was everywhere rushing wild like oncestill waters escaping the rubble of a collapsed dam he sagged against owens the big man laughed and then the big man screamed quinceys teeth were at owens neck he ripped through flesh tore muscle and artery blood filled his mouth and the peacemaker thundered again and again in his hand and then owens was nothing but a leaking mess there in his arms a husk of a man puddling red washing away to nothing so fast spurting red rich blood one second then stagnantpool dead the next quinceys gun was empty he fumbled for his bowie arming himself against owens compadres there was no need mrs danvers stood over them a smoking shotgun in her hands quincey released owens corpse watched it drop to the floor let me get a look at you mrs danvers said there aint no time for that he said dracula chuckled i cant believe it is you they sent the american cowboy the romantic quincey studied the counts amused grin unnatural canines gleamed in the moonlight in the ruined wasteland of carfax dracula seemed strangely alive make your play quincey offered icy laughter rode the shadows there is no need for such melodrama mr morris i only wanted the blood nothing else and i have taken that that aint what seward says quincey squinted his eyes adjusting to the darkness he claims youre after miss lucys soul again the laughter i am a man of science mr morris i accept my condition and my biological need disease and the transmission of disease make for interesting study i am more skeptical concerning the mythology of my kind fairy stories bore me certainly powers exist which i cannot explain but i cannot explain the moon and the stars yet i know that these things exist because i see them in the night sky it is the same with my special abilitiesthey exist i use them hence i believe in them as for the human soul i cannot see any evidence of such a thing what i cannot see i refuse to believe but quincey could see he could see dracula clearer every second the narrow outline of his jaw the eyes burning beneath his heavy brow the long thin line of his lips hiding jaws that could gape so wide you dont want her quincey said thats what youre saying i only want a full belly mr morris that is the way of it he stepped forward his eyes like coals i only take the blood your kind is different you want everything the flesh the heart thesoul which of course has a certain tangibility fueled by your belief you take it all in comparison i demand very little we take but we give too that is what your kind would have me believe i have seen little evidence that this is the truth red eyes swam in the darkness think about it mr morris they have sent you here to kill me they have told you how evil i am but who are theythese men who brought me to your miss lucy what do they want he did not blink he only advanced think on it mr morris examine the needs of these men seward and holmwood look into your own heart examine your needs and now quincey smiled maybe i aint as smart as you count he stepped forward maybe you could take a look for melet me know just what you see their eyes met the vampire stumbled backward he had looked into quincey morris eyes seen a pair of empty green wells bottomless green pits something was alive there undying something that had known pain and hurt and very briefly ecstasy very suddenly the vampire realized that he had never known real hunger at all the vampire tried to steady himself but his voice trembled what i can seei believe quincey morris did not blink he took the stake from sewards bag i want you to know that this aint something i take lightly he said four hed drawn a sash around his belly but it hadnt done much good his jeans were stiff with blood and his left boot seemed to be swimming with the stuff that was his guess anywaythere wasnt much more than a tingle of feeling in his left foot and he wasnt going to stoop low and investigate seeing himself in the mirror was bad enough his face was so white almost like the counts almost like her face in death mrs danvers stepped away from the coffin tucking a pair of scissors into a carpet bag i did the best i could she said im much obliged maam quincey leaned against the lip of the box numb fingers brushing the yellow ribbon that circled lucys neck you cant see them stitches at all the whiskeybreathed preacher said and the seamstress cut him off with a glance you did a fine job mrs danvers quincey tried to smile you can go on home now if you dont mind i think id like to stay thatll be fine quincey said he turned to the preacher but he didnt look at him instead he stared through the parlor window outside the sky was going to blood red and bruise purple he reached into the box his fingers were cold clumsy lucys delicate hand almost seemed warm by comparison quincey nodded at the preacher lets get on with it the preacher started in quincey had heard the words many times hed seen people stand up to them and hed seen people totter under their weight and hed seen plenty who didnt care a damn for them at all but this time it was him hearing those words him answering them and when the preacher got to the part about taking do you take this womanquincey said right now i just want to give thats what the count couldnt understand him with all the emotion of a tick seward and holmwood even lucys mother they werent much better but quincey understood now more than ever he held tight to lucys hand if youve a mind to you can go ahead and kiss her now the preacher said quincey bent low his lips brushed hers ever so gently he caught a faint whiff of mrs murphys soap no trace of garlic at all with some effort he straightened it seemed some time had passed because the preacher was gone and the evening sky was veined with bluepink streaks the piano player just sat there his eyes closed tight his hands fisted in his lap you can play it now quincey said and the man got right to it fingers light and shaky on the keys voice no more than a whisper come and sit by my side if you love me do not hasten to bid me adieu but remember the red river valley and the cowboy who loved you so true quincey listened to the words holding lucys hand watching the night the sky was going black now blacker every second there was no blood left in it at all just like you you damn fool he thought he pulled his bowie from its sheath sewards words rang in his ears one moments courage and it is done but seward hadnt been talking to quincey when hed said those words those words were for holmwood and quincey had heard them but hed been about ten steps short of doing something about them if he hadnt taken the time to discuss philosophy with count dracula that might have been different as it was holmwood had had plenty of time to use the stake while seward had done his business with a scalpel for too many moments quincey had watched them too stunned to move but when he did move there was no stopping him he used the bowie and he left whitby that night he ran out he wasnt proud of that and all the time he was running hed thought so much blood all spilled for no good reason dracula with the needs of a tick holmwood and seward who wanted to be masters or nothing at all he ran out sure but he came back because he knew that there was more to the blood more than just the taking one moments courage quincey stared down at the stake jammed through his beloveds heart the cold shaft spearing the bluepink muscle that had thundered at the touch of his fingers the bowie shook in his hand the piano man sang there never could be such a longing in the heart of a poor cowboys breast as dwells in this heart you are breaking while i wait in my home in the west outside the sky was black every square in the quilt no moon tonight thunder rumbled rattling the windows quincey put the bowie to his neck lightning flashed and white spiderwebs of brightness danced on lucys flesh the shadows receded for the briefest moment then flooded the parlor once more and quincey was lost in them lost in shadows hed brought home from whitby one moments courage he sliced his neck praying that there was some red left in him a thin line of blood welled from the wound overflowing the spot where lucy had branded him with eager kisses he sagged against the box pressed his neck to her lips he dropped the bowie his hand closed around the stake one moments courage he tore the wooden shaft from her heart and waited minutes passed he closed his eyes buried his face in her dark hair his hands were scorpions scurrying everywhere dancing to the music of her tender thighs her breast did not rise did not fall she did not breathe she would never breathe again but her lips parted her fangs gleamed

postapocalyptic future coming to a town overrun by lawlessness the town was lost between the mountains and the sea like a man between the earth and heaven the train moved along the shore all night and the rattle of the wheels merged with the sound of the surf in a single unending melody in the freight car denis was barely able to sleep he lay on boards that smelled of hay and horse dung watching the infrequent flashes of stars through the holes in the slotted roof of the car there were no horses herethe livestock pens were emptybut a little bit of hay remained and he raked it under his head before going to sleep denis had undressed and now wore only his undershorts boots stood beside his feet jeans a plaid shirt and a velvet jacket hung off the side rail of the livestock pen his left hand rested atop a heavy revolver in a frayed holster the wheels of the train knocked out their song denis began to stir and whispered the train is rushingwhat a beaut the wheels are knockingtra ta toot toot then dozed off for a short time denis awoke as the car was gripped by the morning chill he stood grabbed his weapon and walked from the end of the car to the caboose platform in one of the pens a vagrant lay still and unmoving in the shadows denis averted his eyes daybreak the door to the train car was open he had entered the train through it last night outside on the platform he unhurriedly relieved himself then sat down hanging his legs off the side of the car an endless ladder spreading out beneath him the rails like twin steel bow strings and the rungs of the crossties dark from creosote if you lay your head back it seemed as if the train were gliding down from the sky itself the wheels are knocking tratatoot denis repeated a quarter of an hour later when the train had stopped in a small town denis stood in the open doors of the freight car finishing a cigarette the train pulled onto track number one on track two a long freight train with tanks and storage containers began to sing and toot and started off in the opposite direction denis jumped down without waiting for the train to come to a full stop and teetered but kept his balance its a oneminute stop said the stationmaster who was standing by the tracks with a red flag in his hand he looked suspiciously at the empty car he was alone on the platform his uniformlike his faceold and crumpled his eyes dull and dead ive already arrived denis said a gleam of curiosity appeared in the eyes of the stationmaster he looked over denis from head to toe then asked got a pistol revolver licensed no the locomotive whistled and started to move the stationmaster rolled up the signal flag and slid it into a tube he glanced at the departing train what about your traveling companion the stationmaster said pointing denis saw that the vagrants foot was visible through the open door of the train car hed asked as if by inertia in exactly the same way that he had stepped out to meet the train in exactly the way he had rolled up the flag the man had observed this kind of behavior before too many times hes going farther denis answered is your town a big one two hundred thirty people the stationmaster said and theres an infant too the daughter of a schoolteacher but she was born sickly he shrugged his shoulders i dont know whether she counts the knocking of the wheels grew silent in the distance and only the whisper of the sea remained my name is denis pyotr the stationmaster said he extended his handmechanically lifeless denis pressed his palmfirmly steadily oh youre completely frozen pyotr said some emotion at least appearing in his voice lets go inside ill make you some tea denis nodded and followed him into the stationa small onestory building made of red brick the roof covered in tile they drank tea in the cold dilapidated office in the corner old red banners with golden letters gathered dustawards for victories in some kind of socialist labor competitions from the previous century on the desk was a black plastic telephone outofplace incongruenta relic of a time before everything turned to shit does that thing work denis asked and gulped down the hot tea youve got to be joking pyotr didnt even smile but were supposed to have one nobody rescinded the rule is there electricity in the town theres a generator in the hospital theyve been bringing in a little bit of oil the stationmaster said cautiously the fishermen have a wind turbine an old one how do you get by like everybody else pyotr said with no trace of resentment we do whatever we need to we poke around in the soil but theres very little good soil around here we catch fish during the day the freight train will come by we will send ten barrels of fish to the city salted fresh we interlay them with wet grassseaweed theyll last a day what else the stationmaster hemmed and hawed well in general nothing theres no work there was no point for you to get off the train here i always find work denis said he poured himself more tea from a fat nickel teapot it was the only clean and wellconditioned object in the office and the tea brew was the real thing as though from a past life unfortunately theres no sugar left pyotr said theres never enough sugar i dont drink it sweet the stationmaster raised his tired and pleading eyes you should go the freight train will set off in the afternoonill put you on it i can talk to the engineer hell let you in the cabin you can go as he failed to explain the word asas right then there was a knock at the door and someone entered the office well now pyotr whispered as he stood denis finished drinking his tea then turned around a young man was standing at the doorthin blackhaired with brash lively eyes and brightred lips as though they had been painted with lipstick he was wearing a black leather coat with shining silver braidstuds and black leather pants that fit tightly over wiry legs in his left hand he held an automatic pistol by his sidecarelessly with boyish defiance whos he the young man asked hes just passing through the stationmaster said he got off the morning train he was riding in the freight car he was completely frozen hes leaving in midafternoon the young man remained silent and bit his lip whos this denis asked the stationmaster some kind of pretty boy pyotr choked on his tea and shook his head the young mans eyes became big and round from the insult he didnt say a thingfor which denis mentally complimented himbut he immediately began to raise his weapon the stationmaster dove under the desk the revolver in deniss hand shot just once a hole appeared in the young mans black leather jacket and the air smelled tartly of gunpowder the youth glanced at denishurt like a child forbidden to play a gameand fell heavily to the floor you go denis said to pyotr ill clean up here what have you done the stationmaster began as he crawled out from under the desk what have you done you should have just peacefully left in the afternoon youre not sick of living this way everybodys living this way its bad for everyone now no not everyones living this way denis said resolutely go the stationmaster set off for the door in an arc but the young mans bootsheavy lacedup army bootswere lying right on the doorstep and he was forced to step over the body is this one a newcomer or one of yours denis asked the stationmaster stopped awkwardly leaning over the body he licked his lips took off his service cap with raspberrycolored piping and crumpled it in his hand one of ours the doctors son where can i find him the doctor take this street the stationmaster said and flicked his hand so that it was clear right away there was only one street in the town and it goes from the station to the sea theres a little hospital halfway down the street a clinic of course not a hospital we just call it that you go home denis suggested go go ill clean up everything the hospital was very small but even so it was a little bigger than the train station it was two stories tall but on the second story parts of broken window panes were awkwardly patched with clear plastic denis walked back and forth on the porch finishing his cigarette finally he made up his mind gave a short knock on the door and without waiting for an answer entered the doctor must have lived in the hospitalotherwise why would he be in his office so early fairly old and heavy he was sitting at his desk a stethoscope the symbol of his profession was in the corner he was eating a watermelon have a seat the doctor said pushing a plate at denis eat we have sandy soil the watermelons are really good they help your kidneys im not worried about my kidneys denis said your son i know the doctor didnt raise his eyes to look at him pyotr stopped by earlier denis remained silent what do you expect the doctor asked i cant say thank you to you but im not going to begin to accuse you of anything yes certainly its good that this torment has ended to watch your son being turned into a monsterit burns up the soul i can imagine denis said the doctor set aside the green rind and started on the next piece of melon just what have you achieved he mumbled now theyll kill you and punish us for the fact that we didnt kill you ourselves how many of them are there denis asked twenty or so can you be more precise eighteen he said red juice trickling from his lips not counting my son we dont have to count him denis confirmed there are about a hundred men in the city couldnt you handle this yourself its not a hundred the doctor shook his head if we count just the adults its about seventy well there are only eighteen of them thats easy for you to say the doctor shrugged his shoulders eighteen fifteen of them are our children initially there was just three yes they settled in everything began little by little they promised to protect us and for a while they really did protect us then one our boys went over to them then another then a third you shouldve done something about it before the first went over to them denis said firmly how many men how many women they have about two women the doctor winced but thats not a problem for them if they get bored they come take our women what is the name of this gang denis asked they call themselves the high noon vampires they come to harass us every day at noon like clockwork and the leader his name is anton pavlovich denis stood and went to the door i could never understand this a handful of bloodsuckers puts the entire town on its kneesand everyone sits in the corner like sheep he said he was quiet for a moment then said where can i get something to eat theres a café across the street he already had finished another slice of watermelon and was now gnawing on the rind unconsciously we have just one café the owner of the café was the first person with living eyes denis had met in the town when he entered there were three people sitting in the dining room but they immediately got up and left as though a nasty odor were hovering around denis a woman not yet old but with hair streaked with gray came up to him peered into his eyes for a second and then nodded her head kill as many as you can she said im begging you ill kill them all denis answered simply what can i have to drink just something to drink or have a drink just drink i cant stand alcohol coffee denis just smiled as if she were making a joke but the woman went behind the bar jingled some keys and opened a drawer she took out a small bag generously poured coffee beans into a hand grinder and started solemnly rotating the lever as if she were performing a sacred ritual to a certain degree it was just that denis waited looking as if he were enchanted the coffee that the woman brought to him in a big red mug was boiling hot but the most important thing was the fact that it smelled like coffee where did this luxury come from denis asked after taking a sip from past life there is always something left from the past life denis nodded silently do you want to have a bite to eat the woman asked im not offering you a banquetyou cant fight on a full stomach but theyll come to the city at noon youll have time for a snack okay denis said although he was full what can you recommend i hate fish the woman said but i have good steaks honestly give me onewelldone and not too big a young girl peeked into the dining hall from the kitchen she had a pale face and tightly pursed lips is she afraid of me shes afraid of everyone the woman answered without turning ever since she was dragged away last year they kept her for three days the girl was about fourteen or fifteen dont you worry denis said although he knew that the woman would not believe him i will kill all of them there are eighteen of them the woman answered he liked her precision i know thats not too many her look changed ever so slightly as if she had begun to believe him take this the womans hand dove into the neck of her dress and pulled out a chain this is an icon of the mother of god i believe it was what saved my daughter no denis said and gently but firmly stopped her hand i cant take it but youll help me immensely if in a halfhour you bring me another cup of coffee if you kill them all ill make you a cappuccino the café owner said with foam they drove into town from the sea side the side of the pier where in a leisurely manner they set a couple of old barns on fire the fishermen had long ago gone off to sea in their little boats taking their wives children and more or less all of their valuable household possessions five of the gang rode horses the rest huddled on two horsedrawn carts in one of the carts a machine gun was set on a turret and behind the machine gun sitting on an old office chair a young woman was stooped overall decked out in black leather with silver buttons glistening in the sun denis watched her with amusement vampires of course arent afraid of either the sun or silver they can be killed just like peopleits justmore difficult the town had become deserted the residents did not dare look at what was happening even out of the corners of their eyes howeverin one of the windows of the café the drape was moving slightly denis smiled in that direction then returned his attention to the two carts and five riders when they saw denis standing in the middle of the street they slowed down slightly and began to move more cautiously looking from side to side cocking their rifles and switching off the safeties on their revolvers and automatic weapons denis waited patiently until they completely surrounded him the girl with the machine gun was chewing gum and gave him a look of scorn but without animosity what is this some kind of fucking cowboy the leaderanton pavlovich denis rememberedsaid he was middleaged but not oldstrong with keen intelligent eyes he wore a gun in an open holster and rode the best horse since it wasnt a question denis preferred to remain silent it was you who killed andrei pavlovich said me denis said pavlovich nodded thinking well he said if that was your way of asking to join our gang ill take you i was tired of that soplyak anyway are you the master denis asked what areyouthe master thats what the leader of a vampire pack is called or dont you even know that much a fat man riding beside pavlovich laughed the girl with the machine gun smiled pavlovich sighed kill him the first bullet struck the girl with the machine gun right between the eyes denis sidestepped right pulling pavlovichs secondincommand down from his horse and throwing him onto the cart knocking down the other gang members as if they were bowling pins at the end of the cart he lay still his neck broken the second bullet tore through the heart of a man holding an automatic rifle the third targeted the face of a girl holding a shotgun at the very last moment she jerked and the bullet tore off part of her ear and so denis had to shoot a fourth time the fifth and sixth bullets felled two guys with revolvers who were the spitting image of each other brothers twins the last one the seventh entered the stomach of a man whod tried to jump denisan asian with shortly cropped hair and cold merciless eyes someone shot and missed someone screamed the horses neighed and reared denis danced between and among his remaining adversaries breaking the necks of two of them and with a single strike of his hand tearing out the heart of a third a teenager on the cart saw this put his lips around the muzzle of his revolver and shot himself the girl with the shotgun was hanging limply off the side of the cart the weapon falling out of her dead fingers denis grabbed it and discharged one barrel into the head of a man on a horse his head exploded into red mist tratatata tratatata tratatata denis hummed like the rhythm of a foxtrot counting the dead enemies he decided not to count the young one who shot himself the leader did not fit into the rhythm either another end awaited him the remaining high noon vampires ran in all directions but the dance wasnt over yet the second shotgun shell hit the guy with the hunting rifle in the back he fell writhing in the roads dust denis then drove the butt of the gun into the forehead of a scrawny man with crazed eyes whod been running backwards deftly shuffling his feet and giggling madly as if he had seen something amazingly funny trata denis said three horses rushed along the road toward the sea denis switched the revolver to his other hand emptied out the shells and snapped three bullets in trata denis finished humming and shot two of the horses started galloping faster dislodging their deceased riders one of the riders feet got caught in the stirrup and he was dragged for a few meters then lost his boot and remained on the road motionless only the leader remained with a little regret in his heart denis planted a bullet into the leg of the mans horse with surprising deftness pavlovich leapt down but did not even try to get uphe just turned on his back and glared at denis as he approached denis slowly walked toward him pavlovich pulled out a gun and fired off a single shot but denis kicked the weapon out of his hand and grabbed pavlovichs jacket and pulled it tightly around him you missed he said denis shackled pavlovichs hands with his own belt gagged his mouth with a handkerchief and started dragging him toward the rail station the woman came out of the café when they were passing by holding a coffee cup somewhat shakily in her hands denis looked into it a cappuccino you are quick he said you are even quicker the woman said her daughter stood behind her smiling we must finish the horse off denis said will you be able to do it there are a lot of weapons back there no more deaths the woman said even a lame horse is a living horse denis drank his cappuccino pavlovich wheezed something unintelligible into his gag please go away go away for gods sake the woman shouted her nerves couldnt stand it any more it will be better for you not to tell anyone exactly what you saw here denis said he returned the unfinished cup to her and walked away dragging the leader to the train station barrels of fish stood on the platform but there was no one around denis signaled to the approaching train himself and loaded the barrels onto a cargo car at the end of the train he then threw the leader into the car and climbed aboard the train whistled and started off denis stood for a while by the open door looking at the town receding into the distance without looking he caught pavlovich as he made an attempt to jump off the train and tossed him back into the car denis closed the door approached the man and pulled the gag out of his mouth you god damned pridurok pavlovich shouted he was so terrified that he no longer was afraid of anything you pridurok were not vampires we just called ourselves high noon vampires were an ordinary gang understand an ordinary gang i understand denis nodded and this is our town was your town denis said pavlovich fell silent he looked at deniss face for a moment then stared at his chest i didnt miss he muttered i couldnt have missed denis took off his jacket revealing a hole from which slowly oozed a dark dark liquidthat quite recently just that morning had been flowing in the veins of the doctors son the cold gray flesh surrounding the wound was already starting to heal you didnt miss denis said but its really difficult to kill us those who have died already dont like to die again he was silent for a moment looking at pavlovichs neck then continued my master doesnt like it when a gang of con men call themselves vampires we dont like to kill very much but we have to sometimes thats what we are but if we have a choice we always choose to kill those who are even worse than we are the trains wheels tapped outtratatata tratatataand the rhythmical crash of the surf could be heard off in the distance

formative event in their lives it explores how big a gap there is between then and now and all the things that can fall through that gap okay henry said so now were here he was using his so entertain me voice and he was cold but trying not to show it pete and i were cold too we were trying not to show it either being cold is not manly you look at your condensing breath as if its a surprise to you what with it being so balmy and all even when youve known each other for over thirty years you do these things why i dont know yep i agreed it wasnt my job to entertain henry pete walked up to the thick wire fence he tilted his head back until he was looking at the top four feet above his head a tenfoot wall of tautly crisscrossed wire whos going to test it well hey youre closest like the others i was speaking quietly though we were half a mile from the nearest road or house or person this side of the fence anyhow i did it last time long while ago still he said stepping back your turn dave i held up my hands these are my tools man henry sniggered youre a tool thats for sure pete laughed too i had to smile and for a moment it was like it was the last time hey presto time travel you dont need a machine it turns out you just need a friend to laugh like a teenager chronology shivers and soquickly before i could think about iti flipped my hand out and touched the fence my whole arm jolted as if every bone in it had been tapped with a hammer tapped hard and in different directions christ i hissed spinning away shaking my hand like i was trying to rid myself of it goddamn christ that hurts henry nodded sagely this stretch got current then also didnt we use a stick last time always been the brains of the operation right hank pete snickered again i was annoyed but the shock had pushed me over a line it had brought it all back much more strongly i nodded up the line of the fence as it marched off into the trees further i said and pointed at henry and youre testing the next section bro it was one of those things you do one of those stupid drunken things that afterwards seem hard to understand you ask yourself why confused and sad like the ghost of a man killed though a careless step in front of a car we could have not gone to the junction for a start though it was a thursday and the thursday session is a winter tradition with us a way of making january and february seem less like a living death the two young guys could have given up the pool table though instead of bogarting it all night by being better than us and efficiently dismissing each of our challenges in turn in which case we would have played a dozen slow frames and gone home around eleven like usualready to get up the next morning feeling no more than a little fusty this time of year it hardly matters if henry yawns over the gas pump or pete zones out behind the counter in the massaqua mart and i can sling a mornings home fries and sausage in my sleep weve been doing these things so long that we barely have to be present maybe thats the point maybe thats the real problem right there by quarter after eight proven poolfools we were sitting at the corner table we always have since back when it was bills place and beer tasted strange and metallic in our mouths we were talking back and forth laughing once in a while none of us bothered about the pool but yes a little bit bothered all the same it wasnt some macho thing i dont care about being beat by some guys who are passing through i dont much care about being beat by anyone henry and pete and i tend to win games about equally if it werent that way then probably we wouldnt play together its never been about winning it was more that i just wished i was better had assumed id be better one day like i expected to wind up being something other than a short order cook dont get me wrong you eat one of my breakfasts youre set up for the day and tomorrow youll come back and order the same thing it just wasnt what i had in mind when i was young not sure what i did have in mindi used to think maybe id go over the mountains to seattle be in a band or something but the thought got vague after thatbut it certainly wasnt being first in command at a hot griddle none of ours are bad jobs but theyre the kind held by people in the background people who are getting by people who dont play pool that well it struck me as i watched pete banter with nicole when she brought round number four or five that i was still smoking i had been assuming i would have given it up by now tried once or twice didnt take would it happen probably not would it give me cancer sooner or later most likely better try again then at some point henry watched nicoles ass as it accompanied her back to the counter cute as hell he said approvingly not for the first time pete and i grunted in the way we would if hed observed that the moon was smaller than the earth henrys observation was both true and something that had little bearing on our lives nicole was twentythree we could give her fifteen years each thats not the kind of gift that cute girls covet so we sat and talked and smoked and didnt listen to the sound of balls being efficiently slotted into pockets by people who werent us you walk for long enough in the woods at night you start getting a little jittery forests have a way of making civilisation seem less inevitable in sunlight they may make you want to build yourself a cabin and get back to nature get that whole davy crockett vibe going on in the dark they remind you what a good thing chairs and hot meals and electric light really are and you thank god you live now instead of then every once in a while wed test the fenceusing a stick now the current was on each time we tried so we kept walking we followed the line of the wire as it cut up the rise then down into a shallow streambed then up again steeply on the other side if you were seeing the fence for the first time youd likely wonder at the straightness of it the way in which the concrete posts had been planted at tenyard intervals deep into the rock you might ask yourself if national forests normally went to these lengths and youd soon remember they didnt that for the most part a cheerful little wooden sign by the side of the road was all that was judged to be required if you kept on walking deeper intrigued sooner or later youd see a notice attached to one of the posts the notices are small designed to convey authority rather than draw attention no trespassing they say military land that could strike you as a little strange perhaps because you might have believed that most of the markedoff areas were down over in the moonscapes of nevada rather than up here at the quiet northeast corner of washington state but who knows what the militarys up to right apart from protecting us from foreign aggressors of course and the terrorist threat and if that means they need a few acres to themselves then thats actually kind of comforting the army moves in mysterious ways our freedoms to defend good for them youd think and youd likely turn and head back for town having had enough of tramping through snow for the day in the evening youd come into rubys and eat hearty some of my wings or a burger or the brisketwhich though i say so myself isnt half bad next morning youd drive back south i remember when the fences went up thirty years ago our parents knew what they were for hell we were only eight and we knew there was a danger and it was getting worse the last decade had proved that four people had disappeared in the last year alone one came back and was sick for a week in an odd and dangerous kind of way and then died the others were never seen again my aunt jean was one of those but theres a danger to going in abandoned mine shafts too or talking to strangers or juggling knives when youre drunk so you dont do it you walk the town in pairs at night and you observe the unspoken curfew you kept an eye out for men who didnt blink for slim women whose strides were too shortor so people said there was never that much passing trade in town massaqua isnt on the way to anywhere massaqua is a single guy who keeps his yard tidy and doesnt bother anyone the tourist season up here is short and not exactly intense there is no ski lodge or health spa and the motel frankly isnt up to much the fence seemed to keep the danger contained and out of town and within a few years its existence was part of life it wasnt like it was right there on the doorstep no bigcity reporter heard of it and came up looking to make a sensationor if they did they didnt make it all the way here life went on years passed sometimes small signs work better than great big ones as we climbed deeper into the forest pete was in front i was moreorless beside him and henry lagged a few steps behind it had been that way the last time too but then we hadnt had hip flasks to keep us fuelled in our intentions we hadnt needed to stop to catch our breath so often either we just going to keep on walking it was henry asked the question of course pete and i didnt even answer at quarter after ten we were still in the bar the two guys remained at the pool table when one leaned down the other stood silently judiciously sipping from a bottled beer they werent talking to each other just slotting the balls away looked like theyre having a whale of a time we were drinking steadily and the conversation was often twoway while one or other of us trekked back and forth to empty our bladder by then we were resigned to sitting around we were a little too drunk to start playing pool even when the table became free there was no news to catch up on we felt aimless we already knew that pete was ten years married that they had no children and it was likely going to stay that way his wife is fine and still pleasant to be with though her collection of dolls is getting exponentially bigger we knew that henry was married once too had a little boy and that though the kid and his mother now lived forty miles away relations between them remained cordial neither pete nor i are much surprised that he has achieved this henry can be a royal pain in the ass at times but he wouldnt still be our friend if thats all he was same again boys youre thirsty tonight it was petes turn in the gents so it was henry and i who looked up to see nicole smiling down at us thumb hovering over the repeat button on her pad deprived of petes easy manner partly genetic also honed over years of chatting while totting and bagging groceries our response was cluttered and vague quick nods and smiles i said thanks and henry got in a hell yes that came out a little loud nicole winked at me and went away again as she has done many times over the last three years as she got to the bar i saw one of the poolplayers looking at her and felt a strange twist of something in my stomach it wasnt because they were strangers or because i suspected they might be something else something that shouldnt be here they were just younger guys thats all of course theyre going to look at her shes probably going to want them to i lit another cigarette and wondered why i still didnt really know how to deal with women theyve always seemed so different to me so confident so powerful so in themselves kind of scary even most teenage boys feel that way i guess but i had assumed age would help that being older might make a difference apparently not the opposite if anything cute just dont really cover it henry said again not for the first time going to have to come up with a whole new word supercute hows that hyperhot ultra how about just beautiful for a horrible moment i thought id said this out loud i guess in a way i did because what pronouncements are louder than the ones you make in your own head pete returned at the same time as the new beers arrived and with him around it was easier to come across like grownups he came back looking thoughtful too he waited until the three of us were alone again and then he reached across and took one of my marlboro like he used to back in the day when he couldnt afford his own he didnt seem to be aware hed done it he looked pretty drunk in fact and i realised that i was too henry is generally at least a little drunk pete lit the cigarette took a long mouthful of beer and then he said you remember that time we went over the fence the stick touched and nothing happened i did it again same result we stopped walking my legs ached and i was glad for the break pete hesitated a beat then reached out and brushed the thick black wire with his hand when we were kids he might have pretended it was charged and jiggered back and forth eyes rolling and tongue sticking out he didnt now he just curled his fingers around it gave it a light tug powers down he said quietly henry and i stepped up close even with pete standing there grasping it you still had to gird yourself to do the same then all three of us were holding the fence holding it with both hands looking in that close up the wire fuzzed out of focus and it was almost as if it wasnt there you just saw the forest beyond it moonlit trunks snow you heard the quietness if you stood on the other side and looked out the view would be exactly the same with a fence that long it could be difficult to tell which side was in which was out this too was what had happened the previous time when we were fifteen wed heard that sometimes a section went down and so we went looking with animals snow the random impacts of falling branches and a wind that could blow hard and cold at most times of year once in a while a cable stopped supplying the juice to one tenyard stretch the power was never down for more than a day there was a computer that kept track andsomewhere nobody knew wherea small station from which a couple of military engineers could come to repair the outage it had happened back then it had happened now we stood this silent row of older men and remembered what had happened then pete had gone up first he shuffled along to one of the concrete posts so the wire wouldnt bag out and started pulling himself up as soon as his feet left the ground i didnt want to be left behind so i went to the other post and went up just as quickly we reached the top at around the same time soon as we started down the other sidelowering ourselves at first then just dropping henry started his own climb we all landed silently in the snow with bent knees we were on the other side and we stood very still far as we knew no one had ever done this before to some people this might have been enough not to three boys moving very quietly hearts beating hardjust from the exertion none of us were scared not exactly not enough to admit it anywaywe moved away from the fence after about twenty yards i stopped and looked back you chickening out no henry i said his voice had been quiet and shaky i took pains that mine sound firm memorising we want to be able to find that dead section again hed nodded good thinking smart boy pete looked back with us stand of three trees close together there unusually big tree over on the right kind of a semiclearing on a crest shouldnt be hard to find we glanced at each other judged it logged then turned and headed away into a place no one had been for nearly ten years the forest floor led away gently there was just enough moonlight to show the ground panning down towards a kind of high valley lined with thick trees as we walked bent over a little with unconscious caution part of me was already relishing how wed remember this in the future leaping over the event into retrospection not that wed talk about it outside the three of us it was the kind of thing which might attract attention to the town including maybe attention from this side of the fence there was one person i thought i might mention it to though her name was lauren and she was very cute the kind of beautiful that doesnt have to open its mouth to call your name from across the street i had talked to her a couple times finding bravery i didnt know i possessed it was she who had talked about seattle said shed like to go hang out there someday that sounded good to me good and exciting and strange what i didnt know that night in the forest was that she would do this and i would not and that she would leave without us ever having kissed i just assumed i assumed a lot back then after a couple of hundred yards we stopped huddled together shared one of my cigarettes our hearts were beating heavily even though wed been coming downhill the forest is hard work whatever direction it slopes but it wasnt just that it felt a little colder here there was also something about the light it seemed to hold more shadows you found your eyes flicking from side to side checking things out wanting to be reassured but not being sure that you had been after all i bent down to put the cigarette out in the snow it was extinguished in a hiss that seemed very loud we continued in the direction wed been heading we walked maybe another five six hundred yards it was henry who stopped keyed up as we were pete and i stopped immediately too henry was leaning forward a little squinting ahead what he pointed down at the bottom of the rocky valley was a shape a big shape after a moment i could make out it was a building two wooden storeys high and slanting you saw that kind of thing sometimes the sagging remnant of some pioneers attempt to claim an area of this wilderness and pretend it could be a home pete nudged me and pointed in a slightly different direction there was the remnants of another house further down a little fancier with a fallendown porch and thirty yards further another smaller with a false front cool henry said and briefly i admired him we sidled now a lot more slowly and heading along the rise instead of down it ruined houses look real interesting during the day at night they feel different especially when lost high up in the forest trees grow too close to them pressing in the lack of a road long overgrown can make the houses look like they were never built but instead made their own way to this forgotten place in which you have now disturbed them they sit at angles which do not seem quite right i was beginning to wonder if maybe wed done enough come far enough and i doubt i was the only one then we saw the light after pete asked his question in the bar there was silence for a moment of course we remembered that night it wasnt something youd forget it was a dumb question unless you were really asking something else and we both knew pete wasnt dumb behind us on the other side of the room came the quiet reproachful sound of pool balls hitting each other and then one of them going down a pocket we could hear each other thinking thinking it was a cold evening and there was thick snow on the ground as there had been on that other night that the rest of the town had pretty much gone to bed that we could get in henrys truck and be at the head of a hiking trail in twenty minutes even driving drunkard slow i didnt hear anyone thinking a reason though i didnt hear anyone think why we might do such a thing or what might happen by the time pete had finished his cigarette our glasses were empty we put on our coats and left and crunched across the lot to the truck back then on that longago night suddenly my heart hadnt seemed to be beating at all when we saw the light in the second house a faint and curdled glow in one of the downstairs windows my whole body suddenly felt light and insubstantial one of us tried to speak it came out like a dry click i realised there was a light in the other house too faint and golden had i missed it before or had it just come on i took a step backwards the forest was silent but for the sound of my friends breathing oh no pete said he started moving backwards stumbling then i saw it too a figure standing in front of the first house it was tall and slim like a rakes shadow it was a hundred yards away but still it seemed as though you could make out an oval shape on its shoulders the colour of milk diluted with water it was looking in our direction then another was standing near the other house no two henry moaned softly we three boys turned as one and i have never run like that before or since the first ten yards were fast but then the slope cut in and our feet slipped and we were down on hands half the time scrabbling and pullingevery muscle working together in a headlong attempt to be somewhere else i heard a crash behind and flicked my head to see pete had gone down hard banging his knee falling on his side henry kept on going but i made myself turn around and grab petes hand not really helping but just pulling trying to yank him back to his feet or at least away over his shoulder i glimpsed the valley below and i saw the figures were down at the bottom of the rise speeding our way in jerky blurredblack movements like halfseen spiders darting across an icy window pane petes face jerked up and i saw there what i felt in myself and it was not a cold fear but a hot one a redhot meltdown as if you were going to rattle and break apart then he was on his feet again moving past me and i followed on after him towards the disappearing shape of henrys back it seemed so much further than wed walked it was uphill and the trees no longer formed a path and even the wind seemed to be pushing us back we caught up with henry and passed him streaking up the last hundred yards towards the fence none of us turned around you didnt have to you could feel them coming like rocks thrown at your head rocks glimpsed at the last minute when there is time to flinch but not to turn i was sprinting straight at the fence when henry called out i was going too fast and didnt want to know what his problem was i leapt up at the wire it was like a truck hit me from the side i crashed the ground fizzing arms sparking and with no idea which way was up then two pairs of hands were on me pulling at my coat cold hands and strong i thought the fingers would be long and pale and milky but then i realised it was my friends and they were pulling me along from the wrong section of the fence dragging me to the side when they could have just left me where i fell and made their own escape the three of us jumped up at the wire at once scrabbling like monkeys stretching out for the top i rolled over wildly grunting as i scored deep scratches across my back that would earn me a long hard look from my mother when she happened to glimpse them a week later we landed heavily on the other side still moving forward having realised that wed just given away the location of a portion of dead fence but now we had to look back and what i sawthough my head was still vibrating from the shock id received so i cannot swear to itwas at least three maybe five figures on the other side of the fence not right up against it but a few yards back black hair was whipped up around their faces and they looked like absences illlit by moonlight then they were gone we moved fast we didnt know why theyd stopped but we didnt hang around we didnt stick too close to the fence either in case they changed their minds we halfwalked halfran and at first we were quiet but as we got further away and nothing came we began to laugh and then to shout punching the air boys who had come triumphantly out the other side the forest felt like some huge football field applauding its heroes with whispering leaves we got back to town a little after two in the morning we walked down the middle of the deserted main street slowly untouchable knowing the world had changed that we were not the boys who had started the evening but men and that the stars were there to be touched that was then as older men we stood together at the fence for a long time recalling that night parts of it are fuzzy now of course and it comes down to snapshots petes terrified face when he slipped the first glimpse of light at the houses henrys shout as he tried to warn me narrow faces the colour of moonlight they most likely remembered other things defined that night in different ways and were the centre of their recollections as i looked now through the fence at the other forest i was thinking how long a decade had seemed back then and how you could learn that it was no time at all henry stepped away first i wasnt far behind pete stayed a moment longer then took a couple of steps back nobody said anything we just looked at the fence a little longer and then we turned and walked away took us forty minutes to get back to the truck the next thursday henry couldnt make it so it was just me and pete at the pool table late in the evening with many beers drunk i mentioned the fence not looking at me chalking his cue pete said that if henry hadnt stepped back when he did hed have climbed it and gone over yeah he said this was bullshit and i knew it really there was a pause no he said eventually and i wished i hadnt asked the second time i could have left him with something left us with it calling an ass cute isnt much but its better than just coming right out and admitting youll never cup it in your hand the next week it was the three of us again and our walk in the woods wasnt even mentioned weve never brought it up since and we cant talk about the first time any more either i think about it sometimes though i know i could go out walking there myself some night and there have been slow afternoons and dry sleepless small hours when i think i might do it when i tell myself such a thing isnt impossible now that i am still who i once was but i have learned a little since i was fifteen and i know now that you dont need to look for things that will suck the life out of you time will do that all by itself blood gothic by nancy holder nancy holder is the author of more than eighty

vampires to be apex predators with humanity as their prey this story however demonstrates that perhaps the most dangerous predator of all is unfulfilled and unrelenting desire she wanted to have a vampire lover she wanted it so badly that she kept waiting for it to happen one night soon she would awaken to wings flapping against the window and then take to wearing velvet ribbons and cameo lockets around her delicate pale neck she knew it she immersed herself in the world of her vampire lover she devoured gothic romances consumed latenight horror movies visions of satin capes and eyes of fire shielded her from the harshness of the daylight from mortality and the vain and meaningless struggles of the world of the sun days as a kindergarten teacher and evenings with some overly eager casual acquaintance could not pull her from her secret existence always a ticking portion of her brain planned proceeded waited she spent her meager earnings on dark antiques and intricate clothes her wardrobe was crammed with white negligees and ruffled underthings no crosses and no mirrors particularly not in her bedroom white tapered candles stood in pewter sconces and she would read late into the night by their smoky flickerings she scented and ruffled hair combed loosely about her shoulders she glanced at the window often she resented loversthough she took them thrilling to the fullness of life in them the blood and the lifewho insisted upon staying all night burning their breakfast toast and making bitter coffee her kitchen of course held nothing but fresh ingredients and copper and ironware to her chagrin she could not do without ovens or stoves or refrigerators alone she carried candles and bathed in cool water she waited prepared and at long last her vampire lover began to come to her in dreams they floated across the moors glided through the fields of heather he carried her to his crumbling castle undressing her pulling off her diaphanous gown caressing her lovely body until in the height of passion he bit into her arched neck drawing the life out of her and replacing it with eternal damnation and eternal love she awoke from these dreams drenched in sweat and feeling exhausted the kindergarten children would find her unusually quiet and selfabsorbed and it frightened them when she rubbed her spotless neck and smiled wistfully soon and soon and soon her veins chanted in prayer and anticipation soon the children were her only regret she would not miss her inquisitive relatives and friends the ones who frowned and studied her as if she were a portrait of someone they knew they were supposed to recognize those who urged her to drop by for an hour to come with them to films to accompany them to the seashore those who were connected to heror thought they wereby the mere gesturing of the long and milky hands of fate who sought to distract her from her one true passion who sought to discover the secret of that passion for true to the sacredness of her vigil for her vampire lover she had never spoken of him to a single earthly earthbound soul it would be beyond them she knew they would not comprehend a bond of such intentioned sacrifice but she would regret the children never would a child of their love coo and murmur in the darkness never would his proud and noble features soften at the sight of the mother and her child of his loins it was her single sorrow her vacation was coming june hovered like the mist and the children squirmed in anticipation their own true lives would begin in june she empathized with the shining eyes and smiling faces knowing their wait was as agonizing as her own silently as the days closed in she bade each of them a tender farewell holding them as they threw their little arms around her neck and pressed fervent summertime kisses on her cheeks she booked her passage to london on a ship then to romania bulgaria transylvania the hereditary seat of her beloved the fierce violent backdrop of her dreams her suitcases opened themselves to her long full skirts and her brooches and lockets she peered into her hand mirror as she packed it i am getting pale she thought and the idea both terrified and delighted her she became paler thinner more exhausted as her trip wore on after recovering from the disappointment of the raucous modern cruise ship she raced across the continent to find refuge in the creaky trains and taverns she had so yearned for her heart thrilled as she meandered past the black silhouettes of ruined fortresses and ancient manor houses she sat for hours in the mists praying for the howling wolf to find her for the bat to come and join her she took to drinking wine in bed deep rich bloodred burgundy that glowed in the candlelight she melted into the landscape within days and cringed as if from the crucifix itself when flickers of her past life her american false existence invaded her serenity she did not keep a diary she did not count the days as her summer slipped away from her she only rejoiced that she grew weaker it was when she was counting out the coins for a gypsy shawl that she realized she had no time left tomorrow she must make for frankfurt and from there fly back to new york the shopkeeper nudged her inquiring if she were ill and she left with her treasure trembling she flung herself on her own rented bed this will not do this will not do she pleaded with the darkness you must come for me tonight i have done everything for you my beloved loved you above all else you must save me she sobbed until she ached she skipped her last meal of veal and paprika and sat quietly in her room the innkeeper brought her yet another bottle of burgundy and after she assured him that she was quite all right just a little tired he wished his guest a pleasant trip home the night wore on though her book was open before her her eyes were riveted to the windows her hands clenched around the wineglass as she sipped steadily like a creature feeding oh to feel him against her veins emptying her and filling her soon and soon and soon then all at once it happened the windows rattled flapped inward a great shadow a curtain of ebony fell across the bed and the room began to whirl faster faster still and she was consumed with a bitter deathly chill she heard rather than saw the wineglass crash to the floor and struggled to keep her eyes open as she was overwhelmed engulfed taken is it you she managed to whisper through teeth that rattled with delight and cold and terror is it finally to be freezing hands touched her everywhere her face her breasts the desperate offering of her arched neck frozen and strong and neverdying sinking she smiled in a rictus of mortal dread and exultation eternal damnation eternal love her vampire lover had come for her at last when her eyes opened again she let out a howl and shrank against the searing brilliance of the sun hastily they closed the curtains and quickly told her where she was home again where everything was warm and pleasant and she was safe from the disease that had nearly killed her she had been ill before she had left the states by the time she had reached transylvania her anemia had been acute had she never noticed her own pallor her lassitude anemia her smile was a secret on her white lips so they thought but he had come for her again and again in her dreams and on that night he had meant to take her finally to his castle forever to crown her the bestbeloved one his love of the moors and the mists she had but to wait and he would finish the deed soon and soon and soon she let them fret over her wrapping her in blankets in the last days of summer she endured the forced cheer of her relatives allowed them to feed her rich food and drink in hopes of restoring her but her stomach could no longer hold the nourishment of their kind they wrung their hands and talked of stronger measures when it became clear that she was wasting away at the urging of the doctor she took walks small ones at first on painfully thin feet swathed in wool cowering behind sunglasses she took tiny steps like an old woman as she moved through the summer hours her neck burned with an ungovernable pain that would not cease until she rested in the shadows her stomach lurched at the sight of grocerystore windows but at the butchers she paused and licked her lips at the sight of the raw bloody meat but she did not go to him she grew neither worse nor better i am trapped she whispered to the night as she stared into the flames of a candle by her bed i am disappearing between your world and mine my beloved help me come for me she rubbed her neck which ached and throbbed but showed no outward signs of his devotion her throat was parched bonedry but water did not quench her thirst at long last she dreamed again her vampire lover came for her as before joyous in their reunion they soared above the crooked trees at the foothills streamed like black banners above the mountain crags to his castle he could not touch her enough worship her enough and they were wild in their abandon as he carried her in her diaphanous gown to the gates of his fortress but at the entrance he shook his head with sorrow and could not let her pass into the black realm with him his fiery tears seared her neck and she thrilled to the touch of the mark even as she cried out for him as he left her fading into the vapors with a look of entreaty in his dark flashing eyes something was missing he required a boon of her before he could bind her against his heart a thing that she must give to him she walked in the sunlight enfeebled cowering she thirsted hungered yearned still she dreamed of him and still he could not take the last of her unto himself days and nights and days her steps took her finally to the schoolyard where once only months before she had embraced and kissed the children thinking never to see them again they were all there who had kissed her cheeks so eagerly their silvery laughter was like the tinkling of bells as dust motes from their games and antics whirled around their feet how free they seemed to her who was so troubled how content and at peace the children she shambled forward eyes widening behind the shields of smoky glass he required something of her first her one regret her only sorrow she thirsted the burns on her neck pulsated with pain tears of gratitude welled in her eyes for the revelation that had not come too late weeping she pushed open the gate of the schoolyard and reached out a skeletonlimb to a child standing apart from the rest engrossed in a solitary game of cats cradle tawnyheaded ruddycheeked filled with the blood and the life for him as a token of their love my little one do you remember me she said softly the boy turned and smiled back uncertainly in innocence and trust then as she came for him swooped down on him like a great winged thing with eyes that burned through the glasses teeth that

certain types of brain injuries can turn nice people into sociopaths at the flick of a switch these people through no fault of their own lose their basic sense of restraint of remorse of empathy vampirism seems to work the same way so if a bump on the head or a bite on the neck turns you bad are you still you and if a bump on the head or a bite on the neck can turn you bad are you ever really you such questions are especially perplexing for the affected persons familyparticularly when the individual in question is feasting on the local children mama died four nights ago giving birth to my baby sister ann bubba cried and cried mama gone in his littleboy voice but i never let out a single tear there was blood red as any sunset all over the bed from that birthing and when papa saw it he rubbed his head against the cabin wall over and over and over and made little animal sounds sukey washed mama down and placed the baby on her breast for a moment remember she whispered mama gone bubba wailed again but i never cried by all rights we should have buried her with garlic in her mouth and her hands and feet cut off what with her being vampire kin and all but papa absolutely refused your mama couldnt stand garlic he said when the sounds stopped rushing out of his mouth and his eyes had cleared it made her come all over with rashes she had the sweetest mouth and hands and that was that not a one of us could make him change his mind not even granddad stokes or pop wilber or any other of the men who come to pay their last respects and as papa is a preacher and a brimstone man they let it be the onliest thing he would allow was for us to tie red ribbons round her ankles and wrists a kind of sign like a line of blood everybody hoped that would do but on the next day she rose from out her grave and commenced to prey upon the good folk of taunton of course she came to our house first that being the dearest place she knew i saw her outside my window gray as a gravestone her dark eyes like the holes in a shroud when she stared in she didnt know me though i had always been her favorite mama be gone i said and waved my little cross at her the one she had given me the very day id been born avaunt the old bible word sat heavy in my mouth she put her hand up on the window frame and as i watched the gray fingers turned splotchy pink from all the garlic i had rubbed into the wood black tears dropped from her black eyes then but i never cried she tried each window in turn and not a person awake in the house but me but i had done my work well and the garlic held her out she even tried the door but it was no use by the time she left i was so sleepy i dropped down right by the door papa found me there at cockcrow he never did ask what i was doing and if he guessed he never said little joshua greenough was found dead in his crib the doctor took two days to come over the mountains to pronounce it by then the garlic around his little bed to keep him from walking too had mixed with the death smells everybody knew even the doctor and him a city man it hurt his mama and papa sore to do the cutting but it had to be done the men came to our house that very noon to talk about what had to be papa kept shaking his head all through their talking but even his being preacher didnt stop them once a vampire walks these mountain hollers theres nary a house or barn thats safe nighttime is lost time and no one can afford to lose much stock so they made their sharp sticks out of green wood the curling shavings littering our cabin floor bubba played in them not understanding sukey was busy with the baby nursing it with a bottle and a sugar teat it was my job to sweep up the wood curls they felt slick on one side bumpy on the other like my heart papa said i was the one let her turn into a night walker its my business to stake her out no one argued specially not the greenoughs their eyes still red from weeping just take my children papa said and if anything goes wrong cut off my hands and feet and bury me at mills cross under the stone theres garlic hanging in the pantry mandy jane will string me some so sukey took the baby and bubba off to the greenoughs house that seeming the right thing to do and i stayed the rest of the afternoon with papa stringing garlic and pressing more into the windows but the strand over the door he took down i have to let her in somewhere he said and this is where ill make my stand he touched me on the cheek the first time ever papa never has been much for show now you run along to the greenoughs mandy jane he said and remember how much your mama loved you this isnt her child mamas gone something else has come to take her place i should have remembered that the good book says the living know that they shall die but the dead know not anything i wanted to ask him how the vampire knew to come first to our house then but i was silent for papa had been asleep and hadnt seen her i left without giving him a daughters kiss for his mind was well set on the nights doing but i didnt go down the lane to the greenoughs at all wearing my triple strand of garlic with my cross about my neck i went to the burying ground to mamas grave it looked so raw against the greening hillside the dirt was red clay but all it looked like to me was blood there was no cross on it yet no stone that would come in a year just a humping a heaping of red dirt over her coffin the plain pinewood box hastily made i lay facedown in that dirt my arms opened wide oh mama i said the good book says you are not dead but sleepeth sleep quietly mama sleep well and i sang to her the lullaby she had always sung to me and then to bubba and would have sung to baby ann had she lived to hold her blacks and bays dapples and grays all the pretty little horses and as i sang i remembered papa thundering at prayer meeting once behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death the rest of the song just stuck in my throat then so i turned over on the grave and stared up at the setting sun it had been a long and wearying day and i fell asleep right there in the burying ground any other time fear might have overcome sleep but i just closed my eyes and slept when i woke it was dead night the moon was full and sitting between the horns of two hills there was a sprinkling of stars overhead and mama began to move the ground beneath me trying to rise the garlic strands must have worried her for she did not come out of the earth all at once it was the scrabbling of her long nails at my back that woke me i leaped off that grave and was wide awake standing aside the grave i watched as first her long gray arms reached out of the earth then her head with its hair that was once so gold now gray and streaked with black and its shroud eyes emerged and then her body in its winding sheet stained with dirt and torn from walking to and fro upon the land then her bare feet with blackened nails though alive mama used to paint those nails her one vanity and papa allowed it seeing she was so pretty and otherwise not vain she turned toward me as a hummingbird toward a flower and she raised her face up and it was gray and bony her mouth peeled back from her teeth and i saw that they were pointed and her tongue was barbed mama gone i whispered in bubbas voice but so low i could hardly hear it myself she stepped toward me off that grave lurching down the hump of dirt but when she got close the garlic strands and the cross stayed her mama she turned her head back and forth it was clear she could not see with those black shroud eyes she only sensed me there something warm something alive something with the blood running like satisfying streams through the blue veins mama i said again try and remember that searching awful face turned toward me again and the pointy teeth were bared once more her hands reached out to grab me then pulled back remember how bubba always sucks his thumb with that funny little noise you always said was like a little chuck in its hole and how sukey hums through her nose when shes baking bread and how i listened to your belly to hear the baby and how papa always starts each meal with the blessing on things that grow fresh in the field the gray face turned for a moment toward the hills and i wasnt even sure she could hear me but i had to keep trying and remember when we picked the blueberries and bubba fell down the hill tumbling headend over and we laughed until we heard him and he was saying the same six things over and over till long past bed the gray face turned back toward me and i thought i saw a bit of light in the eyes but it was just reflected moonlight and the day papa came home with the new ewe lamb and we fed her on a sugar teat you stayed up all the night and i slept in the straw by your side it was as if stars were twinkling in those dead eyes i couldnt stop staring but i didnt dare stop talking either and remember the day the bluebird stunned itself on the kitchen window and you held it in your hands you warmed it to life you said to life mama those stars began to run down the gray cheeks theres living mama and theres dead youve given so much life dont be bringing death to these hills now i could see that the stars were gone from the sky over her head the moon was setting papa loved you too much to cut your hands and feet you gotta return that love mama you gotta veins of red ran along the hills outlining the rocks as the sun began to rise i took off one strand of garlic then the second then the last i opened my arms have you come back mama or are you gone the gray woman leaned over and clasped me tight in her arms her head bent down toward mine her mouth on my forehead my neck the outline of my little gold cross burning across her lips she whispered here and gone child here and gone in a voice like wind in the coppice like the shaking of willow leaves i felt her kiss on my cheek a brand then the sun came between the hills and hit her full in the face burning her as red as earth she smiled at me and then there was only dust motes in the air dancing when i looked down at my feet the grave dirt was hardly disturbed but mamas gold wedding band gleamed atop it i knelt down and picked it up and unhooked the chain holding my cross i slid the ring onto the chain and the two nestled together right in the hollow of my throat i sang blacks and bays dapples and gray and from the earth itself the final words sang out all the pretty little horses that was when i cried long and loud a sound i hope never to make again as long as i live then i went back down the hill and home where papa still waited by the open door abrahams boys by joe hill joe hill is the bestselling author of the novel heartshaped box and the short story collection th century ghosts both of which won the bram stoker award he is currently at work on a comic book called locke key with artist gabriel rodriguez the vampire hunter abraham van helsing first appeared in the most famous vampire novel of them all bram stokers classic dracula and served as the inspiration for editor jeanne caveloss anthology the many faces of van helsing which features new stories about this intriguing and enigmatic figure joe hills abrahams boys from that anthology provides a new literary interpretation of this classic character by way of nods to such contemporary issues as domestic abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder the story also calls to mind nietzsches famous dictum whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster we also note that like his protagonist the author is the son of a famous man author stephen king and also has a younger brother author owen king this is most assuredly just a coincidence maximilian searched for them in the carriage house and the cattle shed even had a look in the springhouse although he knew almost at first glance he wouldnt find them there rudy wouldnt hide in a place like that dank and chill no windows and so no light a place that smelled of bats it was too much like a basement rudy never went in their basement back home if he could help it was afraid the door would shut behind him and hed find himself trapped in the suffocating dark max checked the barn last but they werent hiding there either and when he came into the dooryard he saw with a shock dusk had come he had never imagined it could be so late no more this game he shouted rudolf we have to go only when he said have it came out hoff a noise like a horse sneezing he hated the sound of his own voice envied his younger brothers confident american pronunciations rudolf had been born here had never seen amsterdam max had lived the first five years of his life there in a dimly lit apartment that smelled of mildewed velvet curtains and the latrine stink of the canal below max hollered until his throat was raw but in the end all his shouting brought only mrs kutchner who shuffled slowly across the porch hugging herself for warmth although it was not cold when she reached the railing she took it in both hands and sagged forward using it to hold herself up this time last fall mrs kutchner had been agreeably plump dimples in her fleshy cheeks her face always flushed from the heat of the kitchen now her face was starved the skin pulled tight across the skull beneath her eyes feverish and birdbright in their bony hollows her daughter arlenewho at this very moment was hiding with rudy somewherehad whispered that her mother kept a tin bucket next to the bed and when her father carried it to the outhouse in the morning to empty it it sloshed with a quarter inch of badsmelling blood youn go on if you want dear she said ill tell your brother to run on home when he crawls out from whatever hole hes in did i wake you mrs kutchner he asked she shook her head but his guilt was not eased im sorry to get you out of bed my loud mouth then his tone uncertain do you think you should be up are you doctorin me max van helsing you dont think i get enough of that from your daddy she asked one corner of her mouth rising in a weak smile no maam i mean yes maam rudy wouldve said something clever to make her whoop with laughter and clap her hands rudy belonged on the radio a child star on someones variety program max never knew what to say and anyway wasnt suited to comedy it wasnt just his accent although that was a source of constant discomfort for him one more reason to speak as little as possible but it was also a matter of temperament he often found himself unable to fight his way through his own smothering reserve hes pretty strict about havin you two boys in before dark isnt he yes maam he said theres plenty like him she said they brung the old country over with them although i would have thought a doctor wouldnt be so superstitious educated and all max suppressed a shudder of revulsion saying that his father was superstitious was an understatement of grotesquely funny proportions you wouldnt think hed worry so much about one like you she went on i cant imagine youve ever been any trouble in your life thank you maam said max when what he really wanted to say was he wished more than anything shed go back inside lie down and rest sometimes it seemed to him he was allergic to expressing himself often when he desperately wanted to say a thing he could actually feel his windpipe closing up on him cutting off his air he wanted to offer to help her in imagined taking her elbow leaning close enough to smell her hair he wanted to tell her he prayed for her at night not that his prayers could be assumed to have value max had prayed for his own mother too but it hadnt made any difference he said none of these things thank you maam was the most he could manage you go on she said tell your father i asked rudy to stay behind help me clean up a mess in the kitchen ill send him along yes maam thank you maam tell him hurry please when he was in the road he looked back mrs kutchner clutched a handkerchief to her lips but she immediately removed it and flapped it in a gay little wave a gesture so endearing it made max sick to his bones he raised his own hand to her and then turned away the sound of her harsh barking coughs followed him up the road for a whilean angry dog slipped free of its tether and chasing him away when he came into the yard the sky was the shade of blue closest to black except for a faint bonfire glow in the west where the sun had just disappeared and his father was sitting on the porch waiting with the quirt max paused at the bottom of the steps looking up at him his fathers eyes were hooded impossible to see beneath the bushy steelwool tangles of his eyebrows max waited for him to say something he didnt finally max gave up and spoke himself its still light the sun is down we are just at arlenes it isnt even ten minutes away yes mrs kutchners is very safe a veritable fortress protected by a doddering farmer who can barely bend over his rheumatism pains him so and an illiterate peasant whose bowels are being eaten by cancer she is not illiterate max said he heard how defensive he sounded and when he spoke again it was in a tone of carefully modulated reason they cant bear the light you say so yourself if it isnt dark there is nothing to fear look how bright the sky his father nodded allowing the point then said and where is rudolf he is right behind me the old man craned his head on his neck making an exaggerated show of searching the empty road behind max i mean he is coming max said he stops to help clean something for mrs kutchner clean what a bag of flour i think it breaks open scatters on everything shes going to clean herself but rudy say no he wants to do it i tell them i will run ahead so you will not wonder where we are hell be here any minute his father sat perfectly still his back rigid his face immobile then just when max thought the conversation was over he said very slowly and so you left him max instantly saw with a sinking feeling of despair the corner he had painted himself into but it was too late now no talking his way back out of it yes sir to walk home alone in the dark yes sir i see go in to your studies max made his way up the steps towards the front door which was partly open he felt himself clenching up as he went past the rocking chair expecting the quirt instead when his father lunged it was to clamp his hand on maxs wrist squeezing so hard max grimaced felt the bones separating in the joint his father sucked at the air a sissing indraw of breath a sound max had learned was often prelude to a right cross you know our enemies and still you dally with your friends until the night come max tried to answer but couldnt felt his windpipe closing felt himself choking again on the things he wanted but didnt have the nerve to say rudolf i expect not to learn he is american here they believe the child should teach the parent i see how he look at me when i talk how he try not to laugh this is bad but you at least when rudolf disobey it is deliberate i feel him engaging me you disobey in a stupor without considering and then you wonder why sometime i can hardly stand to look at you mr barnum has a horse that can add small numbers it is considered one of the great amazements of his circus if you were once to show the slightest comprehension of what things i tell you it would be wonder on the same order he let go of maxs wrist and max took a drunken step backwards his arm throbbing go inside and out of my sight you will want to rest that uncomfortable buzzing in your head is the hum of thought i know the sensation must be quite unfamiliar tapping his own temple to show where the thoughts were yes sir max said in a tonehe had to admitwhich sounded stupid and churlish why did his fathers accent sound cultured and worldly while the same accent made himself sound like a dullwitted scandinavian farmhand someone good at milking the cows maybe but who would goggle in fear and confusion at an open book max turned into the house without looking where he was going and batted his head against the bulbs of garlic hanging from the top of the door frame his father snorted at him max sat in the kitchen a lamp burning at the far end of the table not enough to dispel the darkness gathering in the room he waited listening his head cocked so he could see through the window and into the yard he had his english grammar open in front of him but he didnt look at it couldnt find the will to do anything but sit and watch for rudy in a while it was too dark to see the road though or anyone coming along it the tops of the pines were black cutouts etched across a sky that was a color like the last faint glow of dying coals soon even that was gone and into the darkness was cast a handful of stars a scatter of bright flecks max heard his father in the rocker the soft whineandthump of the curved wooden runners going back and forth over the boards of the porch max shoved his hands through his hair pulling at it chanting to himself rudy come on wanting more than anything for the waiting to be over it mightve been an hour it mightve been fifteen minutes then he heard him the soft chuff of his brothers feet in the chalky dirt at the side of the road he slowed as he came into the yard but max suspected he had just been running a hypothesis that was confirmed as soon as rudy spoke although he tried for his usual tone of good humor he was winded could only speak in bursts sorry sorry mrs kutchner an accident asked me to help i know late the rocker stopped moving the boards creaked as their father came to his feet so max said and did you get the mess clean up yuh uhhuh arlene and i arlene ran through the kitchen wasnt looking mrs kutchnermrs kutchner dropped a stack of plates max shut his eyes bent his head forward yanking at the roots of his hair in anguish mrs kutchner shouldnt tire herself shes unwell indeed i think she can hardly rise from bed thats whatthats what i thought too rudys voice at the bottom of the porch he was beginning to recover his air its not really all the way dark yet it isnt ah when one get to my age the vision fail some and dusk is often mistake for night here i was thinking sunset has come and gone twenty minutes ago what time max heard the steely snap of his father opening his pocket watch he sighed but its too dark for me to read the hands well your concern for mrs kutchner i admire oh itit was nothing rudy said putting his foot on the first step of the porch but really you should worry more about your own wellbeing rudolf said their father his voice calm benevolent speaking in the tone max often imagined him employing when addressing patients he knew were in the final stages of a fatal illness it was after dark and the doctor was in rudy said im sorry im youre sorry now but your regret will be more palpable momentarily the quirt came down with a meaty smack and rudy who would be ten in two weeks screamed max ground his teeth his hands still digging in his hair pressed his wrists against his ears trying vainly to block out the sounds of shrieking and of the quirt striking at flesh fat and bone with his ears covered he didnt hear their father come in he looked up when a shadow fell across him abraham stood in the doorway to the hall hair disheveled collar askew the quirt pointed at the floor max waited to be hit with it but no blow came help your brother in max rose unsteadily to his feet he couldnt hold the old mans gaze so he lowered his eyes found himself staring at the quirt instead the back of his fathers hand was freckled with blood max drew a thin dismayed breath you see what you make me do max didnt reply maybe no answer was necessary or expected his father stood there for a moment longer then turned and strode away into the back of the house toward the private study he always kept locked a room in which they were forbidden to enter without his permission many nights he nodded off there and could be heard shouting in his sleep cursing in dutch stop running max shouted i catch you eventually rudolf capered across the corral grabbed the rail and heaved himself over it sprinted for the side of the house his laughter trailing behind him give it back max said and he leaped the rail without slowing down hit the ground without losing a step he was angry really angry and in his fury possessed an unlikely grace unlikely because he was built along the same lines as his father with the rough dimensions of a water buffalo taught to walk on its back legs rudy by contrast had their mothers delicate build to go with her porcelain complexion he was quick but max was closing in anyway rudy was looking back over his shoulder too much not concentrating on where he was going he was almost to the side of the house when he got there max would have him trapped against the wall could easily cut off any attempt to break left or right but rudy didnt break to the left or right the window to their fathers study was pushed open about a foot revealing a cool library darkness rudy grabbed the windowsill over his headhe still held maxs letter in one handand with a giddy glance back heaved himself into the shadows however their father felt about them arriving home after dark it was nothing compared to how he would feel to discover either one of them had gained entry to his most private sanctum but their father was gone had taken the ford somewhere and max didnt slow down to think what would happen if he suddenly returned he jumped and grabbed his brothers ankle thinking he would drag the little worm back out into the light but rudy screamed twisted his foot out of maxs grasp he fell into darkness crashed to the floorboards with an echoing thud that caused glass to rattle softly against glass somewhere in the office then max had the windowsill and he yanked himself into the air go slow max its a his brother cried and he thrust himself through the window big drop rudy finished max had been in his fathers study before of course sometimes abraham invited them in for a talk by which he meant he would talk and they would listen but he had never entered the room by way of the window he spilled forward had a startling glance of the floor almost three feet below him and realized he was about to dive into it face first at the edge of his vision he saw a round end table next to one of his fathers armchairs and he reached for it to stop his fall his momentum continued to carry him forward and he crashed to the floor at the last moment he turned his face aside and most of his weight came down on his right shoulder the furniture leaped the end table turned over dumping everything on it max heard a bang and a glassy crack that was more painful to him then the soreness he felt in either head or shoulder rudy sprawled a yard away from him sitting on the floor still grinning a little foolishly he held the letter halfcrumpled in one hand forgotten the end table was on its side fortunately not broken but an empty inkpot had smashed lay in gleaming chunks close to maxs knee a stack of books had been flung across the persian carpet a few papers swirled overhead drifting slowly to the floor with a swish and a scrape you see what you make me do max said gesturing at the inkpot then he flinched realizing that this was exactly what his father had said to him a few nights before he didnt like the old man peeping out from inside him talking through him like a puppet a hollowedout emptyheaded boy of wood well just throw it away rudy said he knows where everything in his office is he will notice it missing my balls he comes in here to drink brandy fart in his couch and fall asleep ive been in here lots of times i took his lighter for smokes last month and he still hasnt noticed you what max asked staring at his younger brother in genuine surprise and not without a certain envy it was the older brothers place to take foolish risks and be casually detached about it later whos this letter to that you had to go and hide somewhere to write it i was watching you work on it over your shoulder i still remember how i held your hand in mine rudys voice swooping and fluttering in mockromantic passion max lunged at his brother but was too slow rudy had flipped the letter over and was reading the beginning the smile began to fade thought lines wrinkling the pale expanse of his forehead then max had ripped the sheet of paper away mother rudy asked thoroughly nonplussed it was assignment for school we were ask if you wrote a letter to anyone who would it be mrs louden tell us it could be someone imaginary oror historic figure someone dead youd turn that in and let mrs louden read it i dont know i am not finish yet but as max spoke he was already beginning to realize he had made a mistake allowed himself to get carried away by the fascinating possibilities of the assignment the irresistible what if of it and had written things too personal for him to show anyone he had written you were the only one i knew how to talk to and i am sometimes so lonely he had really been imagining her reading it somehow somewhereperhaps as he wrote it some astral form of her staring over his shoulder smiling sentimentally as his pen scratched across the page it was a mawkish absurd fantasy and he felt a withering embarrassment to think he had given in to it so completely his mother had already been weak and ill when the scandal drove their family from amsterdam they lived for a while in england but word of the terrible thing their father had done whatever it wasmax doubted he would ever know followed them on they had gone to america his father believed he had acquired a position as a lecturer at vassar college was so sure of this he had ladled much of his savings into the purchase of a handsome nearby farm but in new york city they were met by the dean who told abraham van helsing that he could not in good conscience allow the doctor to work unsupervised with young ladies who were not yet at the age of consent max knew now his father had killed his mother as surely as if he had held a pillow over her face in her sickbed it wasnt the travel that had done her in although that was bad enough too much for a woman who was both pregnant and weak with a chronic infection of the blood which caused her to bruise at the slightest touch it was humiliation mina had not been able to survive the shame of what he had done what they were all forced to run from come on max said lets clean up and get out of here he righted the table and began gathering the books but turned his head when rudy said do you believe in vampires max rudy was on his knees in front of an ottoman across the room he had hunched over to collect a few papers which had settled there then stayed to look at the battered doctors bag tucked underneath it rudy tugged at the rosary knotted around the handles leave that alone max said we need to clean not make bigger mess do you max was briefly silent mother was attacked her blood was never the same after her illness did she ever say she was attacked or did he she died when i was six she would not confide in a child about such a thing but do you think were in danger rudy had the bag open now he reached in to remove a bundle carefully wrapped in royal purple fabric wood clicked against wood inside the velvet that vampires are out there waiting for a chance at us for our guard to drop i would not discount possibility however unlikely however unlikely his brother said laughing softly he opened the velvet wrap and looked in at the nineinch stakes skewers of blazing white wood handles wrapped in oiled leather well i think its all bullshit bullllshit singing a little the course of the discussion unnerved max he felt for an instant lightheaded with vertigo as if he suddenly found himself peering over a steep drop and perhaps that wasnt too far off he had always known the two of them would have this conversation someday and he feared where it might take them rudy was never happier than when he was making an argument but he didnt follow his doubts to their logical conclusion he could say it was all bullshit but didnt pause to consider what that meant about their father a man who feared the night as a person who cant swim fears the ocean max almost needed it to be true for vampires to be real because the other possibilitythat their father was and always had been in the grip of a psychotic fantasywas too awful too overwhelming he was still considering how to reply when his attention was caught by a picture frame slid halfway in under his fathers armchair it was face down but he knew what hed see when he turned it over it was a sepiatoned calotype print of his mother posed in the library of their townhouse in amsterdam she wore a white straw hat her ebon hair fluffed in airy curls beneath it one gloved hand was raised in an enigmatic gesture so that she almost appeared to be waving an invisible cigarette in the air her lips were parted she was saying something max often wondered what he for some reason imagined himself to be standing just out of the frame a child of four staring solemnly up at her he felt that she was raising her hand to wave him back keep him from wandering into the shot if this was so it seemed reasonable to believe she had been caught forever in the act of saying his name he heard a scrape and a tinkle of falling glass as he picked the picture frame up and turned it over the plate of glass had shattered in the exact center he began wiggling small gleaming fangs of glass out of the frame and setting them aside concerned that none should scratch the glossy calotype beneath he pulled a large wedge of glass out of the upper corner of the frame and the corner of the print came loose with it he reached up to poke the print back into place and then hesitated frowning feeling for a moment that his eyes had crossed and he was seeing double there appeared to be a second print behind the first he tugged the photograph of his mother out of the frame then stared without understanding at the picture that had been secreted behind it an icy numbness spread through his chest crawling into his throat he glanced around and was relieved to see rudy still kneeling at the ottoman humming to himself rolling the stakes back up into their shroud of velvet he looked back at the secret photograph the woman in it was dead she was also naked from the waist up her gown torn open and yanked to the curve of her waist she was sprawled in a fourposter bedpinned there by ropes wound around her throat and pulling her arms over her head she was young and maybe had been beautiful it was hard to tell one eye was shut the other open in a slit that showed the unnatural glaze on the eyeball beneath her mouth was forced open stuffed with an obscene misshapen white ball she was actually biting down on it her upper lip drawn back to show the small even row of her upper palate the side of her face was discolored with bruise between the milky heavy curves of her breasts was a spoke of white wood her left ribcage was painted with blood even when he heard the car in the drive he couldnt move couldnt pry his gaze from the photograph then rudy was up pulling at maxs shoulder telling him they had to go max clapped the photo to his chest to keep his brother from seeing he said go ill be right behind you and rudy took his hand off his arm and went on max fumbled with the picture frame struggling to fit the calotype of the murdered woman back into place then saw something else went still again he had not until this instant taken notice of the figure to the far left in the photograph a man on the near side of the bed his back was to the photographer and he was so close in the foreground that his shape was a blurred vaguely rabbinical figure in a flatbrimmed black hat and black overcoat there was no way to be sure who this man was but max was sure knew him from the way he held his head the careful almost stiff way it was balanced on the thick barrel of his neck in one hand he held a hatchet in the other a doctors bag the car died with an emphysemic wheeze and tinny clatter he squeezed the photograph of the dead woman into the frame slid the portrait of mina back on top of it he set the picture with no glass in it on the end table stared at it for a beat then saw with horror that he had stuck mina in upside down he started to reach for it come on rudy cried please max he was outside standing on his tiptoes to look back into the study max kicked the broken glass under the armchair stepped to the window and screamed or tried tohe didnt have the air in his lungs couldnt force it up his throat their father stood behind rudy staring in at max over rudys head rudy didnt see didnt know he was there until their father put his hands on his shoulders rudolf had no trouble screaming at all and leaped as if he meant to jump back into the study the old man regarded his eldest son in silence max stared back head half out the window hands on the sill if you like his father said i could open the door and you could effect your exit by the hallway what it lacks in drama it makes up in convenience no max said no thank you thank you imwerethis ismistake im sorry mistake is not knowing capital of portugal on a geography test this is something else he paused lowering his head his face stony then he released rudy and turned away opening a hand and pointing it at the yard in a gesture that seemed to mean step this way we will discuss what at later date now if it is no trouble i will ask you to leave my office max stared his father had never before delayed punishmentbreaking and entering his study at the least deserved a vigorous lashingand he tried to think why he would now his father waited max climbed out dropped into the flower bed rudy looked at him eyes helpless pleading asking him what they ought to do max tipped his head towards the stablestheir own private studyand started walking slowly and deliberately away his little brother fell into step beside him trembling continuously before they could get away though his fathers hand fell on maxs shoulder my rules are to protect you always maximilian he said maybe you are tell me now you dont want to be protect any longer when you were little i cover your eyes at the theater when come the murderers to slaughter clarence in richard but then later when we went to macbeth you shove my hand away you want to see now i feel history repeats nuh max didnt reply at last his father released him they had not gone ten paces when he spoke again oh i almost forget i did not tell you where or why i was gone and i have piece of news i know will make sad the both of you mr kutchner run up the road while you were in school shouting doctor doctor come quick my wife as soon as i see her burning with fever i know she must travel to dr rosens infirmary in town but alas the farmer come for me too late walking her to my car her intestines fall out of her with a slop he made a soft clucking sound with his tongue as of disapproval i will have our suits cleaned the funeral is on friday arlene kutchner wasnt in school the next day they walked past her house on the way home but the black shutters were across the windows and the place had a toosilent abandoned feel to it the funeral would be in town the next morning and perhaps arlene and her father had already gone there to wait they had family in the village when the two boys tramped into their own yard the ford was parked alongside the house and the slanted double doors to the basement were open rudy pointed himself towards the barnthey owned a single horse a usedup nag named rice and it was rudys day to muck out her stableand max went into the house alone he was at the kitchen table when he heard the doors to the cellar crash shut outside shortly afterwards his father climbed the stairs appeared in the basement doorway are you work on something down there max asked his fathers gaze swept across him but his eyes were deliberately blank later i shall unfold to you he said and max watched him while he removed a silver key from the pocket of his waistcoat and turned it in the lock to the basement door it had never been used before and until that moment max had not even known a key existed max was on edge the rest of the afternoon kept looking at the basement door unsettled by his fathers promise later i shall unfold to you there was of course no opportunity to talk to rudy about it over dinner to speculate on just what might be unfolded but they were also unable to talk afterward when they remained at the kitchen table with their schoolbooks usually their father retired early to his study to be alone and they wouldnt see him again until morning but tonight he seemed restless always coming in and out of the room to wash a glass to find his reading glasses and finally to light a lantern he adjusted the wick so a low red flame wavered at the bottom of the glass chimney and then set it on the table before max boys he said turning to the basement unlocking the bolt go downstairs wait for me touch nothing rudy threw a horrified wheyfaced look at max rudy couldnt bear the basement its low ceiling and its smell the lacy veils of cobwebs in the corners if rudy was ever given a chore there he always begged max to go with him max opened his mouth to question their father but he was already slipping away out of the room disappearing down the hall to his study max looked at rudy rudy was shaking his head in wordless denial it will be all right max promised i will take care of you rudy carried the lantern and let max go ahead of him down the stairs the reddishbronze light of the lamp threw shadows that leaned and jumped a surging darkness that lapped at the walls of the stairwell max descended to the basement floor and took a slow uncertain look around to the left of the stairs was a worktable on top of it was a pile of something covered in a piece of grimy white tarpstacks of bricks maybe or heaps of folded laundry it was hard to tell in the gloom without going closer max crept in slow shuffling steps until he had crossed most of the way to the table and then he stopped suddenly knowing what the sheet covered we need to go max rudy peeped right behind him max hadnt known he was there had thought he was still standing on the steps we need to go right now and max knew he didnt mean just get out of the basement but get out of the house run from the place where they had lived ten years and not come back but it was too late to pretend they were huck and jim and light out for the territories their fathers feet fell heavily on the dusty wood planks behind them max glanced up the stairs at him he was carrying his doctors bag i can only deduce their father began from your ransack of my private study you have finally develop interest in the secret work to which i sacrifice so much i have in my time kill six of the undead by my own hand the last the diseased bitch in the picture i keep hid in my officei believe you have both see it rudy cast a panicked look at max who only shook his head be silent their father went on i have train others in the art of destroying the vampire including your mothers unfortunate first husband jonathan harker gott bless him and so i can be held indirectly responsible for the slaughter of perhaps fifty of their filthy infected kind and it is now i see time my own boys learn how it is done how to be sure so you may know how to strike at those who would strike at you i dont want to know rudy said he didnt see picture max said at the same time their father appeared not to hear either of them he moved past them to the worktable and the canvas covered shape upon it he lifted one corner of the tarp and looked beneath it made a humming sound of approval and pulled the covering away mrs kutchner was naked and hideously withered her cheeks sunken her mouth gaping open her stomach was caved impossibly in beneath her ribs as if everything in it had been sucked out by the pressure of a vacuum her back was bruised a deep bluish violet by the blood that had settled there rudy moaned and hid his face against maxs side their father set his doctors bag beside her body and opened it she isnt of course undead merely dead true vampires are uncommon and it would not be practicable or advisable for me to find one for you to rehearse on but she will suit for purposes of demonstration from within his bag he removed the bundle of stakes wrapped in velvet what is she doing here max asked they bury her tomorrow but today i am to make autopsy for purposes of my private research mr kutchner understand is happy to cooperate if it mean one day no other woman die in such a way he had a stake in one hand a mallet in the other rudy began to cry max felt he was coming unmoored from himself his body stepped forward without him in it another part of him remained beside rudy an arm around his brothers heaving shoulders rudy was saying please i want to go upstairs max watched himself walk flatfooted to his father who was staring at him with an expression that mingled curiosity with a certain quiet appreciation he handed max the mallet and that brought him back he was in his own body again conscious of the weight of the hammer tugging his wrist downward his father gripped maxs other hand and lifted it drawing it towards mrs kutchners meager breasts he pressed maxs fingertips to a spot between two ribs and max looked into the dead womans face her mouth open as to speak are you doctorin me max van helsing here his father said folding one of the stakes into his hand you drive it in here to the hilt in an actual case the first blow will be follow by wailing profanity a frantic struggle to escape the accursed never go easily bear down do not desist from your work until you have impale her and she has give up her struggle against you it will be over soon enough max raised the mallet he stared into her face and wished he could say he was sorry that he didnt want to do it when he slammed the mallet down with an echoing bang he heard a high piercing scream and almost screamed himself believing for an instant it was her still somehow alive then realized it was rudy max was powerfully built with his deep water buffalo chest and scandinavian farmers shoulders with the first blow he had driven the stake over twothirds of the way in he only needed to bring the mallet down once more the blood that squelched up around the wood was cold and had a sticky viscous consistency max swayed his head light his father took his arm goot abraham whispered into his ear his arms around him squeezing him so tightly his ribs creaked max felt a little thrill of pleasurean automatic reaction to the intense unmistakable affection of his fathers embraceand was sickened by it to do offense to the house of the human spirit even after its tenant depart is no easy thing i know his father went on holding him max stared at mrs kutchners gaping mouth the delicate row of her upper teeth and found himself remembering the girl in the calotype print the ball of garlic jammed in her mouth where were her fangs max said hm whose what his father said in the photograph of the one you kill max said turning his head and looking into his fathers face she didnt have fangs his father stared at him his eyes blank uncomprehending then he said they disappear after the vampire die poof he released him and max could breathe normally again their father straightened now there remain one thing he said the head must be remove and the mouth stuff with garlic rudolf max turned his head slowly his father had moved back a step in one hand he held a hatchet max didnt know where it had come from rudy was on the stairs three steps from the bottom he stood pressed against the wall his left wrist shoved in his mouth to quell his screaming he shook his head back and forth frantically max reached for the hatchet grabbed it by the handle i do it he would too was confident of himself he saw now he had always had it in him his fathers brusque willingness to puncture flesh and toil in blood he saw it clear and with a kind of dismay no his father said wrenching the hatchet away pushing max back max bumped the worktable and a few stakes rolled off clattering to the dust pick those up rudy bolted but slipped on the steps falling to all fours and banging his knees their father grabbed him by the hair and hauled him backwards throwing him to the floor rudy thudded into the dirt sprawling on his belly he rolled over when he spoke his voice was unrecognizable please he screamed please dont im scared please father dont make me the mallet in one hand half a dozen stakes in the other max stepped forward thought he would intervene but his father swiveled caught his elbow shoved him at the stairs up now giving him another push as he spoke max fell on the stairs barking one of his own shins their father bent to grab rudy by the arm but he squirmed away crabwalking over the dirt for a far corner of the room come i help you their father said her neck is brittle it wont take long rudy shook his head backed further into the corner by the coal bin his father flung the axe in the dirt then you will remain here until you are in a more complaisant state of mind he turned took maxs arm and thrust him towards the top of the steps no rudy screamed getting up lunging for the stairs the handle of the hatchet got caught between his feet though and he tripped on it crashed to his knees he got back up but by then their father was pushing max through the door at the top of the staircase following him through he slammed it behind them rudy hit the other side a moment later as their father was turning that silver key in the lock please rudy cried im scared im scared i want to come out max stood in the kitchen his ears were ringing he wanted to say stop it open the door but couldnt get the words out felt his throat closing his arms hung at his sides his hands heavy as if cast from lead nonot lead they were heavy from the things in them the mallet the stakes his father panted for breath his broad forehead resting against the shut door when he finally stepped back his hair was scrambled and his collar had popped loose you see what he make me do he said your mother was also so just as unbending and hysterical just as in need of firm instruction i tried i the old man turned to look at him and in the instant before max hit him with the mallet his father had time to register shock even wonder max caught him across the jaw a blow that connected with a bony clunk and enough force to drive a shivering feeling of impact up into his elbow his father sagged to one knee but max had to hit him again to sprawl him on his back abrahams eyelids sank as he began to slide into unconsciousness but they came up again when max sat down on top of him his father opened his mouth to say something but max had heard enough was through talking had never been much when it came to talk anyway what mattered now was the work of his hands work he had a natural instinct for had maybe been born to he put the tip of the stake where his father had showed him and struck the hilt with the mallet it turned out it was all true what the old man had told him in the basement there was wailing and profanity and a frantic struggle to get away but it was over soon enough nunc dimittis by

tempting the gods the biblical phrase nunc dimittis servum tuumnow dismiss your servantevokes images of selfless sacrifice but so often when we tear away the mask of you need me we find underneath the face of i need you we sometimes describe a certain type of person as an emotional vampire for all their romance and dangerous magnetism vampires are at heart bloodsuckersthat is to say parasites a parasite cannot live without attaching itself to a host organism after reading this story ask yourself how many vampires are in it are you sure maybe you should count again the vampire was old and no longer beautiful in common with all living things she had aged though very slowly like the tall trees in the park slender and gaunt and leafless they stood out there beyond the long windows raindashed in the grey morning while she sat in her highbacked chair in that corner of the room where the curtains of thick yellow lace and the winecoloured blinds kept every drop of daylight out in the glimmer of the ornate oil lamp she had been reading the lamp came from a russian palace the book had once graced the library of a corrupt pope named in his temporal existence roderigo borgia now the vampires dry hands had fallen upon the page she sat in her black lace dress that was one hundred and eighty years of age far younger than she herself and looked at the old man streaked by the shine of distant windows you say you are tired vassu i know how it is to be so tired and unable to rest it is a terrible thing but princess said the old man quietly it is more than this i am dying the vampire stirred a little the pale leaves of her hands rustled on the page she stared with an almost childlike wonder dying can this be you are sure the old man very clean and neat in his dark clothing nodded humbly yes princess oh vassu she said are you glad he seemed a little embarrassed finally he said forgive me princess but i am very glad yes very glad i understand only he said i am troubled for your sake no no said the vampire with the fragile perfect courtesy of her class and kind no it must not concern you you have been a good servant far better than i might ever have hoped for i am thankful vassu for all your care of me i shall miss you but you have earned she hesitated she said you have more than earned your peace but you he said i shall do very well my requirements are small now the days when i was a huntress are gone and the nights do you remember vassu i remember princess when i was so hungry and so relentless and so lovely my white face in a thousand ballroom mirrors my silk slippers stained with dew and my lovers waking in the cold morning where i had left them but now i do not sleep i am seldom hungry i never lust i never love these are the comforts of old age there is only one comfort that is denied to me and who knows one day i too she smiled at him her teeth were beautiful but almost even now the exquisite points of the canines quite worn away leave me when you must she said i shall mourn you i shall envy you but i ask nothing more my good and noble friend the old man bowed his head i have he said a few days a handful of nights there is something i wish to try to do in this time i will try to find one who may take my place the vampire stared at him again now astonished but vassu my irreplaceable helpit is no longer possible yes if i am swift the world is not as it was she said with a grave and dreadful wisdom he lifted his head more gravely he answered the world is as it has always been princess only our perceptions of it have grown more acute our knowledge less bearable she nodded yes this must be so how could the world have changed so terribly it must be we who have changed he trimmed the lamp before he left her outside the rain dripped steadily from the trees the city in the rain was not unlike a forest but the old man who had been in many forests and many cities had no special feeling for it his feelings his senses were primed to other things nevertheless he was conscious of his bizarre and anachronistic effect like that of a figure in some surrealist painting walking the streets in clothes of a bygone era aware he did not blend with his surroundings nor render them homage of any kind yet even when as sometimes happened a gang of children or youths jeered and called after him the foul names he was familiar with in twenty languages he neither cringed nor cared he had no concern for such things he had been so many places seen so many sights cities which burned or fell in ruin the young who grew old as he had and who died as now at last he too would die this thought of death soothed him comforted him and brought with it a great sadness a strange jealousy he did not want to leave her of course he did not the idea of her vulnerability in this harsh world not new in its cruelty but ancient though freshly recognisedit horrified him this was the sadness and the jealousy that because he must try to find another to take his place and that other would come to be for her as he had been the memories rose and sank in his brain like waking dreams all the time he moved about the streets as he climbed the steps of museums and underpasses he remembered other steps in other lands of marble and fine stone and looking out from high balconies the city reduced to a map he recollected the towers of cathedrals the starswept points of mountains and then at last as if turning over the pages of a book backwards he reached the beginning there she stood between two tall white graves the chateau grounds behind her everything silvered in the dusk before the dawn she wore a ball dress and a long white cloak and even then her hair was dressed in the fashion of a century ago dark hair like black flowers he had known for a year before that he would serve her the moment he had heard them talk of her in the town they were not afraid of her but in awe she did not prey upon her own people as some of her line had done when he could get up he went to her he had kneeled and stammered something he was only sixteen and she not much older but she had simply looked at him quietly and said i know you are welcome the words had been in a language they seldom spoke together now yet always when he recalled that meeting she said them in that tongue and with the same gentle inflexion all about in the small café where he had paused to sit and drink coffee vague shapes came and went of no interest to him no use to her throughout the morning there had been nothing to alert him he would know he would know as he had known it of himself he rose and left the café and the waking dream walked with him a lean black car slid by and he recaptured a carriage carving through white snow a step brushed the pavement perhaps twenty feet behind him the old man did not hesitate he stepped on and into an alleyway that ran between the high buildings the steps followed him he could not hear them all only one in seven or eight a little wire of tension began to draw taut within him but he gave no sign water trickled along the brickwork beside him and the noise of the city was lost abruptly a hand was on the back of his neck a capable hand warm and sure not harming him yet almost the touch of a lover thats right old man keep still im not going to hurt you not if you do what i say he stood the warm and vital hand on his neck and waited all right said the voice which was masculine and young and with some other elusive quality to it now let me have your wallet the old man spoke in a faltering tone very foreign very fearful i haveno wallet the hand changed its nature gripped him bit dont lie i can hurt you i dont want to but i can give me whatever money you have yes he faltered yesyes and slipped from the sure and merciless grip like water spinning gripping in turn flinging awaythere was a whirl of movement the old mans attacker slammed against the wet grey wall and rolled down it he lay on the rainy debris of the alley floor and stared up too surprised to look surprised this had happened many times before several had supposed the old man an easy mark but he had all the steely power of what he was even now even dying he was terrible in his strength and yet though it had happened often now it was different the tension had not gone away swiftly deliberately the old man studied the young one something struck home instantly even sprawled the adversary was peculiarly graceful the grace of enormous physical coordination the touch of the hand also impervious and certainthere was strength here too and now the eyes yes the eyes were steady intelligent and with a curious lambency an innocence get up the old man said he had waited upon an aristocrat he had become one himself and sounded it up i will not hit you again the young man grinned aware of the irony the humour flitted through his eyes in the dull light of the alley they were the colour of leopardsnot the eyes of leopards but their pelts yes and you could couldnt you granddad my name said the old man is vasyelu gorin i am the father to none and my nonexistent sons and daughters have no children and you my name said the young man is snake the old man nodded he did not really care about names either get up snake you attempted to rob me because you are poor having no work and no wish for work i will buy you food now the young man continued to lie as if at ease on the ground why because i want something from you what youre right ill do almost anything if you pay me enough so you can tell me the old man looked at the young man called snake and knew that all he said was a fact knew that here was one who had stolen and whored and stolen again when the slack bodies slept both male and female exhausted by the sexual vampirism he had practised on them drawing their misguided souls out through their pores as later he would draw the notes from purse and pocket yes a vampire maybe a murderer too very probably a murderer if you will do anything said the old man i need not tell you beforehand you will do it anyway almost anything is what i said advise me then said vasyelu gorin the servant of the vampire what you will not do i shall then refrain from asking it of you the young man laughed in one fluid movement he came to his feet when the old man walked on he followed testing him the old man took snake to an expensive restaurant far up on the white hills of the city where the glass geography nearly scratched the sky ignoring the mud on his dilapidated leather jacket snake became a flawless image of decorum became what is always ultimately respected one who does not care the old man who also did not care appreciated this act but knew it was nothing more snake had learned how to be a prince but he was a gigolo with a closet full of skins to put on now and then the speckled leopard eyes searching wary would give him away after the good food and the excellent wine the cognac the cigarettes taken from the silver boxsnake had stolen three but stylishly overt had left them sticking like porcupine quills from his breast pocketthey went out again into the rain the dark was gathering and snake solicitously took the old mans arm vasyelu gorin dislodged him offended by the cheapness of the gesture after the acceptable one with the cigarettes dont you like me any more said snake i can go now if you want but you might pay for my wasted time stop that said vasyelu gorin come along smiling snake came with him they walked between the glowing pyramids of stores through shadowy tunnels over the wet paving when the thoroughfares folded away and the meadows of the great gardens began snake grew tense the landscape was less familiar to him obviously this part of the forest was unknown trees hung down from the air to the sides of the road i could kill you here said snake take your money and run you could try said the old man but he was becoming weary he was no longer certain and yet he was sufficiently certain that his jealousy had assumed a tinge of hatred if the young man were stupid enough to set on him how simple it would be to break the columnar neck like pale amber between his fleshless hands but then she would know she would know he had found for her and destroyed the finding and she would be generous and he would leave her aware he had failed her too when the huge gates appeared snake made no comment he seemed by then to anticipate them the old man went into the park moving quickly now in order to outdistance his own feelings snake loped at his side three windows were alight high in the house her windows and as they came to the stair that led up under its skeins of ivy into the porch her pencilthin shadow passed over the lights above like smoke or a ghost i thought you lived alone said snake i thought you were lonely the old man did not answer any more he went up the stair and opened the door snake came in behind him and stood quite still until vasyelu gorin had found the lamp in the niche by the door and lit it unnatural stained glass flared in the door panels and the windowniches either side owls and lotuses and faroff temples scrolled and luminous oddly aloof vasyelu began to walk toward the inner stair just a minute said snake vasyelu halted saying nothing id just like to know said snake how many of your friends are here and just what your friends are figuring to do and how i fit into their plans the old man sighed there is one woman in the room above i am taking you to see her she is a princess her name is darejan draculas he began to ascend the stair left in the dark the visitor said softly what you think you have heard the name you are correct but it is another branch he heard only the first step as it touched the carpeted stair with a bound the creature was upon him the lamp was lifted from his hand snake danced behind it glittering and unreal dracula he said draculas another branch a vampire do you believe in such things said the old man you should living as you do preying as you do i never said snake pray prey said the old man prey upon you cannot even speak your own language give me the lamp or shall i take it the stair is steep you may be damaged this time which will not be good for any of your trades snake made a little bow and returned the lamp they continued up the carpeted hill of stair and reached a landing and so a passage and so her door the appurtenances of the house even glimpsed in the erratic fleeting of the lamp were very gracious the old man was used to them but snake perhaps took note then again like the size and importance of the park gates the young thief might well have anticipated such elegance and there was no neglect no dust no air of decay or more tritely of the grave women arrived regularly from the city to clean under vasyelu gorins stern command flowers were even arranged in the salon for those occasions when the princess came downstairs which was rarely now how tired she had grown not aged but bored by life the old man sighed again and knocked upon her door her response was given softly vasyelu gorin saw from the tail of his eye the young mans reaction his ears almost pricked like a cats wait here vasyelu said and went into the room shutting the door leaving the other outside it in the dark the windows which had shone bright outside were black within the candles burned red and white as carnations the vampire was seated before her little harpsichord she had probably been playing it its song so quiet it was seldom audible beyond her door long ago nonetheless he would have heard it long ago princess he said i have brought someone with me he had not been sure what she would do or say confronted by the actuality she might even remonstrate grow angry though he had not often seen her angry but he saw now she had guessed in some tangible way that he would not return alone and she had been preparing herself as she rose to her feet he beheld the red satin dress the jewelled silver crucifix at her throat the trickle of silver from her ears on the thin hands the great rings throbbed their sable colours her hair which had never lost its blackness abbreviated at her shoulders and waved in a fashion of only twenty years before framed the starved bones of her face with a savage luxuriance she was magnificent gaunt elderly her beauty lost her heart dulled yetmagnificent wondrous he stared at her humbly ready to weep because for the half of one halfmoment he had doubted yes she said she gave him the briefest smile like a swift caress then i will see him vassu snake was seated crosslegged a short distance along the passage he had discovered in the dark a slender chinese vase of the yang tsai palette and held it between his hands his chin resting on the brim shall i break this he asked vasyelu ignored the remark he indicated the opened door you may go in now may i how excited youre making me snake flowed upright still holding the vase he went through into the vampires apartment the old man came into the room after him placing his blackgarbed body like a shadow by the door which he left now standing wide the old man watched snake circling slightly perhaps unconsciously he had approached a third of the chambers length towards the woman seeing him from the back vasyelu gorin was able to observe all the play of tautening muscles along the spine like those of something readying itself to spring or to escape yet not seeing the face the eyes was unsatisfactory the old man shifted his position edged shadowlike along the rooms perimeter until he had gained a better vantage good evening the vampire said to snake would you care to put down the vase or if you prefer smash it indecision can be distressing perhaps id prefer to keep the vase oh then do so by all means but i suggest you allow vasyelu to wrap it up for you before you go or someone may rob you on the street snake pivotted lightly like a dancer and put the vase on a sidetable turning again he smiled at her there are so many valuable things here what shall i take what about the silver cross youre wearing the vampire also smiled an heirloom i am rather fond of it i do not recommend you should try to take that snakes eyes enlarged he was naive amazed but i thought if i did what you wanted if i made you happyi could have whatever i liked wasnt that the bargain and how would you propose to make me happy snake went close to her he prowled about her very slowly disgusted fascinated the old man watched him snake stood behind her leaning against her his breath stirring the filaments of her hair he slipped his left hand along her shoulder sliding from the red satin to the dry uncoloured skin of her throat vasyelu remembered the touch of the hand electric and so sensitive the fingers of an artist or a surgeon the vampire never changed she said no you will not make me happy my child oh snake said into her ear you cant be certain if you like if you really like ill let you drink my blood the vampire laughed it was frightening something dormant yet intensely powerful seemed to come alive in her as she did so like flame from a finished coal the sound the appalling life shook the young man away from her and for an instant the old man saw fear in the leopardyellow eyes a fear as intrinsic to the being of snake as to cause fear was intrinsic to the being of the vampire and still blazing with her power she turned on him what do you think i am she said some senile hag greedy to rub her scaly flesh against your smoothness some hag you can being yourself without sanity or fastidiousness corrupt with the phantoms the leftovers of pleasure and then murder tearing the gems from her fingers with your teeth or i am a perverted hag wanting to lick up your youth with your juices am i that come now she said her fire lowering itself crackling with its amusement with everything she held in check her voice a long long pin skewering what she spoke to against the farther wall come now how can i be such a fiend and wear the crucifix on my breast my ancient withered fallen empty breast come now whats in a name as the pin of her voice came out of him the young man pushed himself away from the wall for an instant there was an air of panic about him he was accustomed to the characteristics of the world old men creeping through rainy alleys could not strike mighty blows with their iron hands women were moths that burnt but did not burn tones of tinsel and pleading not razor blades snake shuddered all over and then his panic went away instinctively he told something from the aura of the room itself living as he did generally he had come to trust his instincts he slunk back to the woman not close this time no nearer than two yards your man over there he said he took me to a fancy restaurant he got me drunk i say things when im drunk i shouldnt say you see im a lout i shouldnt be here in your nice house i dont know how to talk to people like you to a lady you see but i havent any money none ask him i explained it all ill do anything for money and the way i talk some of them like it you see it makes me sound dangerous they like that but its just an act fawning on her bending on her the groundless glory of his eyes he had also retreated was almost at the door the vampire made no move like a marvelous waxwork she dominated the room red and white and black and the old man was only a shadow in a corner snake darted about and bolted in the blind lightlessness he skimmed the passage leapt out in space upon the stairs touched leapt touched reached the open area beyond some glint of starshine revealed the stained glass panes in the door as it crashed open he knew quite well that he had been let go then it slammed behind him and he pelted through ivy and down the outer steps and across the hollow plain of tall wet trees so much infallibly his instincts had told him strangely even as he came out of the gates upon the vacant road and raced towards the heart of the city they did not tell him he was free do you recollect said the vampire you asked me at the very beginning about the crucifix i do recollect princess it seemed odd to me then i did not understand of course and you she said how would you have it after she waited she said after you leave me he rejoiced that his death would cause her a momentary pain he could not help that now he had seen the fire wake in her flash and scald in her as it had not done for half a century ignited by the presence of the thief the gigolo the parasite he said the old man is young and strong and can dig some pit for me and no ceremony she had overlooked his petulance of course and her tact made him ashamed just to lie quiet will be enough he said but thank you princess for your care i do not suppose it will matter either there is nothing or there is something so different i shall be astonished by it ah my friend then you do not imagine yourself damned no he said no no and all at once there was passion in his voice one last fire of his own to offer her in the life you gave me i was blessed she closed her eyes and vasyelu gorin perceived he had wounded her with his love and no longer peevishly but in the way of a lover he was glad next day a little before three in the afternoon snake returned a wind was blowing and seemed to have blown him to the door in a scurry of old brown leaves his hair was also blown and bright his face windslapped to a ridiculous freshness his eyes however were heavy encircled dulled the eyes showed as did nothing else about him that he had spent the night the forenoon engaged in his second line of commerce they might have drawn thick curtains and blown out the lights but that would not have helped him the senses of snake were doubly acute in the dark and he could see in the dark like a lynx yes said the old man looking at him blankly as if at a tradesman yes said snake and came by him into the house vasyelu did not stop him of course not he allowed the young man and all his blown gleamingness and his wretched roué eyes to stroll across to the doors of the salon and walk through vasyelu followed the blinds a sombre ivory colour were down and the lamps had been lit on a polished table hothouse flowers foamed from a jade bowl a second door stood open on the small library the soft glow of the lamps trembling over goldworked spines up and up a torrent of static priceless books snake went into and around the library and came out i didnt take anything can you even read snapped vasyelu gorin remembering when he could not a woodcutters fifth son an oaf and a sot drinking his way or sleeping his way through a life without windows or vistas a mere blackness of error and unrecognised boredom long ago in that little town cobbled together under the forest and the chateau with its starry lights the carriages on the road shining the dark trees either side and bowing in answer to a question lifting a silver comfit box from a pocket as easily as he had lifted a coin the day before snake sat down leaning back relaxedly in the chair he was not relaxed the old man knew what was he telling himself that there was money here eccentricity to be battened upon that he could take her the old woman one way or another there were always excuses that one could make to oneself when the vampire entered the room snake practised a gigolo came to his feet and the vampire was amused by him gently now she wore a bonewhite frock that had been sent from paris last year she had never worn it before pinned at the neck was a black velvet rose with a single drop of dew shivering on a single petal a pearl that had come from the crown jewels of a czar her tact her peerless tact naturally the pearl was saying this is why you have come back naturally there is nothing to fear vasyelu gorin left them he returned later with the decanters and glasses the cold supper had been laid out by people from the city who handled such things pâté and lobster and chicken lemon slices cut like flowers orange slices like suns tomatoes that were anemones and oceans of green lettuce and cold glittering ice he decanted the wines he arranged the silver coffee service the boxes of different cigarettes the winter night had settled by then against the house and roused by the brilliantly lighted rooms a moth was dashing itself between the candles and the coloured fruits the old man caught it in a crystal goblet took it away let it go into the darkness for a hundred years and more he had never killed anything sometimes he heard them laugh the young mans laughter was at first too eloquent too beautiful too unreal but then it became ragged boisterous it became genuine the wind blew stonily vasyelu gorin imagined the frail moth beating its wings against the huge wings of the wind falling spent to the ground it would be good to rest in the last half hour before dawn she came quietly from the salon and up the stair the old man knew she had seen him as he waited in the shadows that she did not look at him or call to him was her attempt to spare him this sudden sheen that was upon her its direct and pitiless glare so he glimpsed it obliquely no more her straight pale figure ascending slim and limpid as a girls her eyes were young full of a primal refinding full of utter newness in the salon snake slept under his jacket on the long white couch its brocaded cushions beneath his cheek would he on waking carefully examine his throat in a mirror the old man watched the young man sleeping she had taught vasyelu gorin how to speak five languages and how to read three others she had allowed him to discover music and art history and the stars profundity mercy he had found the closed tomb of life opened out on every side into unbelievable inexpressible landscapes and yet and yet the journey must have its end worn out with ecstasy and experience too tired any more to laugh with joy to rest was everything to be still only she could continue for only she could be eternally reborn for vasyelu once had been enough he left the young man sleeping five hours later snake was noiselessly gone he had taken all the cigarettes but nothing else snake sold the cigarettes quickly at one of the cafés he sometimes frequented he met with those who sensing some change in his fortunes urged him to boast snake did not remaining irritatingly reticent vague it was another patron an old man who liked to give him things where did the old man live oh a fine apartment the north side of the city some of the day he walked a hunter he distrusted the open veldt of daylight there was too little cover and equally too great cover for the things he stalked in the afternoon he sat in the gardens of a museum students came and went seriously alone or in groups riotously snake observed them they were scarcely younger than he himself yet to him another species now and then a girl catching his eye might smile or make an attempt to linger to interest him snake did not respond with the economic contempt of what he had become he dismissed all such sexual encounters their allure their youth these were commodities valueless in others they would not pay him the old woman however he did not dismiss how old was she sixty perhapsno much older ninety was more likely and yet her face her neck her hands were curiously smooth unlined at times she might only have been fifty and the dyed hair which should have made her seem raddled somehow enhanced the illusion of a young woman yes she fascinated him probably she had been an actress foreign theatricalrich if she was prepared to keep him thinking him mistakenly her pet cat then he was willing for a while he could steal from her when she began to cloy and he decided to leave yet something in the uncomplexity of these thoughts disturbed him the first time he had run away he was unsure now from what not the vampire name certainly a stage name draculaswhat else but from somethingsome awareness of fate for which idea his vocabulary had no word and no explanation driven once away driven thereafter to return since it was foolish not to and she had known how to treat him gracefully graciously she would be honourable for her kind always were used to spending money for what they wanted they did not baulk at buying people too they had never forgotten flesh also had a price since their roots were firmly locked in an era when there had been slaves but but he would not he told himself go there tonight no it would be good she should not be able to rely on him he might go tomorrow or the next day but not tonight the turning world lifted away from the sun through a winter sunset into darkness snake was glad to see the ending of the light and false light instead spring up from the apartment blocks the cafés he moved out on to the wide pavement of a street and a man came and took his arm on the right side another starting to walk by him on the left yes this is the one the one calls himself snake are you the man who walked beside him asked of course it is said the first man squeezing his arm didnt we have an exact description isnt he just the way he was described and the right place too agreed the other man who did not hold him the right area the men wore neat nondescript clothing their faces were sallow and smiling and fixed this was a routine with which both were familiar snake did not know them but he knew the touch the accent the smiling fixture of their masks he had tensed now he let the tension melt away so they should see and feel it had gone what do you want the man who held his arm only smiled the other man said just to earn our living doing what on either side the lighted street went by ahead at the streets corner a vacant lot opened where a broken wall lunged away into the shadows it seems you upset someone said the man who only walked upset them badly i upset a lot of people snake said im sure you do but some of them wont stand for it who was this perhaps i should see them no they dont want that they dont want you to see anybody the black turn was a few feet away perhaps i can put it right no thats what weve been paid to do but if i dont know said snake and lurched against the man who held his arm ramming his fist into the soft belly the man let go of him and fell snake ran he ran past the lot into the brilliant glare of another street beyond and was almost laughing when the thrown knife caught him in the back the lights turned over something hard and cold struck his chest his face snake realized it was the pavement there was a dim blurred noise coming and going perhaps a crowd gathering someone stood on his ribs and pulled the knife out of him and the pain began is that it a choked voice asked some way above him the man he had punched in the stomach itll do nicely a new voice shouted a car swam to the kerb and pulled up raucously the car door slammed and footsteps went over the cement behind him snake heard the two men walking briskly away snake began to get up and was surprised to find he was unable to what happened someone asked high high above i dont know a woman said softly look theres blood snake took no notice after a moment he tried again to get up and succeeded in getting to his knees he had been hurt that was all he could feel the pain no longer sharp blurred like the noise he could hear coming and going he opened his eyes the light had faded then came back in a long wave then faded again there seemed to be only five or six people standing around him as he rose the nearer shapes backed away he shouldnt move someone said urgently a hand touched his shoulder fluttered off like an insect the light faded into black and the noise swept in like a tide filling his ears dazing him something supported him and he shook it from hima wall come back son a man called the lights burned up again reminiscent of a cinema he would be all right in a moment he walked away from the small crowd not looking at them respectfully in awe they let him go and noted his blood trailing behind him along the pavement the french clock chimed sweetly in the salon it was seven beyond the window the park was black it had begun to rain again the old man had been watching from the downstairs window for rather more than an hour sometimes he would step restlessly away circle the room straighten a picture pick up a petal discarded by the dying flowers then go back to the window looking out at the trees the rain and the night less than a minute after the chiming of the clock a piece of the static darkness came away and began to move very slowly towards the house vasyelu gorin went out into the hall as he did so he glanced towards the stairway the lamp at the stairhead was alight and she stood there in its rays her hands lying loosely at her sides elegant as if weightless her head raised princess yes i know please hurry vassu i think there is scarcely any margin left the old man opened the door quickly he sprang down the steps as lightly as a boy of eighteen the black rain swept against his face redolent of a thousand memories and he ran through an orchard in burgundy across a hillside in tuscany along the path of a wild garden near st petersburg that was st petersburg no more until he reached the body of a young man lying over the roots of a tree the old man bent down and an eye opened palely in the dark and looked at him knifed me said snake crawled all this way vasyelu gorin leaned in the rain to the grass of france italy and russia and lifted snake in his arms the body lolled heavy not helping him but it did not matter how strong he was he might marvel at it as he stood holding the young man across his breast and turning ran back towards the house i dont know snake muttered dont know who sent them plenty would like tohow bad is it i didnt think it was so bad the ivy drifted across snakes face and he closed his eyes as vasyelu entered the hall the vampire was already on the lowest stair vasyelu carried the dying man across to her and laid him at her feet then vasyelu turned to leave wait she said no princess this is a private thing between the two of you as once it was between us i do not want to see it princess i do not want to see it with another she looked at him for a moment like a child sorry to have distressed him unwilling to give in then she nodded go then my dear he went away at once so he did not witness it as she left the stair and knelt beside snake on the turkish carpet newly coloured with blood yet it seemed to him he heard the rustle her dress made like thin crisp paper and the whisper of the tiny dagger parting her flesh and then the long still sigh he walked down through the house into the clean and frigid modern kitchen full of electricity there he sat and remembered the forest above the town the torches as the yelling aristocrats hunted him for his theft of the comfit box the blows when they caught up with him he remembered with a painless unoppressed refinding what it was like to begin to die in such a way the confused anger the coming and going of tangible things long pulses of being alternating with deep valleys of nonbeing and then the agonised impossible crawl fingers in the earth itself pulling him forward legs sometimes able to assist sometimes failing passengers which must be dragged with the rest in the graveyard at the edge of the estate he ceased to move he could go no farther the soil was cold and the white tombs curious petrified vegetation over his head seemed to suck the black sky into themselves so they darkened and the sky grew pale but as the sky was drained of its blood the foretaste of day began to possess it in less than an hour the sun would rise he had heard her name and known he would eventually come to serve her the way in which he had known both for himself and for the young man called snake had been in a presage of violent death all the while searching through the city there had been no one with that stigma upon them that mark until in the alley the warm hand gripped his neck until he looked into the leopardcoloured eyes then vasyelu saw the mark smelled the scent of it like singed bone how snake crippled by a mortal wound bleeding and semiaware had brought himself such a distance through the long streets hard as nails through the mossy gardenland of the rich through the colossal gates over the watery nighttuned plain so far dying the old man did not require to ask or to be puzzled by he too had done such a thing more than two centuries ago and there she had found him between the tall white graves when he could focus his vision again he had looked and seen her the most beautiful thing he ever set eyes upon she had given him her blood he had drunk the blood of darejan draculas a princess a vampire unique elixir it had saved him all wounds had healed death had dropped from him like a torn skin and everything he had beenscavenger thief brawler drunkard and for a certain number of coins whoreeach of these things had crumbled away standing up he had trodden on them left them behind he had gone to her and kneeled down as a short while before she had kneeled by him cradling him giving him the life of her silver veins and this all this was now for the other even her blood it seemed did not bestow immortality only longevity at last coming to a stop for vasyelu gorin and so many many decades from this night the other too would come to the same hiatus snake too would remember the waking moment conscious another now endured the stupefied thrill of it and all that would begin thereafter finally with a sort of guiltiness the old man left the hygienic kitchen and went back towards the glow of the upper floor stealing out into the shadow at the lights edge he understood that she would sense him there untroubled by his presencehad she not been prepared to let him remain it was done her dress was spread like an open rose the young man lying against her his eyes wide gazing up at her and she would be the most beautiful thing that he had ever seen all about invisible the shed skins of his life husks he would presently scuff uncaringly underfoot and she the vampires head inclined toward snake the dark hair fell softly her face powdered by the lampshine was young was full of vitality serene vivacity loveliness everything had come back to her she was reborn perhaps it was only an illusion the old man bowed his head there in the shadows the jealousy the regret were gone in the end his life with her had become only another skin that he must cast he would have the peace that she might never have and be glad of it the young man would serve her and she would be huntress once more and dancer a bright phantom gliding over the ballroom of the city this city and others and all the worlds of land and soul between vasyelu gorin stirred on the platform of his existence he would depart now or very soon already he heard the murmur of the approaching train it would be simple this time not like the other time at all to go willingly everything achieved in order knowing she was safe there was even a faint colour in her cheeks a blooming or maybe that was just a trick of the lamp the old man waited until they had risen to their feet and walked together quietly into the salon before he came from the shadows and began to climb the stairs hearing the silence their silence like that of new lovers at the head of the stair beyond the lamp the dark was gentle soft as the vampires hair vasyelu walked forward into the dark without misgiving tenderly how he had loved her hunger by gabriela lee gabriela lee is a graduate of the university of the philippines with a ba in creative writing and received her masters degree in literary studies from the national university of singapore she is based in singapore and works for an online gaming company developing content lees fiction has appeared in the anthology a time for dragons edited by vincent simbulan in the dark blue southern seas literary anthology from silliman university and in an anthology of filipino fiction called a different voice in which this story first appeared hunger deals with the vampiric mananaggal myth which in philippine mythology is a blend of oldschool western vampiric myths and native superstition in myths shes a beautiful woman who can separate the upper half of her body from her lower half lee said the lower half stays rooted in one place while the upper half goes on a feeding frenzyusually sucking the unborn fetus from a pregnant woman if you look at the duality of such a creature it serves as the perfect metaphor for adolescent hunger you feel like a small star orbiting around a center of gravity as you step out of the car and instinctively move towards kian he smiles at you that kind of smile reserved for best friends and childhood confidants and for once you wish that you hadnt known him since first grade when you squished a sugary ice cream cone into joseph bulaongs nose because he was beating kian up in the middle of the school playground good gig he says giving you a thumbsup sign your rendition of that buckley song was amazing you blush and grin batting away the compliment with one bluemanicured hand he is the bassist for hands down you are the lead singer you see him three gigs a week the last of which is usually at holeinthewall a small smoky bar with faux s american dinerstyle interiors and a bathroom that flooded every fourth toilet flush you resist the urge to step closer to him instead you wait until lia and paolo step out of the car and make their way towards ababu it is past two in the morning and youre sure your parents will have a hissy fit when they smell your clothes they reek of cigarette smoke courtesy of the patrons at the hole but that its all right more time spent with kian is definitely time spent well the small neighborhood persianesque eatery is filled with students and other night owlsyour group has to stand at the curb for ten minutes before a free seat emerges floating like an empty glass bottle in the middle of the sea of people you move towards it quickly manipulating an extra chair to fit the four of you around the monobloc table you already know what you want and wave the waitress away shawarma at this time of the night is always a treat paolo and kian immediately fall into conversation regarding the set paolo youve known since your freshman year at the ateneo where he mistakenly thought you were a high school student looking for the office of admissions and kindly directed you to kostka hall both of you were in comm lia whom you met through friends of friends was a parttime model and notime student kian youve known since forever a sarah geronimo song suddenly plays in your head and you want to smash your internal radio for even considering such a cheesy song to describeoh never mind forever really isnt enough anyway the food arrives courtesy of a sleepyeyed waitress in shorts and a pink cotton shirt another rerun of a bad filipino action movie plays on the tv mounted at the corner of ababu where nobody pays any attention well except the manongs who would usually sit at the proper angle just to watch the rapidfire exchange between fernando poe jr and max alvarado paolo scarfs down his food occasionally squirting the fieryhot red chili sauce liberally across the mound of white rice on his plate lia eats delicately drinking her diet coke with a pinky slightly raised in the air if you didnt know where the place was youre sure youd have thought that lia was eating at one of those fivestar restaurant chains that her father owns surreptitiously you watch kian scoop up the rice and meat into his spoon and put it in his mouth you watch his lips surround the neck of the spoon the silver giving way to warm pink flesh you watch his tongue swirl slightly around the depression of the spoon cleaning the surface and making sure that the savory white sauce was gone from the utensil you feel a shiver run down your spine god am i being turned on by watching him eat rachel are you all right youre not eating your food paolo peers into your face his eyes wide behind his glasses despite his pudgy welldressed exterior he was the best damn drummer you had ever met drum sticks were lightning bolts in his hand hurled at the next beat with deadly accuracy kian glances at you sideways but doesnt say anything his eyes are dark behind the long stylish bangs oh im fine you say flustered you cover up the fact that youve been checking out your best friend for the last five minutes by grabbing the chili sauce and pouring it into the shawarma i was just thinking we all know what youre thinking cut in lia suddenly we do paolo asks raising an eyebrow you feel panic rise inside your throat acid green bubbling just up your windpipe fuck what are we thinking of kian seconds you feel like youre suddenly part of a hive mind that rachel fudged up the second verse to that jack johnson song she went too fast she was half a beat early breathe breathe everythings fine you mentally count to ten and then turn to look at kian his eyebrows were slightly raised the corners of his lips curved slightly in a smile of suppressed mirth you are briefly reminded of one of those batteryoperated dolls that grinned evilly you think whenever you pressed a button he doesnt suspect a thing grinning you bite into your shawarma savoring the bite of onions and tomatoes and lettucecabbage youre never sure which is which and the sweet sweet essence of the meat you wonder briefly if that is how kian will taste in your mouth a riot of flavors clamoring for attention slippingsliding across your tongue you dont have a gig tonight you open the windows of your bedroom and let the night breeze play with the tassels of your curtains the tips of your hair you parents are out late another charity event this time for the pediatrics ward you managed to excuse yourself from tonights festivities claiming a headache your mother tells you that maybe its the pain from not doing anything except that damn band but you barely hear her tonight the winds are calling the stars are now within your reach you lift up your shirt and run your fingers across the smooth line that neatly bisects your stomach just below your navel the cut is clean and there is almost no bleeding now you close your eyes and allow everything that is dark and bright to resurface you cant see it now but the slice of pain across your mind tells you that your wings have emerged from beneath your skin warm and leathery smelling of old streets and older shadows you give them an experimental flap feeling the gust of wind lift you slightly off the ground your toes scraping the floor your shoulder blades complain of the exertion and you return to the surface your heels conforming with the flat wooden surfaces carefully you inch your way towards the window your wings beat faster and you hear a swift crack as your bones sever themselves you feel lighter suddenly half flesh and skin the human side stripped away as you abandon yourself to another creature feral and wild a scream rips from your mouth and you hear others answer the wind whips around you invisible fingers running through your hair pale and wideeyed you prepare to fly you take a deep breath hunger returns stomach pangs stronger than any need for human food well there is such a thing as human food your mouth tastes imagined blood sweetthick and you know that tonight will be a feast candycoated words dribble out of your mouth as you lean into the microphone your hands running around the slender neck of the stand as you would encircle your fingers around a lovers arm around you the stage lights sweep across the tiny stage creating a chiaroscuro effect the beat consumes you everything moves from one melody to the next the riffs leave you sweaty your heart pounding to song you know that everything you do is dictated by the cycle of words and musicevery thrust of your hip every movement of your head the flow of your arms and legs this is the closest you can get to heaven to a high to falling in love you know kian finds you beautiful when you singsome residual psychic abilities remain at least twentyfour hours after you feed you give him your patent comehither look that you use whenever you sing hanggang saan that was the latest song you guys had penned and your most popular to datenu has been playing it constantly rumor has it that labels have been wanting to snap up your band the ripple of excitement from hardcore fans they were with you ever since collegeorgmates and classmates high school friends and indie audiences was palpable you and your bandmates try to downplay it but even the icequeen lia cant help but break into a silly grin once in a while but tonight you are focused on kian you run the tip of your tongue across the edges of your teeth and pretend you arent looking at him while hes looking at you hes dressed up for tonights gig pressed midnight blue jeans and a buttondown polo you were with him when you bought this at people are people with a tasmanian devil tie his sneakers are newly washed and he smells like soap and deodorant clean and smooth like clear river water constantly washing over the shiny pebble shores you are feeding more often now at least once every two days the siren call is harder and harder to ignore your mother finally notices the dark circles under your eyes fingerprints of a night spent without sleep and your chalkwhite cheeks you wander around your house barefoot dragging your legs tired your father presses the back of his hand on your forehead an act of concern you try and stop yourself from tilting your head back and forcing his fingers into your mouth a small snack in the middle of the day your back is constantly sore and drops of blood pepper your sheets your mother asks you if its anything she could help you with and you smile sweetly and tell her no perhaps its just dysmenorrhea you know youre a good liar you tell the band that youre having a case of the stomach flu and if lia could sub first while you deal with the pain they acquiesce understanding that pain is a part of your life kian visits you often bringing rolls of ensaymada from red ribbon and complimenting your mother on her new hairdo she simpers and smiles and asks him if he has a girlfriend and you know where the conversation is going and start wishing a hole in the ground would open up and swallow you alive or your mother your stomach starts hurting again like there is an invisible dwarf with a silver knife that is slowly peeling away layers of flesh and dammit you know that tonight you have to fly again until when are we going to walk arm in arm hand in hand friends are we only fooling each other because neither wants to speak until when hands down when kian first introduces you to katherine it is all you can do to stop from breaking her delicate little fingers in your grip she gives you a barbie doll smile and tells you that shes happy to meet you and that christopher christopher he had never used that name since high school has told her so much about his best friend rachel you want to roll your eyes so far into your head that you might be drowned in the dark but kian quickly steers her away from you and towards the small round table near the amps lia passes by and takes you by the elbow then frogmarches you towards the girls toilets inside the ceramictiled room she proceeds to tell you how much she hates kians new girl and that if she had it her way she would allow her latent chinese side the side that loves pain and torture which then makes you wonder just how is hers and paolos sex life and if the rope burn rumors are true to take over and just slice off katherines flesh one sliver at a time until shes flayed a million times over and blood is dripping on the floor in heartshaped droplets you kindly thank lia for her thoughtful words as you lean towards the counter and position your hands underneath the sink water automatically gushes out from the tap and you turn your wrists letting the cool clear liquid wash away the memory of katherines touch a part of you feels that this is a dream a hallucinatory experience your stomach feels like a thousand tiny balloons straining against a net and youre afraid that youre ready to explode there is a knock on the door and you can hear raffy your manager asking in his disconcertingly nasal voice even though he says hes not gay that its five minutes before the set starts lia hollers that youre ready that you two are just freshening up you grip the edge of the sink with both hands and watch in detached fascination as the color of your fingernails slowly seep away almost matching the pale egg white surface of the sink you feel lias strong hands on your back and you dry heave into the sink you tell her its just nerves that you cant remember performing in front of an audience this large and in a venue this popularthe hole was like home but a newer larger venue with possible scouts is something elsebut lia just rubs your back harder until you feel the balloons carefully pop you now feed with a vengeance your wings ripping through the air like sharp claws across a stretch of fine dark silk your tongue continually snakes out from between your lips tasting invisible molecules your body constantly angled a stubborn compass needle pointing towards the next prey before when you were just starting out and you were unaccustomed to the taste of meat you decided to just have a meal a night you were careful to choose only the mothers who never wanted their child or those who prayed fervently each night that they would be a good girl that they would never allow that man into their beds and inside their hearts those who were too frightened of the hilot or the quiapo vendors who sold herbal concoctions beside the church you would listen carefully to the susurrus of voices in your head carefully separating strand from strand allowing the most fearful to surface inside your head like a drop of oil in a bowl of water but now you are ravenous anger fuels your hunt and it is only after the fifth feeding that you feel slightly satisfied you lick the blood coating your lips run your fingers lightly across your incisors in order to check for any stray bits of meat carefully you poise yourself from the edge of the corrugated tin rooftop ready to take flight beneath you the girl sleeps soundly in a small pool of dark blood the color of the evening tide you stretch out your wings and leap on the back of the wind the thrill of flight still excites you even after all these years and you abandon yourself to the moment the patterns of the wind at midnight the way the city lights seem to mirror the constellation of stars scattered across the sky it has been six months since kian or christopher as he has decided to be called again and katherine hooked up each time that you see them its like a needle is being driven deeper and deeper into your chest just above where your heart is located you are waiting for the day when in the middle of singing hanggang saan you suddenly keel over the microphone stand tangling up in the skeins of wires swirling around your feet when your bandmates turn you over they will find a small hole just above your left breast trickling blood down your chest and soaking your blouse its an appealing thought you decide while watching kian steal a kiss from katherines lips you decide to turn your back on them and help paolo out with the equipment since katherine started following kian around like a faithful puppy girlfriend their nights out as a group has been severely limited you feel like the odd one out paolo and lia have been a couple since the beginning of time and katherine would rather have kian tied to a pole than leave her line of sight for more than five minutes sure there are boys and youve gone out on a few dates only to realize that you have an annoying tendency to compare each and every reasonably interested hotblooded male with kian its a depressing thought and you decided to stop being masochistic by just pretending to be lesbian lia gleefully joins into the fray of pretense to the point of almost kissing you on the lips after a gig which forever made paolo disconcerted about his girlfriends sexual orientation and kian laughing so hard that he had to gulp down several glasses of water just to calm down tonights different though kian offers you a ride home even though katherine lives in parañaque and he lives in makati now while you are still at your old neighborhood in la vista he shrugs off your protestations and instead gallantly escorts you and katherine to his car paolo and lia wave goodbye and you find yourself sitting at the back seat of his soupedup toyota corolla sharing the space with the long hard length of tobey his guitar because the front seat has been taken over by the girlfriend the drive is silent along edsa with only death cab for cutie playing on the cd player katherine is halfasleep and the digital readout on the dashboard tells you its past two in the morning and your parents have gotten used to you going home even later or earlier whichever strikes your fancy and have resigned themselves to that fact kian hums along his thumbs occasionally following the beat on the rim of the steering wheel you are lulled by the lamp lights sweeping past the window at regular intervals and kian pushing the car to almost ninety and the way the car flows along the avenue almost as if it were flying katherine lives on a sleepy street inside an exclusive subdivision the guard already knows kian and waves him inside without an id just like at your place the gate is white and tall and the greenery outside is trim and neat beyond the fence you can see an expanse of brick and glass kian carefully wakes katherine up and kisses her tenderly you stare out the window focus on the stray dog wandering down the opposite sidewalk occasionally raising up one hind leg and pissing on the side of the wall the street lamp makes the dogs coat shine like amber you bite your bottom lip playing with the tender bit of flesh they said that in the olden days when food was scarce your kind would feed on dogs to survive you are glad that you have never had to deal with such a problem you move into the front seat when katherine vacates it you give her a friendly peck on the cheek and resist drawing blood the door closes with a definitive click as you slide into the front kian keeps the engine on as the both of you wait until the gate opens for katherine then kian puts the car into gear and you feel it growl to life the drive is smooth until you hit edsa again just past the magallanes station for some reason the stretch is filled with heavyloading trucks and busloads of people on their way north and half of the avenue is blocked by workmen and piles of rubble kian swears and swerves to another lane only to be hit by another tangle in the mounting traffic jam i dont think well get you back home so quickly chel he says sleepily you can recognize the warning signs from when you were youngerkian would become more talkative in an effort to stave off the drowsiness im sorry you can just drop me off at the next station you say nervously at least you can go home and sleep right not a problem what kind of a best friend would i be if i dont bring you home properly you laugh the kind that would kill us in a traffic jam because he could barely keep his eyes open well either way your parents would kill me he says rubbing his eyes with the back of his hands and leaning to the front sign number two i cant leave you here but i sure as hell dont think that it will clear up soon who knows you tell him falsely optimistic maybe it will clear up after this stretch but thirty minutes later the car barely moved ten meters the world seems to have stopped kian is staring straight ahead you adjust your skirt modestly around your thighs clasping your hands in the middle like a proper catholic schoolgirl the air conditioning sputters and spits out small clouds of cool air the cd has stopped the interior is quieter than what you imagined a tomb to be like kian peers outside my turns coming up soon i dont think this traffic will clear up you shrug if you have a couch and a spare toothbrush i dont mind crashing over at your place he looks exceptionally relieved that the suggestion came from you if youre sure he says his voice trailing off hopefully you nod your fingers surreptitiously trailing across the fabric of your shirt right above the scar he knows about the operation but he has never seen the scar you hope the night wont come to that you were fifteen and stupid and already three months into the pregnancy when you discovered the situation the boy was also fifteen and stupid and promptly stopped returning your increasingly panicky phone calls and text messages twice you went to his house but the maid answered both times and denied emphatically the presence of the drs hernandezes único hijo desperate you remember the story of one of your friends about the illegal clinics that litter the side streets of the city and resolve to visit one of them you bring three thousand pesos and the girl who told you the story and take a jeep to sta mesa it started raining lightly then making the streets look like pea soup the street canals carrying with it the vestiges of the city candy wrappers plastic wrappers of all colors of the rainbow dead rats and bloody cats gutted by careless drivers you didnt know what pain was until you fainted from it later on you remember your friend telling you that there was blood too much blood and they had to give you a transfusion but it was a black market clinic and the blood was tainted and it was only three weeks after the operation that you realized that it wasnt just any kind of disease known to man but something other than of this world at first the bleeding refused to stop you had to buy rolls of gauze and change your bandages every hour just to avoid staining your clothes suspicious your parents assigned a chaperone ate babing who spent more time chatting up the tricycle drivers at the corner store than watch you go off with your friends there was no pain which surprised you just a damp feeling around your midsection like a patch of grass after a summer shower and then you learned about others of your kind they came to you just as the clock struck midnight all women with hair flowing like forest vines around their faces and leathery batlike wings all of them were also able to separate their upper halves from their lower halves the edges of their stomachs distended and glittering from a nights frenzied feeding you wanted to weep when you saw them floating outside your window looking at you with dead eyes calling you forward you knew what they were you knew the stories halfwhispered to children in order to fear the dark the beat of shadow wings you thought that being in the city would make you safe but you had to accept it a part of you knew that this was all your fault and you had to learn how to accept consequences and if this was punishment for that one night of bliss then so be it kians apartment was no bigger than a large walkin closet two steps forward and you were in the kitchen two steps back and you were almost stumbling into the bed there was no couch you look at him expectantly bathrooms over there he says waving carelessly at a wooden door that was held shut by a length of chain he rummages inside a synthetic textile closet the one with a zipper for a door and hands you a rumpled tshirt and a pair of cotton shorts you thank him quietly and close the bathroom door behind you in the dim light of a single orange electric bulb you pour the freezing cold water over your head from a pail there are warning bells going off inside your head but you force them to be quiet to still kian wont touch you and you certainly will try not to have any physical contact with him he has a girlfriend you stumble out of the bathroom and into utter darkness sorry came his disembodied voice from somewhere to your left im too tired ill take a shower in the morning did you even change you tease keeping your voice light of course he says come to bed chel you carefully maneuver around the plastic furniture and the plastic bags of clothes and groceries scattered on the floor your fingers encounter a soft material which means youve probably reached the bed already you slip into the space kian has provided painfully aware of the dip in the center of the mattress which means that hes already on the other side positioning yourself on the edge you cross your hands over your chest and turn your back towards him youre not sure whether your eyes are open or closed it doesnt make much of a difference behind you kian moves forward and wraps his around your waist pulling you to him you whisper worriedly wondering whats wrong but he simply buries his face at the back of your neck you feel something warm and wet trickle down your nape and you turn around to face him are you crying you ask quietly wrapping your arms around his shuddering shoulders his face is in your shirt burrowed between the valley of your breasts and you have never held him like this not even when anita the love of his life and his first girlfriend left him for her classmate jasmine toledo he had also cried then and refused to eat anything but meat lovers pizza from pizza hut because that was the last meal that he and anita had shared for two weeks you hold him to you its not so bad after all until you feel him shift slightly and his lips press against your skin through the fabric you look down and he looks up and then you are reminded of the way the titanic slammed against the icebergsthe impact was enough to bring the mighty ship shuddering to its knees kians kiss feels that way breaking all the barriers refusing to acknowledge their existence cracking the walls that you have surrounded yourself with twelve years worth you bite down on the flesh of his lower lip your tongue swipes the drop of blood that wells across the surface he tastes of metal and cinnamon bitter and pungent the salt of the seas you store the memory inside your mind where later on when you are alone you will roll it over and over in your mind like a particularly beautiful and intricate plaything you gasp as his hands slip underneath your shirt stroking the flat of your stomach tracing the line of your wound is this it he whispers his voice grating the still night air you nod desperately squirming underneath his touch everything be damned he lowers his head and you feel the tip of his tongue like a flower petal dipped in morning dew slippingsliding across the cut tasting your blood you tangle your fingers into his hair allow him to uncover your skin beneath the clothes his hands memorizing the language of your movements you know you are sinking that you have abandoned all hope of resurfacing you who have known flight known the names of all the winds that encircle the citynow you know how it feels to drown the waters are slowly slowly closing over your head in your mind there will be no chance for redemption so you will decide to run away you will change your city your name your face but to the women the others of your kind the foulest of blood that flows hotly through your veins will still sound a clarion call and everywhere you go they will gather outside your window waiting for you like ghosts at a funeral you will taste the blood on your mouth feed because you need to live but there is no more pleasure in the succulent liquid taste of meat even flight has lost its pleasure every time you take to the air you remember the fall into his arms and everything is made bittersweet by the memory when you feed for the last time you will find yourself crouched on the rooftop of a beautiful white house in the outskirts of the village where you are currently hiding in you will hear the fervent prayers of the woman in your mind she does not want this child carefully you will unfurl your tongue and search for a gap in the roof you can smell her already strong and warm full of flesh and life your tongue enters her belly laps up the scarletandsunset child that will never know light only the warm beat of the darkness you will swirl the liquid inside your mouth and realize that it tastes of metal and cinnamon bitter and pungent the salt of the seas i know this taste ode to edvard munch by caitlín r kiernan caitlín r kiernan is the author of seven novels including silk murder of angels daughter of hounds the red tree and the vampire novel the five of cups her short fiction has been collected in a is for alien and in several other volumes she has also published two collections of erotica and a third confessions of a fivechambered heart will be released in she lives in providence rhode island this tale was inspired in part by edvard munchs painting the vampire but i was much more interested in writing a story about immortality and time about our smallness in the face of the passage and the gulf of time than i was in writing a traditional vampire story kiernan said kiernan says that she usually accounts for the prevalence of the vampire in modern literature to the marriage of sex and death in the vampire tale and especially in the more romantic sort we have a sort of socially sanctioned necrophilia she said a vampire is essentially a cannibalistic corpse through which a kiss combines the act of feeding and copulation to be preyed upon by a vampire is to become deaths lover and its hard to imagine a more powerful frisson i find her always sitting on the same park bench shes there no matter whether im coming through the park late on a thursday evening or early on a monday evening or in the first grey moments of a friday morning i play piano in a martini bar at columbus and th or i play at the piano mostly for tips and free drinks and when i feel like the long walk or cant bear the thought of the subway or cant afford cab fare whenever i should happen to pass that way alone in the darkness and the interruptions in the darkness made by the lampposts shes there always on that same bench not far from the ramble and the bow bridge just across the lake they call that part of the park cherry hill the truth is that i havent lived in manhattan long enough to know these things and anyway im not the sort of man who memorizes the cartography of central park but she told me its called cherry hill because of all the cherry trees growing there and when i looked at a map in a guidebook it said the same thing you might mistake her for a runaway sixteen or maybe seventeen she dresses all in rags or clothes so threadbare and dirty that they may as well be rags and ive never seen her wearing shoes no matter the season or the weather ive seen her barefoot in snow i asked her about that once if she would wear shoes if i brought her a pair and she said no thank you but no because shoes make her claustrophobic i find her sitting there alone on the park bench near the old fountain and i always ask before i sit down next to her and always she smiles and says of course of course you can sit with me you can always sit with me her shoulderlength hair has been dyed the color of pomegranates and her skin is dark ive never asked but i think she may be indian india indian i mean not native american i once waited tables with a girl from calcutta and her skin was the same color and she had the same dusky brownblack eyes but if she is indian the girl on cherry hill she has no trace of an accent when she talks to me about the fountain or her favorite paintings in the met or the exhibits she likes best at the museum of natural history the first time she smiled youre a vampire i asked as though it were the sort of thing you might ask any girl sitting on a park bench in the middle of the night thats an ugly word she said and scowled at me thats a silly ugly word and then she was silent a long moment and i tried to think of anything but those long incisors like the teeth of a rat filed down to points it was a freezing night near the end of january but i was sweating nonetheless and i had an erection and i realized then that her breath didnt fog in the cold air im a daughter of lilith she said which is as close as shes ever come to telling me her name or where shes from or anything else of the sort im a daughter of lilith and the way she said it with not even a trace of affectation or humor or deceit i knew that it was true even if i had no idea what she meant i knew that she was telling me the truth that was also the first night that i let her kiss me i sat with her on the bench and she licked eagerly at the back of my neck her tongue was rough like a cats tongue she smelled of fallen leaves that dry and oddly spicy odor which i have always associated with late october and jackolanterns yes she smelled of fallen leaves and her own sweat and more faintly something which i took to be woodsmoke her breath was like frost against my skin colder even than the long winter night she licked at the nape of my neck until it was raw and bleeding and she whispered soothing words in a language i could neither understand nor recognize it was designed in she said some other night meaning the fountain with its bluestone basin and eight frosted globes they built this place as a turnaround for the carriages it was originally meant to be a drinking fountain for horses a place for thirsty things like an oasis i suggested and she smiled and nodded her head and wiped my blood from her lips and chin sometimes it seems all the wide world is a desert she said there are too few places left where one may freely drink even the horses are no longer allowed to drink here though it was built for them times change i told her and gently touched the abraded place on my neck trying not to wince not wanting to show any sign of pain in her presence horses and carriages dont much matter anymore but horses still get thirsty they still need a place to drink do you like horses i asked and she blinked back at me and didnt answer my question it reminds me of an owl sometimes that slow considering way she blinks her eyes it will feel better in the morning she said and pointed at my throat wash it when you get home and then i sat with her a while longer but neither of us said anything more she takes my blood but never more than a mouthful at a time and shes left me these strange dreams in return i have begun to think of them as a sort of gift though i know that others might think them more a curse because they are not entirely pleasant dreams some people would even call them nightmares but things never seem so cut and dried to me yes there is terror and horror in them but there is beauty and wonder too in equal measurea perfect balance that seems never to tip one way or the other i believe the dreams have flowed into me on her rough cats tongue that theyve infected my blood and my mind like a bacillus carried on her saliva i dont know if the gift was intentional and i admit that im afraid to ask im too afraid that i might pass through the park late one night or early one morning and she wouldnt be waiting for me there on her bench on cherry hill that asking would break some brittle spell which i can only just begin to comprehend she has made me superstitious and given to what psychiatrists call magical thinking misapprehending cause and effect when i was never that way before we met i play piano in a martini bar and until now theres never been anything in my life which i might mistake for magic but there are many things in her wide sienna eyes which i might mistake for many other things and now that uncertainty seems to cloud my every waking thought yet i believe that its a small price to pay for her company smaller even than the blood she takes i thought that i should write down one of the dreams that i should try to make mere words of it from this window beside my bed i can see roosevelt island beyond the rooftops and the east river and brooklyn and the hazy bluewhite sky that can mean either summer or winter in this city it makes me think of her that sky though im at a loss to explain why at first i thought that i would write it down and then read it to her the next time i see her but then i started to worry that she might not take it the way id intended simply as reciprocation my gift to repay hers she might be offended instead and i dont think i could bear the world without her not after all these nights and mornings and all these dreams im stalling yes i am theres the silhouette of a city far off past the sand and smoke that seem to stretch away in all directions except that one which would lead to the city i know ill never go that far that going as far as that id never again find my way home the city is for other beings i know that shes seen the city that shes walked its streets and spoken all its dialects and visited its brothels and opium dens she knows the stink of its sewers and the delicious aromas of its markets she knows all the high places and all the low places and i follow her across the sand up one dune and down another these great waves of windsculpted sand which tower above me which i climb and then descend in this place the jackals and the vultures and the spiny black scorpions are her court and there is no place here for thirsty horses sometimes i can see her through stinging veils of sand and other times it seems i am entirely alone with the wailing sirocco gale and the voice of that wind is a thousand women crying for their men cut down on some arabian battlefield a thousand years before my birth and it is also the slow creep of the dunes across the face of the wasteland and it is my heart pounding loudly in my ears im lost in the wild and i think ill never see her again but then i catch a glimpse of her through the storm crouched in the lee of ruins etched and defaced by countless millennia of sand and wind and time she might almost be any animal anything out looking for its supper or some way to quench its thirst she waits there for me in the entrance to that crumbling temple and i can smell her impatience like dashes of turmeric i can smell her thirst and her appetite and the wind drives me forward she leads me down into the earth her lips pressed to my ear whispering so i can hear her over the storm she tells me the name of the architect who built the fountain on cherry hill that his name was jacob wrey mould and he came to new york in or or to design and build all souls church he was a pious man she tells me and he illustrated thomas greys elegy in a country churchyard and book of common prayer she says he died in and that he too was in love with a daughter of lilith that he died with no other thought but her i want to ask where she learned all these things if perhaps she spends her days in libraries and i also want to ask if she means that she believes that im in love with her but then the narrow corridor weve been following turns left and opens abruptly on a vast torchlit chamber listen she whispers this is one of my secrets ive guarded this place for all my life the walls are built from great blocks of reddish limestone carved and set firmly in place without the aid of mortar locking somehow perfectly together by a forgotten masonic art the air reeks of frankincense and there is thick cinnamoncolored dust covering everything i follow her down a short flight of steps to the floor it occurs to me that weve gone so deep underground that the roar of the wind should not still be so loud but it is and i wonder if maybe the wind has found its way inside me if its entered through one of the wounds she leaves on my throat this was the hall of my mother she says and now i see the corpses heaped high between the smoky braziers they are nude or they are halfdressed or theyve been torn apart so completely or are now so badly decomposed that its difficult to tell whether theyre clothed or not some are men and others are women and not a few are children i can smell them even through the incense and i might cover my nose and mouth i might begin to gag i might take a step back towards the stairs leading up to the long corridor and the bloodless desert night beyond and she blinks at me like a hungry watchful owl i cannot expect you to understand she says and there are other rooms other chambers endless atrocities that i can now only half recall there are other secrets which she keeps for her mother in the deep places beneath shifting sands there are the ghosts of innumerable butcheries there are demons held in prisons of crystal and iron chained until some eventual apocalypse their voices are almost indistinguishable from the voice of the wind and then we have descended into some still greater abyss a cavern of sparkling stalactite and stalagmite formations travertine and calcite glinting in the soft glow of phosphorescent vegetation which has never seen and will never have need of sunlight were standing together at the muddy edge of a subterranean pool water so still and perfectly smooth an ebony mirror and shes already undressed and is waiting impatiently for me to do the same i cant swim i tell her and earn another owl blink if i could swim i cannot imagine setting foot in that water that lake at the bottom of the world no one has asked you to swim she replies and smiles showing me those long incisors at this well men only have to drown you can do that well enough i suspect and then im falling as the depths of that terrible lake rise up around me like the hood of some black desert cobra and rush over me bearing me down and down and down into the chasm driving the air from my lungs stones placed one by one upon my chest until my lungs collapse constricting coils drawing tighter and tighter about me and i try to scream i open my mouth and her sandpaper tongue slips past my lips and teeth she tastes of silt and dying and loss she tastes of cherry blossoms and summer nights in central park she wraps herself about me and the greywhite wings sprouting from her shoulders open wider than the wings of any earthly bird those wings have become the sky and her feathers brush aside the fire of a hundred trillion stars her teeth tear at my lower lip and i taste my own blood this wind howling in my ears is the serpent flood risen from out that black pool and is also icy solar winds and the futile cries of bottled demons dont be afraid she whispers in my ear and her hand closes around my penis one must only take very small drinks one must not be greedy in these dry times i gasp and open my eyes unable to remember having shut them and now were lying together on the floor of the abattoir at the end of the long corridor below the temple ruins this is the only one of her secrets shes shown me and anything else must have been my imagination my shock at the sight of so much death there is rain rain as red and sticky as blood but still something to cool my fever and i wrap my legs around her brown thighs and slide inside her shes not made like other women my raggedy girl from cherry hill and she begins to devour me so slowly that i will still be dying in a thousand years she tells me she loves me there are no revelations here my eyes look for the night sky somewhere beyond the gore and limestone and sand but there are only her wings like heaven and hell and whatever might lie in between and i listen to the raw and bitter laughter of the wind some nights i tell myself that i will walk around the park and never mind the distance and inconvenience some nights i pretend i hope that she wont be there waiting by the fountain but im not even as good a liar as i am a pianist and it hardly matters because shes always there last night for instance i brought her an old sweater i never wear a birthday present from an exgirlfriend and she thanked me for it i told her that i can bring her other things whatever she might need that she only has to ask and she smiled and told me im very kind my needs are few she said and pulled the old sweater on over whatever tatters she was already wearing i worry about you i said i worry about you all the time these days thats sweet of you she replied but im strong stronger than i might seem and i wondered if she knows about my dreams and if our conversations were merely a private joke i wonder if she only accepted the sweater because she feels sorry for me we talked and she told me a very funny story about her first night in the park almost a decade before i was born and then when there were no more words when there was no longer the need for words i leaned forward and offered her my throat thank you she said and i shut my eyes and waited for the scratch of her tongue against my skin for the prick of those sharp teeth she was gentle because she is always gentle lapping at the hole shes made and pausing from time to time to murmur reassurances i can understand without grasping the coarser literal meaning of what shes said i get the gist of it and i know thats all that matters when she was done when shed wiped her mouth clean and thanked me again for the sweater when wed said our usual goodbyes for the evening i sat alone on the bench and watched as she slipped away into the maze of cherry trees and azaleas and forsythia bushes i dont know what will become of these pages i may never print them or i may print them out and hide them from myself i could slip them between the pages of a book in the stacks at nyu and leave them there for anyone to find i could do that i could place them in an empty wine bottle and drop them from the queensboro bridge so that the river would carry them down to the sea the sea must be filled with bottles finders keepers by l a banks l a banks is the bestselling author of the vampire huntress legend series which

in her crimson moon werewolf series undead on arrival was released in banks was named the essence magazine storyteller of the year having thoroughly explored the hiphop urban vampires in the vampire huntress legends with this story banks wanted to try her hand at a historical vampire tale in the vein of the classic vampire sagas finders keepers is about a centuriesold vampire who finds herself alone in the modern world banks said it was fun going back in time and dealing with the prejudices against women minorities as well as a lot of the social power paradigms that existed then and now theres always a thread of social justice that runs through my work wanting to see those who probably will never in real life be brought to justice get their due atlantic city new jersey she kissed his forehead tasting the thin sheen of salty moisture that still lingered on his skin considering him before she gently closed his eyes he had a handsome face that of a roman dark lashes that rested against his now porcelainpale skin a strong aristocratic nose rugged square jaw but he wasnt a keeper slightly forlorn she peeled herself away from his nude lifeless body with a sigh studying the tall athletic form in repose on the bed as she took her time to dress a threadwidth finger of crimson seeped from his wound the scarlet beacon drawing her back to his side to taste the last of him his body twitched from the invasion she kissed his lips as a goodbye and a thank you leaving a red print of his essence against his mouth but he wasnt a keeper death was like delicious prose when delivered with elegance and style it had a prologue a body and then an epilogue no less than fine dining replete with an appetizer entrée followed by dessert the composition of it all was quiet pleasurable and perfect she felt no guilt as she turned toward the terrace doors and faced the moon she would shower later back at her lair this mans death was an elegant kill as always society was the better for it she was the better for it and if there was an ultimate maker then the drained man on the bed could hash out the particulars with the judge of creation regarding whether or not his life had been lived in vain it was always a philosophical question that niggled herwould a socalled victim dare ask the divine for recompense after having killed so many men himself for blood money one less mob enforcer lost at a casino would not imperil the world perhaps she provided a true service to mankind the man her feed would have killed tonight had been given a night of reprieve an honest man would therefore get one more night to liveshe just hoped hed made the most of the time a slight smile graced her lips exposing a hint of fang as she retracted them her logic was sound in her own mind as she leaped up on the terrace railing balancing on it for a moment before allowing the night to pull her into its dark folds of freedom wind rushed through her hair and buffeted her face plummeting helped her remember being alive the joy the fear the pain but after a few moments she finally allowed the fierceness of the wind to abate so she could hover on the gentleness of the evening breeze floating high above the atlantic city boardwalk her thoughts drifted to her human days back then it was the humans who were beasts things were not so different now she reasoned spying the antlike creatures that dotted the boardwalk and streets below humans killed more of their own than her kind did and for much more senseless reasons men whod wanted her called her a witchwhen she denied their advances women whod envied her beauty joined in their persecution murderous group thinking prevailed over logic as was the human way the verdict was simple and heartless it was in everyones best interest that she be exterminated everyones best interest but hers mysterious deaths had been blamed on her sorcery when all shed had was the gift or curse of second sight no one had given a single thought to the nobleman stranger that had recently come ashore with his ship and largess he was above the law and above their suspicion or contempt they had been elegantly glamoured people she hated that she even needed them for blood the midnight blue horizon drew her attention moonlight sent shards of opalescence to ripple against the blueblack water it was so beautiful if she could stay airborne all night she would memories rolled across her mind in unrelenting waves haiti was a small lush place then too small to hide in who would risk their life to give sanctuary to a motherless child no one was that brave when a mob came calling theyd easily found her had mercilessly beaten and violated her and then dragged her to a pyre to cover their shame already halfdead from the abuse and hemorrhaging badly theyd lit tinder around her flames quickly caught the hem of her ragged dress heat raced up her legs but she was too weak to move and could barely scream her protest came out as a deep resounding moan of agony she would have been their bonfire that night had a man with honor not shown up maybe thats why she loved the weightlessness of vapor so that was how alfonse had come to her as vapor searing heat had given way to cool relief the jeers and curses all around her had turned into screams of terror something that no human mind could fathom had rescued her from the flames and now the townspeople knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was more on the island to fear than her the least likely person the nobleman of means wielded the wrath and destructive power of an entity that they were horrified to name humans fled the beach had returned to a place of peace beneath the moon a gentle hand had cradled her skull lifting her throat to his mouth a gentle whisper offered her a choice with a promise i will not hurt you do you want to live something human within her recoiled as she swallowed her own blood but that feral primal animus within knew she was dying and it fought with all its might to survive blood choked her words all she could do was nod but her mind screamed a thousand questions as his beautiful lips parted and the moonlight glinted off his fangs yet his murmur was so serene relax i must do this now before your heart stops beating or it will be too late chérie she remembered her making as though it were only moments ago more than two hundred years still could not eclipse the horror of what people had done to her nor could she ever forget what alfonse had given her through his sanguine kiss her broken bones and violated flesh had begun to knit as her muscles relaxed raw nail beds from fighting rapists and aggressors began to heal pain literally ceased with his kiss and then there was only sweet pressure at her neck life was draining out of her with each suckle the world slowed down her hearing dulled her eyes closed against the moon the burns that had engulfed her legs cooled the puffiness of her swollen face eased for a moment there was a velvet cloak of dark peace that enveloped her a totality of nothingness so peaceful that if she could have she would have wept initially she could feel him then see him within her minds eye as he threw his head back with his eyes closed ecstasy staining his expression chest heaving from the exertion moonlight casting crimson prisms in saliva and blood against porcelain canines he was horrifying and gorgeous this nobleman that had claimed her breathe hed commanded a gasp shuddered through her and relief made him hug her tears stung her eyes as she searched for a place to discreetly land amongst the modern day humans that strolled the atlantic city boardwalk so carefree at night it was time to return her thoughts to the present without alfonse the past was a place of pain but the memories had a stranglehold on her her first question upon her awakening in alfonses arms had been so naïve i will live his dark eyes had flashed with both triumph and remorse non you will exist hed then touched her disheveled hair with reverence im sorry it was the only way even then she hadnt fully understood all she was sure of was that a strange nobleman had found her and had saved her at her darkest hour his handsome face still haunted her deeply intense dark eyes thick brows furrowed in a frown of concern square jaw owning a slight cleft strong romanesque nose a shock of glistening brunette hair spilling across his shoulders when the wind tired of it his mouth lush and rubystained punished by the suckle why didnt you just let me die it had seemed fair enough a question then because youd fought so hard to live and what theyd accused you of was a lie i am a man of principle without principles we are all just animals his admission became a sensual murmur that bonded them forever i have watched you since i came to this island you are an exquisite beauty that i could never allow to endure the sentence for my sins even being what i am there is a code of ethics never take more than you need never take from those who are innocent ma chérie break no hearts cull the herd of its own beasts feed from the damned and dont allow them to wake up theyd blamed you for my feeds a convenient scapegoat to give them license to act out their lusts and anger fools the lot of them how could they think a woman who walks in the sunlight amongst them could be capable of such crimes still she wasnt sure of what hed admitted but she did understand how a woman of no pedigree no social standing born at the wrong time to the wrong majority could be blamed her response had pained him as shed taken up his hand within hers look at my hand look at yours what do you see look at your clothes look at mine that is enough of a reason for them to excuse you and to lynch me shed expected him to snatch his hand away in offense but her simple truth had gentled his expression from outrage at the mob that had violated her humanity to something else that she even now couldnt describe his words had become tender like his touch his fingers dappling the pleasure of a caress against her cheek as hed spoken in a gentle timbre i see beautiful cinnamonhued skin perfumed by oils and flavors of the earth i see deep amberbrown expressive eyes so gorgeous and with depth so vast that they rival the jewelblue sea i see thick lush tendrils of mahogany hair that appears to be as velvet under the night sky i see a face of an angel a mouth so inviting i tremble he looked away out toward the surf his voice becoming distant as he spoke a truth that was hard to bear ive also sadly witnessed a soul that was pure have to flee its earthly housing well before its time heard a heart that was loving stop beating while you were in my arms then as now i see a body created in majesty that is still yearning for affection beyond lust i see a brilliant mind trapped in an era of ignorance straining for recognition and release i see a woman held captive by circumstance and accident of birth a hostage of men who have no right to own another living soul the small attention i gave you upon arriving here at night caused them to hate you more jealousy is a tireless monster that no one can understand it was her turn to look away then tears mixed with rage as she remembered the respectful attention the new nobleman had given her and the way men with lesser wealth had resented her reciprocated charm women on the island black and white hated her because of the attention shed garnered from the wealthy stranger men on the island seethed with outrage those of all hues taking offense that she would be so enamored with a stranger that shed deny their advances she hadnt thought she was better or that they were lesser alfonse dubenet had given her a jewel that no man had offered respect set in kindness he didnt presume to own her hadnt presumed that due to her station versus his that he could simply take her hed actually tried to begin the slow process of courting her that is what had been viewed as scandalous that was where the true crime had been committed according to the locals and shed blossomed under alfonses gifts of emotional tenderness shed seen that as his difference the respect and tenderness hed offered not until the night hed rescued her had she realized that he was something beyond human but then again so were they it was humans that had ultimately abused her had tried to murder her a vampire had killed her but in so doing had saved her the simplicity of it was both profound and perverse alfonse had released a sigh of frustration when he saw her thinking too hard and had then given her his hand be my bride and let us seek our revenge by outliving them all we will have to go to the mainland they now know what i am as well as will correctly assume you are that too if we stay on this small island they will find us by daylight we must leave tonight chérie his human crew was already waiting the ship had been loaded the hull of it prepared protection sealed it that was the first time shed crossed the sea new orleans eventually became her home but not before hed shown her the world she missed alfonse so terribly that her heart still contracted with phantom pains when she thought about him shaking the memory she alighted on a deserted section of boardwalk the night was still young as she considered the moon only a little after midnight normally she didnt hunt so early and preferred being out in the ocean breeze as long as possible but the man shed fed on so reminded her of alfonse yet his physical attributes were where the similarity had begun and ended the mans mind was repugnant his thoughts pedestrian common she had done a good deedfreeing a beautiful body of a stagnant soul at least the physical work of art could decompose in peace and not be mocked by adulterous misuse from the banal mind that had controlled it he wasnt even a good lover thus not worthy of being a vampire the shadow of a building provided her reentry into solid form near humans a quick autumn breeze took up the edges of her little black dress as she stepped into the light giving passerby men a glimpse of her long sleek legs and a flash of red thong brief curiosity and lust filled their eyes she dismissed them mentally while she listened to their life stories in her head as she walked toward the boardwalk rails to stare out at the ocean all average joes none worth pursuing and shed just eaten never take more than you need the casinos here were just not like those in monaco the beaches here so unlike the caribbean or the mediterranean losing alfonse was a tragedy tears rose in her eyes and then burned away time had bled out the tears but not the pain or the memory nightly survival was a game of chance the casinos were that as well the baccarat tables and high rollers dens were filled with men who thrived on risk and survived that was the energy that drew her and ignited her that was the energy that disappointed her bored insane she wondered if she might try a new milieu this century politicians perhaps most were duplicitous foul creatures that were predatory in nature so why not it would be no different than handpicking criminals to feed from however hiding their deaths would be more problematic siphoning a hitman dry would not create a fullscale investigation it would go into a coldcase homicide file police wouldnt expend too much manpower on it the organization her feed hailed from would retaliate if necessary against their assumed enemies which would allow her to feed off the opposing side for a while until they retaliatedand the authorities would be none the wiser a beautiful cycle until she moved on it would all remain in the province of organized crime simple elegant going after whitecollar political criminals with highprofile posts would be messy even if more satisfying maybe one day for now she was stuck in north america until she could develop a foolproof plan to cross the forbidding sea daylight was the barrier one could travel as vapor only so far before depleting ones energy the specter of being lost at sea at sunrise decomposing and burning in the water was compelling enough of a reason to stay on shore alfonse had taught her that too had taught her how to glamour human helpers to keep their coffins closed in the cargo hull until night but with new technology and homeland security new maritime laws as well as the ineptness of this eras baggage handlers were she to dare a plane flight would mean shed surely fry in their care she allowed her shoulders to slump for now she was not just stuck but trapped on this continent since alfonses demise pushing away from the rail with renewed annoyance she headed toward the bright lights not caring which casino she entered they were all the same just like the feeds had been vegas was a notch up from where she was now but it lacked a beach and being a spawn of the caribbean the night air for her required surf down in the delta the feeds that came into the casinos were so poboysouthern fried that they threatened to make her kill sloppily in outrage shed had to move from there and her beloved new orleans just wasnt the same since the flood miami had potential but there was so much competition to feed on the drug lords that often territorial plunder wars broke out amongst her kind and she didnt need the hassle each coven was so protective of its land rights same with la california was another world the northeastern seaboard held the greatest potential at the moment as did the connecticut tract or going up into michigan and over into canada still one had to be careful of regional vampire politics she was older than most but was also made by alfonsewhom many had ill feelings about because hed been merciless in enforcing his code of ethics never the innocent never take more than you need gorging orgies had been put to a stop in his region making children was considered heresy in alfonses book he had garnered formidable enemies because of his extreme views because of his extreme mercy toward humans for that mercy they had colluded to mercilessly expose him to sunlight in a devastating coup the only thing that had saved her was another male wanted her for himself her face became tight as thoughts of vengeance tainted her mood yes shed played along until she could return the favor of sunlight exposure but that had left her alone an outcast from polite vampire society that was the main reason she couldnt trust a cargo ship or flight abroad however montreal was beautiful and quebec was her refuge when she needed a taste of europe albeit neither was a seaside town but up there any death of a local human was a big deal in that pristine environment and created too much attention so until circumstances changed or her code of feeding off those whod been predators changed she was stuck how did one stop missing a man that shed loved for more than two hundred years she kept walking until the click of her high heels against the marble pierced her senses sometimes she lived so deeply inside her own head that she had to remember where she was and had to remember to keep up the tedious façade of being engaged in the moment caring about the mundane goings on of human existence had to fit in be unobtrusive in their world had to stay away from the mirrors and reflective surfaces that were all the rage in the chic hotels wanted a vodka martini and hated that she had to find a feed who was drinking one and then had to entice him somewhere for just a sip from his veins all this waiting when she was a woman of action tonight she wanted to be anywhere but here but atlantic city would just have to do frustrated she found a black jack table and sat with a flop bad night the dealer asked with a smile she stared at his warm hazel eyes and dark brown skin enjoying the way his mouth moved for a moment before she materialized a stack of chips in her clutch bag and then withdrew them to slide them onto the table just a slow start but the night is young he nodded appraising her physique for a second and then dealt her cards she studied him before looking down at her cards he couldnt have been more than twentyfive with his sexy chocolate self black jack she said quietly and then pushed the five thousand dollars worth of chip winnings back in his direction as a tip he was cute too young with too much of a future to dine on she stood as he gaped you sure miss he looked from the stack to her and then over to his pit boss as ever she murmured blowing him a sexy kiss do something positive with it a mind is a terrible thing to waste she made eye contact with the older pit boss to be sure the young dealer wouldnt get in troublehe hadnt stolen the chips it was her tip her choice the pit boss nodded now she could leave this is what acute boredom did made one find little stupid things to engage in to give ones life meaning she turned to leave but the young dealers energy reached out to try to hold her she could feel him summoning the nerve to ask a simple question curiosity about to cost him dearly curiosity always killed the cat and sometimes satisfaction brought it back he was a handsome cat even if curiosity had the potential to kill him but he wasnt a keeper not likely to get brought back whats your name she half turned and offered him a halfsmile not important and no i dont want to meet you later when you get off your shift just enjoy the cash and stay healthy baby okay i can do that he said seeming disappointed as she strode away she shook her head and chuckled softly to herself men they always wanted more than the bargain five grand wasnt enough he wanted sex too maybe she would just head toward the poker tables or just go out to sit under the stars to allow the night to pass without incident he stared at the security monitors running back the images that didnt make sense a chair had moved away from the table by itself chips had appeared on the table and the dealer looked as though he was talking to himself hed dealt and cards flipped where no one was seated then what looked like five thousand in winnings had gotten pushed back to the dealer the kid had even checked with the pit boss who nodded chips slid toward him as he spoke to the nothingness it was time to take a break obviously his head was all screwed up either someone had slipped him a mickey or he was finally having that nervous breakdown that he should have had five years ago but he was so fuckin close no one else had seemed to notice it had gone by in a flash yo tony you okay a burly member of the security team stared at him seeming worried all of a sudden you dont look so good like you seen a ghost or somethin he dabbed at the sweat beading his brow im cool man just need a few cover for me i need to go take a walk several pairs of eyes regarded him eyes he knew he could never fully trust he wasnt one of them but had worked his way inside their organization through years of deception and still he was only in the outer layers of their hierarchy sure thing man take ten he nodded studying their predatory eyes before slipping out of the casino floor monitoring room maybe he was losing it if they could see it so clearly sharks could always sense blood in the water from miles away and from what fat joe had said and the expression on his face it was obvious he was bleeding to death but the big question was had his cover been blown somehow and ultimately did that matter if he was a traitor he was dead if he was perceived as a liability he was dead sharks would eat their own if one of them was weak or injured right now he seemed weak seemed injured he knew his eyes had given him away his sweat in a cool airconditioned room had telegraphed to them that something out of the blue had made him freak he could have replayed the images but what if what he saw was all in his head then thered be questions deeper digging into his background he couldnt fully trust his own either there had been a leak back at the federal task force on organized crime jersey division after what theyd done to his meghan his partner and his partners wife there was no time for socalled healing he kept walking if they snuffed him in the mens room then hed take several of them with him checking the stalls briefly he walked past the urinals and went to the sinks splashing water on his face quickly so that his senses remained alert he grabbed a paper towel and stared in the mirror as he wiped away the water not seeing himself but the fire before he turned away his partner nate was the inside man hed worked the logistics in the office their wives were dear friends that day meghan had gone over to personally tell carol the good news she was pregnant tony briefly closed his eyes the kids thank god were in the yard when carol turned on the burner under a tea kettle both women were at ground zero when the blast rocked the kitchen nate heard it on the police band evidence of the charred radio told them that hed never made it home to collect his devastated children or to bury his wife theyd ducttaped explosives to nates chair and then allowed the warehouse to go up like a fourth of july display he needed a drink even though that was thoroughly against casino policy fuck it no wonder he was seeing things following the rules had never been his forte at least not after what went down had gone down heading toward the elevators he kept his gaze scanning hed known all along that there had to be a leak no matter what the internal investigation revealed his own personal investigation told him otherwise some people even suggested that he rest stop asking questions take a vacation take time off to grieve meghan there were a lot of people who didnt want the gambiotti family to have any legal problems political incorrectness was entrenched in the system as was payola he took their advice for three months took time off to do what he had to do so when bodies within the department started dropping they never suspected it was one of their own making a surgical strike it wasnt murder in his mind it was a matter of principle chaos bred panic those within the department left in the chain of command wanted the loose ends tied up quickly before death came to their door they wanted him back on the job back in play suddenly they didnt care about his healing or his loss survival instinct was a motherfucker they knew that a man with nothing to lose was a dangerous thing so they set him on the other side like a rabid dognever the wiser about who was hitting dirty fedsand they sicced him on the side that had given the hit order he could go after the gambiottis with impunity as long as he yielded results but if he was caught doing anything outside the scope of the law he was on his own a rogue that they would necessarily disavow the bell sounding the elevator arrival gave him a start he stepped inside glad it was empty and went down to the casino floor he had to talk to that black jack dealer and pit boss before he left to go out for a smoke a small dive bar around the corner was calling his name but so was the need to know he approached the table carefully watching the patrons and the dealer until the young man noticed him after the hand he shut the table down yo man i knew yall was comingask stan the chick said it was my tip yall aint breaking my legs for no bullshit i dont steal from the house never have the kid is clean tony stan said his voice low as he entered the quiet but intense conversation i havent said a word and you all have jumped to a defense tony said coolly regarding both men cmon tony what are we supposed to think one of you guys comes down here from the monitoring booth shuts down the table and whatever right after the kid gets a big tip the old man lifted his chin it aint right what did the woman look like tony waited knowing the cameras were now on him if there was something shaky going on then he had to solidify the familys trust in him by going to handle it directly maybe he would run back those digital images he could show the boys in the room the thing that had triggered his reaction and they would see him now down on the floor but both men looked puzzled for a moment you saw the broad from the monitors old stan challenged running his thick fingers through his snowwhite hair she was fine the dealer said keeping his voice low and his eyes darting around like a trapped rabbits you know man the money type five ten skin flawless designer black dress on diamond earrings the real shit not no czs single gold bangle with some real weight legs that go on for miles stilettos making her ass even hotter when she walks beautiful set of tits vneck serving it all up but not in a hoochie type of way but she didnt remind me of a pro at least not the ones around here ive seen she had a real classy vibe man like she wasnt from around herebelonged in fucking vegas or monaco or off some runway in paris but not down at the damned jersey shore like she had money to play with seemed like she was bored as hell too if you feel me hey if she stole it yall can have it backbut i didnt steal it the kid is only twentysix tony he didnt steal from the drawer that i witnessed with my own eyes hes not lying the broad was old money the desperation in the young mans voice and fear in his eyes told him what he needed to know onethere hadnt been a theft twothere was a woman at that table but then why hadnt she shown up on the monitors that was the part that made him question his sanity unnerved he let the two men waiting on his judgment off the hook all right keep the chips but point out which way she went i have some questions for her shit you shut my table down and ill walk you to her over by the poker tables the young dealer seemed unconvinced that his life was no longer in jeopardy stan nodded and he quickly came around the edge of his table i dont want no problems man no bullshit whatsoever awight so ima take you to her you can ask her yourself whether or not she gave me the tip cool then you guys will have that on tape and i dont have to worry about getting into my car in the parking lot right thatll work tony said calmly as the young dealer came to his side looked around and then shook his hand there she go he said beginning to walk cant miss her aint nothing like her in this joint tony stared behind the kid for a moment before he began walking again he hadnt lied sensuality personified oozed from her very being the way her graceful hand took up a card and added it to her fan the way her mesmerizing eyes studied them and the dealer sent the temperature of the entire casino up a notch her face was gorgeous and that added to the unbelievable curves she owned made her a knockout dropdead todiefor beauty not since meghan had he been so drawn to a woman a roll in the hay with a pro was one thing simply a matter of releasing the primalsomething hed indulged in when he had more drinks than advisable but this woman then as though sensing his approach she looked up and stared at him there was no question she was staring at himit was more than a visual recognition he felt it he watched her fold her hand rake in the winnings and stand leaving the game shed sensed someone staring at her but until the crowd parted a bit she wasnt sure of where the energy pull was coming from she spotted the young dealer whose entire aura radiated stress and flightorfight hormone that was palpable yes hed been the one staring at her but there was a darker presence a more sensual mysterious creature behind the kid the moment she saw the source she froze his dark brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail she wondered if it was held by a dark leather thong or a simple rubber band she briefly closed her eyes no longer than a slow blink perceiving as much as she could about him in seconds leather held his hair broad shoulders filled out his black leather jacket and concealed a gun she could taste the metallic change in the air and smell the gunpowder in the clip he wore a black tshirt beneath the butter soft leather black slacks black slipon cole haans no jewelry just a fine gold watch made by rolex a pair of intense dark eyes pierced her asking questions in a thunder of human thoughts a strong jaw was set hard but his mouth was still beautiful not a tight line of anger his athletic body moved through the crowd with the stealth of a cat he was hunting her interesting yet there was no guile aimed at her to be found in his presence but this was a man of mysteries as he neared her it all became so clearhe was the honest man shed saved earlier by feeding on the assassin the irony made her smile excuse me miss may i have a word with you she turned and regarded the near breathless dealer and then the man that stood behind him she nodded already knowing what the problem was i had hoped it wouldnt come to this she said looking past the dealer into the eyes of pure intrigue i was bored gave him a large tip of my own volition he didnt steal anything from your casino she flashed a purse full of chips worth close to fifty thousand dollars look i have more she pulled out another five grand and handed it to the dealer just so you gentlemen who watch transactions can be clear that i did tip the man see see what i mean tony the dealer held the chips out to tony to take still nervous youre straight you can go back to your table and open up tony said quietly not looking at the dealer his eyes transfixed on her buy you a drink she gave him a halfsmile mind if we get out of here and go somewhere less frenetic this place is giving me a headache great minds think alike im tony pleased to meet you antonio i am odette how did you know my full name was antonio and not just plain anthony because you are a complicated man and anthony is way too simplistic for you how about that drink somewhere out of here i would adore a vodka martini he nodded my favorite good she murmured très bon fat joe took the phone away from his ear slowly every man in the booth watching tony leave the casino alone after money had again changed hands they just found donny all fucked up in his room over at the trump cant figure out what the fuck happened to him wasnt an ounce of blood in im that shit is crazy lou said standing tony had to know donny was gonna do im tonight cuz look at the segment of floor activity he was checking out before he got all weird on us fat joe came around the desks moving his heft swiftly to lean in and see where lou pointed other henchmen in the room joined in look at that shit i dont understand it but somehow he must have either erased the persons image or somethin the dealer looks nervous five large goes across the table the dealer asks old stan something and then our boy shuts down his monitors goes downstairs right he has a little talk the dealer walks with him away from the black jack area over toward poker they put more cash in the dealers hand and he leaves so the black kid is working undercover with him and they got old stan to turn a blind eye you think fat joe stood up straight outrage making his face turn red yeah and helping himself to a little pocket lining just like the other feds but how he got to donny thats what i wanna know fat joe looked at lou does that matter how they did it they tried to infiltrate us are stealing money from useven if it is a punk ass amount and they killed a good man the boss said to be sure that crazy bastard tony got put down hard tonight we cant have undercover cops thinking they can violate us like that so its good hes off the premises saves us the trouble of having to ask him to go for a little ride ill round up the fellas lou said with a slight smile the place where hed taken her was a dive but it was quiet the short walk away from the casino district had allowed her thoughts to gather along with her impressions of him pain so deep and so profound cloaked him and shed almost reached out to touch him to try to dispel it youre an honest man she said once the bartender had taken their drink orders noble no man is without sin he replied staring into her eyes sin stains nobility i didnt say you were without sin i said you were an honest man to kill those who have brutalized those you love is an honest emotion her words made him draw back and a frown replaced his once serene expression you need to talk to mequickly she smiled i am not your nemesis nor your enemy she released a sigh as their drinks came knowing shed never be able to sip hers without a bit of blood mixer there was a man in the hotel over at the trump taj mahal donny i think his name was was tony leaned in to her and grabbed her arm was she said flatly he knew who you were they all do i suppose if they sent him to kill you hes dead tony slowly let go of her arm and then cautiously downed half his martini how do you know all of this because i eliminated him incredulous he simply stared at her for a moment you work for them and youve now set me up she shook her head no have the rest of your martini i dont work for anyone havent in years he was an asshole a very bad man the type i despise so then how do you know all of thislike how you knew my name tonys voice was a low threatening rumble if i told you youd never believe me try me you just told me you killed a man and know way too much about me for comfort she searched his face seeing kind eyes behind their angry veneer seeing where the pain began and what had chased him into the arms of fate they took your wifes life she murmured your partners and his wife the baby odette shook her head and then shivered beasts humans can be animalsive died at their hands had that which was precious taken from me you and i are not so different lady stop talking in riddles he said now grabbing her arm again as he roughly set down his glass you arent ready for the truth ask yourself didnt you find it strange that you couldnt see me on the monitors the moment i saw you pushing the young dealer in my direction with you dressed in security staff black i figured that the technology had betrayed me what the fuck is going on lady she inclined her head toward the mirror behind the bar motioning toward it with her chin i dont show up in reflections mirrored surfaces or even in photographs i dont exist but i do exist i dont appear dangerous but im deadly and im so much older than you think but im not evil although everything youve been taught says that i am even though some like me definitely are you and i are the same rogues an enigma cloaked in pain and invisible to most others we cull the herds you and i in our own way we keep the beasts away from the innocent be careful tonightits getting late i need to go his hand had fallen away from her arm as his jaw went slack he didnt offer protest as he stared in the mirror and she stood and walked away too stunned to immediately gather himself by the time his body and mind caught up to each other allowing him to toss a twenty on the bar and dash out the door to find her she was gone but a black escalade careened over the curb its door opened before he could draw his weapon and beefy hands had him duct tape went over his mouth nylon cuffed his wrists as the vehicle sped to a deserted section of beach hardened eyes told him odette hadnt lied how could he have been so stupid his shoulder collided with the ground the searing pain racing through his skeleton a pair of dead young eyes stared at him open glassy the kid was only twentysix hell he was only thirtyseven struggling just made the men around him laugh trying to speak made them draw their weapons take the tape off and lemme hear what this sonofabitch has to say lou growled leveling a nine millimeter toward tonys face weve known you were a cop for months another henchman ripped off the tape tony took a huge inhale and then began shouting spittle flying fuck you he yelled out trying to sit up you kill my pregnant wife and think im not coming for you you kill my partner and think thered be no retribution chest heaving death eminent he refused to beg them wanted them to know that hed take this grudge with him to hell and back ill haunt you motherfuckers this aint over the men around him laughed and shook their heads sorry i aint superstitious one said yeah me neither lou said shrugging his shoulders and poking out his barrel chest but sorry about the wife little bitch wasnt supposed to be at the house when it blew our bad ill kill you tony shouted yeah were so scared lou said and then squeezed the trigger twice the back of his head exploded in pain and colors for a second and then everything went dark there was no light no sound he could no longer feel the sand or the wind the chill of the night air was gone hed failed it was so quick a blink of time he was floating and weeping inside his shattered mind pressure at his throat made his muscles twitch something tightened around him and then became light making him feel like he was flying away time stood still and yet he could feel its passage water now pelted his body his forehead rested against something soft he opened his eyes slowly to a dark angel the shower spray blurring his vision buttercreamsoft hands traced his back cinnamonhued breasts cushioned his chest as his knees buckled a warm mouth sought his in a tender kiss he had to be in heaven because hed just left hell on the beach everything was now surreal his stomach churned and then pain soon gripped him making him stagger backward to claw the wall his wail an agonized echo that bounced off the tiles i tried but got there too late to save the boy that young dealer they are animals a familiar voice murmured you must eat to regain your strength and then heal today tonight we will work together frantic he looked around at the exquisite marble and gold fixtures and then his gaze settled on odette where am i at my home far away from them you saved me he panted the last thing i remember is lou unloaded two slugs into the back of my head tonys hand gingerly touched his skull and then when he felt no wound panicked i perceived that you wanted to live more than anything else in order to avenge this travesty of justice i did but but how he stepped out of the walkin shower bumping into the glass and staggering to the far side of the spacious bathroom i heard the shots felt the impact passed out how in the fuck dont i have a huge hole in my head he looked around noticing something was missing wheres the mirror wheres the goddamned mirror odette i dont have any in the mansion she said calmly turning off the water and covering her nudity with a large white turkish towel they upset me why whats going on she tossed him a towel and watched him grab it swiftly im sorry it was the only way to save you but once you eat youll understand all eat eat are you insane he wound the towel around his waist and struggled to stand without the aid of the double sink im not hungry im about to lose my mind my brains just got blown out but im not dead this aint a hospital and i dont know why im even alive pain doubled him over again youre not eat she whispered offering him her wrist he seemed confused and then became horrified as her french manicured finger broke the skin and fangs filled his mouth at the first sight of her blood tears stung his eyes but the scent of blood saturated the bathroom drawing him to her beyond his control he closed his eyes as he took her arm and brought it to his lips her fingers threading through his hair petting him as he greedily suckled colors staining the inside of his lids pleasure careening through his system until he could stand it no more he threw his head back and released a moan her embrace opened the floodgate on years of hurt along with a torrent of tears sobs of remorse choked him a tender mouth swallowed them away velvet tresses were in his fist his fingers wending their way through dripping curls hands so graceful so soft removed pain from his aura with each gentle caress until towels fell away and skin burned against skin this woman had saved him had pulled his essence of existence away from the blackness he had another chance to complete the mission hed begun her story exploded inside his mind and he wept for her as his story entered her and she wept for him their honesty becoming raw passion that slammed against the walls and melted down to bodyslicked heat on the towelstrewn floor the storm of emotions and pleasure was so swift that it left them both breathless he stared down at her tracing the edge of her beautiful brows and then cradled her cheek why did you come back for me he murmured still out of breath because you were a keeper i found you after a very long search a nobleman and it has been centuries since id found someone worth saving a gentle smile eased out of hiding on her face plus i so badly wanted a vodka martini he paused to catch his breath his mind laboring under the new knowledge it had just received what they did to you was unforgivable i became what i am much like you did tonight she murmured touching his cheek her smile fading someone cared enough about me to give me another chance and i loved him for that and for whom he was he understood what odette was telling him he loved meghan that way but it was becoming so difficult to hold onto the memory or to nurse it to life imagine after more than two hundred years the memories fade and all you have left is the pain her stare was so hypnotic so open and for all that she was and all that she had done she possessed serenity i have to finish this tomorrow night then i can move on i know you have to redress what happened to you she said quietly briefly closing her eyes just as one day ill route out the rest of those in the coven that participated in the coup against alfonse i know he murmured moving against her slowly and now appreciating the unhurried pleasure of their union she was a beautiful woman but there was something beyond that something still so genuine inside her very being it had been so long since hed witnessed that or had allowed himself to experience the possibility it existed beyond meghan the fact that he felt the way he did almost seemed like a betrayal its not a betrayal odette murmured brushing his mouth with hers they would have wanted us to go on to thrive and not merely survive if we exist tortured then the others have also won a gasp escaped him as odettes slick sheath tightened around him he studied her face as he loved her slowly kissing her throat then her breasts paying delicate homage to her erect hershey nipples with tiny suckles until she moaned satiny legs encircled his waist as she arched and offered him her throat the strike into her jugular was swift but tender her gasp sending a shudder through him that made him cry out the night wore on their lovemaking an anthem to survival to renewal that took them from the floor of the vast bathroom to the sprawl of her kingsized bed he watched semidazed as the steel door to the basement sanctuary closed and pure darkness surrounded them but yet he could still see rest she whispered later tonight will be ours we have the benefit now of time power and stealth he pulled her against his chest in the darkness finding it new that no heartbeats meshed and only cool skin now touched the heat was gone but not his loyalty to the one whod saved him the seeds of a longtime love had been planted one that wouldnt grow old one that understood him more than the former love of his life ever had one that shared his altruism and even his dark side im glad you found me he said quietly i didnt want to die she nodded and kissed his chest i am glad too this is rare it is magic finders keepers for the first time in years he closed his eyes with a smile they entered the casino just as they had left but no monitors could perceive them old stan looked at tony and then glanced away wait here he said to odette i have to clear this up she nodded and perused the floor watching as her lover tried to make an old man understand but that was pointless people believed what they wanted to finally she saw tony hail her with a slight lift of his jaw ask odette he said calmly placing a hand on stans shoulder she already knew the direction of the conversation he didnt kill the young dealer they did tony used to work for the feds stan straightened then get the fuck away from me would ya he spoke through his teeth i dont wanna wind up like that kid and i dont wanna know whats going onbut i dont want them to see me ever talking to you tony nodded no problem you live well odette took his arm there is much i have to teach you about the use of your power just get me up into the security area without them seeing me vapor she said with a wide grin follow me to the shadows you just dont do that on an open casino floor in polite company she took his hand and then pulled him into an alcove kissing him passionately as passersby glanced at them once and then they were gone drifting replaced body weight and then vents became passageways silence echoed all around him until odettes voice entered his head bullets will hurt but not kill you however the rage is controlling you right now you must control the rage decide before you go in there whether or not you want to rip them to shreds with your bare hands and start an entirely crazy investigation or if you want to just shoot them all so that it looks like a humanonhuman crime before he could answer her he was standing inside the room and could feel her presence invisibly monitoring his first foray as a vampire they were eating takeout from the restaurants below laughter filled the room total entitlement to joy surrounded them like his life and death and that of an innocent kids never matter never happened they didnt even see him i told you i would haunt you tony said in a low growl oh shit lou jumped up and grabbed his gun four henchmen cursed and scrambled for weapons i thought you whacked this bastard fat joe shouted in that moment tony decided he didnt want to shoot them handtohand combat just felt too good ripping lous arm out of its socket and then shooting him in the head just felt like the right thing to do but wisdom and vampire speed prevailed as he unloaded his clip feed before you leave odette said materializing behind him or else its a waste they sat hand in hand under the stars on a bench watching the surf a thousand questions pummeled his mind but he was grateful he didnt have to verbalize any of them for her to understand it is a sexy glorious emotion revenge but just like sex with a lover you dont love once you climax it all feels so hollow he nodded leave it to a woman to so eloquently define what was raging within him now what he whispered there are so many more of them so many i could go after and will but it all seems so pointless she laid her head on his shoulder this is why i havent destabilized the coven after i repaid gustav for what hed done to alfonse i sadly realized it would never bring him back her soft palm stroked his chest as she looked out to the moon alfonse and i decimated the town back in haiti before we left that fateful night of my making we settled all old debts but in the end none of that made us feel better beyond the moment of the bloodletting sorta like a crack high for the moment its an adrenaline rush like you cannot believe and then and then you crash he stared at her so how do you go on living now as time passes youll realize that the greatest thing you have is someone to share that passage of time with for what felt like eons i focused on the ugliness so much that i could never see the beauty of life once i died i forgot how to do that i had forgotten that while i was still living he said in a sad murmur i have seen the dawn of so much though cars telephones airplanes i could go on and on but also wars he smiled and then chuckled sadly so what do we do become philanthropists she smiled and shrugged why not we can be whatever we want to be can right wrongs can help or hurt what do you want to be i dont want to hurt people he said quietly his voice so sad that it drew her she stared into his eyes and nodded touching his lips with one finger enough lessons for one night enough vengeance for one era let us focus on beauty he took her mouth in a slow dissolve of pleasure he was her greatest find something precious that she would vow to keep and she knew that she was that for him the irony of that truth not lost on either of them after the stone age by brian stableford brian stablefords latest novels all new this year include sherlock holmes and the vampires of eternity the dragon man and the moment of truth he is wellknown in vampire circles for his novels the hunger and ecstasy of vampires the empire of fear and young blood and for his translations of french author paul féval pères nineteenthcentury works of vampire fiction which predate

popular because it imagines a kind of charisma a subspecies of angst and an insidious variety of violence of which humans are incapable thus providing a temporary distraction from the charismatic void ineffably tedious angst and mere brutality that constitute the quotidian human condition i became interested in it when the history of the subgenre took an interesting turn in the s when assumptions of monstrosity formerly taken moreorless for granted were challenged and interrogated in various quirky ways presumably reflectingalbeit in a distorting mirrorcontemporary sociological shifts in attitudes to sexuality this tale which first appeared in the bbcs cult vampire magazine is about the potential utility of vampirism as a natural substitute for liposuction mina had tried them all weightwatchers conley grapefruit atkins hypnotherapy and pumping iron on the day she decided after three grueling months that the stone age diet was doing her more harm than goodjust like all the restshe felt that she had hit rock bottom in the abyss of despair she clocked in at sixteen stone five pounds just six pounds lighter than the day she had embarked on the stone age with such steely determination by the end of march she would doubtless crack the seventeen stone barrier going in the wrong direction younger people she supposed calculated in kilograms but she had never contrived to adjust mercifully she was in public finance rather than the commercial sector so she rarely had to audit accounts that were connected even in the remotest degree with the eu she never traveled abroad because she couldnt bear the thought of an airplane seat let alone stripping down to a bikini on a beach in marbella she had never lost the habits of embarrassment gained in childhood and now she had the prospect of middleage spread looming before her mina hadnt an atom of proof that she had been passed over for promotion because of the way she looked the fact that her newly imported line manager lucy stanwere had a figure like paula radcliffe as well as being ten years younger might have been coincidence the fact that lucy was able to wear fourinch heels thus allowing her to tower over those condemned by gravity to flat soles might also be irrelevant to her rapid ascent of the status ladder the fact that mina was due to see lucy for her annual appraisal the morning after she fell off the stone age wagon and gorged herself on welsh rarebit and chocolate milk was however definitely not a coincidence anxiety had always been a key factor in minas comfort eating lucys office was of course incredibly neat it wasnt just that the cleaners made more effort there than in the openplan but that lucys own personal neatness radiated out from her sizeten suit to bathe her entire environment with a kind of bloodless perfection simply being there made mina feel even more like a rubbishheap than usual from the moment she stepped through the door her one ambition was to escape as soon as possible no matter how much criticism she had to absorb and acknowledge in order to do it she didnt of course dare to entertain the ambition that she might accomplish that escape without some slighting reference being made to her appearancein fact the first thing lucy said after please sit down miss mint was are you unwell that in healthfascistese meant how can you even breathe when youre carrying so much excess baggage you disgusting calorieaddict ive had a little tummy trouble recently mina admitted but its sure to clear up now coming off the stone age lucy asked in a tone that sounded almost sympathetic mina had never talked to lucy in a nonwork context so she couldnt claim to know her well but she certainly hadnt expected sympathy she decided that it must be an illusion yes actually mina admitted i thought so lucy said the trouble with all these theories about what evolution shaped our digestive systems to do is that humans are so exceedingly adaptable we grow up on grains and dairy products and our bodies learn to love them if theres one thing that separates humans from all the other animals its the ability to learn to love dont you agree the chance would be a fine thing mina thought what she said aloud was yes miss stanwere its lucy look mina i dont want to seem presumptuous and ill understand if you want to confine our discussion to the nerves and sinews of auditing practice and gordon browns latest wrinkles but theres a better way to lose weight if you really want to its about time that you were let in on the secret mina had long suspected that there must be a vast conspiracy of the fit and thin whose precious secrets were sternly withheld from people like her but she had never expected to be let into it she said nothing i know what youre thinking lucy stanwere said when the pause had passed from pregnant to eggbound how would i know well i do she took up her handbag any normal person would have had to root about for at least thirty seconds to find what she wanted but lucy only required a mere moment to pluck the desired item from its innermost depths she handed mina a photograph mina stared at the snapshot in frank disbelief it wasnt so much the sixteen stone version of lucy stanwere that startled and appalled her so much as the expression the teenager was wearing an expression of profound shame and terror of exposure that mina had only ever seen at weightwatchersor in a mirror when she looked up again mina saw her superior with entirely new eyes she could find but one word how lucys perfectly manicured fingers dipped into the mysterious bag for a second time and produced another slim item at first mina judged from its size that it was a businesscard but it was glossy and black and bore an image of two magnificently athletic individuals dancing what appeared to be the tango above the redlettered inscription the after dark club the postcode attached to the address was suggestive of mayfair meet me there at tenthirty lucy said ill tell the desk to expect you and ill take you in a night club mina said aghast i cant go to a night club tenthirty lucy stanwere repeated insistently be on time mina had nothing suitable to wear but the situation was so surreal that it didnt seem to matter she was usually curled up in bed with a mills and boon not long after tenthirty once shed watched the news on the bbc so she went to catch the central line tube at ealing broadway with the kind of disturbed feeling that changes in a familiar routine always bring on she had never realized that the urban wilderness between piccadilly and oxford street had so many hidden trails and discreet coverts but her pocket atoz eventually guided her to an unmarked door with a discreet intercom and bellpush mina almost turned round and went home right then but eventually plucked up courage to press the button when a fuzzy voice said yes she blurted out isthattheafterdarkclublucystanwereaskedmetomeetherhere without the slightest pause for breath there was an eerie buzzing soundmore like a swarm of angry wasps than placid bees but no less welcome for thatpunctuated by a click mina pushed the door open and entered a gloomy corridor which led to a flight of stairs at the top of the stairs was a desk manned by a teenage male in an absurdly oldfashioned suit miss mint he said before she could gather her breath weve been expecting you its a pleasure to meet you mina had not had time to frame a reply when the burgundycolored door to the left of the desk opened and lucy stanwere came out accompanied by two other men each as callow as the receptionist both complexioned like turks or italians they too were wearing black suits cut to standards of formality that had surely gone out with the last king george or maybe queen victoria lucy by contrast was dressed in a very now manner that was far more relaxedlouche eventhan her everyday officewear mina darling she said with a brazen bonhomie that contrasted just as sharply with the flinty face of public finance i want you to meet marcian and szandor youll have to forgive szandorim afraid his english is a trifle rustybut marcian will translate for him come through wont you mina was unable to respond to this invitation immediately because marcian and szandor were busy kissing her hands so enthusiastically that they hadnt waited to take turns seizing one apiece nor did they let go when they had finished arranging themselves to either side of her with an affectionate politeness that she had never encountered before she had of course avoided making eyecontact her embarrassment being so intense that she had all but closed her eyes but as she stole sidelong glances to her left and right she observed that both of them were looking at her with expressions that betrayed not the slightest hint of disgust contempt scorn or disapproval if she had only dared she might have felt a surge of joy but she had lived in the world too long to be free of the suspicion that she was about to suffer some humiliating reversal of fortune marcian and szandor escorted her through the doorway although it didnt seem humanly possible that there was room enough for either to pass through it beside her let alone both she was swept along another purplecarpeted corridor to another darkly varnished door while lucy followed the image on the card had left mina with the impression that there might be a ballroom swirling with exotic couples all engaged in a furiously erotic tango but the whole building seemed silent insulated from the unceasing noise of the capital the room in which mina now found herself was actually a bedroom my god mina thought as she contemplated the kingsized fourposter with the red velvet curtains its not a night club at all its a knockingshop for chubbychasers so far as she was concerned chubbychasers were creatures of legend one of whom she had always longed to meet like unicorns which refused to have anything to do with anyone but virgins men who were sexually attracted to fat women were exceedingly thin on the ground in ealing then mina remembered lucy who was only half the woman now that she had been as a teenager and realized that there must be more to the situation than had yet met her eye she turned opening her fearful eyes sufficiently to demand an explanation its all right mina lucy said theres nothing to be afraid of no ones gong to do anything to you that you dont want them to do but the time has come for you to ask yourself the question do i sincerely want to be thin mina swallowed a hysterical laugh the consequent frog in her throat made it impossible to do anything but croak yes it seemed a pitifully feeble expression of her desire but lucy seemed satisfied good she said ill cut to the chase thenno point in beating about the bush marcian and szandor are vampires given a few months of weekly sessions they can literally drink your superfluous flesh away youll need to take iron tablets to facilitate the manufacture of new blood but their enzymes will do the restreorientate your metabolism to convert your adipose deposits that kind of thing it wont make you feel badquite the reverse youll feel better than youve ever felt before full of energy in more ways than one natural selection is a wonderful thing and we talked only this morning about the marvelous ability of human beings to adapt themselves marcian and szandor are human too of courseyoull have to forget all that superstitious nonsense about the undead rising from their graves and canine teeth becoming fangs vampires are just another natural species near relatives of ours in the genus homo who accompanied us to the brink of extinction more than once but are now on the increase again theyre not quite ready to come out of hiding yetlike us theyre not entirely free of their old instinctsbut theyre making discreet diplomatic moves at every level taking one step at a time in the tedious business of winning hearts and minds mina hadnt noticed lucy stanweres clichéaddiction before but she tried to concentrate her attention on the more important aspects of the speech apparently she wasnt going to be required to dance the tango in any literal sense instead she was going to lie down on the bed while marcian and szandor drank her blood presumably relieving her of forty fluid ounces or so while pumping some kind of enzymes into her that would retune her metabolism to mobilize her fat reserves and set her on the road to paradise or at least size twelve all in all it was difficult to see a downside eyes wide open now mina found herself staring at lucys neck looking for telltale holes lucy smiled that stuff about fangs is just hammer horror lucy said its more sucking than biting actually it doesnt even leave a lovebite because there are no leftovers youll feel a slight numbness for a day or two and your complexion might be a trifle pale but youll feel a lot better in yourself mina belatedly thought of a potential downside will i turn into a vampire too she asked surprised at the lack of faintness in her own voice no silly lucy replied i told you theyre just another human species you cant turn into one of them any more than they can turn into wolves or bats its symbiosis they obtain sustenance from us we get fitness and an amazing sense of wellbeing in return mutual profitthe ultimate expression of freemarket economics at its finest theres no rush you can have all the time you need to think about it all we ask is a little discretion discretion mina echoed with a confidence she had never felt before to hell with discretion lets get on with it in the next two hours mina discovered why the after dark clubs card depicted two dancing figures the movement was internal and emotional and there were three people involved rather than two but it was rhythmic as well as hectic measured as well as erotic marcian and szandor never touched her below the waist but that didnt matter mina understood well enough by the time she went to catch the night bus back to ealing why sophisticated people said that the most important sexual organ was the brain she didnt see lucy stanwere before she left presumably that wonderful woman and perfect friend was still engaged in a languorous horizontal tarantella of her own probably with a single partner given that she no longer had the storedup wealth to satisfy two marcian saw her to the door bid her a fond goodnight and made another date with her for the following tuesday the old mina would have asked anxiously whether shed be ready for another session quite so soon but the new mina took it for granted that she could raise her blood to the required pressure with time to spare marcians conversation had been mostly devoted to technical matters and mild warnings so mina felt that he hadnt really warmed to her as yet but szandorwho had been silent apart from a few incomprehensible mumblingshad been free to indulge himself in fond stares and tactile explorations and mina felt that they had already built a delicate rapport although she was besotted with them both she couldnt help feeling a little fonder of szandor they seemed such nice young men so expert in their arcane art that she would have been more than happy to see them again even if the pounds hadnt started to melt away with such awesome rapidity it wasnt until the tuesday when mina plucked up enough nerve to make a feeble joke about dracula that she discovered how old the seemingly young men actually were old vlad marcian said with a delighted chuckle that was a fine compliment to her joke i remember him not one of us of coursejust ahow do you saya groupie thought he might become immortal if we would only teach him the trick poor sap her experience was so ecstatic that it took mina ten minutes to realize that she too was a groupie someone who hung around vampires avidly offering blood twenty more were required to disclose that poor sap wasnt an americanism sap was a vampire colloquialism for homo sapiens marcian referred to his own kind as ultrasthat being a contraction of homo ultrasapiens which loosely translated meant man the extremely wise it wasnt until it was nearly time to go home that it occurred to mina to wonder how old marcian actually was given that he had obviously been around for centuries but it didnt seem polite to ask forthrightly after all hed been polite enough not to ask her age she resolved to make discreet and indirect inquiries on the following sunday for which they made a third date by the time friday night arrived eight days after minas introduction to the joys of vampire victimhood she felt that her life had undergone a fabulous transformation as she said good night to lucy stanwere she gloried in the conspiratorial glance that they exchangeda pleasure in which she had never indulged with any other colleague of either sex during her entire career in public finance at work of course they behaved with strict formality never making the slightest mention of their secret but as they stepped over the threshold each evening they made their silent acknowledgements mina went straight from work to the gym where she went to work first on the rowing machine and then on the cycling machine she sometimes caught other people staring at her but that didnt make her feel selfconscious any more once they would merely have been appalled by her bulk now she was content to assume that they were amazed at her capacity for exercise regenerating the blood she required to feed marcian and szandor was no mere matter of stuffing herself with calories and iron tablets she had to crank up her retuned metabolism rebalancing the energyeconomy of her physical and spiritual being even fake rowing and fake cycling were beginning to give her a sense of furious speed and steadfast endurance that was remarkably satisfyingthough not of course anywhere near as satisfying as lying on the curtained fourposter while marcian and szandor sucked their sustenance from her flesh with such obvious avidity and appreciation on sunday she observed that it must have been hard for vampires living through times of plague famine and religious persecution the black death was bad marcian admitted but the church wasnt too inconvenient bishops grow as fat as members of any other priviligentsia civilization is a fine thing life was harder before there were cities you must have very good memories to recall a time when there wasnt mina suggested delicately ach its more tradition than memory marcian admitted we make up stories to remind ourselves of all the things were bound to forget we all feel nostalgic about the good old days before you saps wiped out the neanderthals but its legendbased nobody really remembers anything much before the fall of troy and its all momentary flashes until the last two hundred years or so the price of living forever i suppose mina said pensively marcian actually raised his head then to look her in the eyeas fondly as szandor but also a trifle darkly nobody lives forever mina he said ultras dont age or suffer from disease but we all die in the end drowned or decapitated burned or blown up every living thing dies in the early hours of that monday morning mina stepped on the scales to find that she had broken fifteenseven for the first time in three years going in the right direction she couldnt expect to continue to shed weight at more than a pound a day for very long of course but even as the rate of loss tailed off she could reasonably expect to be below fourteen stone by the end of april and below twelve by the end of june come halloween she might be the woman of her dreams not an ounce over nine stone and fit as a flea mina had rarely contemplated the future in any frame of mind but abject horror but she found herself wondering now about very serious questions when for instance would she no longer be able to feed two hungry vampires would she have to choose between marcian and szandor or would they settle her fate between themselves and what then would be her longterm prospects how long could a sap continue to feed a single vampire if she made every possible effort to maximize her bloodproduction years decades a whole sap lifetime marcian would have known all the answers but mina felt that she needed a different perspective one friday when she wasnt due at the after dark she asked lucy stanwere if they could meet up for a drink lucy looked her up and down as if trying to decide whether mina had lost sufficient weight to be fit company in a sapfilled winebar but eventually nodded lets have dinner she said do you know the arlequino andante in marylebone high street its late to make a booking but theyll let me in if i ring mina didnt know the restaurant but she promised to find it and meet lucy there at eight ive been meaning to have an indepth chat to find out how you were getting along lucy said when theyd ordered but you know how it is its obviously working happy never been happier mina agreed its just that ive been wondering about a few things and i dont like to trouble marcian with too much chat while hesdrinking oh marcy wouldnt mind hes a real chatterbox by comparison with my otto what is it the notgoingoutindaylight business that too mina agreed although it had not been among the items praying on her mind they dont catch fire and shrivel up or anything hammery like that lucy told her its just a matter of ingrained habit evolution shaped them as nocturnal hunters like most other vampiric speciesbats bedbugs and the like they could give it up if they wanted to but they dont that prompted mina to think of another question if natural selection gave them such long lives she said why did we poor saps get stuck with seventy years why did the chimps get stuck with all that hair and no brains small differences in dna can easily be amplified into big differences of lifestyle weve outstripped chimps because human babies are born at a relatively early stage of development so our brains gain from experience as they grow the older we grow the more benefit we get from that experience so natural selection favors living longerbut we poor saps never got the benefit of the mutation that freed the ultras from the burden of ageing the corollary is that they reproduce very slowlyultra males and females dont mix much and only have sex once or twice a millenniumand theres the nutritional limitation too it has to be human blood you seeno other species will do its almost as if they were our extra selves formed entirely from our spare fleshbut maybe thats a bit too philosophical the parma hams good isnt it nice texture mina found the ham a trifle chewy and it had a tendency to stick to her teeth so it wasnt until she was tucking into her veal marsala that she raised the question of where her new relationship might be headed mediumtermwise didnt marcy tell you lucy asked you only had to ask szandor will take you on eventuallyi hope thats not a disappointing prospect his english is improving i hope hes supposed to be doing nightclasses at the city lit marcy runs the clubhes the fixer for the entire london community hell put you on home visits soon if thats okayjust szandor i suppose although marcy might drop in occasionally he kept tabs on me for a while once hed set me up with otto i love otto good job we no longer live in an era when lifelong spinsters were automatically assumed to be consorting with the devil isnt it yes it is mina agreed when you say lifelong dont worry about that lucy said its not really a matter of living fast dying young and leaving a beautiful corpse what if we do get used up by fifty or fiftyfive well look as good as we possibly can until then and all youll ever have to do to reconcile yourself to it is consider the alternative even the new mina didnt quite have courage enough to ask exactly how old lucy really was although she had concluded that appearances were probably deceptive and that lucys cv might not be honest about such details as date of birth it didnt seem to matter much the crucial datum so far as mina was concerned was her own age which was thirtythree if feeding a vampire meant that she was likely to die at fiftysomething rather than the contemporary female average of seventynine that didnt seem too high a price to pay for twenty years of betterthannormal slenderness anyway who could tell how many years of lifeexpectancy her obesity might have cost her if shed stayed on the boomandbust diet carousel mina did however summon enough courage to ask whether lucy had sap boyfriends as well as otto i had a few when i still wanted to catch up on all the sex i thought id missed out on lucy admitted frankly it didnt take long to realize that i hadnt missed anything at all compared to the real thing youll find that out for yourself i dare say mina did find out for herself indeed everything transpired as lucy had prophesied szandors english improved enough for him to ask her himself whether he might visit her at home once a week to begin with and mina readily agreed marcian dropped in on her too once a month or so more for a chat than a feed on one such occasion in august he mentioned to her that the club had moved but he didnt give her a card with the new address soon after that lucy announced that she was moving on again too having been promoted to a senior position in newcastle mina breezed through the interview panel for lucys job so the farewell party was a double celebration it got so wild by midnight that some jumpedup officeboy from procurement blurted out the office rumor which held that mina and lucy were lesbian lovers far from feeling appalled or insulted mina was delighted that she should be thought so versatile so desirable and so interesting she told szandor about it when he visited her on the following sundaysundays having now become their regular datebut he didnt laugh it wasnt that vampires didnt have a sense of humor just that they found different things amusing anyway mina said the promotion will mean a hike in salary so ill be able to buy a house you could move in if you wanted toit might be more convenient he laughed at that sank you very much he said but it vouldnt be right where do you live now she asked for the first time do you have a job of your ownnight security or something szandors gaze though still fond became troubled i cannot tell you vere i liff he said as for jops ve liff as ve liffed in the old country as communistsreal communists not those soffiet bastards effer since he broke off ever since what mina prompted assuming he was thinking about something that had happened after the collapse of communism in bosnia or chechnya or wherever he had recently come from effer since the stone age he said ven you began to vork in bronzeve vere neffer a part of that the vorld of vork of jopsis not ours mina realized then how little she actually knew about the vampire way of life and how they occupied themselves when they were not feeding she realized too how wide the gulf between the two human species must be if all of history since the end of the stone age had been sap history never recognizing let alone involving the ultras except as myth and shadow mystery and threat and yet the ultras lived in a world that saps had remade an ecosphere that saps had spoiled on the edges of a global civilization organized and driven by sap machines and money mina nearly asked szandor what the communist vampires did for money but realized that she didnt have to they obtained their money as they obtained their blood from their sapient groupiesnot evidently in weekly handouts but at intervals nevertheless adequate to their peculiar needs in all probability they were content to wait until their victims were used up who else after all but her one and only dependent was a groupie likely to appoint as her heir vampires could afford to be patient and had certainly had abundant opportunity to acquire the habit how many victims mina wondered had szandor had before her far more she guessed than she had had hot dinners of her ownthat being at the end of the day exactly what she was it wouldnt be right for him to move in with her she realized for exactly the same reasons that it wouldnt be right for her to move into a battery cage or a veal crate she was no longer the fat cow she had been in spring but she would be a cow for as long as she might live after that reverie there was only one question that she needed to ask szandor she said do you love me do you really love me the ultra paused in his appreciation of the wonderfully appetizing blood that he was sucking from her breast to say yes my darlink i loff you ferry much mina knew that it was true he loved her not as a boychild is obliged to love the mother at whose teat he sucks nor as a farmer is obliged to love his prize cattle nor as saps were obliged by their carefully selected hormones to love one another but freely he loved her in his own unique way as only a vampire could love a member of his sister species who provided the substance of his life in a single miraculous red stream when her lover had gone after kissing her hand as any overpolite european might have done in saying au revoir mina went to the fulllength mirror that she had bought only the previous day and stood naked before it to make a critical study of the skin that sagged loosely about her ten stone two pound frame there was still a way to go but she was getting there the skin would tighten up in time even at thirtythree she still had enough adaptability to continue tightening its grip on her compacted flesh she would never reach perfection but every day in every way she was getting better and betterand how many hardworking saps could honestly say thatexcept for all the others who were secretly in bed with the real reds all in all she told herself more in selfcongratulation than in a spirit of selfdiscipline its quite impossible to see a downside much at stake by kevin j anderson bestselling author kevin j anderson has written nearly novels many of them cowritten with doug beason with his wife rebecca moesta or with brian herbert with whom he continues frank herberts dune saga his most recent original projects are the saga of seven suns series which concluded with last years the ashes of worlds and his nautical fantasy epic terra incognita the first of which the edge of the world came out in june a batmansuperman tiein novel was also released earlier this year and a new dune novel the winds of dune is due in august anderson says that one of the appeals of vampire fiction is that the mythos has grown so rich and varied over the past century or so it gives writers plenty of room to operate with their imaginations my story takes place on the periphery of actual vampire fictionmore a story about vampires than a story with vampires he said much at stake is a different sort of dracula story its protagonist is famed actor bela lugosi the star of the original dracula film and explores some of his personal background as well as the history behind vampire legends bela lugosi stepped off the movie set listening to his shoes thump on the papiermâché flagstones of castle dracula he swept his cape behind him practicing the liquid spectral movement that always evoked shrieks from his live audiences the films director tod browning had called an end to shooting for the day after yet another bitter argument with karl freund the cinematographer the egos of both director and cameraman made for frequent clashes during the intense seven weeks that universal had allotted for the filming of dracula they seemed to forget that lugosi was the star and he could bring fear to the screen no matter what camera angles karl freund used with all the klieg lights shut down the enormous set for castle dracula loomed dark and imposing universal studios had never been known for its lavish productions but they had outdone themselves here propmen had found exotic old furniture around hollywood and masons built a spooky fireplace big enough for a man to stand in one of the most creative technicians had spun an eighteenfoot rubbercement spiderweb from a rotary gun it now dangled like a net in the dim light of the closeddown set on aching legs lugosi walked toward his private dressing room he never spoke much to the others not his costars not the director not the technicians he had too much difficulty with his english to enjoy chitchat and he had too many troubling thoughts on his mind to seek out company even during his years of portraying dracula in the stage play he had never socialized with the others perhaps they were afraid of him seeing what a frightening monster he could become in his role after sellout performances on broadway then years on the road with the show he had sequestered himself each time maintaining the intensity he had built up as dracula the prince of evil drawing on the pain in his own life the fear he had seen with his own eyes he projected that fear to the audiences the men would shiver the women would cry out and faint and then write him thrilling and suggestive letters lugosi embodied fear and danger for them and he reveled in it now he would do the same on the big screen he closed the door of the dressing room all of the others would be going home or to the studio cafeteria or to a bar only dwight frye remained late some nights practicing his renfield insanity lugosi thought about going home himself where his third wife would be waiting for him but the pain in his legs felt like rusty nails twisting beneath his kneecaps reminding him of the old injury the one that had taught him fear he sat down on the folding wooden chairuniversal provided nothing better for the actors not even for the films starbut lugosi turned from the mirror and the lights somehow he couldnt bear to look at himself every time he did this he reached to the back of his personal makeup drawer fumbling with clumsy fingers until he found the secret hypodermic needle and his vial of morphine taped out of sight the filming of dracula had been long and hard and he had needed the drug nearly every night he would have to acquire more soon outside on the set echoing through the thin walls of his dressing room lugosi could hear dwight frye practicing his renfield cackle frye thought his portrayal of the madman would make him a star in front of the american audiences but though they screamed and shivered none of them understood anything about fear lugosi had found that he could mumble his lines wiggle his fingers and leer once or twice and the audiences still trembled they enjoyed it it was so easy to frighten them before universal decided to film dracula the script readers had been very negative crying that the censors would never pass the movie that it was too frightening too horrifying this story certainly passes beyond the point of what the average person can stand or cares to stand one had written as if they knew anything about fear he stared at the needle sharp and silver with a flare of yellow reflected from the makeup lightsand van helsing thought a wooden stake would be lugosis bane he filled the syringe with morphine his legs tingled trembled aching for the relief the drug would give him it always did like count dracula consuming fresh blood lugosi pushed the needle into his skin finding the artery homing in on the silver point of pain and release he closed his eyes in the darkness behind his thoughts he saw himself as a young lieutenant in the rd royal hungarian infantry fighting in the trenches in the carpathian mountains during the great war lugosi had been a young man frightened hiding from the bullets but risking his life for his homelandhe had called himself bela blasko then from the hungarian town of lugos the bullets sang around him in the air mixed with the explosions the screams the air smelled thick with blood and sweat and terror the mountain peaks backlit at night by orange explosions looked like the castle spires of some ancient hungarian fortress more frightening by far than the crumbling stones and cobwebs the set builders had erected on the studio lot then the enemy bullets had crashed into his thigh his knee shattering bone sending blood spraying into the darkness he had screamed and fallen thinking himself dead the enemy soldiers approached ready to kill him but one of his comrades had dragged him away during the retreat young lugosi had awakened from his long warm slumber in the army hospital the nurses there gave him morphine day after day long after the doctors required itone of the nurses had recognized him from the hungarian stage his portrayal of jesus christ in the passion play she had given lugosi all the morphine he wanted and outside in a haze of sparkling painlessness the great war had continued now he winced in the dressing room snapping his eyes open and waiting for the effects of the drug to slide into his mind through the thin walls of the dressing room he could hear dwight frye doing renfield again heh hee hee hee heeeee lugosis mind grew muddy flares of color appeared at the edges when the rush from the morphine kicked in the pleasure detached his mind from the chains of his body a liquid chill ran down his spine and he felt suddenly cold the makeup lights in his dressing room winked out plunging him into claustrophobic darkness he drew a sharp breath that echoed in his head outside dwight fryes laugh changed into the sound of distant agonized screams blinking and disoriented he tried to comprehend exactly what had altered around him as if walking through gelatin lugosi shuffled toward the dressing room door and opened it the morphine made fright and uneasiness drift away from him he experienced only a melting curiosity to know what had happened and in his mind he questioned nothing his dracula costume felt alive on him as if it had become more than just an outfit the set for castle dracula appeared even more elaborate now more solid dirtier and he saw no end to it no border where the illusion stopped and the cameras set up where karl freund and tod browning would argue over the best way to photograph the action no booms no klieg lights no catwalks the fire in the enormous hearth had burned low showing only orange embers sharp smoke drifted into the greatroom he smelled old feasts dampness and mildew in the corners the leavings of animals in the scattered straw on the floor torches burned in iron holders on the wall the cold air raised goosebumps on his morphinenumbed flesh the moans and screams continued from outside moving with a careful driven gait lugosi climbed the wide stone staircase much like the one on which he met renfield in the film his shoes made clicking sounds on the flagstones solid stones now not mere papiermâché he listened to the screams he followed them he knew he was no longer in hollywood reaching the upper level lugosi trailed a cold draft to an open balcony that looked down onto a nightshrouded hillside stars shone through wisps of high clouds in an otherwise clear sky four bonfires raged near clusters of soldiers and drab tents erected at the base of the knoll though the stench of rotting flesh reached him at once it took lugosis eyes a moment to adjust from the brightness of the fires to see the figures spread out on the slope at first he thought it was a vineyard with hundreds of stakes arranged in rows radiating from concentric circles of other stakes but one of the vines moved a flailing arm and the chorus of the moans increased suddenly like a camera coming into focus lugosi recognized that the stakes contained human forms impaled on the sharp points some of the points were smeared with blood that looked oily black in the darkness other stakes still shone wicked and white as if they had been trimmed once again after the victims had been thrust down upon them lugosi gasped and even the morphine could not numb him to this many of the human shapes stirred waving their arms clutching the wounds where the stakes protruded through their bodies they had not been allowed to die quickly dim winged shapes fluttered about the bodiesvultures feasting even at night so gorged they could barely fly ignoring the soldiers by the tents and bonfires ignoring the fact that many of the victims were not even dead ravens nearly invisible in the blackness walked along the bloodstained ground pecking at dangling limbs a group of the soldiers broke out in laughter from some game they played lugosi squeezed his eyes shut and shivered revulsion confusion and fear warred within his mind this must all be some illusion a twisted nightmare the morphine had never affected him like this before some of the victims had been skewered head down others sideways others feet down the stakes rose to various heights high and low as if in a morbid caste system of death a rushing wail of pain swept along the garden of bloody stakes sounding like a choir from the corridor behind lugosi a quiet voice murmured listen to themlike children of the night do you enjoy the music they make lugosi whirled and stumbled slumping against the stone wall the numbness seemed to put his legs at a greater distance from his body behind him stood a man with huge black eyes that reflected tears in the torchlight his face appeared beautiful yet seemed to hide a deep agony like a doe staring into a broken mirror rich brown locks hung curling to his shoulders he wore a purple embroidered robe lined with spotted fur some of the spots were long smears of brown like dried spots of blood wiped from wet blades his full lips trembled below a long dark mustache what is this place lugosi croaked then realized that he had answered automatically in the strangers own tongue a language as familiar to lugosi as his childhood as most of his life you are speaking hungarian the stranger widened his eyes in indignation outside the chorus of moans grew louder then quiet like the swell of the wind i speak hungarian now that i am no longer a prisoner of the turks we will obliterate their scourge i will strike such fear in their hearts that the sultan himself will run cowering back to constantinople one of the vultures swooped close to the open balcony and then flew back toward its feeding ground startled lugosi turned around then back to face the stranger who had frightened him who are you he asked the hungarian words fit so naturally in his mouth again lugosi had forced his native language aside to learn english phonetically at first delivering his lines with power and menace to american audiences though he could not understand a word of what he was saying understanding came much later the haunted stranger took a hesitant step toward lugosi i am vlad dracula i bid you welcome i have waited for you a long time lugosi lurched back and held his hand up in a warding gesture as if reenacting the scene when van helsing shows him a box containing wolfsbane from childhood lugosi had heard horrible stories of vlad the impaler the real dracula rumored to be a vampire himself known to be a bloodthirsty butcher who had slaughtered hundreds of thousands of turksand as many of his own people in the torchlit shadows vlad dracula paid no attention to lugosis reaction he walked up beside him and stood on the balcony curling his hands on the stone halfwall gaudy rings adorned each of his fingers i knew you would come dracula said i have been smoking the opium pipe a trick i learned during my decade of turkish captivity the drug makes my soul rest easier it makes me open for peace and eases the pain i thought at such a time you might be more likely to appear vlad dracula turned and locked eyes with bela lugosi the dark piercing stare seemed more powerful more menacing than anything lugosi had mimed in hundreds of performances as the vampire he could not shirk away he knew now how the mina character must feel when he said look into my eyes what do you want from me lugosi whispered vlad dracula did not try to touch him but turned away speaking toward the countless victims writhing below absolution he said absolution lugosi cried for this who do you think i am how are you called dracula asked lugosi disoriented yet accustomed to having his name impress guests answered bela lugosno i am bela blasko of the town of lugos he drew himself up trying to feel imposing in his own dracula costume but the enormity of vlad the impalers presence seemed to dwarf any imaginary impressiveness lugosi could command vlad dracula appeared troubled bela blaskothat is an odd name for an angel are you perhaps one of my fallen countrymen an angel lugosi blinked i am no angel i cannot grant you forgiveness i do not even believe in god he wished the morphine would wear off this was growing too strange for him but as he held his hand on the cold stone of the balcony it felt real to him too real the sharp stakes below would be just as solid and just as sharp he looked down at the ranks of tortured people covering the hillside and he knew from the legends about the impaler that this was but a tiny fraction of all the atrocities vlad dracula had already done even if i could i would not grant you absolution for all of this vlad draculas eyes became wide but he shrank away from lugosi but i have built monasteries and churches restored shrines and made offerings i have surrounded myself with priests and abbots and bishops and confessors i have done everything i know how he gazed at the bloodied stakes but seemed not to see them you killed all these people and many many more what do you expect lugosi felt the fear grow in him again real fear as he had experienced that wartorn night in the carpathian mountains what would vlad dracula do to him some of those victims below were lugosis own countrymenthe simple peasants and farmers the bakers and bankers craftsmenjust like those lugosi had fought with in the great war just like those who had rescued him after he had been shot in the legs who had dragged him off to safety where the nurses tended him gave him morphine vlad dracula had killed them all there are far worse things awaiting man than death the impaler said i did all this for god and for my country lugosi felt the words catch in his throat for his country his own mind felt like a puzzle with large pieces of memory breaking loose and fitting together in new ways lugosi himself had done things for his country for hungary that others had called atrocities back in he had embraced communism and the revolution proudly he had bragged about his short apprenticeship as a locksmith then had formed a union of theater workers fighting and propagandizing for the revolution that thrust bela kun into power but kuns dictatorship lasted only a few months during which romania attacked the weakened country and kun was ousted by the counterrevolution all supporters of bela kun were hunted down and thrown into prison or executed lugosi had fled for his life to vienna with his first wife and from there penniless he had traveled to berlin seeking acting jobs lugosi had scorned his fainthearted american audiences because they proved too weak to withstand anything but safe insignificant frightsyet now he didnt believe he could stomach what he saw of the impaler but vlad dracula thought he was doing this for his people to free wallachia and the towns that would become great hungarian cities i fight the turks and use their own atrocities against them they have taught me all this vlad dracula wrung his hands then snatched a torch free from its holder on the wall he pushed it toward lugosi letting the fire crackle lugosi flinched but he felt none of the heat it seemed important for dracula to speak to lugosi to justify everything can you not hear me i care not if you are not the angel i expected you have come to me for a reason the turks held me hostage from the time i was a boy to save his own life my father dracul the dragon willingly delivered me to the sultan along with my youngest brother radu radu turned traitor became a turk in his heart he grew fat from harem women and rich banquets and too much opium my father then went about attacking the sultans forces knowing that his own sons were bound to be executed for it vlad dracula held his hands over the torch flame the heat licked his fingers but he seemed not to notice day after day the sultan promised to cut me into small pieces he promised to have horses pull my legs apart while he inserted a dull stake through my body the long way several times he even went so far as to tie me to the horses just to frighten me day after day bela of lugos he lowered his voice yes the turks taught me much about the extremes one can do to an enemy vlad dracula hurled the torch out the window lugosi watched it whirl and blaze as it dropped through the air to the ground rolled then came to rest against a rock without the torch the balcony alcove seemed smothered with shadows lit only by the starlight and distant fires from the slaughter on the hillside after i escaped i learned that my father and my brother mircea had been ambushed and murdered by john hunyadi a hungarian who should have shared their loyalty hunyadi captured my father and brother so he could gain lordship over the principalities my father controlled he struck my father with seventythree sword strokes before he dealt the mortal blow he claimed that he had tortured my brother mircea to death and buried him in the public burial grounds dracula shook his head and lugosi saw real tears hovering there mircea had fought beside john hunyadi for three years and had saved his life a dozen times when i was but a boy mircea taught me how to fish and ride a horse he showed me the constellations in the stars that the greeks had taught him dracula scraped one of his rings down the stone wall leaving a white mark when i became prince again i ordered his coffin to be opened so that i could give him a proper burial with priests and candles and hymns we found his head twisted around his hands had scraped long gouges on the top of his coffin john hunyadi had buried him alive vlad dracula glanced behind him as if to make certain no one else wandered the castle halls so late at night and then he allowed himself to sob he mumbled his brothers name just a few months ago in my castle on the arges river in transylvania the turks laid siege to me and fired upon the battlements with their cherrywood cannons one turkish slave forewarned me and i was able to escape by picking my way along the ice and snow of a terrible pass my own son fell off his horse during the flight and i have never seen him again my wife could not come with us and so rather than being captured by the turks she climbed the stairs of our tallest tower overlooking the sheer gorge and she cast herself out of the window she was my wife bela of lugos do you know what it is like to lose a wife like that lugosi felt cold from the breeze licking over the edge of the balcony not like that but i can understand the loss in exile from hungary back in lugosi had left his wife ilona in vienna while he tried to find work in berlin in german cinema or on the stage he had written to her every other day but she had never replied he learned later that her father the executive secretary of a budapest bank had convinced her to divorce him to flee back to hungary and to avoid her husband at all costs because of the awful things he had done against his own country draculas wife had chosen a different way out outside lugosi heard distant shouts and the jingling of horses approaching at a gallop he saw the soldiers break away from their tents scattering the bonfires and snatching up their weapons the impaler seemed not to notice i do not know who you are or why you have come vlad dracula said i prayed for an angel a voice who could remove these demons of guilt from within me he snatched out at lugosis vampire costume but his hand passed directly through the actors chest lugosi shrank back feeling the icy claw of a spectral hand sweep through his heart vlad dracula widened his enormous dark eyes with superstitious terror you truly must be a spirit come to torment me since you refuse to grant me absolution lugosi did not know how to answer he delivered his answer with a stuttering uncertain cadence i i am neither of those things i am only a traveler a dream to you perhaps from a time and place far from here i have not lived my life yet i will be born many centuries from now you come not to judge me then or punish me vlad dracula looked truly terrified he looked down at the hand that had passed through lugosis body no i am just an actoran entertainer i perform for other people i try to make them afraid he shook his head but i was wrong what i do has no bearing on real fear the acting i do the frights i give to my audience are a sham that fear has no consequences he leaned out over the balcony then squeezed his eyes shut at the scores of maimed corpses and those victims not fortunate enough to have died yet seeing this convinces me i know nothing about real fear in the courtyard directly below shouting erupted marching men hurried out into the night someone blasted a horn lugosi heard the sounds of a fight swords clashing vlad dracula glanced at it dismissed the commotion for a moment then locked his hypnotic gaze with lugosis again the anguish behind the impalers eyes made lugosi want to squirm that is all i have prayed repeatedly for an apparition and you claim to have learned something from me about fear all is lost i have been abandoned god is making a joke with me his shoulders hunched into the furlined robe and he reddened with anger lugosi had the crawling feeling that if he had been corporeal to the impaler vlad dracula would have thrust him upon a vacant stake on the hillside i do not know what to tell you vlad dracula i am not your conscience i have destroyed enough things in my own life by trying to do what i thought was right and best but i can tell you what i think vlad dracula cocked an eyebrow below a clattering sound signaled a portcullis opening booted feet charged across the flagstone floor as someone hurried into the receiving hall my lord prince lugosi spoke rapidly the turks have taught you well as your atrocities show but you have perhaps gone too far you cannot undo the things you have already done the thousands already slain but you can change how you act from now on your brutal bloodthirsty reputation is already wellearned mothers will frighten their children with stories of vlad the impaler for five hundred years now perhaps you have built enough terror that you no longer need the slaughter the mere mention of your name and the terror it evokes may be enough to accomplish your aims to save hungary from the turks if this is how you must be try to govern with fear not with death then your god may give your conscience some rest vlad dracula made a puzzled frown perhaps we are together because i needed to learn something about fear as well the impaler laughed with a sound like breaking glass for one who has not lived even a single lifetime you are a wise man bela of lugos they both turned at the sound of a running man hurrying up the stone steps to the upper level where lugosi and vlad dracula stood side by side the messenger scraped his sword against the stone wall clattering he swept his cloak back looking from side to side until he spotted dracula in the shadowy alcove sweat and blood smeared his face my lord prince you did not respond the man cried a crimson badge on his shoulder identified him as a retainer from one of the boyars serving vlad dracula i have been in conversation with an important representative dracula said nodding to lugosi surprised but falling back on his training lugosi sketched a formal bow to the messenger but the retainer looked toward where lugosi stood blinked and frowned i see nothing my lord prince in a rage vlad dracula snatched out a dagger from his furlined robe the messenger blanched and stumbled backward warding off the death from the knife but also showing a kind of sick relief that his end would be quick not moaning and bleeding for days on a stake as the vultures circled about dracula lugosi snapped bringing to bear all the power and command he had used during his very best performances as the vampire vlad dracula stopped holding the knife poised for its strike the retainer trembled staring with wide blank eyes but afraid to flee look at how terrified you have made this man the fear you create is a powerful thing you need not kill him to accomplish your purpose vlad dracula heard lugosi but kept staring at the retainer making his eyes blaze brighter his leer more vicious the retainer began to sob i need not explain my actions to you he said to the man your soul is mine to crush whenever i wish now tell me your news the sultans army has arrived it appears to be but a small vanguard attacking under cover of darkness but the remaining turks will be here by tomorrow we can stand strong against this vanguardmany of them have already fled upon seeing their comrades impaled on this hillside my lord prince they will report back it will enrage the sultans army vlad dracula pinched his full lips between his fingers he looked at lugosi who stood watching and waiting the messenger seemed confused at what the impaler thought he saw or it will strike fear into the sultans army we can use this go out to the victims on the stakes cut off the heads of those dead or mortally woundedand be quick about itand catapult the heads into the turkish vanguard they will see the faces of their comrades and know that this will happen to them if they fight me find those whose injuries may still allow them to live and set them free of the stakes send them back to the sultan to tell how monstrous i am then he will think twice about his aggression against me and against my land the retainer blinked in astonishment still trembling from having his life returned to him curious about these new tactics vlad dracula was attempting yes my lord prince he scrambled backward and ran to the stone steps lugosi felt the walls around him growing softer shimmering his knees felt watery his body felt empty the morphine was wearing off dracula tugged at his dark mustache this is interesting the sultan will think it just as horrible but god will know how merciful i have been perhaps next time i smoke the opium pipe he will send me a true angel lugosi stumbled feeling sick and dizzy warm flecks of light roared through his head dracula seemed to loom larger and stronger i cannot see you as clearly my friend you grow dim and i can barely feel the effects of the opium pipe our time together is at an end now that we have learned what we have learned it would be best for you to return to your own country but i must dress for battle if we are to fight the sultans vanguard i want them to see exactly who has brought them such fear farewell bela of lugos i will try to do as you suggest lugosi tried to shake the thickening cobwebs from his eyes farewell vlad dracula he said raising his hand it passed through the solid stone of the balcony wall the lights flickered around his makeup mirror dazzling his eyes lugosi drew in a deep breath and stared around his tiny dressing room a shiver ran through him and he pulled the black cape close around him seeking some warmth outside dwight frye attempted his long renfield laugh one more time but sneezed at the end fryes dressing room door opened and lugosi heard him walking away across the set on the small table in front of him lugosi saw the empty hypodermic needle and the remaining vial of morphine fear the silver point looked like a tiny stake to impale himself on morphine had always given him solace a warm and comfortable feeling that made him forget pain forget trouble forget his fears but he had used it too much now it transported him to a place where he could see only the thousands of bloodied stakes and moaning victims vultures circling ravens pecking at living flesh and the mad tormented eyes of vlad the impaler he did not want to think where the morphine might take him nextthe night in the carpathians during the great war or his secret flight across the hungarian border after the overthrow of bela kun knowing that his life was forfeit if he stopped or just the pain of learning that ilona had abandoned him while he worked in berlin the possibilities filled him with fearnot the fear without consequences that sent shivers through his audiences but a real fear that would put his sanity at risk he had brought the fear upon himself cultivated it by his own actions bela lugosi dropped the syringe and the small vial of morphine onto the hard floor of his dressing room slowly with great care he ground them both to shards under the heel of his count dracula shoes his legs ached again from the old injury but it made him feel solid and alive the pain wasnt so bad that he needed to hide from it what he found in his druginduced hiding place might be worse than the pain itself lugosi opened his dressing room and saw dwight frye just leaving through the large doors he called out for the other actor to wait remembering to use english again though the foreign tongue seemed cumbersome to him mr frye would you care to join me for a bit of dinner i know it is late but i would enjoy your company frye stopped and his eyes widened to show how startled he was for a moment he looked like the madman renfield again but when he chuckled the laugh carried delight not feigned insanity yes i would sure like that mr lugosi its good to see youre not going to keep to yourself again the rest of us dont bite you know nothing to be afraid of lugosi smiled sardonically and stepped toward him the pain in his legs faded into the background youre right mr frye there is nothing to fear house of the rising sun by elizabeth bear elizabeth bears recent books include all the windwracked stars and

strange echoes of his fame to say more than that might give too much away but lets just say that as a result of writing this story bear knows a lot more about the history of blues gospel and rock and roll than she used to sycorax smiled at me through the mantilla shadowing her eyes eyes untouched by that smile she lolled against a wroughtiron railing one narrow hip thrust out dyed red hair tumbling out of the black spiderweb of her shawl looking like a mac rebennack song come to life the dead quickly grow thin she licked her lips with a long pale tongue and even the semblance of amusement fell away youre pale tribute no coup tonight nothing appealed tribute wasnt my real name any more than sycorax was hers she leaned into me pressed a hand to my throat her flesh lay like ice against the chill of my skin i told you to hunt i hunted backing away red nails trailing down my chest i hunted hunted and returned emptyhanded its as much how you hear the orders as how theyre given she followed close on my steps driving me before her ragged black chiffon clung and drifted around her calves she reached up to lace china fingers in the fine hairs at the nape of my neck her face against my throat was waxen too long unfed you weaken me on purpose tribute give me what you have she needed me needed me to feed old as she was she had to have the blood more often and she couldnt take it straight from a human anymore she needed someone like me to purge the little taints and poisons from it firstand even then i had to be careful what i brought home so sensitive the old she caught at my collar pulled it open with fumbling hands i leaned down to herchattel blood of her blood no more able to resist her will than her own right hand commanded to protect and feed her at least this time i knew what sort of predator i served although i had less choice about it i figured things out too late again sycorax curled cold lips back from fangs like a row of perfect icicles sank her teeth into my flaccid vein and tried to drink all that pain and desire spiked through meevery time like the first timeand on its heels a hollowness sycorax hissed drew back she turned her head and spat transparent fluid on the cobbles i smiled as she turned on me spreading my hands like jesus on a hilltop still backing slowly away i had made very sure that i had nothing to feed her on petty i know and shed make me pay for it before dawn down the narrow lane a clubs red door swung open and i turned with a predators eye attracted to the movement spill of light cut like a slice of cake booted feet crunching on glittering glass girls laughing young drunk i remembered what that felt like i raked a hand through my forelock and looked away making the mistake of catching sycoraxs chinablue eye those she said jerking her chin i shook my head too easy baby let me get you something more challenging i used to have an accentdownhome mississippi faded by the years just like everything else i suspected i sounded paneuropean now like sycorax ive put some effort into changing my speech patterns her lips painted pale to match chinawhite skin curled into a sulk tribute after a quarter of a century you ought to know i mean what i say i tugged my collar glancing down them sycorax twisted a stilettoheeled boot crushing the litter of cracked glass against the bricks she enjoyed the hunt a little too much but who but a madwoman would have drained my living body and made me hers just fetching my corpse from the grave would have taken insane effort im hungry she complained while i sharpened my teeth on my lip to stop a malicious smile if i could buy a little time the girls might make it to the street and i could lose them in the crowds and tangled shadows of the gaslamp district footsteps receded down the alley i spread my hands in protest cocking my head to one side and giving her the little halfsmile that used to work so well on my wife something with a little more fight in it sweetie my wife was a hell of a lot younger than sycorax those two girls bring me their blood tribute thats an order and that was the end of the argument i turned to obey tribute coming back around slowly her gazecatching mineflat and pale sycorax i could just spike your pretty eyes out on my pinkie finger and eat them lovely boy she purred hazel arent they blue she shrugged and made an irritated dismissive gesture hands white as wax its so hard to tell in the dark the girls made it to the street before sycorax ended the discussion but i had to follow them anyway i paced my ordained prey staying to the shadows the collar of the black leather trenchcoat that sycorax had picked out for me tugged up to halfhide the outline of my jaw i never would have bought that coat for myself youd think anybody whod been dead for any time at all would have had enough of blackness and shadows thank you very much sycorax reveled in it if she were three hundred years younger shed have been a gothchick it was a good night nobody turned for a second look people are always dying and human memory is short in a hundred years i shall probably be able to walk down any street in the world without raising an eyebrow as long as the sun is down sycorax didnt bother to follow i had no choice but to do as i was bid its more than a rule its a fact i expected there were still a few women i knew who would get a kick out of that my girls staggered somewhat weaving one was a blonde brittle dyed hair and a red beret the other one had glossy chestnut brown waves and the profile of a little girl i tracked them through the district toward the ocean neon glow and littered sidewalks a door would open and music would issue forth and it wasnt long before i found myself mouthing the words to one particular song theres something gloriously ironic in a man charting a numberone hit twentyfive years after hes dead otis redding eat your heart out my quarry paused at an openair patio where a live band played the blues girl singer open coat and a spill of curls like wicked midnight performing old standards the kind ive always loved mama tell my baby sister not to do what i have done ill spend my life in sin and misery in the house of the rising sun a song that was already venerable when eric burdon made it famous theres all kinds of whoredom arent there and all kinds of bloodsuckers too the singer nailed amazing grace a capella like heartbreak voice sharp and gritty as little mary johnson doing cold cold heart i caught myself singing along and slashed my tongue with needle teeth before someone could overhear still no blood i hadnt fed in a long time and it hurt more than it should have the girls sat down at a table and ordered food i smelled beer hot wings eyewatering garlic i suddenly very badly wanted a peanut butter sandwich and a milkshake leaning against the high black iron fence i watched the girls watching the band until a passerby in her fifties turned to get a startled better look at me i stood up straight and met her gaze directly giving her the crooked littlekid smile it almost always works except on sycorax trying to hide your face only convinces them theyve seen something sorry she said waving me away with a smile a moment later she turned back you know you look like people say i answered pitching my voice high amazing she nodded cheerfully gave me a wide wondering grin and continued on her way i watched her go chattering with her friends shaking their heads the girls didnt stay for king of the road although i would have liked to hear the version kids i almost turned away when they walked past they stank of garlicstuffed mushrooms and beer the reek of the herb knotted my stomach and seared my eyes i actually tried to take a halfstep away before the compulsion sycorax had laid on me locked my knees and forced me back into pursuit they walked arm in arm skinny twentyyearolds with fake ids and black vinyl miniskirts cheap boots too much eyeliner the one with the brown hair broke my heart every time she tossed her head just that way i let myself drift ahead of them taking a gamble on where they would cut across the residential neighborhood near the ocean a dangerous place for girls to be i ducked down a side street to cut them off and waited in the dark of an unlit doorway sycoraxs control permitted that much i leaned against the wall scrubbing my face against my hands it felt like a waxen mask cold and stiff my hands werent much better they werent long i was unlucky they picked the better of the two routes through the brownstones the one i had been able to justify choosing and just that innocently chose their fate the scent of bougainvillea and jacaranda filled the spaces of the night i watched them skipping from streetlight to streetlight shadows stretched out behind them catching up and then reaching before the brownhaired one walked a few steps ahead of the bleachblonde humming to herself i couldnt help it it wasnt one of my standards but every blues singer born knows the words to that one hell i used to have a horse by that name i picked up the tune i had to they call the rising sun its been the ruin of many a poor boy and me o god im one their heads snapped up twenty maybe i was dead before they were born gratifying that they recognized my voice fellas dont believe what a bad woman tells youthough her eyes be blue or brown i strolled out of the shadows ducking my head and smiling letting the words trail away the darkhaired girl did a double take she had a lovely nose pert and turned up the blonde blinked a couple of times but i dont think she made the connection id changed my appearance some and id lost a lot of weight the stench of garlic on their breath would have thickened my blood in my veins if i had any left i swallowed hard remembering all those songs about wandering ghosts and unquiet graves ghosts that all seem to want the same thing revenge and to lay down and rest i smiled wider what the lady wants the lady gets oh wow the darker girl said do you have any idea how much you look like the street was empty dark and deserted i came up under the streetlight close enough to reach out and touch the tip of that nose if i wanted i dropped them a look that used to melt hearts sidelong glance under lowered lashes people say i answered and sick to my stomach i broke their necks before i fed it was the least i could do poison roiled in my belly when i laid them out gently in the light of that streetlamp in the rich dark covering the waterfront close enough to smell the sea i straightened their spines so they wouldnt look so terrible for whoever found them but at least they wouldnt be coming back it was happening already my limbs jerked and shook my flesh crawled with ripples like fire my tongue numb as a drunks im going back to new orleans to wear that ball and chain not this time struggling to smooth each step to hide the venom flooding my veins i hurried back to my poor hungry mistress i stole the brunettes wallet i stopped and bought breath mints at the allnight grocery i beat sycorax home a standup dame by lilith saintcrow lilith saintcrows most recent books are hunters prayer the latest in her jill kismet series and strange angels as by lili st crow the first in a new series for young adults the third jill kismet book is due out around the same time as this anthology her other work includes the dante valentine series as well as several other novels saintcrow says each generation invents and reinvents different variations on the vampire theme blood sex love death repression liberation from the confines of civilization or meditation upon the link between eros and thanatosvampires are tremendously versatile she said they endure because we can and do remake them with every generation to bram stokers readers vampires were about disturbing untrammeled female sexuality discomfort with modernity and the excesses of colonization since then theyve gone through several incarnations as filthy corpses investment bankers androgynous sexy avatars you name it the strength of the vampire is her ability to shapeshift for each new set of popular neuroses this story is an homage to the noir gumshoe greatshammett and chandler i was working on a very dark ugly book and needed something shorter and a little more hopeful saintcrow said not too hopeful though noir isnt very hopeful when a man wakes up in his own grave he sometimes reconsiders his choice of jobs if hes smart that is me im dumb as a box of rocks and my skull felt like a cannonade was going off inside the agony in my head was rivaled only by the thirst aching thirst in every nerve and vein my throat scorched and my eyes hot marbles it was raining but the water from the sky falling into my open mouth did nothing for the dry nails twisting in my larynx i struggled up out of clods of rainchurned clay mud slick and dirty as a newborn pig my clothes were ruined and the monster in my head roared i fell backward still trapped to my knees in wet earth padded hammers of rain smashing along the length of my body and screamed the spasm passed leaving only the parched desert plains inside every inch of me a few moments of effort got me kicking free the last of the wet clay collapsing in a bodyshaped hole now that the body was above ground i opened my mouth rain beating my dirty face and got only a mouthful of muck coughing gagging i made it to hands and knees my head was a swollen pumpkin balanced on a thin aching stick and the headache receded between waves of scorching unbearable agonizing thirst there were pines all around me singing and sighing as the sodden wind slapped them around it took me two tries to stand up and another two tries before i remembered my name jack jack becker thats me thats who i am and ive got to find the dame in the green dress outside the city limits and im a duck out of water the mud wouldnt dry not in this downpour it just kept smearing over the ruin of my shirt and suit pants even chin yuns laundry wouldnt be able to get it out of the worsted slogging and slipping i made it down a hill the size of the chrysler building and found the dirt road turned off the highway and there was a mile marker right there twelve miles to the city cramps screamed from my empty belly maybe getting shot in the head works up a mans appetite every time i reached up to touch my noggin it was tender a puckered hole above my right eye full of even more mud i wasnt going to get far the idea of stumbling off the side of the road and drowning in a ditch was appealingexcept for the dame in the green dress think about that jack one thing at a time thunder rumbled somewhere far away miss dale would be at home probably talking to her cat or making a nice hot cup of tea the thought made my insides clench like they were going to turn into a meat grinder and my breath made a funny whistling sound through my open mouth my nose was plugged and in any case i was gasping for air sometimes it rains hard enough to drown you out here that was when i saw the light it was beautiful it was golden it was a diner not just any diner but the dentons dandy diner eleven miles from the city limits i couldnt go in there looking like this it took me a while to fumble for my wallet and i nearly ended up in the ditch anyway my feet tangling together the walletlast years christmas present from miss dalewas still in my pocket and held all the usuals plus nineteen dollars and twenty cents they hadnt taken any money interesting think about that later jack my shirt was wet enough to shed the mud my suit jacket nowhere in evidence stinging pellets warned me the rain was turning to ice but the crazy thing was i wasnt cold just thirsty as hell maybe the idea of the dame in green was warming me up neon blinked in the diners windows it was closed goddammit and just when i could have used a phone i could even see the phone box smearing my muddy mitts on the window and blinking every time the cold drinks sign blinked as well the phone was at the end of the hall right near the crapper my legs nearly gave out this is turning out to be a bad night jackie boy i found a rock i could lift without busting myself and heaved it the glass on the door went to pieces and i carefully unlocked it the long slugtrail of mud i left toward the phone might have been funny if id been in a grinning mood a man like me knows his secretarys home number any dame dumb enough to work for a case like me probably wouldnt be out dancing at a nightclub dale didnt have any suitorsnot that she talked of course she was a tall thin number with interesting eyes but that was as far as it went not like the dame in green no sir i hung onto the phone box with fingers that looked swollen and bruised dirt still slimed my palms under it i was fishbelly white almost glowing in the dim lighting the dentons were going to find their diner not quite so dandy in the cold light of dawn and i was sorry about that hello she repeated herself because i was trying to make my mouth work hello dale i managed through the obstruction in my mouth sounded like theyd broken my jaw or like i was sucking on candy mr becker a note of alarm now jack you got to come pick me up dollface i sounded drunk where have youoh never mind where are you i could almost see her perched on her settee that cup of tea steaming gently on an endtable and her everpresent steno pad appearing jack where are you right now denton i managed dandy diner about eleven miles out of the city you got the keys to my studebaker your car is impounded mr becker now she sounded like the miss dale i knew cool calm efficient over the phone she sounded smoky and sinful just like bacall i mightve hired her just for that phone voice alone but she turned out to be damned efficient and not likely to yammer her yap off all the time which meant i paid her even when i couldnt eat you dont find secretaries like that every day after all never mind ill bring my car dentons dandy hm thats west out of town right sure it is my legs buckled again i hung onto the box for all i was worth ill be waiting out front im on my way and she hung up just like that what a gal the pain in my gut crested as miss dale peered over the seat id barely managed to get the door open and as soon as i was in the car she took off i wrestled the door shut and the windshield wipers made their idiot sound for about half a mile as i lay gasping in the back seat the car smelled like chanel no and chesterfields and it smelled of miss dale of hairspray and powder and a thousand other feminine things you usually have to get real close to a dame to get a whiff of it also smelled like something else something warm and coppery and salty and so good the windshield wipers went kathump kathump and her ford mustve had something going on with the engine because there was another regular thumping high and hard and fast my mouth wouldnt close all the way i kept making that wheezing sound and she finally risked another look over the seat at me im taking you to samaritan general she said and i stared at the sheen of her dark hair you sound terrible no thank god it was one word i could say without whatever was wrong with my mouth interfering no hospital the slurring was back like my jaw was broken but i wasnt feeling any pain as a matter of fact now that the headache was gone the only thing bothering me was how thirsty i was another mile squished under the tires she turned the defroster up and that regular thumping sounded like her car was about to explode it was going so fast mr becker you are beginning to worry me she lit a chesterfield keeping her eyes on the road and when she opened the window to blow the smoke out the smell of the rain came through and i realized what that thumping was it was miss dales pulse i was hearing her heartbeat and the tires touching the road and each raindrop smacking the hardtop the hiss of flame as she lit the cigarette showed the fine sheen of sweat on her forehead and i realized miss dale was nervous dont worry dollface everythings fine take me where can you go jack the lady in green knows your office and if she thinks youre dead take me to your house only it was more like hauwsch like i was a goddamn german deliowner and when i ran my tongue along the inside of my teeth everything got interesting my tongue rasped and i lost whatever it was miss dale would have said because the taste of copper filled my mouth and i suddenly knew what i was thirsty for the knowledge might have made me scream if i hadnt gone limp against the seat as if someone had sapped me because it was warm and the twisting in my gut receded a little bit and because goddammit after a man claws his way up out of his own grave and breaks into a diner he deserves a little rest the green dress hugged her curves like the samaritan freeway hugs the coast and under the little veil on her hat those eyes were green too she even had green gloves and she accepted a light from me with a small nod and raised eyebrows settling her emerald velvet clutch purse in her lap you come highly recommended mr becker a regular bryn mawr purr over the sound of miss dale typing in the front the lady kept her back straight as a ruler and the lamp on my desk made her out to be pale not one of those sunbunnies miss dale stopped typing glad to hear that i made it noncommittal as casual as my shoes on the desk it was five oclock and already dark the middle of winter and i was behind on the rent mr becker miss dale stood tall and angular in the doorway will you be needing anything else her cattilted dark eyes met mine and she had a sheaf of files in her capable narrow hands if she got a little more meat on her shed be a knockout if that is you could chip through the ice right now she was giving me the chance to say we were closing and the dame in green could come back another time i waved a languid hand no thanks miss dale ill see you in the morning very good sir frosty as a frigidaire miss dale spent a few moments moving around the office locking the files in the front cabinet and the dame in green said nothing until my secretary left locking the door behind her and her heels clicktapping down the hall as efficiently as the rest of her the sign outside my office window blinked we were up over an allnight lunch counter and newsstand and the big neon arrow drenched the room with waves of yellow and red after dark once miss dale turned the lights off the couch opposite my desk looked inviting and it would have looked even more inviting if i hadnt been looking eviction in the face i suppose so what do you want me to do mrs i made it into a question kendall mrs arthur kendall mr becker i want you to follow my husband it smelled like chanel and dirt and even though i was under a pile of blankets i was lying on something soft and i shot up straight swallowing a scream it was the sound a bullet makes when it hits a skull the explosion that was death my fingers were around something soft but with a harder core my other hand flashed up catching miss dales other wrist as she tried to slap me silk flutteredshe was dressed in a wrapper a red kimono with a sunyellow dragon breathing orange fire she yelped and i realized i was halfnaked only in a pair of mudcrusted skivvies someone had undressed me and put me in a bed made of pink fluff pillows spilling over the edges the chanel was her and the dirt that was me stinking up a nice dames bed mr becker she said and it was my imperturbable secretary again the belt of her kimono loosened enough to show a strap of herwell im only human of course i looked mr becker let go of me at once the nightmare receded i let go of her wrists she retreated two steps bumping her hip against a bedside table loaded with a jar of cold cream and a stack of big leatherbound books that looked straight out of dr caligaris library as well as a lamp with a frilly pink shade and an economysized box of kleenex we stared at each other and the fine damp texture of her skin looked better than it ever had she rubbed at her right wrist the one id grabbed first you were screaming she whispered for once i had no smartaleck thing to say of course id been screaming miss dale drew herself up tightening her kimono with swift movements she was barefoot and her dark hair wasnt pinned back it tumbled down to her shoulders in a mass of curls and it looked nice that way she folded her arms and tried her best glare on me and if i hadnt been lounging halfnaked in what i suspected was her bed it might have worked im sorry it was all i could say youd better be youre wanted for murder i closed my mouth with a snap and started thinking furiously you disappeared three days ago mr becker the police tore apart your office i am sad to report they also took your last three bottles of scotch they questioned me rather extensively too my throat was dry the thirst was worse than ever and that distracting sound was back the high hard thumping it was her pulse and it sounded like water in the desert it sounded like the chow bell in basic training her heart going that fast meant she was terrified but there she stood high color on her cheeks arms folded and shoulders back ready to take me to task once again three days murder i husked the murder of arthur kendall mr becker his widow identified you as the killer hung on the bedroom wall behind her was a photoplay page of humphrey bogart in a fedora leering at the camera like the bum he was i was beginning to suspect my practical miss dale had a soft spot for leering bums the kendall job it was difficult to think through the haze in my head and the sound of her pulse calming down a little now thank god there was something very wrong with me the kendall job she echoed naturally i have an extra copy of the file you prepared and naturally i didnt mention it to the police especially to lieutenant grady i think you are many things mr beckera disgraceful drunk and an immoral and unethical investigator just to mention a few but a murderer not the man who does widow cases for free she rubbed at her right wrist so im a sucker for dames with hard stories so what i didnt kill anyone it was a relief to say it youve got the file naturally she dropped her arms i would appreciate an explanation but im only your secretary youre a standup doll i managed the kendall job went bad miss dale i didnt kill him being that practical type she got right down to brass tacks then who did mr becker even though the thirst was getting worse by the second and the sound of her pulse wasnt helping i knew the answer to that one get me that file dale and while youre at it can i have some clothes or am i just going to swing around like tarzan if shed muttered something unladylike under her breath as she swept from the room i wouldnt have blamed her i cleaned the rest of the mud off in her pinkandyellow bathroom she had an apartment on the seedier side of parth street but everything was neat and clean and prim as youd expect from the woman id once caught alphabetizing my incoming mail she even had a suit hanging on the back of the door for me one of mine the door didnt shut quite tight and i could hear her moving around the kitchen and hear that maddening delicious irresistible thumping i looked like id been dug up that morning which if you think about it i had there was an ugly flushedred mark over my right eye a divot i could rest my fingertip in it was tender and pressing on it made my whole head feel like a pumpkin again the back of my skull was sore too seamed and scarred under my short wet hair there were bruised bags of flesh under my eyes and my cheeks had sunken in and i looked yellow as a jaundiced chinaman i peeled away my shirt collar and looked a fresh bruised mark above the collarbone two holes that looked like a tiny pair of spikes had gone into my throat the bruise was feverhot and when i touched it the rolling thunder of a heartbeat roared in my ears so loud i grabbed at miss dales scrubbedwhite sink and had to fight to retain consciousness what the hell happened to me the last thing i remembered was letitia kendall wiping her mouth and the skinny nervous redhead putting the barrel of the gun to my forehead right where that livid mark was the one with speckles of dark grit in an orbit around its sunken redness then that sound like an artillery shell inside my skull and waking up in a cold cold grave wanting a drink but not my usual drink not the kind that went down the gullet like liquid fire and detonated in the belly wrapping a warm haze between me and the rest of the world youre insane jack you got shot in the head the trouble with that was i shouldnt be insane i should be dead but i had a pulse too just like miss dale who was starting to smell less like chanel and more like food a sizzling sound drifted down the hall i tied the shoes shed thoughtfully left right outside the bathroom door and saw her front door and the warm light of the kitchen a square of yellow sanity she had her back turned and was fiddling with the stove and a steak waited on a plate on the drainboard she poked at the pan with a fork and i was moving up quietly just as if i was going to sap her three steps two she never even turned around i reached out saw my hand yellow in the yellow light shaking as it brushed past miss dales hipand fastened on the plate with the steak she jumped the fork went clattering and i retreated to the table if i hadnt been so cold i would have been sweating buckets i dropped down in one of miss dales two straightbacked frillcushioned chairs next to her cheap goldspeckled kitchen table and i found out why my mouth hadnt been working properly it was because the fangs had grown and i licked the plate clean of bloody juice before burying my teeth in the raw meat and sucking as if it was mothers milk dales hand clapped over her mouth she pinched so hard her cheeks blanched white from the pressure of her fingers and her cattilted dark eyes turned big as the landlords on rent day the pan sizzled i sucked and sucked and the two sounds almost managed to drown out the thunder of her pulse again her free hand shot out and jerked the pan from the stove the gas flame kept burning a hissing circle of blue and miss dale stared at me holding the pan like she intended to storm the barricades with it i kept sucking it wasnt nearly enough but the thirst retreated this was what i wanted when it was as tasteless as dry paper i finished licking the plate clean and i dropped the wad of drained meat down i looked at miss dale she looked at me i searched for something to say dames on her salary dont buy steak every day she mustve thought id be hungry i still need a secretary dollface her throat worked as she swallowed then she put the pan down on an unlit burner she peeled her fingers away from her mouth the bruise still a dark bracelet on her right wrist it took her two tries before she could get the words out theres another steak in the fridge jack itsraw winter nights last forever and the rain was still coming down dales wrist was swelling but she wrapped it in an ace and told me in no uncertain terms she was fine she drove the ford cautiously the wipers ticking just like her pulse i spread the file out in my lap and checked for tailswe were clean down on cross street she parked where we had a good view of the blue room and i paged through the file pictures of arthur kendall millionaire who had come back from europe with a young wife who had begun to suspect him of fooling around if i hadnt been so interested in the greenbacks she fanned out on my desktop i wouldnt have taken the job divorce jobs arent my favorites they end up too sticky this one had just gotten stickier kendall wasnt just a millionaire he was as dirty as they come id been careful sure but id gotten priceless little shots of him canoodling with the heavies in townlefty schultz who ran the prostitution racket big buck beaudry who provided muscle papa ginette whose family used to run gin and now ran dope big fan of tradition papa ginette id thought i was just getting into a dicey situation until i snapped a few shots of kendall and his wife at a pricey downtown joint where the jazz was hot and the action was hotter the blue room had a waiting list ten years long but money talksand it was willie goldsteins place if goldstein hadnt owned more than half the cops in town hed have been in big sing years ago another latenight appointment and the dame in green waltzed in my door just as miss dale was waltzing out i spread the shots out and told her kendall wasnt cheating shed married a dirty son of an unmentionable but he wasnt hanging out with the ladies those green eyes narrowed and she picked up the glossy of the crowd outside goldsteins there they were kendall and the missus and the redheaded ratfaced gent who followed kendall like glue he wasnt heavy musclehis name was shifty malloy and he had a dope habit the size of wrigley fieldbut he was dapper in a suit and lit kendalls cigarettes mrs kendall set the photo down again and smiled at me she crushed her cigarette out in the ashtray and i glanced down at the pictures again something very strange occurred to me i remember thinking that for a dame who wore green so much she had awfully red lips i remember snapping the shot and i remember the flash of white calf as she turned to follow her husband past the velvet ropes and into the restaurant but there in black and white was kendall and malloy and a crowd of other schmucks thinking it was hot stuff to pay five bucks for a steak and ogle the other rich schmucks and there was a space where the dame in green should have been but letitia kendall wasnt in the picture she was sitting across the desk from me the last ghost of her cigarette rising in the air and her face suddenly shifted under its little green veil she came over the desk at me like a feral tiger and everything went black there he is dale whispered the redhead and sure enough there was shifty malloy dapper as ever in tails getting out of a shiny new packard the blue room had a long awning to keep the rich dry but the ratfaced bum actually unfolded an umbrella and held his hand out to help a lady out of the backseat miles of white white leg through a slit in her dress and she rose up out of the back of the car like a dream only she wasnt in green the dame was in mourning like midnight her red lips a slash on the white powder of her face and i wondered how long it would take people to catch on that she liked to sleep in all day i wondered if anyone would know her hands were cold as ice cubes under the satin gloves and i wondered if anyone would guess how arthur kendall gurgled when she had her teeth in his throat because if i hadnt killed him that only left one suspect didnt it it was cold i lay on the floor and looked at the shapes in front of mea wall full of splinters and long handles ending in metal shapes it was the type of shack you have when youve got a pool and a garden and you need somewhere to store all the unattractive bits needed to keep it clipped and prettya lawnmower shovels all sorts of things youll do as i say letitia kendall said aw jesus shifty malloy whined jesus christ then a dainty foot in a green satin pump stepped into view i blinked felt like id been hit by a train throat was burning couldnt take a deep breath and i couldnt even squirm my hands were tied back and my feet felt like lead blocks she bent down the dame in green and she wasnt wearing her pretty face anymore the smear of crimson on her lips was fresh and she wiped at it with one white white hand as her other hand came down snagged a handful of my suit coat and shirt and hauled me up like i weighed nothing you have to cut off the head she said its very important if you dont you wont get any more malloy was sweating got it cut off the head use a shovel they do well her head tilted a little to the side like a cats considering its prey it is very important edward to cut off the head if i could have opened my mouth i might have said that asking shifty malloy to decapitate someone was like asking a politician to be honest i knew the bum malloy might shoot a man in the back but he was squeamish about cockroaches for christs sake all right already malloy stepped into view and his ridiculous little pastedon moustache was limp as a dead caterpillar with sweat he raised the gun a serviceable little derringer and put it to my forehead you might wanna put him down this is going to make a mess just do it letitia gave me an impatient little shake my feet dangled like a puppets i have a party to attend tonight when i came back from the war some bum asked me what the worst thing about it was i told him it was the goddamn food in the service but the worst thing in the war was the not knowing in the smoke and the chaos where the next bullet was coming from the only thing worse than that is knowing where its coming from and when that gun is to your head and nothing comes out of your crushed and dry throat but a little sound like nuhnuhmuh then the world exploded wait until i get around the corner i said handing her the file then go home youre a standup dame dale for christs sake she slid down in the seat as if afraid someone would see us parked here call me sophie jack how long have i worked for you three years kept me on time and kept that office from going under too i deserve a raise her pulse was thumping again like a rabbits the thirst was back it scorched the back of my throat like bile from the worst hangover ever and it smelled her chanel and softness and the steak shed cooked and my fingers twitched like they wanted to cross the air between us and catch at her dress it was a pretty blue dress high in the collar and tight in the waist and she looked good never noticed before how easy on the eyes miss dale was yeah im an unobservant bum go home sophie it was getting hard to talk again the teeth were coming out shophie i mangled her name the first time i ever said it youre a doll a real doll what are you going to do she had never asked me that before plenty of questions like where did you put that file and do you want coffee and what should i tell boyleston when he calls about the rent but that particular one shed never asked im going to finish the kendall job i slid out of the car and closed the door softly headed down the street she waited just like id told her for me to reach the corner then the fords engine woke and she pulled away i could hear the car but the biggest relief came when i couldnt hear her pulse anymore instead i heard everyone elses the drumbeats were a jungle and here i was the thirst burning a hole in me and the rain smacking at the top of my unprotected head i flipped up the collar of my coat wished like hell a bottle of scotch could take the edge off the burning and headed for chinatown you can find anything in chinatown they eat anything down there and i have a few friends still its amazing how a man who wont balk when you ask him to hide a dead body or a stack of bloodstained clothes might get funny ideas when you ask him to help you findblood thats what butchers are for and after a while i found what i was looking for i had my nineteen dollars and the thirty in pin money from miss dales sophieskitchen jar she said i was good for it and she would take it on her next paycheck i would worry about getting her another paycheck as soon as i finished this out it might take a little doing after two bouts of heaving as my body rebelled the thirst took over and i drank nearly a bucket of steaming copper and then i fell down and moaned like a doper on the floor of a filthy chinatown slaughterhouse it felt good slamming into the thirst in my gut and spreading in waves of warmth until i almost cried i paid for another bucket then i got the hell out of there because even yellow men will stop looking the other way for some things its amazing what you can do once a dame in a green dress kills you and pins you for murder the next thing i needed was a car on the edge of chinatown sits bennys garage and i rousted benny by the simple expedient of jimmying his lock and dragging him out of bed he didnt know why i wanted the busteddown pickup and twelve jerrycans of kerosene i dont want to know he whined at me whydja have to bust the door down jeez becker you shut up i peeled a tenspot off my diminishing bankroll and held it in front of him made it disappear when he snatched at it you never saw me benny he grabbed the ten once i made it reappear i never goddamn see you jack i never wanta see you again neither he rubbed at his stubble the rasp of every hair audible to me and the sound of his pulse was a whackwhack instead of the sweet music of sophies how long would his heart work through all the blubber he had piled on i didnt care i drove away and hoped like hell benny wouldnt call the cops with a yard full of stolen cars and up to his ass in hock to papa ginette it would be a bad move for him but still i worried i worried all the way up into garden heights and the quiet manicured mansions of the rich where i found the house i wanted and had to figure out how to get twelve jerrycans over a ninefoot stone wall the house was beautiful i almost felt bad splishing and splashing over parquet floors priceless antiques and a bed that smelled faintly of copper and talcum powder there was a whole closetful of green dresses i soaked every goddamn one of them rain pounded the roof gurgled through the gutters hissed against the walls i carried two jerrycans downstairs to the foyera massive expanse of checkered black and white soon swimming in the nosecleaning sting of keroseneand settled myself to wait by the door to a study that probably had been arthur kendalls favorite place i could smell him in there cigars and fatheaded expensive cologne i ran my hands down the shaft of the shovel while i waited swung it a few experimental times and tapped it on the floor it was a flathead shovel handily available in any garden shedand every immaculate lawn needs a garden shed even if you get brown or yellow people out to clean it up for you im good at waiting and i waited a long time the fumes got into my nose and made me lightheaded but when the packard came purring up the drive i was pouring the last half of a jerrycan lit a match and a thin trail of flame raced away up the stairs like it was trying to outrun time even if her nose was as acute as mine she might not smell the smoke through the rain and i bolted through the study which had a floorlength window id been thoughtful enough to unlock around the corner moving so fast it was like being back in the war again hardly noticing where either foot landed as long as i kept moving and the shovel whistled as i crunched across the gravel drive and smacked shifty malloy right in the face with it a good hit with all my muscle behind it he had gotten out of the car the stupid bum and he went down like a ton of bricks while letitia kendall fumbled at the doorhandle inside scratching like a mad hen the house began to whoosh and crackle twelve jerries is a lot of fuel and there was a lot to burn in there even if it was raining like god had opened every damn tap in the sky she fell out of the packard the black dress immediately soaked and flashes of fishbelly flesh showing as she scrabbled on gravel her crimson mouth worked like a landed fishs and if i was a nice guy i suppose i might have given her a chance to explain maybe i might have even let her get away by being a stupid dick like you see in the movies who lets the bad guy make his speech but im not a good guy the shovel sang again and the sound she made when the flat blade chopped threequarters of the way through her neck was between a gurgle and a scream the rain masked it and she was off the gravel and on the lawn now on mud as i followed jabbing with the shovel while her head flopped like a defective kewpie dolls i chopped the way we used to chop rattlers back on the farm and when her body stopped flopping and the gouts and gouts of fresh steaming blood had soaked a wide swatch of rainflattened grass i dropped the shovel and dragged her strangely heavy carcass back toward the house i tossed it in the foyer where the flames were rising merrily in defiance of the downpour and i tossed the shovel in too then i had to stumble back eyes blurring and skin peeling and i figured out right then and there that fire was a bad thing for me whatever i was now she was wet and white where the black dress was torn and the flames wanted to cringe away i didnt stick around to see if she went up because the house began to burn in earnest the heat scratching at my skin with thousands of scraping gold pins and there was a rosy glow in the east that had nothing to do with kerosene it was dawn and i didnt know exactly what had happened to me but i knew i didnt want to be outside much longer of course she hadnt gone to sleep as soon as i got near her door trying to tread softly on the worn carpet and smelling the burned food and dust smell of working folks in her apartment building it opened a crack and sophie peered through she was chalkwhite trembling and she retreated down the hall as i shambled in it was still raining and i was tired the thirst was back and my entire body was shot through with lead the pinpricks on my throat throbbed like they were infected but the divot above my right eye wasnt inflamed anymore but my skin cracked and crackled with the burning still and the thirst was back burrowing in my veins i shut her door and locked it i stood dripping on her welcome mat and looked at her she hadnt changed out of the blue dress she had nice legs by god and those cattilted eyes werent really dark they were hazel and her wrist was still bruised where id grabbed her she had peeled the ace off and it was a nice dark purple it probably hurt like hell her hands hung limp at her sides i searched for something to say the rain hissed and gurgled puddles in the street outside were reflecting old neon and newer light edging through gray mist its dawn she just stood there youre a real doll sophie if i didnt have how did it happen she swallowed the muscles in her throat working under that high collar her pulse was still like music youryou she fluttered one hand helplessly for the first time since she walked into my office three years ago and announced the place was a dump my miss dale seemed nonplussed i got bit sugar i peeled my sodden shirt collar away i dont want to make any trouble for you ill figure something out tomorrow night thirty of the longest seconds of my life passed in her front hallway i dripped and i felt the sun coming the way i used to feel storms moving in on the farm back when i was a jugeared kid and the big bad city was a place i only heard about in church jack you ass sophie said so its a bite and a little more miss dale lifted her chin and eyed me i dont have any more steak her pulse was back it was thundering it was hot and heavy in my ears and i already knew i wasnt a nice guy wasnt that why id come here ill go i reached behind me and fumbled for the knob oh no you will not it was miss dale again with all her crisp efficiency she reached up with trembling fingers and unbuttoned the very top button of her collar sophie how long have i been working for you jack she undid another button slender fingers working and i took a single step forward burned skin crackled and my clothes were so heavy they could have stood up by themselves three years and it wasnt for the pay and certainly not because youve a personality that recommends itself coming from her that was a compliment youve got a real sweet mouth there miss dale she undid her third button and that pulse of hers was a beacon now i knew what the thirst wanted now i knew what it felt like now i knew what it could do mr becker shut up if you dont ill lose my nerve sophie is on her pink frilly bed the shades are drawn and the apartments quiet its so quiet time to think about everything when a man wakes up in his own grave he can reconsider his choice of jobs he can do a whole lot of things its so goddamn quiet im here with my back to the bedroom door and my knees drawn up sophie is so still so pale ive had time to look over every inch of her face and i wonder how a stupid bum like me could have overlooked such a doll right under his nose it took three days for me two days ago the dame in the black dress choked her last and her lovely mansion burned it was in all the papers as a tragedy and shifty malloy choked on his own blood out in the rain too i think its time to find another city to gumshoe in theres los angeles after all and that place does threequarters of its business after dark soon the suns going to go down sophies got her hands crossed on her chest and shes all tucked in nice and warm the coverlet up to her chin and the lamp on so she wont wake up like i did in the dark and the mud the rain has stopped beating the roof i can hear heartbeats moving around in the building jesus i hope she wakes up twilight by kelley armstrong kelley armstrong is the bestselling author of the otherworld urban fantasy series which began with bitten and the latest of which frostbitten comes out in october she is also the author of the darkest powers trilogy a youngadult series that began last year with the summoning armstrong is currently in the midst of writing a fiveissue arc for joss whedons angel comic book series armstrong says that the most obvious appeal of vampire fiction is the mingling of sex and death but for me the appeal has always been the concept of immortality she said particularly the problems with it and the sacrifices we wouldor wouldntmake to retain it this story which features cassandra ducharme from armstrongs otherworld series was written for many bloody returns an anthology with a vampiresandbirthdays theme when i think birthdays in regards to my vampires i think rebirth day which is the anniversary of the day they became vampires and each year at that time they must take a life to continue their semiimmortality armstrong said cassandra has never had a problem fulfilling her annual bargain but this year she does another life taken another year to live that is the bargain that rules our existence we feed off blood but for three hundred and sixtyfour days a year it is merely that feeding yet on that last dayor sometime before the anniversary of our rebirth as vampireswe must drain the lifeblood of one person fail and we begin the rapid descent into death as i sipped white wine on the outdoor patio i watched the steady stream of passersby although there was a chill in the airlate autumn coming fast and sharpthe patio was crowded no one willing to surrender the dream of summer quite yet leaves fluttering onto the tables were lauded as decorations the scent of a distant woodfire was willfully mistaken for candles the sun almost gone despite the still early hour only added romance to the meal all embellishments to the night not signs of impending winter i sipped my wine and watched night fall at the next table a lone businessman eyed me he was the sort of man i often had the misfortune to attractmiddleaged and prosperous laboring under the delusion that success and wealth were such irresistible lures that he could allow his waistband and jowls to thicken unchecked under other circumstances i might have returned the attention let him lead me to some tawdry motel then take my dinner he would survive of course waking weakened blaming it on too much wine a meal without guilt any man who took such a chance with a strangerparticularly when he bore a wedding banddeserved an occasional bout of morningafter discomfort he did not however deserve to serve as my annual kill i can justify many things but not that yet i found myself toying with the idea more than i should have prodded by a niggling voice that told me i was already late i stared at the glow over the horizon the sun had set on the anniversary of my rebirth and i hadnt taken a life yet there was no need for panic i would hardly explode into dust at midnight i would weaken as i began the descent into death but i could avoid that simply by fulfilling my bargain tonight i measured the darkness deemed it enough for hunting then laid a twenty on the table and left a bell tolled ten two hours left i chastised myself for being so dramatic i loathe vampires given to theatricsthose who have read too many horror novels and labor under the delusion thats how theyre supposed to behave i despise any sign of it in myself and yet under the circumstances perhaps it could be forgiven in all the years that came before this i had never reached this date without fulfilling my obligation i had chosen this vampiric life and would not risk losing it through carelessness only once had i ever neared my rebirth day and then only due to circumstances beyond my control it had been or perhaps id been hunting for my annual victim when id found myself tossed into a hungarian prison i hadnt been caught at my killid never made so amateurish a mistake even when id been an amateur the prison sojourn had been aarons fault as such things usually were wed been hunting my victim when hed come across a nobleman whipping a servant in the street naturally aaron couldnt leave well enough alone in the ensuing confusion of the brawl id been rousted with him and thrown into a pestinfested cell that wouldnt pass any modern health code aaron had worked himself into a fullfrothing frenzy seeing my rebirth anniversary only days away while i languished in prison waiting for justice that seemed unlikely to come swiftly i hadnt been concerned when one partakes of aarons company one learns to expect such inconveniences while he plotted schemed and swore hed get us out on time i simply waited there was time yet and no need to panic until panic was warranted the day before my rebirth anniversary as id begun to suspect that a more strenuous course of action might be required wed been released id compensated for the trouble and delay by taking the life of a prison guard whod enjoyed his work far more than was necessary this year my only excuse for not taking a victim yet was that i hadnt gotten around to it as for why i was somewhat baffled i am nothing if not conscientious about my obligations yet this year delays had arisen and somehow id been content to watch the days slip past and tell myself i would get around to it as if it was no more momentous than a missed salon appointment the week had passed and id been unable to work up any sense of urgency until today and even now it was only an oddly cerebral concern no matter i would take care of it tonight as i walked an old drunkard drew my gaze i watched him totter into the shadows of an alley and thought theres a possibility perhaps i could get this chore over with sooner than expected i could be quite finickyrefusing to feed off sleeping vagrantsyet as my annual kill this one was a choice i could make every vampire deals with our bargain in the way that best suits his temperament and capacity for guilt and remorse i cull from the edgesthe sick the elderly those already nearing their end i do not fool myself into thinking this is a just choice theres no way to know whether that cancerwracked woman might have been on the brink of remission or if that elderly man had been enjoying his last days to the fullest i make the choice because it is one i can live with this old drunkard would do as i watched him i felt the gnawing in the pit of my stomach telling me id already waited too long i should follow him into that alley and get this over with i wanted to get it over withthat there was no question of that no possibility i was conflicted on this point other vampires may struggle with our bargain i do not yet even as i visualized myself following the drunk into the alley my legs didnt follow through i stood there watching him disappear into the darkness then i moved on a block farther a crowd poured from a movie theater as it passed its life force enveloped me i wasnt hungry yet i could still feel that tingle of anticipation of hunger i could smell their blood hear the rush of it through their veins the scent and sound of life twenty steps later and they were still passing an endless stream of humanity disgorged by a packed theater how many seats were inside three hundred three fifty as many years as had passed since my rebirth one life per year it seems so moderate a price until you looked back and realized you could fill a movie theater with your victims a sobering thought even for one not inclined to dwell on such things no matter there wouldnt be hundreds more not from this vampire contrary to legend our gift of longevity comes with an expiry date mine was drawing near id felt the signs the disconnect from the world a growing disinterest in all around me for me that was nothing new id long since learned to keep my distance from a world that changed while i didnt after some struggle with denial id accepted that i had begun the decline toward death but it would be slow and i still had years left decades even or i would if i could get past this silly bout of ennui and make my rebirth kill as the crowd dwindled i looked over my shoulder to watch them go and considered taking a life from them a random kill id done it once before more than a century ago during a particularly bleak time when i hadnt been able to rouse enough feeling to care yet later id regretted it having let myself indulge my darkest inclinations simply because id been in a dark place myself unacceptable i wouldnt do it again i wrenched my gaze from the dispersing crowd this was ridiculous i was no angstridden cinema vampire bemoaning the choice shed made in life i was no flighty youngster easily distracted from duty abhorring responsibility i was cassandra ducharme senior vampire delegate to the interracial council if any vampire had come to me with this problemim having trouble making my annual killid have shown her the sharp side of my tongue hauled her into the alley with that drunk and told her as aaron might say to piss or get off the pot i turned around and headed back to the alley id gone only a few steps when i picked up a sense of the drunkard excitement swept through me i closed my eyes and smiled that was more like it the quickening accelerated as i slid into the shadows my stride smoothed out each step taken with care rolling heel to toe making no sound that sense of my prey grew stronger with each step telling me he was near i could see a recessed emergency exit a dozen feet ahead a shoe protruded from the darkness i crept forward until i spotted a dark form crumpled inside the rush of his blood vibrated through the air my canines lengthened and i allowed myself one shudder of anticipation then shook it off and focused on the sound of his breathing a gust whipped along the alley scattering candy wrappers and leaflets and the stink of alcohol washed over me i caught the extra notes in his breathingthe deep almost determined rhythm passed out drunk hed probably stumbled into the first semisheltered place hed seen and collapsed that would make it easier still i hesitated telling myself i needed to be sure but the rhythm of his breathing stayed steady he was clearly asleep and unlikely to awake even if i bounded over there and shouted in his ear so what was i waiting for i should be in that doorway already reveling in the luck of finding so easy a victim i shook the lead from my bones and crossed the alley the drunkard wore an army jacket a real one if i was any judge i resisted the fanciful urge to speculate to imagine him as some shellshocked soldier turned to drink by the horrors of war more likely hed bought the jacket at a thrift shop or stolen it his hair was matted so filthy it was impossible to tell the original color above the scraggly beard though his face was unlined younger than id first imagined significantly younger that gave me pause but while he was not the old drunkard id first imagined he was certainly no healthy young man i could sense disease and wasting most likely cirrhosis not my ideal target but he would do and yet almost before i realized it i was striding toward the road he wasnt right i was succumbing to that panic and that was unnecessary even dangerous if i made the wrong choice id regret it better to let the pressure of this ominous date pass and find a better choice tomorrow i slid into the park and stepped off the path the ground was hard so i could walk swiftly and silently as i stepped from the wooded patch my exit startled two young men huddled together their gazes tripped over me eyes glittering under the shadows of their hoods like jackals spotting easy prey i met the stronger ones gaze he broke first grumbling deep in his throat then he shuffled back and waved his friend away as he muttered some excuse for moving on i watched them go considering then dismissing it was easy to separate one victim from a group not nearly so simple when the group consisted of only two people as the young men disappeared i resumed my silent trek across the park my goal lay twenty paces away had i not sensed him i likely would have passed by hed ignored a park bench under the light and instead had stretched out upon the top of a raised garden hidden under the bushes and amidst the dying flowers he lay on his back with his eyes closed his face was peaceful relaxed a handsome face broad and tanned he had thick blond hair and the healthy vitality of a young man in his prime a big man too tall and solid his muscular arms crossed behind his head his slim hips and long denimclad legs ending in work boots crossed at the ankles i circled north to sneak up behind his head he lay completely motionless even his chest was still not rising and falling with the slow rhythm of breathing i crossed the last few feet between us and stopped just behind his head then i leaned over his eyes opened deep brown eyes the color of rich earth he snarled a yawn bout time cass he said couple of punks been circling to see if im still conscious another few minutes and id have had to teach them to let sleeping vamps lie shall i go away then let you have your fun aaron grinned nah they come back we can both have fun he heaved his legs over the side of the garden wall and sat up shaking off sleep then catching a glimpse of my face his grin dropped into a frown you didnt do it did you i couldnt find anyone couldnt find he pushed to his feet towering over me goddamn it what are you playing at first you let it go until the last minute then you cant find anyone i checked my watch its not the last minute i still have ten left i trust that if i explode at midnight youll be kind enough to sweep up the bits i would like to be scattered over the atlantic but if youre pressed for time the charleston river will do he glowered at me a hundred and twenty years together and you never got within a week of your rebirth day without making your kill hungary sixtyeight and i dont see any bars this time so what was your excuse among others i was busy researching that council matter paige brought to my attention i admit i let things creep up on me this year and a century ago that would never have happened but while we were apart i changed bullshit you never change except to get more imperious more pigheaded and more cranky the word is crankier he muttered a few more descriptors under his breath i started down the path youd better be going off to find someone he called after me no im heading home to bed im tired tired he strode up beside me you dont get tired youre he stopped mouth closing so fast his teeth clicked the word is dying i said and while that is true and it is equally true that my recent inability to sleep is a symptom of that tonight i am indeed tired because youre late for your kill you cant pull this shit cassandra not in your condition i gave an unladylike snort and kept walking his fingers closed around my arm lets go find those punks have some fun a broad boyish grin i think one has a gun been a long time since i got shot another day a hunt then im not hungry well i am maybe you couldnt find someone suitable but i can i know what you look for well hunt together ill get a snack youll get another year fair enough he tried to grin but i could see a hint of panic behind his eyes i felt an answering prickle of worry but told myself i was being ridiculous id simply had too much on my mind lately i was tired and easily distracted i needed to snap out of this embarrassing lethargy and make this kill and i would do so tomorrow once aaron had gone back to atlanta its not the end of the worldor my worldif i dont take a life tonight aaron youve been late yourself when you couldnt find someone suitable i haventand perhaps id simply like to know what thats like i touched his arm at my age new experiences are few and far between i take them where i can he hesitated then nodded mollified and accompanied me from the park aaron followed me home that wasnt as nearly as exciting a prospect as it sounds these days we were simply friends his choice if i had my way tired or not i would have found the energy to accommodate him when i first met aaron less than a year after his rebirth hed accused me of helping him in his new life because he looked like something to decorate my bed with true enough even as a human i had never been able to rouse more than a passing interest in men of my own class too wellmannered too gently spoken too soft my tastes had run to stable boys and later to discreet working men finding aaron as a newly reborn vampire a big strapping farm boy with hands as rough as his manners i will admit that my first thought was indeed carnal he was younger than i liked but id decided i could live with that so id trained him in the life of a vampire in return id received friendship protection and endless nights alone frustrated beyond reason it was preposterous of course id never had any trouble leading men to my bed and there id been reduced to chasing a virile young man who strung me along as if he were some coy maiden i told myself it wasnt his faulthe was english thankfully when he finally capitulated i discovered he wasnt nearly as repressed as id feared over a hundred years together it was no grand romance the word love never passed between us we were partners in every sensebest friends hunting allies and faithful lovers then came the morning i woke looked over at him and imagined not seeing him there tried to picture life without him id gone cold at the thought i had told myself id never allow that again when youve lost everyone you learn the danger of attachments as a vampire you must accept that every person you ever know will die and you are the only constant in your life the only person you canand shouldrely on so i made a decision i betrayed aaron not with another man had i done that hed simply have flown into a rage and once past it demanded to know what was really bothering me what i did instead was a deeper betrayal one that said more coldly than i could ever speak the words i dont want you anymore after over half a century apart happenstance had brought us together again wed resisted the pull of that past bond reminded ourselves of what had happened the last time and yet gradually wed drifted back into friendship only friendship sex was not allowedaarons way of keeping his distance given the choice between having him as a friend and not having him in my life at all id gladly choose the former though that didnt keep me from hoping to change his mind that night i slept it was the first time id done more than catnapped in over a year while i longed to seize on this as some sign that i wasnt dying i knew aarons assessment was far more likelyi was tired because id missed my annual kill was this what happened then when we didnt hold up our end of the bargain an increasing lethargy that would lead to death i shook it off i had no intention of exploring the phenomenon further come sunset i would end this foolishness and take a life as i entered my living room that morning i heard a dull slapping from the open patio doors aaron was in the yard building a new retaining wall for my garden when hed been here in the spring hed commented on the crumbling wall and said i could fix that for you id nodded and said yes i suppose you could three more intervening visits three more hints about the wall yet i refused to ask for his help i had lost that right when i betrayed him so yesterday hed shown up on my doorstep masonry tools in one hand suitcase in the other and announced he was building a new wall for my rebirth day that meant he had a reason to stay until hed finished it had he simply decided my rebirth day made a good excuse or was there more than that when id spoken to him this week had something in my voice told him i had yet to take my annual victim i watched aaron through the patio doors the breeze was chilly but the sun beat down and he had his shirt off as he worked oblivious to all around him this was what he did for a livingmasonry the latest in a string of careers i chided him that after two hundred years one should have a healthy retirement savings plan he only pointed the finger back at me declaring that i too worked when i didnt need to but i was selfemployed and selling art and antiques was certainly not in the same category as the physically demanding jobs he undertook yet another matter on which we disagreedwith vigor and enthusiasm i watched him for another minute then headed for the kitchen to make him an iced tea i went out later to check a new shipment at an antique shop when i got home aaron was sitting on the couch a pile of newspapers on the table and one spread in his hands i hope you didnt take those from my trash i wouldnt have had to if youd recycle he peered around the side of the paper that blue box in the garage thats what its for not holding garden tools i waved him off three hundred and fifty years and i have never been deprived of a newspaper or book by want of paper im not going to start recycling now im too old too stubborn he gave a sly grin or too lazy he earned a glare for that one i walked over and snatched up a stray paper from the carpet before it stained if youre that desperate for reading material just tell me and ill walk to the store and buy you a magazine he folded the paper and laid it on the coffee table then patted the spot next to him i hesitated sensing trouble and took a place at the opposite end perched on the edge he reached over his hand going around my waist and dragged me until i was sitting against him remember when we met cass vaguely he laughed your memory isnt that bad remember what you did for me my first rebirth day was coming and id decided i wasnt doing it you found me a victim a choice i could live with with his free hand he picked up a paper separated from the rest and dropped it onto my lap found you a victim i sighed aaron i dont need you to too late he poked a calloused finger at the top article right there the weekold story told of a terminally ill patient fighting for the right to die when i looked over at aaron he was grinning pleased with himself perfect isnt it he said exactly what you look for she wants to die shes in pain shes in a palliative care ward how would i even get in there let alone kill her is that a challenge his arm tightened around my waist because if it is im up for it you know i am he was still smiling but behind it lurked a shadow of desperation again his worry ignited mine perhaps this added incentive was exactly what i needed it wouldnt be easy but it could be interesting particularly with aarons help any other time id have pounced on the idea but now even as i envisioned it i felt only a spark of interest buried under an inexplicable layer of lethargy even antipathy and all i could think was oh but it would just be so much work my hackles rose at such indolence but i squelched my indignation i was determined to take a life tonight i would allow nothing to stand in the way of that therefore i could not enter into a plan that might prove too difficult better to keep this simple so i would have no excuse for failure i lay the paper aside are you hungry a faint frown last night you said you were hungry i continued if you were telling the truth then i presume you still need to feed unless you slipped out last night i thought wed be hunting together later so i waited then well hunt tonight but not a wave at the paper in a hospital we strolled along the sidewalk it was almost dark now the sun just a redtinged memory along the horizon as i watched a flowerseller clear her outdoor stock for the night aaron snapped his fingers flowers thats whats missing in your house you always have flowers the last arrangement wilted early i was going to pick up more when i was out today but i didnt get the chance he seemed to cheer at that as if reading some hidden message in my words here then he said ill get some for you now i arched my brows and carry bouquets on a hunt think i cant sounds like a challenge i laughed and laid my fingers on his forearm well get some tomorrow he took my hand and looped it through his arm as we resumed walking were going to paris this spring he said after a moment are we dare i ask what prompted that flowers spring paris ah a thoughtful gesture but paris in the spring is highly overrated and overpriced too bad im taking you ill book the time off when i get home and call you with the dates when i didnt argue he glanced over at me then grinned and quickened his pace launching into a remember when story of our last spring in paris we bickered over the choice of victim aaron wanted to find one to suit my preference but i insisted we select his type finally he capitulated the fight dampened the evenings mood but only temporarily once aaron found a target he forgot everything else in the early years aaron had struggled with vampiric life hed died rescuing a stranger from a petty thug and his reward after a life spent thinking of others hed been reborn as one who fed off them ironic and cruel yet wed found a way for him to justifyeven relishthe harder facts of our survival he fed from the dregs of society punks and criminals like those youths in the park for his annual kill he condemned those whose crimes he deemed worthy of the harshest punishment and so he could feel he did some good in this parasitic life as he said id found his first victim now two hundred years later he no longer scoured newspapers or tracked down rumors but seemed able to locate victims by intuition alone as i could find the dying the predatory instinct will adapt to anything that ensures the survival of the host tonights choice was a drug dealer with feral eyes and a quick switchblade we watched from the shadows as the man threatened a young runner aaron rocked on the balls at his feet his gaze fixed on that waving knife but i laid my hand on his arm as the runner loped toward the street aarons lips curved happy to see him go but even happier with what the boys safe departure portendednot a quick intervention but a true hunt we tracked the man for over an hour before aarons hunger won out with no small amount of regret he stopped toying with his dinner and i lured the drug dealer into an alleyway an easy maneuver as such things usually were with men like this too greedy and cocksure to feel threatened by a middleaged woman as aarons fangs sank into the drug dealers throat the mans eyes bugged in horror unable to believe what was happening this was the most dangerous point of feeding that split second where they felt our fangs and felt a nightmare come to life it is but a moment then the sedative in our saliva takes hold and they pass out those last few seconds wiped from memory when they wake the man lashed out once then slumped in aarons grasp still gripping the mans shirtfront aaron began to drink gulping the blood his eyes were closed face rapturous and i watched him enjoying the sight of his pleasure his appetite hed been hungrier than hed let on typical for aaron waiting that extra day or two not to practice control or avoid feeding but to drink heartily delayed gratification for heightened pleasure i shivered cass he licked a fallen drop from the corner of his mouth as he held the man out for me this was how we huntedhow aaron liked it not taking separate victims but sharing he always made the disabling bite drank some then let me feed to satiation if i took too much for him to continue feeding safely hed find a second victim there was no sense arguing that i could find my own foodhe knew that but continued compelled by a need to protect and provide you go on i said softly youre still hungry he thrust the man to me yours his jaw set and i knew his insistence had nothing to do with providing sustenance as aaron held the man up for me i moved forward my canines lengthened throat tightening and i allowed myself a shudder of anticipation i lowered my mouth to the mans throat scraped my canines over the skin tasting preparing then with one swift bite my mouth filled with i jerked back almost choking i resisted the urge to spit and forcedwith effortthe mouthful down my stomach revolting in disgust it tasted like blood when i became a vampire i thought this would be the most unbearable part drinking blood but the moment that first drop of blood touched my tongue id realized my worries had been for naught there was no word for the taste no human memory that came close i can only say that it was so perfect a food that i could never tire of it nor wish for something else but this tasted like blood like my human memory of it once before id completed the transition to vampire id filled a goblet with cows blood and forced it down preparing for my new life i could still taste the thick metallic fluid that had coated my mouth and tongue then sat in my stomach for no more than a minute before returning the way it had gone down now after only a mouthful of this mans blood i had to clamp my mouth shut to keep from gagging aaron dropped the man and grabbed for me i waved him aside i swallowed wrong i rubbed my throat lips curving in a moue of annoyance then looked around and found the man at my feet i steeled myself and bent aaron crouched to lift the man for me but i motioned him back and shielded my face so he wouldnt see my reaction then i forced my mouth to the mans throat the bleeding had already stopped i bit his neck again my nails digging into my palms eyes closed letting the disgusting taste fill my mouth then swallowing drink swallow drink swallow my nails broke my skin but i felt no pain i wished i could if only to give me something else to think about it wasnt only the taste that i could struggle past but my whole body rebelled at the very sensation of the blood filling my stomach screaming at me to stop as if what i was doing was unnatural even dangerous i managed one last swallow and then i couldnt i simply couldnt i hung there fangs still in the mans neck willing myself to suck to fill my mouth to finish this mentally screaming raging against the preposterousness of it i was a vampire i drank blood and even if i didnt want to by god i would force every drop down my throat my stomach heaved i swallowed hard i could sense aaron behind me hovering watching worrying another heave if i took one more sip id vomit and give aaron reason to worry to panic and give myself reason to panic it was the victim god only knew what poisons this drug dealer had swimming through his veins and while such things dont affect vampires i am a delicate feeder too sensitive to anomalies in the blood ive gone hungry rather than drink anything that tastes off there was no sense asking aaron to confirm ithe could swill weekold blood and not notice that was it then the victim just the victim i sealed the wound with my tongue and stepped back cass aarons voice was low with warning you need to finish him i the word cant rose to my lips but i swallowed it back i couldnt say that wouldnt this was just another temporary hurdle id rest tonight and find a victim of my own choosing tomorrow he isnt right i said then turned and headed down the alley after a moment i heard aaron pitch the unconscious man into a heap of trash bags and storm off in the opposite direction any other man would have thrown up his hands and left me there i arrived at my car to find aaron waiting by the drivers door i handed him the keys and got in the passengers side at home as i headed toward my room aaron called after me i hope youre not going to tell me youre tired again no im taking a bath to scrub off the filth of that alley then if you arent ready to retire we could have a glass of wine perhaps light the fire its getting cool he paused still ready for a fight but finding no excuse in my words ill start the fire he said thank you no more than ten minutes after i got into the tub the door banged open with such a crash that i started sloshing bubbles over the side aaron barreled in and shoved a small book at me my appointment book i found this in your desk keen detective work practicing for your next council investigation our next council investigation i reached for my loofah brush my mistake thats what i meant is it i looked up trying to understand his meaning but seeing only rage in his eyes he was determined to find out what had happened in that alley and somehow this was his route there my stomach clenched as if the blood was still pooled in it curdling i wouldnt have this conversation i wouldnt ostensibly reaching for the loofah brush i rose letting the bubbles slide from me aarons gaze dropped from my face i tucked my legs under took hold of the side of the tub and started to rise he let me get halfway up then put his hand on my head and firmly pushed me down i reclined into the tub again then leaned my head back floating breasts and belly peeking from the water aaron watched for a moment before tearing his gaze away with a growl stop that cass im not going to run off and im not going to be distracted i want to talk to you i sighed about my appointment book i presume he lifted it last week on the day marked birthday the date you must have planned to make your kill theres nothing else scheduled of course not i keep that day open but you said you were busy thats why you didnt do it i dont believe i said that i said things came up such as i raised a leg onto the rim and ran the loofah brush down it aarons eyes followed but after a second he forced his gaze back to mine and repeated the question i sighed very well lets see on that particular day it was a midnight endofseason designer clothing sale as i was driving out of the city to make my kill i saw the sign and stopped by the time i left it was too late to hunt he glowered at me thats not funny i didnt say it was the glower deepened to a scowl you postponed your annual kill to shop bullshit yeah you like your fancy clothes and youre cheap as hell but getting distracted by a clothing sale he snorted thats like a cop stopping a high speed chase to grab donuts i went quiet for a moment then said as evenly as i could perhaps but i did he searched my eyes finding the truth there then somethings wrong very wrong and you know it i shuttered my gaze all i know is that youre making too big a deal of this as always you take the smallest cassandra ducharme skips her annual kill to go shopping thats not small thats apocalyptic oh please spare me the he shoved the open book in my face forget the sale explain the rest of it you had nothing scheduled all week you had no excuse you didnt forget you didnt get distracted his voice dropped as he lowered himself to the edge of the tub you have no intention of taking a life you you think im trying to kill myself i laughed the sound almost bitter do you forget how i became what i am aaron i chose it i risked everything to get this life and if you think id throw that away one minute before my time is up how you came into this life is exactly why youre hellbent on leaving it like this he snagged my gaze and held it you cheated death no you beat itby sheer goddamned force of will you said i wont die and now when its coming around again youre damned well not going to sit back and let it happen you chose once youll choose again i paused looked away then back at him why are you here aaron i came to fix your wall at no prompting from me no hints from me you came of your own accord correct yeah but then if id planned to let myself die presumably you wouldnt have seen me again i met his gaze do you think i would do that of everyone i know in this world would i leave you without saying goodbye his jaw worked but he said nothing after a moment he pushed to his feet and walked out i lay in bed propped on my pillows staring at the wall aaron was right when the time came i would leave this vampiric life as id come into it by choice but this was not that time there was no doubt of that no possibility that i was subconsciously trying to end my life that was preposterous i had no qualms about suicide fears perhaps yet no different than my fear of death itself when the time came yes but i would never be so irresponsible as to end my life before my affairs were in order my estate would need to be disposed of in advance given to those i wished to see benefit of equal concern was the discovery and disposal of my body to leave that to chance would be unforgivably irresponsible i would make my peace with aaron and make amends for my betrayal or at the very least ensure he understood that whatever i had done to him the reason for it the failing behind it had been mine then there was the council aaron was already my codelegate but i had to ready him to take my senior position and ready the vampire community to accept that change moreover as the senior overall council member it was my duty to pass on all i knew to paige as the keeper of records something id been postponing unwilling to accept that my time was ending ending my stomach clenched at the thought i closed my eyes and shuddered i had never lacked for backbone and never stood for the lack of it in others now i needed to face and accept this reality i was dying not beginning a lengthy descent but at the end of the slope i now knew how a vampire died a rebirth date came and we discovered without warning that we couldnt fulfill our end of the bargain not would not but could not if i could not overcome this i would die not in decades but days panic surged coupled with an overwhelming wave of raw rage of all the ways to die could any be more humiliating in its sublime ridiculousness not to die suddenly existence snuffed out as my time ended not to die beheaded at the hands of an enemy not to grow ill and fade away not even to pass in my sleep such deaths couldnt be helped and while i would have raged against that the injustice of it such a fate was nothing compared to thisto die because i inexplicably lacked the will to do something id done hundreds of times before no that wasnt possible i wouldnt let it be possible i would get out of this bed find a victim and force myself to drain his blood if i vomited up every mouthful i envisioned myself standing yanking on clothing striding from the room yet i didnt move my limbs felt leaden inside i was spitting mad snarling and cursing but my body lay as still and calm as if id already passed i pushed down the burbling panic consider the matter with care and logic i should have taken aarons victim while i still had the strength but now that id missed my opportunity i couldnt chance waiting another day id rest for an hour or so until aaron had retired better for him not to know i wouldnt let him pity and coddle me simply because it was in his nature to help the sick the weak the needy i would not be needy id stay awake and wait until the house grew quiet then id do thisalone i fixed my gaze on the light staring at it to keep myself awake minutes ticked past each feeling like an hour my eyes burned my body begged for sleep i refused it threatened to pull me under even with my eyes wide i compromised id close them for a moments rest and then id leave i shut my eyes and all went dark i awoke to the smell of flowers i usually had some in the house so the smell came as no surprise and i drowsily stretched rested and refreshed then i remembered i hadnt replaced my last flowers and i was seized by the sudden vision of my corpse lying on my bed surrounded by funeral wreaths i bolted upright and found myself staring in horror at a room of flowers before realizing that the fact i was sitting upright would suggest i was not dead with a deep sigh i looked around flowers did indeed fill my room there were at least a dozen bouquets each a riot of blooms with no unifying theme of color shape or type i smiled aaron my feet lit on the cool hardwood as i crossed to a piece of paper propped against the nearest bouquet an advertisement for flights to france beside another was a list of hotels a picture of the eiffel tower adorned a third random images of parisian travel littered the room again with no obvious theme simply pages hurriedly printed from websites typically aaron making his point with all the finesse of a sledgehammer wielded with equal parts enthusiasm and determination should i still fail to be swayed hed scrawled a note with letters two inches high the paper thrust into a bouquet of roses paige had called she was still working on that case and needed my help in smaller letters below he informed me that todays paper carried another article on the palliative care patient who wanted to die i dressed then tucked two of the pages into my pocket and slipped out the side door i didnt go to the hospital aaron had suggested it was too late for that if i was having difficulty making this kill i could not compound that by choosing one that would itself be difficult so i returned to the alley where id foundand dismissedmy first choice two nights ago the drunkard wasnt there of course no one was but i traversed the maze of alleys and back roads in search of another victim i couldnt wait for nightfall i couldnt risk falling asleep again or i might not wake up when an exit door swung open i darted into an alley to avoid detection and spotted my victim a woman sitting in an alcove surrounded by grocery bags stuffed with what looked like trash but i presumed encompassed the sum of her worldly belongings behind me whoever opened that door tossed trash into the alley and slammed it shut again the woman didnt move she stared straight ahead gaze vacant resting before someone told her to move on even as i watched her evaluated her and decided she would do something deep in me threw up excuses not old enough not sick enough too dangerous a location too dangerous a time of day keep looking find someone better someplace safer but if i left here left her i would grow more tired more distracted and more disinterested with every passing hour she would do she had to for once not a choice i could live with but the choice that would let me live there was no way to approach without the woman seeing me unlike aaron i didnt like to let my victims see the specter of death approach but today i had no choice so i straightened and started toward her as if it was perfectly natural for a welldressed middleaged woman to cut through alleyways out of the corner of my eye i saw her look up as i passed she tensed then relaxed seeing no threat i turned as if just noticing her then with a brisk nod i took a twenty from my wallet a cruel ruse or making her last memory a pleasant one perhaps both as expected she smiled her guard lowering even more i reached down but let go of the bill too soon as it fluttered to the ground i murmured an apology and bent as if to retrieve it but she was already snatching it up i kept bending still apologizing and sank my fangs into the back of her neck she gave one gasp before the sedative took effect and she fell forward i tugged her into the alcove propped her against the wall and crouched beside her still form as my fangs pierced her jugular i braced myself the blood filled my mouth as thick hot and horrible as the drug dealers the night before my throat tried to seize up rejecting it but i swallowed hard another mouthful another swallow drink swallow drink swallow my stomach heaved i pulled back from the woman closed my eyes lifted my chin and swallowed the blood another heave and my mouth filled the taste too horrible to describe i gritted my teeth and swallowed with every mouthful now some came back up i swallowed it again soon my whole body was shaking my brain screaming that this wasnt right that i was killing myself drowning my stomach gave one violent heave my throat refilling i clamped my hand to my mouth eyes squeezed shut as i forced myself to swallow the regurgitated blood body shaking i crouched over her again i opened my eyes and saw the woman lying there i couldnt do this i couldnt one hand still pressed to my mouth i tugged the pages from my pocket i unfolded them and forced myself to look paris aaron paige the council i wasnt done yet soon but not yet i squeezed my eyes shut then slammed my fangs into the womans throat and drank her pulse started to fade my stomach was convulsing now body trembling so hard i could barely keep my mouth locked on her neck even as i pushed on seeing the end in sight i knew this wasnt success id won only the first round of a match i was doomed to lose the last drops of blood filled my mouth her heart beat slower and slower then stopped another life taken another year to live in darkness angels by eric van lustbader eric van lustbader

appreciate that in the bargain well be getting their family tooa whole web of relationships and past events that are unknown to us and when those past events stretch back centuries lets just say that you may have been in relationships where you felt like your lovers family members were out for blood but probably never quite like this if i had known then what i know now how those words echo on and on inside my mind like a rubber ball bouncing down an endless staircase as if they had a life of their own which i suppose they do now i cannot sleep but is it any wonder outside bluewhite lightning forks like a giants jagged claw and the thunder is so loud at times that i feel i must be trapped inside an immense bell reverberations like memory unspooling in a reckless helix making a mess at my feet if i had known then what i know now and yet and yet i return again and again to that windswept evening when the ferry deposited me at the east end of the island it had once been so i had been told by the rather garrulous captain a swansneck peninsula but over time the water had gradually eaten away at the rocky soil until at last the land had succumbed to the oceans cool tidal embrace severing itself from the mainland a mile away of course the captain had an entirely different version of what had transpired its them folks up there he had said jerking his sharp unshaven chin toward the castle high atop the islands central mount didnt want no more interference from the other folks hereabouts he gave a short barking laugh and spat over the boats side just as well i say he observed as he squinted heavily into the last of the dying suns watery light them rocks were awfully sharp he shook his head as if weighed down by the memory kids were always darin one another tdo their balancin act goin across down that long spit o land he turned the wheel hard over and spuming water rushed up the bow of the ferry manys the night wed come out with the searchlights tryin to rescue some fool boyd gone over for just a moment he swung us away from the island looming up on our starboard side getting the most out of the crosswinds never found em though not a one he spat again you go over the side around here youre never seen again the undertow i offered he whipped his ruddy windburned face around impaling me with one palegray eye undertow you say his laugh was harsh now and unpleasant you gotta lot tlearn up there at fuego del aire boyo oh yes indeed he left me on the quayside with no one around to mark my arrival as the widebeamed ferry tacked away pushed by the strong sunset wind i thought i saw the captain raise an arm in my direction i turned away from the sea great stands of pine bristly and dark in the failing light marched upward in majestic array toward the castle high above me their tops whipsawed sending off an odd melancholy drone i felt utterly irretrievably alone and for the first time since i had sent the letter i began to feel the queasy fluttering of reservations an odd kind of inner darkness had settled about my shoulders like a vulture descending upon the flesh of the dead i took a deep breath and shook my head to clear it the captains stories were only words strung one after the otherall the legends just words and nothing more now i would see for myself after all that was what i wanted the last of the sunset torched the upper spires so that for a moment they looked like bloody spears imagination thats all it was a writers imagination i clutched at my battered weekender and continued onward puffing for the way was steep but i had arrived at just the right time of the day when the scorching sun was gone from the sky and nights deep chill had not yet settled over the land the air was rich with the scents of the sea an agglomeration so fecund it took my breath away far off over the water great gulls twisted and turned in lazy circles skimming over the shining face of the ocean only to whirl high aloft disappearing for long moments into the fleecy pink and yellow clouds from the outside the castle seemed stupendous it was immense thrusting upward into the sky as if it were about to take off in flight it was constructedobviously many years agofrom massive blocks of granite laced with iridescent chips of mica that shone like diamonds rubies and sapphires in the evenings light a fairy tale castle it surely looked with its shooting turrets and sharply angled spires horned and horrific however on closer inspection i saw that it had been put together with nothing more fantastic than mortar below me a mist was beginning to form swiftly climbing the route i had taken moments before as if following me already the sight of the quay had been snuffed out and the cries of the gulls filtered through the stuff were eerie and vaguely disquieting i climbed the basalt steps to the front door of the castle the span was fully large enough to drive a semi through it was composed of a black substance that seemed to be neither stone nor metal cautiously i ran my hand over its textured surface it was petrified wood in its center was a circular scrollwork knocker of black iron and this i used there was surprisingly little noise but almost immediately the door swung inward at first i could see nothing the creeping mist had curled itself around the twilight plunging me into a dank and uncomfortable night yes it was a melodious voice light and airy a womans voice i told her my name i am so sorry she said we tend to lose track of time at fuego del aire i am marissa of course you were expected my brother will be extremely angry that you were not met at the quay its all right i said i thoroughly enjoyed the walk wont you come in i picked up my suitcase and crossed the threshold felt her slim hand slip into mine the hallway was as dark as the night outside i did not hear the door swing shut but when i looked back the sky and the rolling mist were gone i heard the rustling of her just in front of me and i could smell a scent like a hillside of flowers at dusk her skin was as soft as velvet but the flesh beneath was firm and supple and i found myself suddenly curious to find out what she looked like did she resemble the image in my thoughts a thin pale waiflike creature faint blue traceries of veins visible beneath her thin delicate skin her long hair as black as a ravens wings after what seemed an interminable time we emerged into a dimly lighted chamber from which all other rooms on this floor seemed to branch directly ahead of us an enormous staircase wound upward it was certainly wide enough for twenty people to ascend abreast torches flickered and the smoky perfumed air was thick with the scent of burning tallow and whale oil uncomfortable looking furniture lined the walls bare wooden stiffbacked benches and chairs one might find in a methodist church huge heavy banners hung limply but they were so high above my head and the light so poor i could not make out their designs marissa turned to face me and i saw that she was not at all as i had imagined her true she was beautiful enough but her cheeks were ruddy her eyes cornflower blue and her hair was the color of sundazzled honey falling in thick gentle waves from a thin tortoiseshell band that held it from her face back over her head across her shoulders cascading all the way down to the small of her back her coral lips pursed as if she could not help the smile that now brightened her face yes she said softly musically you are truly surprised im sorry i said am i staring i gave an unnatural laugh of course i was staring i could not stop perhaps you are weary from your climb would you like some food now a cool drink to refresh you i would like to meet morodor i said breaking my eyes away from her gaze with a concerted effort she seemed to possess an ability to draw emotion out of me as if she held the key to channels in myself i did not know existed in time she said you must be patient there are many pressing matters that need attending to only he can see to them i am certain you understand indeed i did not to have come this far to have waited so long all i felt was frustration like a hurt little boy i had wanted morodor to greet me at the front door by way of apology for the discourtesy of the utter stillness at the quay when i arrived but no there were more important matters for him when i wrote to your brother marissa had lifted her long pale palm please she said smiling be assured that my brother wishes to aid you i suspect that is because he is a writer himself there is much time here at fuego del aire and lately his contemplation has found this somewhat more physical outlet i thought of the grisly stories the ferryboat captain had heaped on meand others over time that had come my way from other loquacious mouthsand felt a chill creeping through my bones at the idea of morodors physical outlets it must be fascinating to be able to write novels marissa said i must confess that i was quite selfishly happy when i learned of your coming your writing has given me much pleasure she touched the back of my hand as if i might be a sculpture of great artistry this extraordinary talent must make you very desirable in your world you mean literary circles entertainment circles yes you are quite special my brother doubtless divined this from your letter she took her fingertips from me but now it is late and i am certain you are tired may i show you to your room food and drink are waiting for you there that night there was no moon or rather no moon could be seen nor the stars nor even the sky itself peering out the window of my turret room i could see nothing but the whiteness of the mist it was as if the rest of the world had vanished gripping the edge of the windowsill with my fingers i leaned out as far as i dared peering into the night in an attempt to pick up any outline any shape but not even the tops of the enormous pines could poke their way through the pall i strained to hear the comforting hiss and suck of the ocean spending itself on the rocky shore so far below me there was nothing of that only the odd intermittent whistling of the wind through the stifffingered turrets of the castle at length i went back to bed but for the longest time i could not fall asleep i had waited so long for morodors reply to my letter had traveled for so many days just to be here now it seemed impossible to relax enough for sleep to overtake me i was itchy with anticipation oh more i was burning in the days after i had received his affirmative answer the thought of coming here of talking to him of learning his secrets had more and more come to stand for my own salvation it is perhaps difficult enough for any author to be blocked in his work but for me i lived to write without it there seemed no reason at all to live for i had found during this blocked time that the days and nights passed like months years centuries as ponderous as old elephants they had become my burden i had been like a machine feverishly turning out one book after anotherone a yearfor how many years now fifteen twenty you see the enfant terrible has lost count already mercifully until this year when there was nothing a desert of paper and i grew increasingly desperate sitting home like a hermit traveling incessantly bringing smiling girls home abstaining swinging from one extreme to the other like a human pendulum in an attempt to get the insides in working order again nothing and then one drunken night i had heard the first of the stories about fuego del aire and even through the vapors of my stupor something had penetrated an idea perhaps or more accurately at that point the ghost of an idea of lost love betrayal and the ultimate horror as simple as that and as complex but i knew that imagination was no longer enough that i would have to seek out this place myself i had to find morodor and somehow persuade him to see me sleep i swear to you it finally came although oddly it was like no slumber i had ever had for i dreamed that i was awake and trying desperately to fall asleep i knew that i was to see morodor in the morning that i had to be sharp and that sleepless i would fall far short of that in the dream i lay awake clutching the bedspread up around my chest staring at the ceiling with such intensity that i suspected at any minute i would be able to see right through it i opened my eyes or closed them and opened them again to find the dawnlight streaming through the tall narrow window i had forgotten to close the curtains before going to bed for just an instant i had the strangest sensation in my body it was as if my legs had gone dead all the strength flowing out of my muscles and into the wooden floor of my room but the paralysis had somehow freed my upper torso so that i felt an enormous outpouring of energy a brief stab of fear rustled through my chest and my heart fluttered but as soon as i sat up the sensation went away i rose washed dressed and went down to breakfast food was waiting in steaming array along the length of an immense wooden table in fact now that i had my first good look at fuego del aire in the light of day i saw that everything was of wood the paneled walls the floor where you could see it between the series of darkpatterned carpets the cathedral ceilings door handles windowsills even the lighting fixtures if i had not seen the outside of the castle myself i would have sworn the place had been built entirely of wood two formal settings were laid out one at the head of the table and the other by its left side assuming the first was for morodor i settled into the side chair and began to help myself but it was not morodor who came down the wide staircase it was marissa she was that morning a sight to make the heart pound it was as if the sun had detached itself from its prescribed route across the heavens and had descended to earth she wore a skyblue tunic wrapped crisscross between her breasts and around her narrow waist with a deep green satin sash on her feet she wore rope sandals i saw that one of her toes was girdled by a tiny gold ring her smile as she approached had the warmth of summer itself and her hair how can i adequately describe the way her hair shone in the daylight sparkling and glittering as if each strand were itself some mysterious source of light those waves of golden honey acted as if they had a life of their own good morning she said easily did you sleep well yes i lied perfectly i lifted a bowl of green figs fruit yes please just a bit but even with that she left more on her plate than she ate i was hoping to find your brother already awake i said finishing up my meal she smiled sweetly unfortunately he is not an early riser be patient all will be well she rose if you are finished i imagine you are quite curious about fuego del aire there is much here to see we went out of the main hall through corridors and chambers one after another so filled so disparate that i soon became dizzied with wonder the place seemed to go on forever at length we emerged into a room that judging by its accouterments must once have been a scullery we crossed it quickly and went through a small door i did not see until marissa pulled it open the mist of last night had gone completely and above was only an enormous cerulean sky clear of cloud or bird i could hear the distant sea hurling itself with ceaseless abandon at the jagged base of the mount but lowering my gaze i saw only foliage the garden marissa breathed slipping her hand into mine come on she took me past a field of tiger lilies rows of flowering woodbine through a rose garden of such humbling perfection it took my breath away beyond we came upon a long sculptured hedge half again as tall as i stand there was a long narrow opening through which she led me and immediately we were surrounded by high walls of hedges they were lushly verdant and immaculately groomed so that it was impossible to say where one left off and another began seamless on and on and what is this place i said but marissa did not answer until after many twistings and turnings we were deep within then she faced me and said this is the labyrinth my brother had it constructed for me when i was just a child perhaps he thought it would keep me out of trouble there is a way out i said uneasily looking around me at the darkgreen screens looming up on every side oh yes she laughed a belllike silvery tone it is up here and tapped the side of her head with a slender forefinger this is where i come to think when i am sad or distraught it is so peaceful and still and no one can find me here if i choose to remain hidden not even morodor this is my domain she began to lead me onward through switchbacks past culdesacs moving as unerringly as if she were a magnet being drawn toward the north pole and i followed her silently i was already lost my brother used to say to me marissa this labyrinth is unique in all the world for i have made it from the blueprint of your mind all these intricate convolutions the pattern corresponds to the eddies and whorls of your own brain she stared at me with those huge mocking eyes so blue it seemed as if the noonday sky were reflected there the hint of a smile played at the corners of her lips but of course i was only a child then and always trying to do what he did to be like him she shrugged he was most likely trying to make me feel special dont you think he wouldnt need this place to do that i said how on earth do you find your way out of here nothing she had said had lessened my uneasiness the years she said seriously have taken care of that she pulled at me and we sat our torsos in the deep shade of the hedges our stretchedout legs in the buttery warmth of the sunlight somewhere close at hand a bumblebee buzzed fatly contentedly i put my head back and watched the play of light and shadow on the hedge opposite us ten thousand tiny leaves moved minutely in the soft breeze as if i were watching a distant crowd fluttering lifted handkerchiefs at the arrival of some visiting emperor a kind of dreamy warmth stole over me and at once my uneasiness was gone yes i told her it is peaceful here i am glad she said you feel it too perhaps that is because you are a writer a writer feels things more deeply is that not so i smiled maybe some yes were always creating characters for our stories so we have to be adept at pulling apart the people we meet we have to be able to get beyond the world and like a surgeon expose their workings and youre never frightened of such things frightened why of what youll find there ive discovered many things there over the years how could all of them be pleasant why should i want them to be i sometimes think that many of my colleagues live off the unpleasant traits they find beneath the surface i shrugged in any event nothing seems to work well without the darkness of conflict in life as well as in writing her eyes opened and she looked at me sideways am i wrong to think that knowledge is very important to you what could be more important to a writer i sometimes think there is a finite amount of knowledgenot to be assimilatedbut that can be used and that is why you have come here yes she looked away you have never married why is that i shrugged while i thought about that for a moment i imagine its because ive never fallen in love she smiled at that never ever not in all the time i laughed now wait a minute im not that old thirtyseven is hardly ancient thirtyseven she mouthed softly as if she were repeating words alien to her thirtyseven really yes i was puzzled how old are you as old as i look she tossed her hair i told you last night time means very little here oh yes day to day but i mean you must no more talk now she said rising and pulling at my hand there is too much to see we left the labyrinth by a simple enough path though left to myself i undoubtedly would have wandered around in there until someone had the decency to come and get me presently we found ourselves at a stone parapet beyond which the peak dropped off so precipitously that it seemed as if we were standing on the verge of a rift in the world this was the western face of the island one that i had not seen on my journey here far below uscertainly more than a thousand feetthe sea creamed and sucked at the jagged rocks iced at their base by shining palegray barnacles three or four large lavender and white gulls dipped and wheeled through the foaming spray as they searched for food beautiful isnt it marissa said but i had already turned from the dark face of the sea to watch the planes and hollows of her own shining face lit by the soft summer light all rose and golden radiating a warmth it took me some time to understand the true nature of that heat it stemmed from the same spot deep inside me from which had leaped that sharp momentary anger marissa i breathed saying her name as if it were a prayer and she turned to me her cornflower blue eyes wide her full lips slightly parted shining i leaned over her coming closer inch by inch until i had to shut my eyes or cross them then i felt the brush of her lips against mine so incredibly soft at first cool and fragrant then quickly warming to bloodheat no she said her voice muffled by our flesh oh dont but her lips opened under mine and i felt her hot tongue probing into my mouth my arms went around her pulling her to me as gently as i would handle a stalk of wheat i could feel the hard press of her breasts the round softness of her stomach and the heat the heat rising and with the lightning comes the rain thats from an old poem my mother used to sing to me late at night when the storms woke me up i cannot remember any more of it now its just a fragment of truth an artifact unearthed from the silty riverbed of my mind and i the archeologist of this region as puzzled as everyone else at what i sometimes find but that after all is what has kept me writing year after year an engine of creation the night is impenetrable with cloud and the hissing downpour but still i stand at my open window high up above the city at the very edge of heaven i cannot see the streets below methe one or two hurrying people beneath their trembling umbrellas or the lights of the cars if indeed there are any out at this ungodly hourjust the spectral geometric patterns charcoalgray on black of the buildings tops closest to mine but not as high none of them is as high nothing exists now but this tempest and its fury the night is alive with it juddering and crackling or am i wrong is the night alive with something else i know i know i hear the sound of them now the days passed like the most intense of dreams the kind where you can recall every single detail any time you wish producing its emotions again and again with a conjurers facility being with marissa i forgot about my obsessive desire to seek out morodor i no longer asked her where he was or when i would get to see him in fact i hoped i never would for if there were any truth to the legends of fuego del aire they most assuredly must stem from his dark soul and not from this creature of air and light who never left my side in the afternoons we strolled through the endless gardensfor she was ill at ease indoorsand holding her hand seemed infinitely more joyous than looking upon the castles illimitable marvels i fully believe that if we had chanced upon a griffin during one of those walks i would have taken no more notice of it than i would an alley cat however no such fabled creature made its appearance and as the time passed i became more and more convinced that there was no basis at all to the stories that had been told and retold over the years the only magical power marissa possessed was the one that enabled her to cut to the very core of me with but one word or the merest touch of her flesh against mine i lied to you i told her one day it was late afternoon thick dark sunlight slanted down on our shoulders and backs as slowrunning as honey the cicadas wailed like beaten brass and butterflies danced like living jewels in and out of the low bushes and the blossoms as if they were a flock of children playing tag about what when i said that i had never been in love i turned over on my back staring up at a fleecy cloud piled high a castle in the sky i was once i took her hand rubbed my thumb over the delicate bones ribbing the back it was when i was in college we met in a child psychology class and fell in love without even knowing it for a moment there was a silence between us and i thought perhaps i had made a mistake in bringing it up but you did not marry her no why not we were from different backgrounds i turned to see her face peering at me seeming as large as the sun in the sky i think it would be difficult to explain to you marissa it had something to do with religion religion again she rolled a word off her tongue as if trying to get the taste of a new and exotic food i am not certain that i understand we believed in different thingsor more accurately she believed and i didnt and there was no room for compromise in this no but the ironic part of all of it is that now i have begun to believe if just a little bit and she i think has begun to disbelieve some of what she had always held sacred how sad marissa said will you go back to her our time has long passed something curious had come into her eyes then you believe that love has a beginning and an end always i could no longer bear to have those fantastic eyes riveting me i had thought so why do you look away i i watched the sky the cloudcastle had metamorphosed into a great humpbacked bird i dont know her eyes were very clear piercing though the natural light was dusky we are explorers she said at the very precipice of time something in her voice drew me can there really be a love without end now she began to search my face in detail as if she were committing it to memory as if she might never see me again and that wild thought brought me fully out of my peaceful dozing do you love me yes i whispered with someone elses voice like a dry wind through sere reeds and pulled her down to me at night we seemed even closer it was as if i had taken a bit of the sun to bed with me she was as radiant at night as she was during the day light and supple and so eager to be held to be caressed to be loved feel how i feel she whispered trembling when i am close to you she stretched herself over me the mouth can lie with words but the body cannot this heat is real all love flows out through the body do you know that i was beyond being able to respond verbally she moved her fingertips on me then the petal softness of her palms i feel your body how you respond to me its depth as if i were the moon and you the sea her lips were at my ear her esses sibilant it is important more important than you know why i sighed because only love can mend my heart i wondered at the scar there i moved against her opening her legs darling i met morodor on the first day of my second week at fuego del aire and then it seemed quite by chance it was just after breakfast and marissa had gone back to her room to change i was strolling along the secondfloor balustrade when i came across a niche in the wall that i had missed before i went through it and found myself on a parapet along the jutting north side of the castle it was like hanging in midair and i would have been utterly stunned by the vista had i not almost immediately run into a dark towering shape hastily i backed up against the stone wall of the castle thinking i had inadvertently run into another outcropping of this odd structure then quite literally it seemed as if a shadow had come to life it detached itself from the edge of the parapet and now i could see that it was the figure of a man he must have been nearly seven feet tall and held about him a great ebon cape thick and swirling that rushed down his slender form so that it hissed against the stone floor when he moved he turned toward me and i gasped his face was long and narrow as bony as a corpses his skin fully as pale his eyes beneath darkly furred brows were bits of bituminous matter as if put there to plug a pair of holes into his interior his nose was long and thin to the point of severity but his lips were full and rubicund providing the only bit of color to his otherwise deathly pallid face his lips opened infinitesimally and he spoke my name involuntarily i shuddered and immediately saw something pass across his eyes not anger or sorrow but rather a weary kind of resignation how do you do the greeting was so formal that it startled me and i was tonguetied after all this time he had faded from my mind and now i longed only to be with marissa i found myself annoyed with him for intruding upon us morodor i said i had the oddest impulse to tell him that what he needed most was a good dose of sunshine that almost made me giggle almost pardon me for saying this but i thought that is to see you up and around outside in the daylight i stopped my cheeks burning unable to go on i had done it anyway i cursed myself for the fool that i was but morodor took no offense he merely smileda perfectly ghastly sightand inclined his head a fraction a rather common misconception he said in his disturbing rumbling voice it is in fact direct sunlight that is injurious to my health i am like a fine old print his dark hair brushed against his high forehead i quite enjoy the daytime otherwise but surely you must sleep sometime he shook his great head sleep is unknown to me if i slept i would dream and this is not allowed me he took a long hissing stride along the parapet come he said let us walk i looked back the way i had come and he said marissa knows we are together do not fear she will be waiting for you when we are finished together we walked along the narrow parapet apparently it girdled the entire castle for i saw no beginning to it and no end you may wonder morodor said in his booming vibratory voice why i granted you this interview his great cape swept around him like the coils of a midnight sea so that it seemed as if he kept the night around him wherever he went i sensed in your writing a certain desperation he turned to me and desperation is an emotion with which i can empathize it was kind of you to see me kind yes but i must confess that things have changed since i wrote that letter indeed was that a vibratory warning yes i plunged onward in fact since i came here i i paused not knowing how to continue the change has come since i arrived at fuego del aire morodor said nothing and we continued our perambulation around the perimeter of the castle now i could accurately judge just how high up we were perhaps that mist i had seen the first night had been a cloud passing us as if across the face of the moon and why not all things seemed possible here it struck me as ridiculous that just fifty miles from here there were supertankers and express trains learjets and paved streets lined with shops dispensing sleekly packaged products manufactured by multinational corporations surely all those modern artifacts were part of a fading dream i once had the sea was clear of sails for as far as the horizon it was a flat and glittering pool there solely for the pleasure of this man im in love with your sister i had blurted it out and now i stood stunned waiting i suppose for the full brunt of his wrath but instead he stopped and stared at me then he threw his head back and laughed a deep booming sound like thunder far off a gull screeched perhaps in alarm my dear sir he said you really are the limit and shes in love with me oh oh oh i have no doubt that she is i dont his brows gathered darkly like stormclouds you believe your race to be run he moved away but fear not love ends it through another niche he slid back inside the castle it was as if he had passed through the wall if i had known that today was the day marissa said i would have prepared you for what we were sitting in a bower on a swingchaise above our heads arched brilliant hyacinth and bougainvillea wrapped around and around a white wooden trellis it was near dusk and the garden was filled with a deep sapphire light that was almost luminescent a westerly wind brought us the rich scent of the sea for him we are not very much alike at least superficially marissa i said taking her hand are you certain that you are morodors sister of course i am what do you mean well its obvious isnt it but when she looked at me blankly i was forced to go on what i mean is hes precisely what hes supposed to be at least the way the legends describe what he is her eyes grew dark and she jerked her hand away she gave me a basilisk stare i should have known her voice was filled with bitter contempt youre just like the rest and why shouldnt you be she stood you think hes a monster yes admit it a monster her eyes welled up with tears and that makes me a monster too doesnt it well to hell with you and she whirled away marissa i cried in anguish thats not what i meant at all and i ran after her knowing that it was a lie that it was what i had meant after all morodor was all the legends had said he should be and more my god but he was hideous pallid and cold as the dead an engine of negative energy incapable of any real feeling of crying or true humor or love only love can mend my heart i had meant it how could this golden girl of air and sunlight bear any family ties to that great looming figure of darkness where was the sense in it the rationality she had feelings she laughed and cried felt pleasure and pain and she loved she loved marissa i called again running marissa come back but she had vanished into the labyrinth and i stood there on the threshold the scent of roses strong in my nostrils and peered within i called out her name over and over again but she did not appear and unguided i could not bring myself to venture farther instead i stormed back to the castle searching for morodor it was already dark and the lights had been lit as if by magic in just the same way that the food was prepared the wine bottles uncorked my bed turned down in the evening and made in the morning my soiled clothes washed pressed and laid out with the professionals precision and all done without my seeing a soul i found morodor in the library it was a room as large as a gallery at least three floors of books rising upward until the neat rows were lost in the haze of distance narrow wooden walkways circled the library at various levels connected by a complex network of wide wooden ladders he was crouched on one of these three or four steps off the floor it seemed an odd position for a man of his size he was studying a book as i came in but he quietly closed it when he heard me approach what i said rather nastily no leather bindings his hard ebon eyes regarded me without obvious emotion leather he said softly would mean the needless killing of animals oh i see my tone had turned acid its only humans who need fear you he stood up and i backed away abruptly fearful as he unfolded upward and upward until he stood over me in all his monstrous height humans he said fear me only because they choose to fear me you mean you havent given them any cause to fear you dont be absurd he was as close to being annoyed as i had seen him i cannot help being what i am just as you cannot we are both carnivores i closed my eyes and shuddered but with what a difference to some i have been a god such a dark god my eyes flew open there is a need for that too he put the book way yet i am a man for all that a man who cant sleep who doesnt dream who cannot die not even if i drive a stake through your heart i did not know whether or not i was serious he went across the room to where a strip of the wooden paneling intervened between two bookshelves his hand merged from the folds of his voluminous cape and for the first time i saw the long talonlike nails exposed i shivered as i saw them dig into the wood with ferocious strength but not in any hot animal way the movement was as precise as a surgeon peeling back a patients peritoneum morodor returned with a shard of wood perhaps eighteen inches in length it was slightly tapered at one end not needle sharp but pointed enough to do its work he thrust it into my hands here he said harshly do it now for an instant i intended to do just that but then something inside me cooled i threw the stake from me ill do no such thing he actually seemed disappointed no matter that part of the legend as others is incorrect he went back to his perch on the ladder his long legs drawn up tightly beneath the cape the outline of his bony knees like a violent set of punctuation marks on a blank page legends he said are like funerals they both serve the same purpose they give comfort without which the encroachment of terrifying entropy would snuff out mans desirehis absolute hungerfor life he looked from his long nails up into my face legends are created to set up their own kind of terror but it is a terror very carefully bounded by certain limitations the werewolf can be killed by a silver bullet the medusa by seeing her own reflection in a mirror you see always there is a way out for the intrepid it is a necessary safety valve venting the terror that lurks within all mankindatavistic darkness the unconscious and death he rested his long arms in his lap how secure do you imagine mankind would feel if all of them out there knew the reality of it that there is no escape for me no stake through the heart but you said direct sunlight was injurious to me like the flu nothing more he smiled wanly a week or two in bed and i am fit again he laughed sardonically assuming i believe you why are you telling me this by your own admission mankind could not accept the knowledge then you wont tell them will you but i know he took a deep breath and for the first time his eyes seemed to come to life sparking and dancing within their deep fleshless sockets why did you wish to come here my friend why i told you in the letter i was blocked out of ideas and now i stared at him quizzically while it slowly began to wash over me i can tell them cant i he smiled sphinxlike you are a writer you can tell them anything you wish when i told you before that i was a man i meant it i was sitting with morodor high up in one of the castles peaks in what he called the cloud room like all the other chambers i had been in here it was paneled in wood i have a hunger to live just like all the rest of the masses he leaned back in his chair shifting about as if he were uncomfortable to his left and right enormous windows stood open to the starry field of the night there were no shutters no curtains they could not be closed a sharp chill wind blew in ruffling his dark hair but he seemed oblivious to the caress but do not mistake my words i speak not as some plutocrat bloated on wealth it is only that i am special what happened his eyes flashed and he shifted again in each case it is different in mine well let us say that my hunger for life outweighed my caution he smiled bleakly but then i have never believed that caution was a desirable trait wont you tell me more he looked at me in the most avuncular fashion i entered into a wager with someone and you won no i lost but it was meant that i should lose otherwise i would not be here now his eyes had turned inward and in so doing had become almost wistful i threw the dice one time up against a wall of green baize you crapped out no i entered into life and became el amor brujo thats what youre sometimes called the love sorcerer because of my hypnotic effect on women he moved minutely and his cape rustled all about him like a copse of trees stirred by a midnight wind a survival trait like seeing in the dark or having builtin radar then theres nothing magical there is he said magic involved one learns many arts over the years i have time for everything i shivered pulled my leather jacket closer about me he might not mind the chill but i did i pointed to the walls tell me something the outside of fuego del aire is pure stone but here inside there is only wood why is that i prefer wood my friend i am not a creature of the earth and so stone insults me its density inhibits me i feel more secure with the wood his hand lifted fluttered dropped back into his lap trees he said it almost as if it were a sacred word in the ensuing silence i began to sweat despite the coldness i knew what i at least was leading up to i rubbed my palms down the fabric of my trousers i cleared my throat morodor yes his eyes were halfshut as if he were close to sleep i really do love marissa i know that but there seemed no kindness in his voice i took a deep breath we had a row she thinks i see you as a monster he did not move his eyes did not open any wider for which i was profoundly grateful in a world where so many possibilities exist this is true yet i am also a man and i am marissas brother i am friend foe master servant it is all in the perception still he did not move what do you see my friend i wished hed stop calling me that i said nothing if you are not truthful with me i shall know it his ruby lips seemed to curve upward at their corners something else you may add to the new legend if you choose to write about it ive no wish to deceive you morodor im merely trying to sort through my own feelings i thought he nodded slightly i confess to finding your appearance startling i appreciate your candor oh hell i thought you were hideous i see you hate me now why should i hate you because you take the world view but that was at first already youve changed before my eyes god knows ive tried but now i dont even find your appearance odd as if divining my thoughts he said and this disturbs you it does he nodded his head again quite understandable it will pass he looked at me but you are afraid of that too yes i said softly soon you shall meet my sister again i shook my head i dont understand of course you dont now his voice sounded softer have patience my friend you are young enough still to rush headlong over the precipice merely to discover what is beyond it thats why i came here i know but that time has passed now life has you by the throat and it will be a struggle to the end his eyes flew open seeming as hot as burning coals and who shall be the victor my friend when you have the answer to that you shall understand it all i ate dinner alone that night i had spent hours searching the castle for marissa but it was as if she had vanished weary at last i returned to the dining hall and availed myself of vast quantities of the hot food i was terrified and i thought that this would act as an inhibitor on my appetite but strangely just the opposite was happening i ate and ate as if this alone could assuage my fear it was morodor i was terrified of i knew that but was it because i feared him or liked him afterward it was all i could do to drag myself up the staircase i stumbled down the hallway and into bed without even removing my clothes i slept a deep dreamless sleep but when i opened my eyes it was still dark out i turned over about to return to sleep when i heard a sound i sat bolt upright the short hairs at the back of my neck stiff and quivering silence and out of the silence a weird thin cry i got off the bed about to open the door to the hallway when it came again and i turned it was coming from outside in the blackness of the night i threw open the shutters wide and leaned out just as i had on my first night here this time there was no mist stars shone intermittently through the gauzy cloud cover with a fierce cold light blinking on and off as if they were silently appealing for help at first i saw nothing hearing only the high soughing of the wind through the pines then off to my left so high up that i mistook it for another cloud something moved i turned my head in that direction and saw a shape a good deal darker than a cloud it blossomed with sickening speed blacker even than the night wraith or dream which was it the noise of the flapping wings leathery horned andwhatscabbed conjured up in my mind the image of a giant bat precariously i leaned farther out saw that it was heading for the open apertures of the cloud room i hurled myself across the room and out the door heading up the stairs in giant bounds consequently i was somewhat out of breath by the time i launched myself through the open doorway to the aerie and there found only morodor he turned quickly from his apparent contemplation of the sky you should be asleep he said but something in his tone told me that i had been expected something woke me not a nightmare i trust a sound from the night it was nothing to do with me it is usually quite still here what kind of sound it sounded like a scream a terrible cry morodor only stared at me unblinking until i was forced to go on i went to the window and looked out i saw a shape i could not clearly identify i heard the awful sound of bat wings oh morodor said thats quite impossible we have none here ive seen to that bats are boring really as with octopi im afraid their ferocious reputation has been unjustly thrust upon them just what the hell did i see then morodors hand lifted fell the arch of a great avian wing whatever it was it brought you up here then there was something there i said in triumph you admit it i admit said morodor carefully that i wanted to see you the fact is you are here you and i i said but what of marissa i have been looking for her all evening i must see her do you think it wise to see her now to continue what has begun knowing what you do about me but she is nothing like you you two are the shadow and the light morodors gaze was unwavering two sides of the coin my friend the same coin i was fed up with his oblique answers perhaps i said sharply its just that you dont want me to see her after all im an outsider i dont belong at fuego del aire but if thats the case let me warn you i wont be balked thats the spirit his hand clenched into a fist forget all about that which you saw from your bedroom window it has nothing to do with you his tone was mocking a bird i said uncertainly thats all it was my friend he said calmly there is no bird as large as the one you saw tonight and he reached out for the first time i felt his chill touch as his long fingers gripped my shoulder with a power that made me wither inside come he commanded over here at the windowledge i stood there dazed with shock as he let go of me and leaped out into the night i screamed reaching out to save him thinking that after all his apparent melancholy signaled a wish to die then i saw his great ebon cape ballooning out like a sail drawn upward by the crosscurrents and for the first time i saw what had been hidden beneath its voluminous folds i had thought he wore the thing as an affectation because it was part of the legend but now i understood what care had he for legends he wore the cape for practical reasons for now from under it spread a pair of the most extraordinary wings i had ever seen they were glossy and pitch black as far away from bats wings as you could get for one thing they were feathered or at least covered in long silky strips that had the appearance of feathers for another they were as supple as a hummingbirds and quite as beautiful and made even more so by the thick muscular tendons by which they were attached to his back it was like seeing the most beautifully developed torso hard muscle tone combined with sleek line and yet and yet there was more in the most literal sense because more musculature was required in order for those massive wings to support the weight of the rest of the body those wings sharply angled and hard delicate as brushstrokes they beat at the air like heroic engines they were a magnificent creation nothing less than a crowning achievement an evolutionary pinnacle of the creator but out of the wonder came terror and i thought marissa my god my god he means to turn her into this el amor brujo without a word i turned and bolted from the room taking the steps three at a time i returned to the second floor and there found marissa asleep in her own bed my heart beating like a triphammer i brought a light close to her face but no an exhalation hissed from my mouth there was no change but still i feared morodor and what he could do to her marissa i whispered urgently marissa wake up i shook her but she would not waken hurling the light aside i bent and scooped her up in my arms turning i kicked the door wide and hurried down the stairs where i thought to go at that moment remains a mystery to me still all i know was that i had to get marissa away from that place the way to the disused scullery i knew and this was the route i took outside the wind ruffled my hair but marissa remained asleep i carried her through the field of tiger lilies and the woodbine down the center aisle of the vast rose garden to the verge of the labyrinth without thinking i took her inside it was dark there darker than the night with the high ebon walls textured like stucco looming up on every side i stumbled down the narrow pathways turning now left or right at random until i knew that i was truly lost but at least morodor could not find us and i had with me this places only key panting my muscles aching i knelt on the grass and set marissa down beside me i looked around all i could hear was the faroff whistle of the wind as if diminished by time even the booming surf was beyond hearing now i sat back and wiped my brow staring down at that golden face so innocent in repose so shockingly beautiful i could not allow marissas eyes opened and i helped her to sit up what has happened i was awakened by a strange sound i told her i saw your brother outside the castle i thought at first it was a bird but when i went to find out i saw him she looked at me but said nothing i gripped her shoulders i had begun sweating again marissa i said hoarsely he was flying her eyes brightened and she leaned toward me kissed me hard on the lips then its happened the time is here time i echoed her stupidly time for what for the change she said as if talking to a slowwitted child yes i said i suspected as much thats why ive brought you into the labyrinth were safe here her brows furrowed safe safe from what from morodor i said desperately he cant touch you here now he cannot change you youll stay like this forever youll never have to look like him for the first time i saw fright in her eyes i dont understand she shivered didnt he tell you tell me what i hung on to her i ran out of there as soon as i saw him oh no she cried its all destroyed now all destroyed she put her face in her hands weeping bitterly marissa i said softly holding her close please dont cry i cant bear it ive saved you why are you crying she shook me off and stared wideeyed at me even tearstreaked she was exquisitely beautiful it did not matter that she was filled with pain no emotion could alter those features not even it seemed time itself only morodor her haunted brother he was supposed to tell you to prepare you she said between sobs now it has all gone wrong marissa i said stroking her dont you know i love you ive said it and i meant it nothing can change that as soon as we get out of here well tell me how deep is your love for me she was abruptly icily calm how deep can any emotion be i dont think it can be measured do not be so certain of that she whispered until youve heard me out she put her hands up before her body steepling them as if they were a churchs spire it is not morodor who will work the change it is you me and it has already begun my head was whirling and i put the flat of my hand against the ground as if to balance myself what are you saying the change comes only when we are in love and that love is returned when we find a mate the emotion and its reflection releases some chemical catalyst hidden deep inside our dna helices which has remained dormant until triggered her fingers twined and untwined anxiously this is not a state that can be borne alone it is far too lonely so this is how it is handled an imperative of nature no i cried no no no what youre telling me is impossible its madness it is life and life only your life not mine i stood up stumbled but i could not escape the gaze of her lambent eyes i stared at her in mounting horror liar i cried where is morodors mate if this is true away she said calmly feeding my god i whirled away my god and slammed into the prickly wall of a hedge can love hold so much terror for you she asked you have a responsibility to yourself as well as to me isnt that what love is but i could no longer think clearly i only knew that i must get away from them both the change has already begun she had said i did not think that i wanted to see the fruits of that terrible metamorphosis not after having known her and loved her like this all air and sunlight two sides of the coin wasnt that what i had said to morodor how he must have laughed at that yes two sides but of the same coin dont you see i heard her voice but could no longer see her you have nothing to fear it is your destiny our destiny together howling i clawed my way from her staggering tripping as i ran through the labyrinth my only coherent thought was to somehow get to the sea and then to hurl myself into its rocking embrace to swim to swim and if i were lucky i would at last be thrown up onto the soft sand of some beach far far away but the night had come alive with shadows drenched in my own terror and like a mirror they threw up to me the ugly writhing apparitions from the very bottom of my soul thrusting them rudely into the light for me to view and above me the sound of wings even through the horrendous tattoo of the storm i can make out that sound its the same sound that reached down into my heavy slumber that night in fuego del aire and wrenched me awake i did not know it then but i know it now but i know many things now that i did not then i have had time to think to think and to write sometimes they are one and the same like tonight coming to terms i have never been able to do that i have never wanted to do that my writing kept me fluid moving in and out as the spirit took me new york today capri the next the world was my oyster but what of me the sound is louder now that high keening whistle like the wind through the pines it buzzes through my brain like a downed bottle of vintage champagne i feel lightheaded but more than that lightbodied because i know i know there is nothing but excitement inside me now all the fear and the horror i felt in the labyrinth leached away from me i have had six months to contemplate my destiny morodor was right for each one it is different the doorway metamorphoses to suit the nature of the individual for me it is love i denied that when marissa confronted me with the process of her transmogrification such beauty how could i lose that i thought it took me all of this time to understand that it was not her i feared losing but myself marissa will always be marissa but what of me change is what we fear above all else and i am no different was no different i have already forgotten the golden creature of fuego del aire she haunts my dreams still but i remember only her inner self it is somehow like death this acceptance of life perhaps this is where the legends began all around me the city sleeps on safe and secure wrapped in the arms of the myths of its own creation shhh dont bother to disturb it no one would listen anyway the beating of the wings is very loud now drowning out even the heavy pulsing of the rain it reverberates in my mind like a heartbeat dimming sight taste touch smell it dominates me in a way i thought only my writing could my shutters are open wide i am drenched by the rain buffeted by the chill wind i am buoyed up by them both i tremble at the thought i love i love those words a river of silver turning my bones hollow and now i lift my head to the place where last night the full moon rode calm and clear a ghostly ideogram written upon the air telling me that it is time for me to let go of all i know to plunge inward toward the center of my heart six months have passed and it is time i know for now the enormous thrumming emanates from that spot beatbeat beatbeat beatbeat the heartsound at last there in the night i see her face as she comes for me sunrise on running water by barbara hambly barbara hambly is the bestselling author of dozens of books including the vampire novels those who hunt the night traveling with the dead and renfield she has written many other novels as well such as the popular dragonsbane and its sequels as well as media tiein projects for star trek and star wars and original nongenre novels of historical fiction mystery and romance she is also the editor of the vampire anthology sisters of the night this story is about a vampire who is unfortunate enough to be on the titanic on that ships maiden and only voyage the genesis of the story was simple logistics the titanic loaded in dusk at cherbourg sank in darkness and the rescueboats made their appearance only minutes after full dawn hambly said if a vampire had been in one of the boats hed have been totally without powersbeing upon running water having shipped himself as dracula did in a box of earthand would have been faced with the horrible choice of spontaneously autocombusting at the first touch of sunlight or dropping overboard in the deepest portion of the atlantic ocean to lie paralyzed upon the ocean floorconscious and unable to either move or diepossibly forever the damn ship was supposed to be unsinkable do you think id have set foot on the wretched tub if it werent i embarked at cherbourg for a number of reasons chief among them being that the titanic entered port from southampton at sunset and loaded in the dusk ive never liked the thought of shipping myself in my coffin like a parcel with the attendant risks of inquisitive customsinspectors moronic baggagehandlers and all the tedious beforehand wrangling with a living accomplice who might or might not take the trouble to make sure ones coffin or trunkmost of us prefer extralarge double trunks for travel hasnt been installed in the hold liddown under several thousand pounds of some imbecilic american dowagers frocks half the time one has to kill the accomplice anyway usually its a pleasure are you sure you wish to do this napier inquired simon who had come down to the docks in a closed car to see me off being a century and a half older among the undead than ione of the oldest in europe in facthe is able to tolerate even more twilight waking slightly earlier and if need presses can prolong his wakefulness for a short time into the morning hours though of course only with adequate protection from the suns destructive light you wont be able to hunt once youre on board you know the white star line keeps very accurate manifests of its passengers even in third class it isnt like the old days simon i joked and laid my hand on his gloved wrist youve been vampire too long youre turning into a cautious old spookwhat do they call them these days a fuddyduddy i knew all about the passenger manifests id studied them closely wed hunted the night before close to sunrise id killed twice i knew it was going to be a long voyage seven or eight days from cherbourg to new york a span of time that bordered on dangerous for such as we i hoped i wasnt one of those vampires who turn crazy after four or five days without a killwho are so addicted to the pleasure of the death as well as to its simple nourishmentthat they hunt under conditions which are sure to bring them to the attention of authorities for instance among a limited and closely watched group of people but quite frankly i didnt know without a kill every few days we start to lose our ability to deceive and ensorcel the minds of the living a situation i had never permitted to occur this was the first time in a hundred and forty years that id traveled very far from london the first time since i had become vampire in that i had crossed the ocean when the undead travel they are horribly vulnerable money has always provided some protection in the form of bribes patent locks servants and social pressure why do you think its always evil lord soandso in the penny dreadfuls its astonishing how much interest bonds accumulate if allowed to mature for two centuries but as i was shortly to learn accidents do happen and the longer the journey the more the chances accumulate that something will go fearfully wrong theres a new world across the ocean simon i said making my voice grave face it europe cannot go on as it is war is going to break out the kaiser is practically jostling statesmen in doorways in the hopes of being challenged youve seen the new weapons they have airships incendiary bombs cannon that can demolish a city from miles away its a wise man who knows when to make his break for safety ninetyfive hours later i was kicking myself for those words but who knew simon smiled something he rarely does perhaps you are correct my friend be that so i trust you will act in the nature of a scout and send me word of the promised land now go if not with god at least with the blessing of an indifferent fate my evil lord he checked my papers for the name lord sandridge he put on his blacktinted spectacles and accompanied me to the barrier where he added the subtle influence of his mind to mine in the task of getting my luggage through unchecked i ascended the gangway and from the rail saw him wave a slim small form in dark gray perhaps my only friend among the undead we are not you understand particularly pleasant company even for one another then i went down to the firstclass luggage hold to make sure my coffintrunk was both accessible and inconspicuous simon i presume returned home and slaughtered some unsuspecting immigrant en route for breakfast we put in at queenstown on the irish coast in the morning before our final embarkation over the deep its always a damnable struggle to remain awake in ones coffin for even a short time after the sun is in the sky but i was determined to make the effort and its a good thing i did shortly after id locked myself in for the daywe were still several hours from queenstown at that pointi heard stealthy steps on the deck and smelled the stink of a mans nervous sweat of course someone had noticed the obsessive care id taken in bestowing my trunk and had drawn the usual stupid conclusion that the living are prone to greedy sods skeleton keys rattled close to my head i forced down both grogginess and the quick flash of panic in my breastthe hold was absolutely sheltered from any chance of penetration by sunlightand fought to accumulate enough energy to act get away from here you stupid bastard the living have no idea how commanding are the rhythms of vampire flesh i felt as i had when in mortal life id gotten myself soddendrunk on opium at the hellfire club this ship stinks with american millionaires and youre trying to rob the trunk of a mere evil lord the outer lid opened then the inner i gazed up into a round unshaven face and brown eyes stretched huge with shock and fright i heaved myself up with what i hoped was a terrifying roar wrenched the skeleton keys out of the young mans hand and dropped back into the coffin hauling the lid down after me and slamming shut its inner bolt i heard outside a stifled gasping whimper then heavy shoes hammering away across the deck and up the metal stairs i understand he abandoned ship at queenstown and thus missed all subsequent events a pity drowning was too good for the little swine it wasnt fear of robbery however that made me struggle to remain awake through the boardingprocess at queenstown listening with a vampires preternatural senses to every sound every voice every footfall in the ship around me i had to know who was getting on the ship because of course i had not been completely truthful with simon as to my reasons for leaving england or for embarking at cherbourg for that matter one never likes to admit when one has made a very foolish mistake which brings me to the subject of miss alexandra paxton i dont know under what name she boarded the titanic she knew you see that id be keeping an eye on the passenger lists and would have changed my own travel plans had i suspected she was on board it is another truism of the more puerile examples of horror fiction that the victims of evil lord soandso or the wicked countess blankovsky are generally of the upper or at worst the professional classes this is sheer foolishness for these people keep track of one another particularly in a small country like england another motive for choosing america vampires for the most part live on the poor we kill people whom no one will miss regrettably these people tend to be dirty smelly undernourished frequently ginsoaked and conversationally uninteresting and we do enjoy the chase the catandmouse game the long slow luring for days and weeks at a time which is how id happened to meet and court and flirt with and take to the opera and eventually kill miss cynthia engle only a few days before she was to have wed lionel paxton lionel and his sister had sounded like a remarkably boring pair when miss engle had told me about them at our clandestine meetings edged with danger and champagne i hadnt allowed for my lovely victims craving for the melodramatic which discounted her suitors native shrewdness in any case after a train of events too complicated and messy to go into i had been obliged to kill lionel as well alexandra had been dogging me ever since she came aboard at queenstown at the last possible moment this was an unnecessary inconvenience on her part since as ive said the sun was high in the sky and i couldnt have come up out of the hold even if id been awake but i was aware of her as i lay in the strange clear awareness of the vampire sleep smelled the distinctive vanilla and sandalwood of her dustingpowder heard the sharp click of her stride on the decks and my heart sank there was no way i could kill her on board the titanic without causing a tremendous fuss and possibly being locked in a cabin which might contain a window which really would give the good captain smith something to write about in his log but her goal on the other hand was not survival i knew from a previous encounter that she wore about her neck and wrists silver chains that would effectively sear my flesh should i come in contact with them and carried a revolver loaded with silver bullets which she would not have the slightest hesitation about firing i also knew she was an extremely accurate shot i cant tell you exactly how the undead know when its safe to emerge from their hidingplaces there are those of us who can step forth in lingering nordic twilights with no more than frantic itching of the skin and a sense of intolerable panic others whose flesh will autocombust while the last morning stars are still visible in the sky our instinct in this matter is very strong howeverand those of us who lack it generally dont remain vampires very long i quit my coffintrunk the minute i felt i could do so safely around seventhirty thursday night and ascended the several flights of steps past the squash court and through the seamens and thirdclass quarters down the long crew corridor known as scotland road and through a maze of passages and emergency ladders eventually reached my own b deck stateroom in firstclass the advertising for the titanic had strongly implied that no firstclass passenger need be even aware that such things as lesser mortals existed on the shipanother reason id chosen the vessel for my escape sharpeyed stewards abounded to make sure those who paid for elevation above the great unwashed achieved it but they like most of the living thank god were prey to appearances i was deep in conversation with the young and extremely pretty wife of an elderly american millionaire when the door of the stair from below opened and miss paxton slipped through she was clothed in a gown that must have cost her at least half of what her unfortunate brother had to leave blue velvet with a bodice of creamcolored lace a little aigret of blue gems and creamcolored feathers adorned the springy thickness of her mousebrown hair she was a tall girl of the sort referred to by americans as a fine strapping lass her jaw was long her nose narrow and her bluegray eyes cool and daunting she carried a blue velvet handbag and a trailing mass of lace shawl draped in such a fashion as to conceal her right hand and whatever might have been in it and i fled like a rabbit before she even got a glimpse of me that young person i said to the head steward as i pressed a hundred dollars american into his hand is an impostor a confidence trickster who has been harassing me for a number of months i do not know under what pretext she will attempt to get near me nor do i wish to know only keep her away from me or from any room that i am in for the duration of this voyage understand yes sir certainly lord sandridge as i slipped through into the dining saloon an american matrons pekingese lunged at me in a fury of yapping they really should keep those nasty little vermin locked up of course that wasnt the end of miss paxton having guessed id be traveling firstclass she had invested god knows how much in a firstclass wardrobe so i was never sure i could avoid her merely by sticking to the a deck promenades nor could i afford to keep to my stateroom during the night hours when i was up and about she would i guessed be looking for me by whispers overheard from the cabin stewards and maidsand believe me a vampire can hear whispers through both locked doors and the conversation of american socialitesi guessed she had garnered allies among them by some tale of disinheritance persecution and attempted rape she stalked me most of that first night for she had a constitution of iron i was eventually reduced to donning an inconspicuous pair of trousers and a tweed jacket and hiding out on the thirdclass deck among the irish at sunrise i retired to my coffintrunk again but i did not sleep with anything resembling peace all through that day and the next i heard her footfalls smelled her blood and dustingpowder in the dark of my dreams as she moved through the holds i dreamed about her and i dreamed about the sea as mr stoker so obligingly pointed out in his book dracula wethe undeadcannot cross running water except at the hour of astronomical midnight and at the moment when the tide turns he is quite right it was more than dread that seized me when i and my vampire master stood on the threshold of london bridge and he ordered me across it was a sickness a weakness that paralyzed me as if death itself were rising from the moving river below us like poisoned mist my master laughed at me the bastard and we took a hackney cab across the river to hunt in later years wed take the underground hed keep me talking to school me to focus my mind against the panicky disorientation that flowing water produces but like all vampires i hate the temporary loss of my powers over the minds of the living that was the thing that most worried me during that april voyage that while i could cajole or manipulate or charm or bribe those luscioussmelling warmblooded rosily glowing morsels with whom i was surrounded every night i couldnt alter their perceptions of me or of what was going on around them i couldnt make them fall in love with me so theyd be eager to do my bidding i couldnt lure them in a trance into nooks and corners of the hold nor could i stand outside their cabin doors and tamper with their dreams except for the fact that i retained some though not all of the superhuman strength of a vampire i was to all intents and purposes human again and indeed a trifle less so the touch of silver would sear and blister my flesh the touch of sunlight set me ablaze like a screaming torch and if this wretched young womanwho was as tall as i and strong for a mortalmanaged somehow to tip me overside once in the water i would be paralyzed i would sink like a stone simon had warned me for the vampire state changes the undead flesh and we become physically perfect all muscle no fat fat is what floats a body simon knows things like that hes made a scientific study of our state and is fond of parading his knowledge solicited or not even in the sunless black of the deep ocean i would not die though crushed by the pressure of the water and frozen by its cold nor would i be able to move save for the few minutes after midnight or when the moon passed directly overhead and turned the tidal flow then the magnetism of the moving water would conquer again and the sluggish currents push me where they would i would be conscious simon had assured me how the hell would he know i could think of no state closer to those described by dante in his book of hell and if miss paxton shot me with a silver bullet even if it did not strike my heart the logical place for her to dump my thenunresisting body would be into the drink all these things wove in and out of my dreams with the clack of her shoeheels on the storagehold deck it was altogether not a pleasant voyage even before pm on the night of april id put in a brief appearance in the diningroom that sunday night enough so that no oversolicitous fellowpassenger or cabin steward would come inquiring for my health during the daytime my story was that i was too seasick to eat most older vampires come to despise the stench of human food i enjoyed it and enjoyed too the spectacle of my tablemates shoveling away quantities of poached salmon with mousseline sauce roast duckling squabs and cress asparagus vinaigrette foie gras and éclairsto say nothing of gallons of cognac and wines the flavors linger for many hours in the blood another reason incidentally that we prefer to sup when we can on the rich rather than the poor my custom on the titanic was to spend most of my night moving from place to place in the firstclass accommodation i hadnt seen miss paxton anywhere on the a or b decks since thursday night but twice once in the palm court outside the firstclass smoking room and once in the corridor near my suite id caught the lingering whiff of her dustingpowder she was still finding her way up onto the firstclass decks she could be waiting for me gun in hand around any corner for that reason i was on the bow deck of the shipas far forward on b deck as i could get and a goodly distance from what might have been supposed to be a gentlemanly lurkingplace in the firstclass smoking roomwhen i saw a dark mass of almostclear ice lying straight in the path of the ship being on open water hadnt affected my ability to see in the dark any more than it affected my ability to detect miss paxtons cologne the iceberg though several miles away would be almost invisible to human eyes for there was no moon that night and the ocean lay flat calm eliminating even the telltale froth of waves breaking around the dark ices base the previous night in my ramblings around the ship id heard the men discussing a warning of heavy pack ice received from an american steamer coming east and around dinnertime the temperature of the air had dropped i worried no more than did anybody else onboard about the titanic actually sinking of course her hull was divided into watertight compartments that could be closed at the touch of a button but i did worry about there being a period of confusion in which one passengerthat is to say myselfmight easily be incapacitated say with a silver bullet in the back and dropped overboard without anyone seeing it happen an investigation might later focus on miss paxtons purported vengefulness but that wouldnt do me any good i descended to the c deck well and down the stairs to the cargoholds where the scotland road corridor would lead me eventually to the grand staircase and so up again eventually to the boat deck at the rear of which lay the bridge and there she was stepping out of the door of a servants stair blocking my path she said softly i have you villain i said just as softly bugger she brought up her hand and i saw the gun in it down here surrounded by the crew quarters the sound of a shot would have brought everyone running but at thirty feet it wasnt likely shed miss if she didnt get me through the heart the silver would cause such extraordinary damage as to both incapacitate me wherever it hit and to cause great curiosity in the ships doctor on land i could have rushed her before she fired but i didnt trust my reflexes i wheeled and plunged for the transverse passageway that would take mei hopeddown the smaller crew corridor and so to another stairway up her heels clattered in pursuit as i darted around the corner fled down the brightly lighted white tunnel i debated for a moment simply stepping into the shadow beside the nearest stairway and taking her as she came pastthis late at night it would be easy to drop her unconscious or deadi hadnt fed in four days and i was ravenous over the side but she had the gun and i knew from the past that she was a lusty screamer i darted to the nearest downward stairway and found myself lost in the mazes around the squash court and the quarters of lesser crew on f deck i could hear her behind me still though farther off it seemed it was astonishing how those metal corridors reechoed and tangled sound and down here the thumping of the engines confused even the uncanny hearing of the undead the main stairway led up through the thirdclass dininghall but that i knew would be the logical place for her to cut me off there was another smaller stair by the turkish bath and thats where i was halfway up when a shuddering impact made the whole ship tremble and knocked me reeling off my feet and nearly to the bottom of the steps again i dont think i doubted for an instant that wed hit that wretched iceberg only a human could have missed it that long it towered above the ship for heavens sake glistening but dark it was almost clear ice as id seen not the powdery white of ice thats been exposed to the air i understand again from simon who wasted not a moment after i finally reached london again in telling me i told you so that when the upper sides of icebergs melt sufficiently to alter their balance they sometimes flip over exposing faces that are far less reflective especially on a moonless night even so i clung for a moment to the stairrail listening the lights still blazed brightly and after the first long grinding jar there was no further shaking but as i stretched my senses outout and down to the decks below mei could hear the dim confusion of mens voices the clatter of frenzied activity and the pounding roar of water shooting into the ship as if forced from a firehose i thought damn it if it floods the firstclass luggage hold im sunk i blush to say that was the very expression that formed itself in my mind though at the time i thought only in terms of my lightproof double trunk and the two handsome windows in my stateroom i had no idea what the white star line procedure was for keeping track of passengers and luggage on a disabled ship until another vessel could come alongside to take everyone off but there was no guarantee that any of that would happen until after daylight on the other hand i thought depending on how much confusion there was it would now be very easy to dispose of miss paxton without anyone being the wiser trunk first firstclass luggage was on g deck at the bow the gangways were sufficiently wide to get the trunk up at least as far as the c deck cargo well i was striding forward along a corridor still largely desertedcrewmembers sleep whenever they can the lazy bastardswhen the heavy beat of the engines ceased silence and utter stillness for the first time since wed lain at queenstown filled the ship seeming louder than any thunder i wasnt the only one to find the silence more disturbing than impact with thousands of tons of ice doors began opening along the corridor men and womenmost of them young and all of them tousled from sleepemerged what is it whyre we stopped hit an iceberg i said i pulled a roll of banknotes from the pocket of my tuxedo jacket and added ill need assistance getting my trunk from the firstclass hold it contains papers that i cannot risk having soaked i could have carried the trunk by myself of course but if seen doing so i could kiss goodby any chance of remaining unnoticed unquestioned or uninvestigated for the rest of the trip im sorry lord sandridge fourth officer boxhall appeared behind me uniformed and worriedlooking we may need the crew to stand by and help with the mailroom if the water comes up onto the orlop deck if youll return to your stateroom ill have a man come there the moment we know one can be spared at the moment there doesnt seem to be much damage but we should know more within halfanhour i could have told him there was water pouring into what sounded like several of the watertight compartments down below but reasoned hed have the truth very shortly one of the stewardesses was looking closely at me a thickchinned fairhaired yorkshire girl whom id seen more than once in conversation with miss paxton she moved off swiftly down the corridor slipping between the growing gaggles of crewmen so much for any hope of waiting in my stateroom still i thought midnight was only ten minutes off if there were crewmen hauling sacks of mail out of the way of floodwaters in the firstclass cargo hold id be able to divert their attention from me while i rescued the trunk myself or killed miss paxton and by long before sunrise i reflected as i strode toward the stair id know whether i was going on another vessel or staying hidden in some sunproof locked nook on the titanic while repairs were effected with any luck id be able to get an immigrant or two in the confusion as well miss paxton would be up on b deck headed for my stateroom on c deck some of the swedes and armenians from steerage were still laughing and playing with chunks of the ice that had been scraped off the iceberg on the b deck promenade a few people were prowling about dressed in their coats and their thickest sweaters a young man in eveningclothes showed me a piece of ice then dropped it in his highball saw the thing go past bloody amazing you dont think theres been any damage to the ship asked an elderly lady doddering by on the arm of her superannuated spouse good lord no god himself couldnt sink this ship simon would have crossed himself vampire or no if i ever find myself in a similar situation againgod forbidi will do so too by this time i realizedand the undead are more sensitive to such matters than the livingthat the deck under my feet was just slightly out of true with all that water in the compartments below that didnt surprise or upset me i climbed to the marconi shack on the boat deckthe room where the telegraphers sat pecking frantically at their electric keys weve sent word to the californian but she hasnt replied said one of the young men when i asked probably turned off his set and went to bed bastard nearly blew my ears off earlier tonight when i was trying to deal with the passenger messages the carpathians about sixty miles south of us shell be here in four or five hours to take the passengers off four hours would put its arrival in darkness i reflected as i made my way toward my own stateroom and what i hoped would be a rendezvous with my pursuer five hours at dawn which meant that the moment miss paxton was safely out of the way i would have to get that trunk one way or another and be where i could get into it come first light never i vowed would i travel again if i could help it it was just one damn complication after another i could scent miss paxtons dustingpowder as i entered the corridor leading to my stateroom the scent was strong but she was nowhere in sight in the other cabins i heard the murmur of voicesa woman complained about having to go out on deck in the cold which was prodigiousbut there was certainly neither panic nor concern i took a few steps along the corridor listening sniffing she was in my stateroom of course shed got the maid to let her in this would be easier than id thought i closed my eyes as midnight moved into the icy heavens overhead reached out my mind to hers where she waited in the comfortable darkness of my room laid on her mind one by one the fragile veils of sleep gently gently id done this to her before back in london and had to be all the more subtle because she knew what it felt like and would resist if she recognized the sensations again but she was tired from prowling the ship by night in quest of a clear shot at me by day in search of my trunk i could feel her slipping into dream i murmured to her in the voice of the river cher beside which she and her idiot brother lionel had played as children whispered to her as the breeze had whispered among the willowleaves on its bank sleep sleep youre home and safe your parents are watching over you no harm can come to you one has only about ten minutes at the very outside at those turninghours of noon and midnight when the positions of earth and stars as simon has explained it to me are strong enough to counterbalance the terrible influence of the tides it was excruciating keeping still concentrating my thoughts on those of the young woman in my stateroom feeling those seconds of power tick away calculating how many id need to stride down the hall open the door and bury my fangs in her neck an image i had to keep stringently from my thoughts while my mind whispered to hers sleeprestyoull sleep much easier if you take off those itchy heavy silver chains around your neck its safe to do soyoure safe theyre so heavy and annoying i felt her fumble sleepily with her collarbuttons why do women persist in wearing garments that button up the back saw her in the eyes of my heart head pillowed on velvety hair halfunbound on the leather of the armchair fingers groping clumsily at her throat sleep the catch was large solid and complicated bugger she must have chosen it so knowing it wasnt easy to undo in halfsleep or trance damn how many minuteshow many secondsleft gentle gentle lionel is asking for the necklaces you have to take them off to give them to him i heard her whisper in her heart lionel and tears trickled down her face in her dreams she saw her brother plump and fatuous as hed been in life holding out his hand to her got to have silver to wear to my wedding old girl not legal if the grooms not wearing silver new rules she let the revolver slide from her fingers brought up both hands the catch gave silver links sliding down her breasts seconds left but enough i strode forward down the corridor and that godcursed miserable miniaturized hairfarm of an american matrons pekingese threw itself out of the door of a nearby stateroom and fastened his teeth in my ankle the teeth of such a creature would hardly imperil a soggy toastpoint much less a vampire in full pursuit of undefended prey but the undead are as likely as any other subject of lord gravity to trip if their feet come in contact with a tenpound hairball midstride i went sprawling and although i caught myself as a cat does with preternatural speed the damage was done the peke braced his tiny feet and let out a salvo of barks his mistress appeared in the stateroom door just as i was readying a kick that would have caved in the little abortions skull and shrieked at me how dare you sir come to mummy sun and the next second miss paxton collar unbuttoned hair tumbling over her shoulders and gun in hand was in the door of my stateroom taking aim at a distance of six feet and midnight was over i fled mrs harper i think that was her name straightening up with her struggling hellhound in her arms effectively blocked the corridor for the instant that it took me to get out of the line of fire and i pelted down the staircase into the nearest corridor with miss paxton like a silent fury at my heels there were people in the corridors now my fellowpassengers in every imaginable variation of pyjamas sweaters coats bathrobes and lifejackets all of them carping about having to go out on the boatdecks and all of them impeding miss paxton from taking aim at meand me from getting far enough ahead to lose her i strode dodged slithered bowwards along the b deck corridor making for the cargowell that would give me swift access to the bowels of the ship the lights were still on but if they went outas i thought they must with the holds floodingshe would surely be mine the deck was definitely sloped underfoot when i reached scotland road on d deck again now milling with crewmen at the head of the spiral stair going down to e and f i stopped short with a jolt of sickened shock beneath me a pit of green water churned eerily illuminated by the lights that still burned on the levels below that water looked awfully high the gun cracked behind me and i spun there were still crewmen in the corridor but none were between me and the emergencyladder from which miss paxton had just emerged and not a single one attempted to stop her i dont think the mad bitch would have cared if they had maybe her tales of my perfidy had spread widely among the crew maybe they had a better idea of what was going on below our feet than the passengers or i did the fact remained that she had a gun and a clear shot and i knew that even a glancing wound from it could prove fatal i hadnt drunk the blood of thousands of grimy peasants factoryworkers prostitutes and streeturchins over the course of fourteen decades to let myself be put out of the way by an enraged middleclass virago i did the only thing possible as she fired i fell against the rail tipped over it and dropped straight down into that seething jadegreen seawater hell it was every bit as cold as id been led to expect my mind seemed to fracture to go numb i screamed and my mouth and lungs flooded with waterits a damn good thing id quit breathing many years previously i remember staring up through the green water and seeing alexandra paxton looking down at me gun still in her hand i was conscious but i felt my ability to act at allto summon my limbs to obey my disoriented mindbleeding out of me like gore from a severed femoral artery i couldnt move until she left until she was convinced that i was dead and she seemed to stand theregloating i expect the miserable cowforever then she spit at me and turned away it took what felt like minutes of slow clumsy thrashing before i could thrust myself to the door into what i think was f deck my fingers were like cricket bats and i dont know how long i spent simply trying to get the door open my brain was like a cricket bat too trying to fish a single wet noodle of orientationwhere the hell was the stairway up to e deckfrom the swirling maelstrom of horror shock terrifying weakness and nightmare panic and i knew with blinding certainty that watertight compartments be damned the ship was going down voices impossibly distant came to me from all parts of the ship voices that said shes sinking by the head voices that said you must get in the boat mary i shall follow later voices that said get back there you women and children first nearer feet thudded amid a frightened yammering of swedish gaelic arabic japanese thirdclass passengers trying to find their way up the maze of stairways to the decks above crewmen shouted at them to go back to stay in their cabins theyd be called when it was time for them to get in the lifeboats but id gone to sea god help me as a living man all those years ago and i knew jolly well how many people could fit into a boat the size of the mere sixteen that were in titanics davits i had to get up to the decks before they started letting those foreign swine take up boatspace that id paid for with my firstclass ticket and i had to get there before the foreign swine realized that there wasnt going to be enough room for them in the boats and took matters out of the crews hands and into their own dirty paws the struggle was literally hellish i refer specifically to the fifth circle of dantes hell where the sullen bubble in eternal stasis in the mud beneath the waters of the river styx i can only assume that the styx is warmer than the atlantic ocean in midapril water at a temperature of thirty degrees has exactly the same effect on the undead as it would on the living only of course more prolonged since the living wouldnt survive more than a few minutes even were breathing not an issue beyond the paralyzing cold there was the sheer hammering disorientation of ocean waterliving wateritself for long periods i became simply immobilized my brain shrieking fighting to make a hand move a foot thrust against the metal walls that hemmed me in it was like trying to remain awake in the final extremities of exhaustion id come out of it twist and thrash and wrench myself to push along a foot or so then sink back into an inactivity i couldnt break no matter how frantically i tried those periods got longer the moments of clumsy horrified lucidity shorter and shorter and around me i could feel the walls the hull the decking tilting tilting as the weight of the water in the bow doubled and quadrupled and quintupled and i hung there helpless aware of the sheer horrifying depth of the ocean below i wonder i didnt go mad not with fear that i would die when that final hideous tippingpoint was at last reached and the ship began her lightless plunge to the bottom with the appalling certainty that i would not and could not ever whether because the water conducted sound or for some other cause as i spastically intermittently agonizingly crept and pushed my way toward the stairways and survival i was completely aware of everything that was passing on the decks above even above the cheerful ragtime being pumped out by the ships band i could hear with nightmarish clarity every conversation every footfall every creak of the tackle as the crew loaded up the lifeboats and lowered them to the surface of the sea far below the ships officers kept saying women and children first and the women and childrenbrainless cretinskept finding reasons to remain on the main vessel where it was warm a number of men got into those early boats unchallenged since there were so many women who werent interested i learned later one of them was sent off with only twelve people in it the miserable mrs harper got off accompanied not only by her husband but by her wretched pekingese but around me the walls changed their angle with what to me seemed to be fearful speed until even those firstclass idiots on deck i use the term advisedly realized there was something greatly wrong by the time i dragged myself at last shaking and dripping up a maintenance ladder onto d deck and stumbled toward an unguarded crew ladder to go above the bow of the ship was underwater and all but four of the boats were gone i wont go into a detailed description of the behavior of the some two thousand men and women in competition for the approximately one hundred and sixty available passes out of the jaws of death anyone who has lived for close to two centuries in a major city like london has had ample occasion to view the behavior of mobs and the passengers of the titanic actually acquitted themselves fairly mildly all things considered yes the crew members had to form a cordon around one boat and threaten to shoot any nonlady who tried to board yes the men did rush another of the boats i was too far back in the mob to get on damn those other selfish bastards to hell astonishingly the lights remained on and the band continued to play giving an eerie disjointedness to the scene but somehow i think keeping everyone just on the human side of total panic god knows what it would have been like in darkness with no sound but the groaning of the ships overstrained armature readying itself to snap i had long since given up any thought of getting my trunk to safety or of alexandra paxton i learned much later shed gone straight from shooting me as she thought to the boat deck and had gotten off fairly early in the proceedings she returned to england and lived i regret to say happily ever after the bitch for my part my only thought was getting into a boat and trusting to luck that the rescue ship would arrive while night still lay upon the ocean the richest people in the world were aboard the titanic for gods sake other vessels must be racing one another to pick them up mustnt they in addition to the regular lifeboats the titanic carried four canvas collapsible boats and two of these were assembled and put in the lifeboat davits as the last of the wooden boats was lowered away the other two lashed uselessly to the top of the officers quarters were too tangled up in rope to be dragged to the side but men swarmed over them trying to get them into shape to be floated off if and when god help us all the ship went under and under she would go i knew it could hear with the hyperacute senses of the undead the snapping creak of her skeleton cracking under the weight of water pulling her down and the whole stern end of hergod knows how many tonsthat was by this time lifted completely clear of the glasssmooth obsidian ocean the lights were beginning to glow red as the generators began to fail as i fought my way through the mob to one of the collapsibles a dapper little gentleman whod been helping with the ropes turned to the officer in charge and said im going aboard when the officerwhod been fighting off wouldbe male boarders for some minutesopened his mouth to protest the dapper gentleman said im bruce ismay president of the white star line he stepped into the boat as it swung clear of the deck i reached the rail you may be president of the white star line but if theres room for you theres room for me and i froze i could have batted aside any of the officers who tried to prevent me and the leap would have been nothing for one moment just before the men began to lower less than two feet separated the boats gunwale from the rail with a vampires altered muscle and inhuman strength ive cleared gaps four and five times that with ease two feet of space with running water not all that far below had i been assured of the return of my immortal soul by so doing i could not have made that jump and by the time i fought my way to the place where the other serviceable collapsible was being lowered it was away a number of passengers jumped at this point when the boats were close enough to have picked them up if you walked forward it wasnt all that far to the surface of the sea i made my way to the roof of the officers quarters and joined the struggle to get the remaining two collapsibles unraveled from the snarl of ropes get their canvas sides put up the designer of the damned things is another on the long list of persons i hope will rot in hell and get them to the rails if one fell upsidedown which it did it was too heavy and too clumsy to be righted i could feel the angle of the deck steepening could tell by the dark waters advance that the ship was being pulled forward and down at the bridge went under a rolling wave of black water swept over the roof of the officers quarters and floated the rightsideup collapsible free i scrambled aboard fighting and clawing the army of other men trying to do the same thing glancing back i could see the titanics stern swarming with humanity like ants on a floating branch lift high out of the ocean it was a fearful sight voices were screaming all around me and if id ever had a doubt that a vampire could pray and pray sincerely it was put to rest in that moment i shrieked gods name with the best of them as i threw myself into that miserable canvas tub and we oared away gasping from the great ship as she snapped in halfdear god with what a soundand her stern crashed back the wave propelling our boat on its way i saw her lights beneath the water as the bow pulled down dragging the stern after it the stern rose straight up for a moment venting steam at every orifice and wreathed in the despairing wails of those wretches still trapped aboard pointed briefly like a stumpy accusing finger at the beaconcold blazons of the icy stars then sank with my trunk aboard and no rescueboat in sight it was twenty minutes after two in the morning dawn in the north atlantic comes in midapril at roughly five am first light about a halfhour before that dear god was all i could think dear god the menmostly crewmenaround me in the boat were praying but i was at something of a loss for words what i really wanted was for a lightproof unsinkable coffin to drop down out of the heavens so i could go on killing people and drinking their blood for another few centuries even in my extremity i didnt think god would answer that one so i waited the collapsibles sides never had been properly put up we started shipping water almost immediately and barely dared stir at the oars for fear of altering the boats precarious balance and sending us all down into those black miles of abyss this consideration at least kept the men in the boat from rowing back to pick up swimmers whose voices hung over the water like the humming of insects on a summer night some sixteen hundred people went into the subfreezing water that nightim told most of the other boats even those lightly laden held off for fear of being swamped one american woman tried to organize the other ladies in her boat to stage a rescue at this point and was roundly snubbed so much for the tenderheartedness of the fair sex the cries subsided after twenty minutes or so the living dont last long in water that cold then we could only wait in fear perhaps more excruciating than wed left behind us on the titanic for the canvas boat to slowly fill with water and sink away beneath our feet or in my case for the earth to turn and the sun to rise and my flesh to spontaneously ignite in unquenchable fire it was small consolation to reflect that such an event would briefly keep my fellow passengers warm and one hoped would take their minds off their own upcoming immersion should the boat sink before i burst into flames i found myself thinking my best chance would be to guide myself as best i could toward the titanic wreck the short periods of volition permitted by even a long succession of noons and midnights would never be enough to counteract the movement of the slow deepflowing ocean currents staying in the wreck itself would be my best and only chance i could hear simons voice in my mind speculating about how divers were already learning to search for ships foundered in shallow waters for the sunken treasures of the spanish main and the ancient mediterranean in time i fancy they shall discover even atlantis or at the very least whatever galleons went down chockfull of treasure in midocean you can be sure that whatever science can invent treasurehunters will not be long in adapting to their greed the richest men and women in the world had been my fellow passengers very few of them stuffed their jewels in their pockets before getting into the lifeboats of course the treasurehunters would come as soon as science made it possible for them to do so and even as i thought this i sent up the feeblest of human prayers please god no as if hed listen at far off to the southeast a flicker of white light pierced the blackness followed by a cannons distant boom a slight breeze had come up making the ocean choppy and the air yet more bitterly cold tiny as a nailclipping a new moon hung over the eastern horizon men had begun to fall off the collapsible which was now almost up to its gunwales in seawater that hovered right around the temperature of ice fall silently numb dead within sight of salvation i could see all around us the ocean filled with the palegleaming blobs of what the sailors called trash and growlers miniature icebergs the size of motorcars or singlestory houses ghostly in the starlight among them or west and south in the clearer water i could make out the dark shapes of the other lifeboats could hear the voices of the passengers in them tiny occasional drops of sound like single crickets in the night it wanted but an hour till first light i think i would have wept had it been possible for vampires to shed tears the sky was staining gray when one of the lifeboats was sighted slowly inching toward us how far wed drifted i dont know id sunk into a lethargy of horror watching the slow growing of the light it might have been the effect of the water in the boat which was up to our knees by this time there were only a dozen men left and a woman from third class i could barely move my head to follow the lifeboats agonizingly lentitudinous approach everything seemed to have slowed to the gluey pace of a helpless dream it was as if time itself were slowly jelling to immobility with the cold far across the waterperhaps a mile or two in the midst of the floating iceloomed the dark bulk of a small freighter all around it the lifeboats were creeping inward some from miles away like nearly frozen insects painfully dragging themselves toward the jampot that is the heaven of their tiny lives and i could see that even if the lifeboat reached usand each second it seemed that wed go down under their very nosesthere was no way under gods pitiless sky that it would reach the freighter before full light dont make me do this god dont make me like the laughter of god light flushed up into the gray sky turning all the icebergs to silver the water to sapphire of incredible hardness and depth at the same time my frozen flesh was suffused with unbearable heat my skin itching writhing my flesh readying to burst into flame hiding in a boiler on the wreck curled in some corner of the grand staircase or the palm court lounge i would have only to wait for the treasurehunters to come the cold and darkness would only seem eternal would hope in those circumstances be more cruel than the comfort of despair i closed my eyes tipped myself backward over the side i was about to find out hit by bruce mcallister bruce mcallister is the author of the novels dream baby and humanity prime and more than fifty short stories his short work has been collected in the girl who loved animals and other stories and has appeared in numerous anthologies including the prestigious best american short stories series his stories have also been nominated for both the hugo and nebula awards hes currently working on two quiet fantasy novels both of which incorporate vampire elements mcallister says that he suspects vampire stories are christianity flipped to its dark alterself in communion we do drink blood and were promised immortality so in one sense vampirism is communion and immortality but without gods grace he said so that plays a role in the attraction as does the neoromantic gothic feel of it this story which first appeared in the online magazine aeon is inspired by classic and contemporary hardboiled fiction but while the characters of dashiell hammett and robert parker may have found themselves in similar situations none of them ever had a client or a mark quite like this im given the assignment by an angeli mean that an angelone wearing a highend armani suit with an ermenegildo zegna tie a loud red one why red to project confidence hell i dont know im having lunch at parlamis a mediocre bistro on melrose where i met my first ex when in he walks with what looks like a musical instrument casefrench horn or tiny tuba im thinkingand sits down we do the usual disbelief dialogue from the movies he announces hes an angel i say youre kidding he says no really i ask for proof he says look at my eyes and i do his pupils are missing so i say thats easy with contacts so he makes the butter melt on the plate just by looking at it and i say any demon could do that he says sure but lets cut the bullshit anthony gods got something he wants you to do and if youll take the job hell forgive everything i shrug and tell him okay okay i believe now what everyone wants to be forgiven and its already sounding like any other contract he reaches for the case opens it right there no ones watchingnot even the two undercover narcsthe angel makes sure of that and hands it to me its got a brandnew crossbow in it then he tells me what i need to do to be forgiven god wants you to kill the oldest vampire why i ask and can see him fight to keep those pupilless eyes from rolling even angels feel boredom contempt things like that im thinking and that makes it all that more convincing because he cant do it and why is that im getting braver maybe they do need me im goodone of the three best repairmen west of vegas just like my sainted dad wasand maybe guys who say yes to things like this arent all that common because the fellowthe oldest bloodsuckeris the son ofwell you know no i dont does the prince of lies ring a bell oh im quiet for a second then i get it its like the mob and the police back in my uncles day in jersey you dont take out the don because then maybe they take out your chief i ask him if this is the reasoning the contempt drops a notch but holds no but close enough and where do i do it the vatican the holy city yes big place but doesnt have to be tricky id killed men with a wide range of appliancethe angel knew thatand suddenly this wasnt sounding any trickier crossbow composite frame wooden arrowsdartswhatever theyre called one to the heart id seen enough movies and tv well he says maybe but most of the jesuits there are vampires too oh thats the bad news the good news is theyre pissed at himthe oldest vampire i mean they think he wants to turn mortal hes taken up with some twentyeightyearold bambina who knows almost as many languages as he doesa vatican interpreterand theyve got this place in sienatuscany no lessand he hasnt bitten her and its been making the brothers his greatgreatgreatgrandchildren nervous for about a month now handle it right and she just might help you even if they dont you serious yes why because she wants to be one tooshes very eurogothyou know the typeand he just wont bite her no i dont know the type but i say shes that vindictive what woman isnt this sounds awfully sexist for an angel but i dont argue maybe angels get dumped too does he really i ask does he really what want to be mortal again he never was mortal he was born that way the eyeswhich suddenly have pupils now majorly dark blue onesare starting to roll again what do you think son of you know whowhos not exactly happy with the traditional wine and wafer thing but likes the idea of blood and immortality makes sense i say eyeing the narcs who are eyeing two fairfax high girls but why does god need someone to kill him if he wants to flip he takes a breath what an idiot the pupils say remember when china tried to give taiwan a pair of pandas im impressed this guys up on earthly news no taiwan couldnt take them why not he takes another breath and i hear him counting to ten okay okay i say i get it if they took the pandas they were in bed with china theyd have to make nice with them you accept cute cuddly creatures from someone and it looks like love right basically if you know whos son flipsgoes mortalgod has to accept him right and that throws everything off no balance no order chaos and eventually well hell the angel nods grateful i can tell that im no stupider than i am i think for a moment how many arrows do i get i think hell laugh but he doesnt three three i dont like the feeling suddenly its like some bible story where the guy gets screwed so that god can make some point about fatherly love or other form of sacrifice nice for gods message bad for the guy its a holy number he adds i get that i say but i dont think so not three thats all you get what makes you think three will do iteven if theyre all heart shots you only need one the bad feeling jumps a notch why he looks at me and blinks then nods well each has a point made from a piece of the cross mr pagano we were lucky to get even that much its hidden under three floors and four tons of tile in jerusalem you know what is the cross you know which one i blink right thats the last thing he needs in the heart right so all ive got to do is hit the right spot yes which means i need practice how much time do i have a week i take a breath im assuming youand heknow a few good crossbow schools ones with weekly rates weve got special tutors for that im afraid to ask and what do these tutors usually do kill vampires and you need me when youve got a team of them hed spot them a mile away theyre his kids you might say hes been around years and hes had kids and his kids have had kidsin the way that they have themyou know the biting and sucking thingand they can sense each other a mile away these kidsthe ones working for usare ones whove come

felicethe one from teaneck the one with adenoids know what i mean i go home to my overpriced stucco shack in sherman oaks and to my girlfriend whos got cheekbones like a runway model and lips that make men beg but wears enough lipstick to stop a truck and in any case is sick and tired of what i do for a living and probably has a right to be i should know something besides killing people even if theyre people the police dont mind having dead and im as good at it as my father wanted me to be its too easy making excuses like a pool hustler who never leaves the back room you start to think its the whole world she can tell from my face that ive had one of those meetings she shakes her head and says how much im doing it for free no anthony youre not i am are you trying to get me to go to bed with your brother hed like that or aaron that guy at the gym or do you just want me to go live with my sister she can be a real harpy no i tell her and mean it you must really hate me i dont hate you

please if youll charge for the work i cant you are in trouble no how do you tell her youve got to kill a man who isnt really a man but wants to be one and that if you do god will forgive you all the other killings she heads to the bedroom to start packing i get the case out open it touch the marbleized surface of the thing and hope to hell that god wants a horny assassin because im certainly not seeing any action this night or any other before i leave for rome and action does help steady my finger which mandy knows which every woman ive ever been with knows when i get up the next morning shes gone the note on the bathroom mirror in slashes of that lipstick of hers says i hope you miss my body so bad you cant walk or shoot straight anthony we do the instruction at a deadgrass firing range in topanga canyon my tutor is a nononsense kidmaybe twentywith chinese characters tattooed around his neck like a dog collar naked eyebrows pierced tongue nose lower lip hes serious and strict but seems happy enough for a vampire killer he picks me up in his tundra and on the way to the canyon three manikins that holy number bouncing in the truck bed he says yeah i like iteven if its not what youd think from a buffy rerun or a john carpenter flickyou know like that one shot in mexico more like csinot the bruckheimer but the discovery channel same way that being an investigative journalist isnt as much fun as you think itll beat least thats what i hear all those hours googling the public record in my line of work its the tracking and casing and lightweapons prep but you know more about that than i do mr pagano wasnt your dad sounds like youve been to college kurt i say a year at a community collegethats it but im a reader always have been how do you answer that ive read maybe a dozen books in my life all of them short and necessary and im sitting with this kid who reads probably three fat ones a week not only is he more literate than i am hes going to teach me how to killsomething i really thought i knew how to do dont worry he says youll pick it up yourshall we say previous training and experienceshould make up for your age slower reflexes you know what can i say ive got fifteen years on him and we both know it my reflexes are slower than his as we hit the ventura freeway he tells me what im packing in the case beside you mr pagano youve got a horton legend hd with a talon ultralight trigger dp camotuff limbs speedmax riser alloy cams microflight arrow groove and dialarange trajectory compensatorwith ls mx aluminum arrows and hunter elite arrow quivers how does that make you feel just wonderful i tell him the firing range is upscale and very hip there are dozens of trophy wives and starlets wearing scala baseball caps newsboy caps and sun visors there are almost as many very metro guys wearing aviator shades and designer jungle cammies and all of them are learning personal protection under the tutelage of guys who are about as savvy about what theyre doing as the ordinary gym trainer theyre all trying their best to hit fancy bullseye gag pmt and other tactical targets made for pros but im looking like an even bigger idiot trying to hit with my handfuls of little crossbow darts the manikins the kid has lined up for me at fifty yards the other shooters keep rubbernecking to get a look at us the kid stares them down and they look away if they only knew do the arrows made from the other material i begin do theyuhact i ask arrows with wood made from the cross act the same the kid says very professional we balance them the way wed balance any arrow when it hits when it hits a vampire im sure it doesnt feel like ordinary wood ive never taken one myself glad to hear it actually someone did try an arrow once deer bow two inches off the mark ive got a scar want to see it not really how would it feel to us you mean mortals right it would probably hurt like hell and if you happened to die i doubt it would get you a free pass to heaven thats too bad isnt it when ive filled the manikins with ten quivers worth of arrows and my heartshot rate is a sad we quit for the day its getting close to sunset one of those gorgeous smoggy ones the other shooters have hit the road in their escalades hs and land sharks and the kid is acting distracted date what you know two people dinner and a movie clubbing whatever you could say that but its a threesome cant stand the guyhes a redstate crewcut exdeltaforcerbut the girl shes so hot shell melt your belt buckle he can tell im not following a job itll take the three of us about three

having late poolside dinner at blueonblue tonight well be interrupting it i see i say im staring at him and he beats me to it you want to know what we eat if we cant drink blood yes i do we eat what you eat we dont need blood since we came over which means you donthow to put ityou dont perpetuate the species right which cant make the elders very happy no it cant by the end of the sixth day my heartshot rate is and the kids nodding doing a dance move or two in his tight black jeans and saying youre the man anthony youre the man i shouldnt admit it but what he thinks does matter when i get there courtesy of alitalia the angel wont pay for lufthansa the city of siena in lovely tuscany country of my forefathers is a mess its just after the horserace the one where a dozen riderseach of them repping a neighborhood known for an animal snail dolphin gooseyou get the picturebeat each other silly with little riding crops to impress their local madonna theres trash everywhere ive got the crossbow in its case and a kid on a vespa tries to grab it as he sails by but im ready i know kidsi was one onceand i nail him with a kick to his knee the vespa skids and he flies into a fountain not far away the fountain is a big sea shella scallopwhich i know from reading my fodors must be this neighborhoods emblem for the race he gets up crying gives me the vafuncu with his arm and fist and screams something in native sienesewhich isnt at all the italian i grew up with but which im sure means im going to tell my dad and brothers you asshole the apartment is not in the neighborhood of the scallop but in the neighborhood of the salmon and the girl who answers the door is stunning tall the kind of blonde who tans better than a commercial eyes like shattered glass long legs cute little dimple in her chin i dont see how he can keep his teeth off her this is eurogoth i dont think so so youre the one she says her english is perfect just enough accent to make it sexy yeah anthony pagano i stick out my hand she doesnt take it giovanna she says giovanna musetti and thats what youre going to do it with she gestures with her head at my case she cant take her eyes off it yeah please dont do it she says suddenly i dont know what to say youre supposed to want him dead she looks at me like im crazy why would i want him dead because you want him to bite youbecause you want to be one tooand hehe wont oblige who told you that thethe angel who hired me i know that angel he was here he interviewed me you dont want him dead of course not i love him i sit down on the sofa theyve got a nice place maybe they enjoy the horseraces even if they dont the tourists arent so bad offseason according to fodors and maybe when youre the oldest vampire you dont have to obey the nodaylight rule maybe you get to walk around in the dayin a nice clean modern medieval citymaybe one you knew when you were only a thousand years old and it was being built and a lot trashierand feel pretty mortal and normal who knows why did my employer get it wrong shes got the same look the angel did the angel didnt get it wrong mr pagano he lied why im thinking angels are allowed to do that lie sure if god wants them to why i ask again i dont know thats one of the things i love about frank your mans name is frank it is now thats what hes gone by for the last hundred years he says and i believe him thats one of the things i love what that he doesnt lie that he doesnt need to hes seen it all hes had all the power you could want and he doesnt want it anymore hes bitten so many people he lost count after a century and he doesnt want to do it anymore hes tired of living the lie any vampire has to live hes very human in his heart mr paganoin his soulso human you wouldnt believe itand hes tired of doing his fathers bidding the darkness the blasphemy all of that i dont think he was ever really into it but he had to do it he was his fathers son so he had to do it carry on the traditionthe business do you know what thats like yes i do im starting to like her of coursereally like her shes great eye candy but it isnt just that the more she talks the more i like whats inside she understandsshe understands the mortal human heart but im supposed to kill him i say why because ofbecause of balance what thats what my employer said even though frank wants to flip and youd think that would be a plus it wouldnt be it would throw things off you really believe that anthony now were on firstname basis and i dont mind i dont say a thing for a second i dont know it sounds wrong doesnt it yeah it does we sit silent for a while im looking at her hard too interested so i make myself look away do i make you selfconscious she asks gently that turns me red its not you its me you look awfully good its just me thats sweet now shes doing the looking away cheeks a little red and when she looks backs she says any idea why god would really want him killed none whatsoever but youve still got to do it there was this promise i know you do sure if you do it hell forgive everything they offered me that too if i helped you and you said no yes she loves this guythis vampirethis son of you know whoso much shell turn down an offer like that now im really looking at her shes not just beautiful shes got coglioni shell stand up to god for love im thinking these things and also wondering whether the angel lied about her because maybe she stiffed him because hes the vindictive one theres nothing i can say to stop you shes asking she doesnt say nothing i can do she says nothing i can say and thats all the difference in the world wish there were but there isnt where is he you know yeah i guess i do hes in the vatican somewhere trying to convince those jesuit vampires that its okay if he turns thats where he said he was going when he left a week ago so im sure its true like i said he never lies i know i get up im sorry me too im depressed when i get to rome and not because the city is big and noisy and feels like la my dads people were from calabria and they never had a good thing to say about romani so im biased its becausewell just because but when i reach the vatican i feel a lot better now thisthis is beautiful st peters the church the square marble everywhere sunlight blinding you like the flashlight of god even the silly little fiats going round and round the circle like theyre trapped and cant get off are nice hes not going to be in the basilica i know thats where the pope isthat new strict guy benedictand its visiting day dispensations blessings the rest i dont even try to go through the main vatican doorway on the opposite side too many tourists there too instead i go to a side entrance via gerini where theres no one construction cones sidewalk repair a big door with carvings on it why this entrance i dont know just a hunch i know god can open any door for me that he wants to so if my hunch is right why isnt the door opening maybe therell be a mark on the right dooryou know a shadow that looks like the face of our lady or the number somethingbut before i can check the door for a sign something starts flapping above my head and scares the shit out of me i think its a bat at firstthat would make sensebut its just a pigeon no a dove doves are smaller and pigeons arent this white i know my employer thinks im slow but a white dove the idiot bird keeps flapping two feet from my head and now i see ita twig of something in its beak i dont want to know the bird flies off stops hovers and waits im supposed to follow so i do the door its stopped at is the third one down from mine of course no face of our lady on it but when i step up to it it of course clicks and swings open we go through the next doorway and the next and the next seven doorways in allfrom a library to a little museum then another library then an office then an archive with messy files then a bigger museum some of the rooms are emptyof people i meanand some arent and when theyre not the people some in suits and dresses and some in clerical outfitsgive me a look like well he certainly seems to know where hes going with his musical instrument perhaps theyre having chamber music with espresso for gli ufficiali and of course that cant really be a pure white dove with an olive twig in its beak flapping in front of him so everythings just fine buon giorno signore when the bird stops for good hovering madly its a really big door and it doesnt open right off but i know this is itthat my guy is on the other side whatever hes doing hes there and id better get ready hes a vampire maybe hes confusedmaybe he doesnt want to be one any longerbut hes still got according to the angel superhuman strength and supersenses and the rest when the door openswithout the slightest sound i noteim looking down this spiral staircase into a gorgeous little chapel sunlight is coming through the stainedglass windows so theres got to be a courtyard or something just outside and the frescoes on the ceiling look like real michelangelos big muscles those steroid bodies the bird has flown to the ceiling and is perched on a balustrade waiting for the big event but thats not how i know the guy im looking down at is frank it isnt even that hes got that distinguishedgentleman look that old vampires have in the movies its what hes doing that tells me hes kneeling in front of the altar in front of this big golden crucifix with an especially bloody jesus and hes very uncomfortable doing it even at this distance i can tell hes shaking hes got his hands out in prayer and can barely keep them together hes jerking like hes being electrocuted hes got his eyes on the crucifix and when he speaks its loud and his voice jerks too it sounds confessionalthe tone is rightbut its not english and its not italian it may not even be latin and why should it be hes been around a long time and probably knows the original im thinking the stainedglass light is playing tricks on me but its not there really is a blue light moving around his hands his face his pants legsblue fireand this i see now its whats making him jerk hes got to be in pain i mean here in a chapelin front of an altarsunlight coming through the windowsmaking about the biggest confession any guy has ever made painful as hell but hes doing it and suddenly i know why she loves him hell anyone would without knowing it ive unpacked my crossbow and have it up and ready this is what god wants so i probably get some help doing it im shaking too but go ahead and aim the thing i need forgiveness too you know i want to tell him you cant bank your immortal soul no but you do get to spend it a lot longer i put my finger on the trigger but dont pull it yet i want to keep thinking no i dont i dont want to keep thinking at all i lower the crossbow and the moment i do i hear a sound from the back of the chapel where the main doors got to be and i crane my neck to see its the main door all right heads are peeking in theyre wearing black and i think to myself curious priests thats all but the door opens up more and three of themthat holy numberstep in real quiet theyre wearing funny jesuit collarsthe ones the angel mentionedand they dont look curious they look like they know exactly what theyre doing and they look very unhappy vampires have this sixth sense i know one of them looks up at me suddenly smiles this funny smile and i see sharp little teeth he says something to the other two and heads toward me when hes halfway up the staircase i shoot him i must have my heart in it because the arrow nearly goes through him but thats not what really bothers him its the wood theres an explosion of sparks the same blue fire and a hole opens up in his chest grows and in no time at all hes just not there anymore frank has turned around to look but hes dazed all that confessing hands in prayer position and shaking wildly and he obviously doesnt get whats happening the other two jesuits are heading up the stairs now and i nail them with my last two arrows the dove has dropped like a stone from its perch and is flapping hysterically in front of me like wrong vampires wrong vampires im tired of its flapping so i brush it away turn and leave and if it takes me which it will a whole day to get out of the vatican without that dove to lead me and make doors open magically okay when youre really depressed its hard to give a shit about anything two days later im back at parlamis i havent showered i look like hell ive still got the case with me god knows why ive had two martinis and when i look up there he is im not surprised but i sigh anyway im not looking forward to this so you didnt do it he says you know i didnt asshole yes i do word does get out when the spiritual configuration of the universe doesnt shift the way hed like it to i want to hit his babysmooth face his perfect nose and collagen lips but i dont have the energy so what happens now i ask you really dont know no he shakes his head same look of contempt i guess you wouldnt he takes a deep breath well the jesuits did it for you they killed him last night what theyve got crossbows too where do you think we got the idea same wood of course they handle it with special gloves why why kill him same line of thought if he flips things get thrown off balance order is important for them too you know mortals are the same way you may have noticed you all need order throw things off and you go crazy thats why youll put up with despotseven choose them over more benign and loving leadersjust so you dont have to worry disorder makes for a lot of worry anthony you already knew it knew what that i wouldnt do it and the jesuits would instead yes then why send me again the look the sigh ah think hard i do and miracle of miracles i see it giovanna is free now i say yes frank bless his immortal soulwhich god has indeed agreed to dois gone in flesh so he wants me to hook up with her the angel nods of course why because shell love you really love you innocent that you arejust the way she loved him thats it not exactly because shell love you youll have to stop youll have to stop killing people anthony its just not right no i wont yes you will i dont think so but you willbecause whether you know it yet or not you love her too what do you say to that the angels gotten up straightened his red zegna picked up the case and is ready to leave by the way he adds he says he forgives you anyway i nod tired as hell i figured that youre catching on about time i say he said that too and the whole balance thing what do you think pure bullshit is what im thinking you got it he says reading my mind because well angels can do that twentyfour hours later im back in siena shaved and showered and she doesnt seem surprised to see me shes been grievingthats obvious red eyes perfect hair tussled a mess shes been debriefed by the angelthat i can telland i dont know whether shes got a problem with the plan or not or even whether there is a plan the angel may have been lying about that too but when she says quietly hello anthony and gives me a shy smile i knowand my heart starts flapping like that

this story about a vampire who chooses cryonic preservation in the hope of a cure first appeared in the science journal nature as part of their futures series of shortshort stories macleod says that it was originally inspired by thinking about viruses that spread through changes they make in the hosts behavior its and im still a vampire damn the chap from alcor uk is droning through his orientation lecture new age of enlightenment new industrial revolution many changes take some time to adjust blah blah blah im only halflistening being too busy shifting my foot to keep it out of the beam of direct sunlight millimetering across the floor and trying not to look at his neck i feel like saying ive only been dead forty years for chr for crying out loud i saw the first age of enlightenment i worked nights right through the original industrial revolution i remember being naive enough to get excited about mesmerism galvanism spiritualism socialism roentgen rays rationalism radium mendelism marconi relativity feminism the russian revolution the bomb nightclubs feminism again apollo socialism again the fall of saigon and the fall of the wall the last dodgy nostrum i fell for was cryonics so dont give me this future shock shit sunshine the most disconcerting thing ive come across so far in is the latest ladies fashion the old sleeveless minidress the ozone hole has been fixed and folk are frolicking in the sun i hug myself with bare arms and slide the castored chair back another inch under the heel of my left wrist i feel the thud of my regenerated heart it beats time to the artery visible under the tanned skin of the resurrection mans neck the rest of my nature is unregenerate i feel somewhat thwarted this is not this is definitely not what i died for and it seemed such a good idea at the time it always does by we thought we had a handle on the thing its a virus in all respects but one its benign it prevents aging and stimulates regeneration of any tissue damage short of well a stake through the heart but it has a very low infectivity so it takes a lot of mingling of fluids to spread natural selection has worked that one hard hence the unfortunate impulses and by i can tell you i was getting pretty sick of them i cashed in my six scottish widows life insurance policies lets draw a veil over how i acquired them signed up for cryonic preservation in the event of my death and after a discreet ten years met an unfortunate and bloody end at the hand of the coven senior kelvin youll thank me later he said just before he pushed home the point see you in the future i croaked the last thing i saw was his grin that and the pavement below the spiked railings beside the steps of my flat a tragic accident the coroner i just learned blamed it on the long skirt vampires always the fashion victims i leave the orientation room hang around until dusk under the pretext of catching up with the news and go out and find a vintage clothes shop i walk out in victorian widows weeds they fit so well i suspect they were once mine it didnt work i tell kelvin he sips his bloody mary and looks defensive it did in a way he says there are no viruses in your blood that word again i look away were in some kind of goth club which covers for the mode but doesnt improve my mood so why do i still feel hungry have a tapas he says but seriously the way we figure it the virus has to have transcribed itself into our dna so the nanotech cellrepair just replicates it without a second thought so were stuck with it i say living in the dark and every so often not quite he says now its been established that cryonics really does work theres been a whole new interest in a very old idea the coffin lid opens kelvins looking down as i expect the real shock is the light fullspectrum and warm it feels like something my skin has missed for centuries i sit up naked and bask for a moment the overhead lights reproduce the spectrum of alpha centauri which is where were going the whole coven is here all thirteen of them happier and better fed than ive ever seen them its taken us a lot of planning a lot of money and a lot of lying to get here but were on our way welcome back says kevin he grins around at the coven lets thaw one out for her he says she must be hungry as far as i can see stretch rows and rows of cryonic coffins containing interstellar colonists in what they euphemistically call cold sleep thousands of them enough to keep us going until we reach that kinder sun peking man by robert j sawyer robert j sawyer is the author

pages of analog and was released in hardcover in april although sawyer is best known for his science fiction hes written a number of works that deal with fantastic themes such as this story which won the aurora award and first appeared in the anthology dark destiny iii but as you might guess from the title this one doesnt see sawyer straying too far from his science fiction roots the lid was attached to the wooden crate with eighteen nails the return address in blue ink on the blond wood said sender dept of anatomy pumc peking china the destination address in larger letters was dr roy chapman andrews the american museum of natural history central park west at th street new york ny usa the case was marked fragile and registered and par avion a brand had burned the words via hongkong and by us air service into the wood andrews had waited anxiously for this arrival between and he himself had led the nowfamous gobi desert expeditions searching for the asian cradle of humanity although hed brought back untold scientific richesincluding the firstever dinosaur eggsandrews had failed to discover a single ancient human remain but now a german scientist franz weidenreich had shipped to him a treasure trove from the orient the complete fossil remains of sinanthropus pekinensis in this very crate were the bones of peking man andrews was actually salivating as he used a crowbar to pry off the lid hed waited so long for these terrified that they wouldnt survive the journey desperate to see what humanitys forefathers had looked like anxious the lid came off the contents were carefully packed in smaller cardboard boxes he picked one up and moved over to his cluttered desk he swept the books and papers to the floor laid down the box and opened it inside was a ball of rice paper wrapped around a large object andrews carefully unwrapped the sheets and white white nono it couldnt be but it was it was a skull certainlybut not a fossil skull the material was bright white and it didnt weigh nearly enough a plaster cast not the original at all andrews opened every box inside the wooden crate his heart sinking as each new one yielded its contents in total there were fourteen skulls and eleven jawbones the skulls were subhuman with low foreheads prominent brow ridges flat faces and the most unlikely looking perfect square teeth amazingly each of the skull casts also showed clear artificial damage to the foramen magnum oh some work could indeed be done on these casts no doubt but where were the original fossils with the japanese having invaded china surely they were too precious to be left in the far east what was weidenreich up to fire it was like a piece of the sun brought down to earth it kept the tribe warm at night kept the sabertoothed cats awayand it did something wonderful to meat making it softer and easier to chew while at the same time restoring the warmth the flesh had had when still part of the prey fire was the most precious thing the tribe owned theyd had it for eleven summers now ever since bok the brave had brought out a burning stick from the burning forest the glowing coals were always fanned always kept alive and then one night the stranger cametall thin pale with redrimmed eyes that somehow seemed to glow from beneath his brow ridge the stranger did the unthinkable the unforgivable he doused the flames throwing a gourd full of water on to the fire the logs hissed and steam rose up into the blackness the children of the tribe began to cry the adults quaked with fury the stranger turned and walked into the darkness two of the strongest hunters ran after him but his long legs had apparently carried him quickly away the sounds of the forest grew closerthe chirps of insects the rustling of small animals in the vegetation and a flapping sound the stranger was gone and the silhouette of a bat fluttered briefly in front of the waning moon franz weidenreich had been born in germany in a completely bald thickset man he had made a name for himself as an expert in hematology and osteology he was currently visiting professor at the university of chicago but that was coming to an end and now he was faced with the uncomfortable prospect of having to return to nazi germanysomething as a jew he desperately wanted to avoid and then word came of the sudden death of the canadian paleontologist davidson black black had been at the peking union medical college studying the fragmentary remains of early man being recovered from the limestone quarry at chou kou tien weidenreich who once made a study of neanderthal bones found in germany had read blacks papers in nature and science describing sinanthropus but now at fifty black was as dead as his fossil chargesan unexpected heart attack and to weidenreichs delight the china medical board of the rockefeller foundation wanted him to fill blacks post china was a strange foreboding placeand tensions between the chinese and the japanese were highbut it beat all hell out of returning to hitlers germany at night most of the tribe huddled under the rocky overhang or crawled into the damp smelly recesses of the limestone cave without the fire to keep animals away someone had to stand watch each night armed with a large branch and a pile of rocks for throwing last night it had been karts turn everyone had slept well for kart was the strongest member of the tribe they knew they were safe from whatever lurked in the darkness when daybreak came the members of the tribe were astounded kart had fallen asleep they found him lying in the dirt next to the cold black pit where their fire had once been and on karts neck there were two small redrimmed holes staring up at them like the eyes of the stranger during his work on hematology weidenreich had met a remarkable man named brancusigaunt pale with disconcertingly sharp canine teeth brancusi suffered from a peculiar anemia which weidenreich had been unable to cure and an almost pathological photophobia still the gentleman was cultured and widely read and weidenreich had ever since maintained a correspondence with him when weidenreich arrived in peking work was still continuing at the quarry so far only teeth and fragments of skull had been found davidson black had done a good job of cataloging and describing some of the material but as weidenreich went through the specimens he was surprised to discover a small collection of sharp pointed fossil teeth black had evidently assumed they werent part of the sinanthropus material as he hadnt included them in his descriptions and at first glance blacks assessment seemed correctthey were far longer than normal human canines and much more sharply pointed but to weidenreichs eye the root pattern was possibly hominid he dropped a letter to his friend brancusi halfjoking that hed found brancusis greattothenth grandfather in china to weidenreichs infinite surprise within weeks brancusi had arrived in peking each night another member of the tribe stood watchand each morning that member was found unconscious with a pair of tiny wounds to his neck the tribe members were terrified soon multiple guards were posted each night and for a time the happenings ceased but then something even more unusual happened they were hunting deer it would not be the same not without fire to cook the meat but still the tribe needed to eat four men kart included led the assault they moved stealthily amongst the tall grasses tracking a large buck with a giant rack of antlers the hunters communicated by sign language carefully coordinating their movements closing in on the animal from both sides kart raised his right arm preparing to signal the final attack when a streak of light brown slicing through the grass fangs flashing the roar of the giant cat the stag bolting away and then karts own scream as the sabertooth grabbed hold of his thigh and shook him viciously the other three hunters ran as fast as they could desperate to get away they didnt stop to look back even when the cat let out the strangest yelp that night the tribe huddled together and sang songs urging karts soul a safe trip to heaven one of the chinese laborers found the first skull weidenreich was summoned at once brancusi still suffered from his photophobia and apparently had never adjusted to the shift in time zoneshe slept during the day weidenreich thought about waking him to see this great discovery but decided against it the skull was still partially encased in the limestone muck at the bottom of the cave it had a thick cranial wall and a beetle browdefinitely a more primitive creature than neanderthal probably akin to solo man or java man it took careful work to remove the skull from the ground but when it did come free two astonishing things became apparent the loose teeth davidson black had set aside had indeed come from the hominids here this skull still had all its upper teeth intact and the canines were long and pointed second and even more astonishing was the foramen magnumthe large opening in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes it was clear from its chipped frayed margin that this individuals foramen magnum had been artificially widened meaning hed been decapitated and then had something shoved up into his brain through the bottom of his skull five hunters stood guard that night the moon had set and the great sky river arched high over head the stranger returnedbut this time he was not alone the tribesmen couldnt believe their eyes in the darkness it looked like it was kart butbut kart was dead theyd seen the sabertooth take him the stranger came closer one of the men lifted a rock as if to throw it at him but soon he let the rock drop from his hand it fell to the ground with a dull thud the stranger continued to approach and so did kart and then kart opened his mouth and in the faint light they saw his teethlong and pointed like the strangers the men were unable to run unable to move they seemed transfixed either by the strangers gaze or by karts both of whom continued to approach and soon in the dark chill night the strangers fangs fell upon one of the guards necks and karts fell upon another eventually thirteen more skulls were found all of which had the strange elongated canine teeth and all of which had their foramen magnums artificially widened also found were some mandibles and skull fragments from other individualsbut there was almost no postcranial material someone in dim prehistory had discarded here the decapitated heads of a group of protohumans brancusi sat in weidenreichs lab late at night looking at the skulls he ran his tongue over his own sharp teeth contemplating these subhumans doubtless had no concept of mathematics beyond perhaps adding and subtracting on their fingers how would they possibly know of the problem that plagued the family the problem that every one of the kindred knew to avoid if all those who feel the bite of the vampire themselves become vampires when they die and all of those new vampires also turn those they feed from into vampires soon unless care is exercised the whole population will be undead a simple geometric progression brancusi had long wondered how far back the family went it wasnt like tracing a normal family treeoh yes the lines were bloodlines but not as passed on from father to son he knew his own lineagea servant at castle dracula before the count had taken to living all alone a servant whose loyalty to his master extended even to letting him drink from his neck brancusi himself had succumbed to pneumonia not an uncommon ailment in the dank carpathians he had no family and no one mourned his passing but soon he rose againand now he did have family an englishman and an american had killed the count removing his head with a kukri knife and driving a bowie knife through his heart when news of this reached brancusi from the gypsies he traveled back to transylvania draculas attackers had simply abandoned the coffin with its native soil and the dust that the counts body had crumbled into brancusi dug a grave on the desolate windswept grounds of the castle and placed the counts coffin within eventually over a long period the entire tribe had felt the strangers bite directly or indirectly a few of the tribefolk lost their lives to ravenous bloodthirst drained dry others succumbed to disease or giant cats or falls from cliffs one even died of old age but all of them rose again and so it came to pass just as it had for the stranger all those years before that the tribe had to look elsewhere to slake its thirst but they had not counted on the others weidenreich and brancusi sat in weidenreichs lab late at night things had been getting very tensethe japanese occupation was becoming intolerable im going to return to the states said weidenreich andrews at the american museum is offering me space to continue work on the fossils no said brancusi no you cant take the fossils weidenreichs bushy eyebrows climbed up toward his bald pate but we cant let them fall into japanese hands that is true said brancusi they belong somewhere safe somewhere where they can be studied no said brancusi his redrimmed gaze fell on weidenreich in a way it never had before nono one may see these fossils but andrews is expecting them hes dying to see them ive been deliberately vague in my letters to himi want to be there to see his face when he sees the dentition no one can know about the teeth said brancusi but hes expecting the fossils and i have to publish descriptions of them the teeth must be filed flat weidenreichs eyes went wide i cant do that you can and you will but you can and you will ii can but no buts no no there is a but andrews will never be fooled by filed teeth the structure of teeth varies as you go into them andrews will realize at once that the teeth have been reduced from their original size weidenreich looked at brancusi im sorry but theres no way to hide the truth the others lived in the next valley they proved tough and resourcefuland they could make fire whenever they needed it when the tribefolk arrived it became apparent that there was never a time of darkness for the others large fires were constantly burning the tribe had to feed but the others defended themselves trying to kill them with rock knives but that didnt work the tribefolk were undeterred they tried to kill them with spears but that did not work either the tribefolk came back they tried strangling the attackers with pieces of animal hide but that failed too the tribefolk returned again and finally the others decided to try everything they could think of simultaneously they drove wooden spears into the hearts of the tribefolk they used stone knives to carve off the heads of the tribefolk and then they jammed spears up into the severed heads forcing the shafts up through the holes at the bases of the skulls the hunters marched far away from their camp each carrying a spear thrust vertically toward the summer sun each one crowned by a severed pointedtoothed head when at last they found a suitable hole in the ground they dumped the heads in far far away from their bodies the others waited for the tribefolk to return but they never did do not send the originals said brancusi but the originals are mine do you understand i will ensure their safe passage out of china it looked for a moment like weidenreichs will was going to reassert itself but then his expression grew blank again all right ive seen you make casts of bones before with plaster of paris yes make casts of these skullsand then file the teeth on the casts but you said andrews and others would be able to tell if the original fossils were altered but theres no way they could tell that the casts had been modified correct not if its done skillfully i suppose but do it what about the foramen magnums what would you conclude if you saw fossils with such widened openings i dont knowpossibly that ritual cannibalism had been practiced ritual well if the only purpose was to get at the brain so you could eat it its easier just to smash the cranium and good good leave the damage to the skull bases intact let your andrews have that puzzle to keep him occupied the casts were crated up and sent to the states first then weidenreich himself headed for new york leaving he said instructions for the actual fossils to be shipped aboard the ss president harrison but the fossils never arrived in america and weidenreich the one man who might have clues to their whereabouts died shortly thereafter despite the raging war brancusi returned to europe returned to transylvania returned to castle dracula it took him a while in the darkness of night to find the right spotthe scar left by his earlier digging was just one of many on the desolate landscape but at last he located it he prepared a series of smaller holes in the ground and into each of them he laid one of the grinning skulls he then covered the holes over with dark soil brancusi hoped never to fall himself but if he did he hoped one of his own converts would do the same thing for him bringing his remains home to the family plot necros by brian lumley brian lumley is the bestselling author of dozens of novels including the necroscope and vampire world series and his titus crow and dreamlands series both of which take place in h p lovecrafts cthulhu mythos hes also written more than short stories which have been collected in numerous volumes

grand master by the world horror society it raised eyebrows when twentysixyearold playboy model anna nicole smith married eightynineyearold oil tycoon j howard marshall it seemed such a shameless example of a relationship built on mutual exploitation rather than mutual affection but is that really so different from most relationships is it the case as one character in this story ponders that all relationships are bargains of sorts maybe so maybe not but in the case of this story most definitely so an old woman in a faded blue frock and black headsquare paused in the shade of marios awning and nodded goodday she smiled a gaptoothed smile a bulky slouchshouldered youth in jeans and a stained yellow tshirta slopeheaded idiot probably her grandsonheld her hand drooling vacantly and fidgeting beside her mario nodded goodnaturedly smiled wrapped a piece of stale focaccia in greaseproof paper and came from behind the bar to give it to her she clasped his hand thanked him turned to go her attention was suddenly arrested by something she saw across the road she started cursed vividly harshly and despite my meager knowledge of italian i picked up something of the hatred in her tone devils spawn she said it again dog swine she pointed a shaking hand and finger said yet again devils spawn before making the twofingered doublehanded stabbing sign with which the italians ward off evil to do this it was first necessary that she drop her salted bread which the idiot youth at once snatched up then still mouthing low guttural imprecations dragging the shuffling focacciamunching cretin behind her she hurried off along the street and disappeared into an alley one word that she had repeated over and over again stayed in my mind necros necros though the word was new to me i took it for a curseword the accent she put on it had been poisonous i sipped at my negroni remained seated at the small circular table beneath marios awning and stared at the object of the crones distaste it was a motor car a white convertible rover and this years model inching slowly forward in a stream of holiday traffic and it was worth looking at if only for the girl behind the wheel the little man in the floppy white hat beside herwell he was something else too but she wasjust something else i caught just a glimpse sufficient to feel stunned that was good i had thought it was something i could never know again that feeling a man gets looking at a beautiful girl not after linda and yet she was young say twentyfour or five some three or four years my junior she sat tall at the wheel slim ravenhaired under a white widebrimmed summer hat which just missed matching that of her companion with a complexion cool and creamy enough to pour over peaches i stood upyes to get a better lookand right then the traffic came to a momentary standstill at that moment too she turned her head and looked at me and if the profile had stunned mewell the fullfrontal knocked me dead the girl was simply classically beautiful her eyes were of a dark green but very bright slightly tilted and perfectly oval under straight thin brows her cheekbones were high her lips a red cupids bow her neck long and white against the glowing yellow of her blouse and her smile oh yes she smiled her glance at first cool became curious in a moment then a little angry until finally seeing my confusionthat smile and as she turned her attention back to the road and followed the stream of traffic out of sight i saw a blush of color spreading on the creamy surface of her cheek then she was gone then too i remembered the little man who sat beside her actually i hadnt seen a great deal of him but what i had seen had given me the creeps he too had turned his head to stare at me leaving in my minds eye an impression of beady bird eyes sharp and intelligent in the shade of his hat he had stared at me for only a moment and then his head had slowly turned away but even when he no longer looked at me when he stared straight ahead it seemed to me i could feel those ravens eyes upon me and that a query had been written in them i believed i could understand it that look he must have seen a good many young men staring at him like thator rather at the girl his look had been a threat in answer to my threatand because he was practiced in it i had certainly felt the more threatened i turned to mario whose english was excellent she has something against expensive cars and rich people who he busied himself behind his bar the old lady the woman with the idiot boy ah he nodded mainly against the little man i suspect oh you want another negroni okand one for yourselfbut tell me about this other thing wont you if you likebut youre only interested in the girl yes he grinned i shrugged shes a goodlooker yes i saw her now he shrugged that other thingjust old myths and legends thats all like your english dracula eh transylvanian dracula i corrected him whatever you like and necros thats the name of the spook see necros is the name of a vampire a spook yes and this is a real legend i mean historical he made a fiftyfifty face his hands palms up local i guess ligurian i remember it from when i was a kid if i was bad old necros sure to come and get me today again the shrug its forgotten like the bogeyman i nodded eh nothing but why did the old girl go on like that again he shrugged maybe she think that old man necros eh she crazy you know very backward the whole family i was still interested how does the legend go the spook takes the life out of you you grow old spook grows young its a bargain you make he gives you something you want gets what he wants what he wants is your youth except he uses it up quick and needs more all the time more youth what kind of bargain is that i asked what does the victim get out of it gets what he wants said mario his brown face cracking into another grin in your case the girl eh if the little man was necros he got on with his work and i sat there sipping my negroni end of conversation i thought no more about ituntil later of course i should have been in italy with linda buti had kept her dear john for a fortnight before shredding it getting mindlessly drunk and starting in on the process of forgetting that had been a month ago the holiday had already been booked and i wasnt about to miss out on my trip to the sun and so i had come out on my own it was hot the swimming was good life was easy and the food superb with just two days left to enjoy it i told myself it hadnt been bad but it would have been better with linda linda she was still on my mindat the back of it anywaylater that night as i sat in the bar of my hotel beside an open bougainvilleadecked balcony that looked down on the bay and the seafront lights of the town and maybe she wasnt all that far back in my mindmaybe she was right there in frontor else i was just plain daydreaming whichever i missed the entry of the lovely lady and her shriveled companion failing to spot and recognize them until they were taking their seats at a little table just the other side of the balconys sweep this was the closest id been to her and well first impressions hadnt lied this girl was beautiful she didnt look quite as young as shed first seemedmy own age maybebut beautiful she certainly was and the old boy he must be could only be her father maybe it sounds like i was a little naive but with her looks this lady really didnt need an old man and if she did need one it didnt have to be this one by now shed seen me and my fascination with her must have been obvious seeing it she smiled and blushed at one and the same time and for a moment turned her eyes awaybut only for a moment fortunately her companion had his back to me or he must have known my feelings at once for as she looked at me againfully upon me this timei could have sworn i read an invitation in her eyes and in that same moment any bitter vows i may have made melted away completely and were forgotten god please let him be her father for an hour i sat there drinking a few too many cocktails eating olives and potato crisps from little bowls on the bar keeping my eyes off the girl as best i could if only for common decencys sake butall the time i worried frantically at the problem of how to introduce myself and as the minutes ticked by it seemed to me that the most obvious way must also be the best but how obvious would it be to the old boy and the damnable thing was that the girl hadnt given me another glance since her originalinvitation had i mistaken that look of hersor was she simply waiting for me to make the first move god let him be her father she was sipping martinis slowly he drank a rich red wine in some quantity i asked a waiter to replenish their glasses and charge it to me i had already spoken to the bar steward a swarthy friendly little chap from the south called francesco but he hadnt been able to enlighten me the pair were not resident he assured me but being resident myself i was already pretty sure of that anyway my drinks were delivered to their table they looked surprised the girl put on a perfectly innocent expression questioned the waiter nodded in my direction and gave me a cautious smile and the old boy turned his head to stare at me i found myself smiling in return but avoiding his eyes which were like coals now sunken deep in his brown wrinkled face time seemed suspendedif only for a secondthen the girl spoke again to the waiter and he came across to me mr collins sir the gentleman and the young lady thank you and request that you join them which was everything i had dared hope forfor the moment standing up i suddenly realized how much id had to drink i willed sobriety on myself and walked across to their table they didnt stand up but the little chap said please sit his voice was a rustle of dried grass the waiter was behind me with a chair i sat peter collins i said how do you do mrer karpethes he answered nichos karpethes and this is my wife adrienne neither one of them had made the effort to extend their hands but that didnt dismay me only the fact that they were married dismayed me he must be very very rich this nichos karpethes im delighted you invited me over i said forcing a smile but i see that i was mistaken you see i thought i heard you speaking english and i thought we were english she finished it for me a natural error originally i am armenian nichos is greek of course we do not speak each others tongue but we do both speak english are you staying here mr collins er yesfor one more day and night then i shrugged and put on a sad look back to england im afraid afraid the old boy whispered there is something to fear in a return to your homeland just an expression i answered i meant im afraid that my holiday is coming to an end he smiled it was a strange wistful sort of smile wrinkling his face up like a little walnut but your friends will be glad to see you again your loved ones i shook my head only a handful of friendsnone of them really closeand no loved ones im a loner mr karpethes a loner his eyes glowed deep in their sockets and his hands began to tremble where they gripped the tables rim mr collins you dont we understand she cut him off for although we are together we too in our way are loners money has made nichos lonely you see also he is not a well man and time is short he will not waste what time he has on frivolous friendships as for myselfpeople do not understand our being together nichos and i they pry and i withdraw and so i too am a loner there was no accusation in her voice but still i felt obliged to say i certainly didnt intend to pry mrs adrienne she smiled please no of course you didnt i would not want you to think we thought that of you anyway i will tell you why we are together and then it will be put aside her husband coughed seemed to choke struggled to his feet i stood up and took his arm he at once shook me offwith some distaste i thoughtbut adrienne had already signaled to a waiter assist mr karpethes to the gentlemans room she quickly instructed in very good italian and please help him back to the table when he has recovered as he went karpethes gesticulated probably tried to say something to me by way of an apology choked again and reeled as he allowed the waiter to help him from the room imsorry i said not knowing what else to say he has attacks she was cool do not concern yourself i am used to it we sat in silence for a moment finally i began you were going to tell me ah yes i had forgotten it is a symbiosis oh yes i need the good life he can give me and he needsmy youth we supply each others needs and so in a way the old woman with the idiot boy hadnt been wrong after all a sort of bargain had indeed been struck between karpethes and his wife as that thought crossed my mind i felt the short hairs at the back of my neck stiffen for a moment gooseflesh crawled on my arms after all nichos was pretty close to necros and now this youth thing again coincidence of course and after all arent all relationships bargains of sorts bargains struck for better or for worse but for how long i asked i mean how long will it work for you she shrugged i have been provided for and he will have me all the days of his life i coughed cleared my throat gave a strained selfconscious laugh and heres me the nonpryer no not at all i wanted you to know well i shrugged but its been a pretty deep first conversation first did you believe that buying me a drink would entitle you to more than one conversation i almost winced actually i but then she smiled and my world lit up you did not need to buy the drinks she said there would have been some other way i looked at her inquiringly some other way to to find out if we were english or not oh here comes nichos now she smiled across the room and we must be leaving hes not well tell me will you be on the beach tomorrow ohyes i answered after a moments hesitation i like to swim so do i perhaps we can swim out to the raft id like that very much her husband arrived back at the table under his own steam he looked a little stronger now not quite so shriveled somehow he did not sit but gripped the back of his chair with parchment fingers knuckles white where the skin stretched over old bones mr collins he rustled adrienne im sorry theres really no need i said rising we really must be going she also stood no you stay here er peter its kind of you but we can manage perhaps well see you on the beach and she helped him to the door of the bar and through it without once looking back they werent staying at my hotel had simply dropped in for a drink that was understandable though i would have preferred to think that she had been looking for me for my hotel was middling touristclass while theirs was something else they were up on the hill high on the crest of a ligurian spur where a smaller much more exclusive place nestled in mediterranean pines a place whose lights spelled money when they shone up there at night whose music came floating down from a tiny openair disco like the laughter of highliving elementals of the air if i was poetic it was because of her i mean that beautiful girl and that weary wrinkled driedup walnut of an old man if anything i was sorry for him and yet in another way i wasnt and lets make no pretence about itif i havent said it already let me say it right nowi wanted her moreover there had been that about our conversation her beach invitation which told me that she was available the thought of it kept me awake half the night i was on the beach at amthey didnt show until when they did and when she came out of her tiny changing cubicle there wasnt a male head on the beach that didnt turn at least twice who could blame them that girl in that costume would have turned the head of a sphinx butthere was something some little nagging thing different about her a maturity beyond her years she held herself like a model a princess but who was it for karpethes or me as for the old man he was in a crumpled lightweight summer suit and sunshade hat as usual but he seemed a bit more perky this morning unlike myself hed doubtless had a good nights sleep while his wife had been changing he had made his way unsteadily across the pebbly beach to my table and sun umbrella taking the seat directly opposite me and before his wife could appear he had opened with good morning mr collins good morning i answered please call me peter peter then he nodded he seemed out of breath either from his stumbling walk over the beach or a certain urgency which i could detect in his movements his hurried almost rude lets get down to it manner peter you said you would be here for one more day thats right i answered for the first time studying him closely where he sat like some strange garden gnome half in the shade of the beach umbrella this is my last day he was a bundle of dry wood a desiccated prune a small umber scarecrow and his voice too was of straw or autumn leaves blown across a shady path only his eyes were alive and you said you have no family few friends no one to miss you back in england warning bells rang in my head maybe it wasnt so much urgency in himwhich usually implies a goal or ambition still to be realizedbut eagerness in that the goal was in sight thats correct i am was a student doctor when i get home i shall seek a position other than that theres nothing no one no ties he leaned forward bird eyes very bright claw hand reaching across the table trembling and her shadow suddenly fell across us as she stood there in that costume karpethes jerked back in his chair his face was working strange emotions twisting the folds and wrinkles of his flesh into stranger contours i could feel my heart thumping against my ribswhy i couldnt say i calmed myself looked up at her and smiled she stood with her back to the sun which made a dark silhouette of her head and face but in that blot of darkness her oval eyes were green jewels shall we swim peter she turned and ran down the beach and of course i ran after her she had a head start and beat me to the water beat me to the raft too it wasnt until i hauled myself up beside her that i thought of karpethes how i hadnt even excused myself before plunging after her but at least the water had cleared my head bringing me completely awake and aware aware of her incredible body where it stretched almost touching mine on the fibre deck of the gently bobbing raft i mentioned her husbands line of inquiry gasping a little for breath as i recovered from the frantic exercise of our race she on the other hand already seemed completely recovered she carefully arranged her hair about her shoulders like a fan to dry in the sunlight before answering nichos is not really my husband she finally said not looking at me i am his companion thats all i could have told you last night butthere was the chance that you really were curious only about our nationality as for any veiled threats he might have issued that is not unusual he might not have the vitality of younger men but jealousy is ageless no i answered he didnt threatennot that i noticed but jealousy knowing i have only one more day to spend here what has he to fear from me her shoulders twitched a little a shrug she turned her face to me her lips inches away her eyelashes were like silken shutters over green pools hiding whatever swam in the deeps i am young peter and so are you and you are very attractive veryeager holiday romances are not uncommon my blood was on fire i have very little money i said we are staying at different hotels he already suspects me it is impossible what is she innocently asked leaving me at a complete loss but then she laughed tossed back her hair already dry dangled her hands and arms in the water where theres a will she said you know that i want you the words spilled out before i could control or change them oh yes and i want you she said it so simply and yet suddenly i felt seared a moth brushing the magnet candles flame i lifted my head looked towards the beach across seventyfive yards of sparkling water the beach umbrellas looked very large and close karpethes sat in the shade just as i had last seen him his face hidden in shadow but i knew that he watched you can do nothing here she said her voice languidbut i noticed now that she too seemed short of breath this i told her with a groan is going to kill me she laughed laughter that sparkled more than the sun on the sea im sorry she said more soberly its unfair of me to laugh butyour case is not hopeless oh tomorrow morning early nichos has an appointment with a specialist in geneva i am to drive him into the city tonight well stay at a hotel overnight i groaned my misery then my case is quite hopeless i fly tomorrow but if i sprained my wrist she said and so could not driveand if he went into geneva by taxi while i stayed behind with a headachebecause of the pain from my wrist like a flash she was on her feet the raft tilting her body diving striking the water into a spray of diamonds seconds for it all to sink inand then i was following her laboring through the water in her churning wake and as she splashed from the sea seeing her stumble go to her hands and knees in ligurian shingleand the pained look on her face the way she held her wrist as she came to her feet as easy as that karpethes struggling to rise from his seat stared at her with his mouth agape her face screwed up now as i followed her up the beach and adrienne holding her sprained wrist and shaking it her mouth forming an elongated o the sinuous motion of her body and limbs mobile marble with dew of ocean clinging saltily if the tiny man had said to me i am necros i want ten years of your life for one night with her at that moment i might have sealed the bargain gladly but legends are legends and he wasnt necros and he didnt and i didnt after all there was no need i suppose my greatest fear was that she might be having me on amusing herself at my expense she was of course safe with mein so far as i would be gone tomorrow and the romance forgotten for her anywayand i could also see how she was starved for young companionship a fact she had brought right out in the open from the word go but why me why should i be so lucky attractive was i i had never thought so perhaps it was because i was so safe here today and gone tomorrow with little or no chance of complications yes that must be it if she wasnt simply making a fool of me she might be just a tease but she wasnt at that evening i was in the bar of my hotelhad been there for an hour careful not to drink too much unable to eatwhen the waiter came to me and said there was a call for me on the reception telephone i hurried out to reception where the clerk discreetly excused himself and left me alone peter her voice was a deep well of promise hes gone ive booked us a table to dine at is that all right for you a table where my own voice breathless why up here of course oh dont worry its perfectly safe and anyway nichos knows knows i was taken aback a little panicked what does he know that were dining together in fact he suggested it he didnt want me to eat aloneand since this is your last night ill get a taxi right away i told her good i look forward toseeing you i shall be in the bar i replaced the telephone in its cradle wondering if she always took an aperitif before the main course i had smartened myself up that is to say i was immaculate black bowtie white evening jacket courtesy of c a black trousers and a lightly frilled white shirt the only one i had ever owned but i might have known that my appearance would never match up to hers it seemed that everything she did was just perfectly right i could only hope that that meant literally everything but in her black lace evening gown with its plunging neckline short wide sleeves and delicate silver embroidery she was stunning sitting with her in the bar sipping our drinksfor me a large whisky and for her a tall cinzanoi couldnt take my eyes off her twice i reached out for her hand and twice she drew back from me discreet they may well be she said letting her oval green eyes flicker towards the bar where guests stood and chatted and back to me but theres really no need to give them occasion to gossip im sorry adrienne i told her my voice husky and close to trembling but how is it she demurely cut me off that a goodlooking man like you ishow do you say itgoing short i sat back chuckled thats a rather unladylike expression i told her oh and what ive planned for tonight is ladylike my voice went huskier still just what is your plan while we eat she answered her voice low i shall tell you at which point a waiter loomed napkin over his arm inviting us to accompany him to the dining room adriennes portions were tiny mine huge she sipped a slender light white wine i gulped blocky rich red from a glass the waiter couldnt seem to leave alone mercifully i was hungryi hadnt eaten all dayelse that meal must surely have bloated me out and all of it ordered in advance the very best in quality cuisine this she eventually said handing me her key fits the door of our suite we were sitting back enjoying liqueurs and cigarettes the rooms are on the ground floor tonight you enter through the door tomorrow morning you leave via the window a slow walk down to the seafront will refresh you how is that for a plan unbelievable you dont believe it not my good fortune no shall we say that we both have our needs i think i said that i may be falling in love with you what if i dont wish to leave in the morning she shrugged smiled said who knows what tomorrow may bring how could i ever have thought of her simply as another girl or even an ordinary young woman girl she certainly was woman too but soknowing beautiful as a princess and knowing as a whore if marios old myths and legends were reality and if nichos karpethes were really necros then hed surely picked the right companion no man born could ever have resisted adrienne of that i was quite certain these thoughts were in my mindbut dimly at the back of my mindas i left her smoking in the diningroom and followed her directions to the suite of rooms at the rear of the hotel in the front of my mind were other thoughts much more vivid and completely erotic i found the suite entered left the door slightly ajar behind me the thing about an italian room is its size an entire suite of rooms is vast as it happened i was only interested in one room and adrienne had obligingly left the door to that one open i was sweating and yeti shivered adrienne had said fifteen minutes time enough for her to smoke another cigarette and finish her drink then she would come to me by now the entire staff of the hotel probably knew i was in here but this was italy i shivered again excitement probably i threw off my clothes found my way to the bathroom took the quickest shower of my life drying myself off i padded back to the bedroom between the main bedroom and the bathroom a smaller door stood ajar i froze as i reached it my senses suddenly alert my ears seeming to stretch themselves into vast receivers to pick up any slightest sound for there had been a sound i was sure of it from that room a scratching a rustle a whisper i couldnt say but a sound anyway adrienne would be coming soon standing outside that door i slowly recommenced toweling myself dry my naked feet were still firmly rooted but my hands automatically worked with the towel it was nerves only nerves there had been no sound or at most only the night breeze off the sea whispering in through an open window i stopped toweling took another step towards the main bedroom heard the sound again a small choking rasp a tiny gasping for air karpethes what the hell was going on i shivered violently my suddenly chill flesh shuddering in an uncontrollable spasm buti forced myself to action returned to the main bedroom quickly dressed with the exception of my tie and jacket and crept back to the small room adrienne must be on her way to me even now she mustnt find me poking my nose into things like a suspicious kid i must kill off this silly feeling that had my skin crawling not that an attack of nerves was unnatural in the circumstances on the contrary but i wasnt about to let it spoil the night i pushed open the door of the room entered into darkness found the light switch then i held my breath flipped the switch the room was only half as big as the others it contained a small single bed a bedside table a wardrobe nothing more or at least nothing immediately apparent to my wildly darting eyes my heart which was racing slowed and began to settle towards a steadier beat the window was open external shutters closedbut small night sounds were finding their way in through the louvers the distant sounds of traffic the toot of hornsholiday sounds from below i breathed deeply and gratefully and saw something projecting from beneath the pillow on the bed a corner of card or of dark leather like a wallet or or a passport a greek passport karpethes when i opened it but how could it be the man in the photograph was young no older than me his birth date proved it but there was his name nichos karpethes printed in greek of course but still plain enough his son puzzling over the passport had served to distract me my nerves had steadied up i tossed the passport down frowned at it where it lay upon the bed breathed deeply once morethen froze solid a scratching a hissing a dry gruntingfrom the wardrobe mice or did i in fact smell a rat even as the short hairs bristled on the back of my neck i knew anger there were too many unexplained things here too much i didnt understand and what was it i feared old marios myths and legends no for in my experience the italians are notorious for getting things wrong oh yes notorious i reached out turned the wardrobes doorknob yanked the doors open at first i saw nothing of any importance or significance my eyes didnt know what they sought shoes patent leather two pairs stood side by side below tiny suits no bigger than boys sizes hung above on steel hangers andmy god my goda waistcoat i backed out of that little room on rubber legs with the silence of the suite shrieking all about me my eyes bulging my jaw hanging slack peter she came in through the suites main door came floating towards me eager smiling her green eyes blazing then blazing their suspicion their anger as they saw my condition peter i lurched away as her hands reached for me those hands i had never yet touched which had never touched me then i was into the main bedroom snatching my tie and jacket from the bed dont ask me why and out of the window yelling some inarticulate choking thing at her and lashing out frenziedly with my foot as she reached after me her eyes were bubbling green hells peter her fingers closed on my forearm bands of steel containing a fierce hungry heat and strong as two men she began to lift me back into her lair i put my feet against the wall kicked came free and crashed backwards into shrubbery then up on my feet gasping for air running tumbling crashing into the night down madly tilting slopes through black chasms of mountain pine with the mediterranean stars winking overhead and the beckoning friendly lights of the village seen occasionally below in the morning looking up at the way i had descended and remembering the nightmare of my panicflight i counted myself lucky to have survived it the place was precipitous in the end i had fallen but only for a short distance all in utter darkness and my head striking something hard but i did survive survived both adrienne and my flight from her waking with the dawn stiff and bruised and with a massive bump on my forehead i staggered back to my hotel locked the door behind methen sat there trembling and moaning until it was time for the coach weak maybe i was maybe i am but on my way into geneva with people round me and the sun hot through the coachs windows i could think again i could roll up my sleeve and examine that claw mark of four slim fingers and a thumb branded white into my suntanned flesh where hair would never grow again on skin sere and wrinkled and seeing those marks i could also remember the wardrobe and the waistcoatand what the waistcoat contained that tiny puppet of a man alive still but barely his stickarms dangling through the waistcoats arm holes his babys head projecting its chin supported by the tightly buttoned waistcoats breast and the large bulldog clip over the hangers bar its teeth fastened in the loose wrinkled skin of his walnut head holding it up and his skinny little legs dangling twigthings twitching there and his pleading pleading eyes but eyes are something i mustnt dwell upon and green is a color i can no longer bear exsanguinations a handbook for the educated vampire by anna s oppenhagenpetrescu translated from the romanian by catherynne m valente catherynne m valente is the critically

her first science fiction story golubash or winebloodwarelegy appeared in my anthology federations this next piece translated by valente is an excerpt from exsanguinations a handbook for the educated vampire the indispensable tome of vampire legends and lore by noted vampire scholar annasilvia oppenhagenpetrescu of the university of budapest valente originally published this prefatory and press material on her website annapetrescucatherynnemvalentecom it appears here in print for the first time look for exsanguinations at fine purveyors of demonic texts throughout europe and america in october an ideal vampire prefatory notes death is such a victorian conceit death is solemn it is colorless the unfortunate maiden is laid in a long bed with a silk scarf at the neck scented with oils so that her stink does not offend delicate nostrils her hair brushed to a lustre never achieved in life skin powdered pale and smooth lips drawn in obscene red all to give the appearance of life just snuffed out so recently that the body has not yet realized it has not merely dozed off in the midst of a pleasant afternoon why her eyelashes never laid so coyly dark upon her cheek her color was never so high and feverflushed her teeth never sat so white upon her scarlet lips her curls never clustered so black around her seraphic face in short all effort has been made to make the poor corpse appear immortal to dress it as a vampire after all it is not a proper funeral if she does not look so fresh that she could leap at any moment from the coffin and affix her teeth to a relatives jugular it is a fetish really the justdead virgin as if death were a door from which she must emerge a whore demoniac and hungry the vampire on the contrary is essentially byronic it walks in beauty like the night and through the night and in it it is always windswept and brooding dandified by the accessories of deaththe cross the coffin the shroud but these things are merely fashion no more intrinsic to the vampire self than a widows peak or a lugosian laugh what is necessary is the predatory instinct and the eternal study of death since the vampire is its most skilled practitioner the vampire is not half in love with easeful death it is easeful death and it has some small duty to make of death an art an ecstasy a philosophy else why be a demon certainly mortals cannot get away with such pretension one might casually wonder whether the vampire was a product of the gothic imagination or the gothic imagination was a product of the vampireif one were predisposed to ponder such questions the vampire by its nature does so unable to see itself in a lookingglass it is the vainest of all creatures and considers its own nature incessantly these days there are nightconferences in bulgaria and romania with endless papers and sample chapters of promised masterpieces of course being byronic the ideal vampire is male heroic in his way a frontiersman braving the wilds of humanity piling high his carcasses on the plains i am not an ideal vampire but surely my curls were never so black and shining as the day they lay me in the dirt i listened to them mumble the old rd and counted like sheep the thudfalls of shoveled earth on the lid of what i must assume was a very expensive coffin death as i have said is victorianthus no family would allow themselves to be seen in public with subpar funerary rites i will not here indulge in that most vulgar of recent fashions autobiography suffice it to say that i along with every other vampire since the classical age of our slavic forefathers clawed my way out of that very wellappointed coffin and into the inevitably moonlit night i availed myself as so many of us do of the graveyard caretaker as my first victimhow many of us recall the awkwardness of that first exsanguination it is so much like making love for the first time one has no clear idea what goes where but clutches stiffly to whatever seems more or less correct spraying fluids all over ones best evening clothes and mumbling apologies to the hapless partner who no doubt experienced none of the crude pleasure one hoards to oneself of course the experience of feeding is hardly the psychosexual revelation recent extracultural authors have claimeddo you dear reader find yourself in involuntary climax when ingesting a plate of pasta and a modest red wine certainly not yet certain in vogue lady novelists would have their deluded readership believe our own furtive suppers are orgiastic communions of the highest order ah but i have forgotten the tiresome necessity of all vampiric literaturei have not given my credentials i ought to simply attach a notice of my parentage to my lapel or my curriculum vitae perhaps even have it notarized like the breeding papers of a halffeeble spaniel but certainly without credentials i can have nothing of importance to say very well i was sponsored by a very beguiling old debauch by the name of ambrose mosshammer who asked me to stay after his herodotus seminar for special instruction i fully expected to be accosted in his windowless eighth floor officethough when i imagined his skeletal hand groping my breasts and tearing my new wool skirt i did not quite realize that he would simultaneously be whispering the tale of gyges in my ear and divining the path of my jugular with his tongue before slashing into my throat with his gnarled ancient teeth it was certainly not what i had been led to expect young ladies experienced behind the closed doors of the offices of elderly colleagues i beg the forgiveness of any vampiric readers for whom this recitation must be as tedious and gauche as a human reading about the expulsion of the placenta from his mothers womb but the forms must be followed ambroses blood tasted faintly of dust and the glue of bookbindings as well as a peculiar undertaste of sandalwood and tobacco it was not unpleasant but i was rather in a rush to finish the process once i realized what was afoot there is no need to dwell in ritualthat sort of decadence can be safely left to catholicism he proffered his wrist in a most gentlemanly manner and i availed myself of the necessary blood i cannot overstate his professionalism and patience truly the old ones have a gravitas the younger generation of fiends cannot match i left his office with a rumpled skirt and a torn blouse carried by his graduate students out to the parking lot where i could safely be assumed to have been a victim of an overzealous mugger a few days later i had risen from my grave and thusly embarked on my postdoctoral career anna s oppenhagenpetrescu university of budapest night campus about the author annasilvia oppenhagenpetrescu was born in to danishromanian parents adrian petrescu and marie oppenhagen adrian and marie had immigrated from the continent whilst marie was pregnant to the quiet london suburb of kensington where they raised their only daughter in relative tranquility the life of a young scholar is often tediously predictable and young anna was educated in the usual singlesex boarding schools before entering the equally homogenous st hildas college oxford university she studied classics there under the watchful eye of dr ambrose k mosshammer who in her final year of study graciously converted her in recognition of her great talent once anna had graduated her interest shifted from the roots of human civilization in ancient greece to the roots of vampiric civilization in the slavic states and central europe her unromantic and strictly researched work in the field of protohistory is widely recognized as having been one of the foundations of the field in she helped to establish the order of the ivory tooth an association of literary historians who set out to archive the entirety of the vampiric corpusthat is the sum total of all literature involving vampires in the west while this goal is far from complete the order is now one of the most highly respected institutions among the vampiric elite and its work and ritual conferences are watched with great interest in the early eighties while a humble lecturer at the university of the danube anna was also involved in the eden project a thinktank which aimed to definitively prove or debunk the everpopular claims of preslavic heritage through lilith in recent years the edenites have shifted their focus to documenting the dark ages of the classical world and early semitic culture in which the records of vampiric activity are so scarce as to be by and large discounted by the academic majority the lilith question a nowubiquitous term coined by dr moira russell annas partner in edenism was never qualitatively answered and the two disagree on the subject to this day in anna was hired as a tenuretrack professor at the university of constantinople where she produced her enormous and definitive critical work she drained me of my very marrow the female vampire in history and literature the success and influence of this work cannot be overestimated and continues to be the bedrock of black feminism a movement which has become something of a juggernaut in recent years in fact it was largely due to the popularity of this lay history that the loose confederation of night campuses organized the first of its annual conferences in madrid in of course there are many other conferences around the world and meetings of various societies but the general conference of shadowacademia is by far the largest most prestigious and wellattended it is nowadays simply referred to as the conference disagreements arose between anna and the faculty of sanguinary history at constantinople largely revolving around annas involvement with the edenites and her insistence on encouraging her graduate students to generate texts of their own to counter the horde of human literature on the subject of vampires in she left constantinople and took the prestigious geisslerin chair at the university of budapest where she teaches to this day anna remains unmarried it is considered somewhat gauche to reference ones mortal parentage when in polite society most modern vampires trace their heritage purely through the line of conversion often in the spanish style in which case annas rather baroque moniker would be annasilvia oppenhagenpetrescu y mosshammer y chamberlain etc nevertheless for the sake of the laity she has chosen to briefly recount the flotsam and jetsam of her preconversion existence here those of standing in the community may feel secure in passing by this piece of historical curiosity dr mosshammer has kindly agreed to write an introduction to dr petrescus forthcoming work exsanguinations a handbook for the educated vampire university of csejthe press the apprenticemaster relationship between many vampires and the quasiparental figures who converted them is welldocumented but dr mosshammer has been particularly supportive and the editors of this site wish to take this opportunity to publicly thank him and thus able to take part in such specious feminist activities as the danube is wellknown as a hotbed of radical thought and shoddy workmanshipeven popularly referred to as the berkeley of eastern europe university of darvulia press black feminism a movement which centralizes the role of the female vampire the succubus in sanguinary history is somewhat tainted in the view of most historians due to its roots in human scholarship in the mortal world secondwave feminism resulted in a great deal of literaturemuch of which was written by women like anna who would later be converted bringing this rather specialized interest into their vampiric studies in addition many find it ridiculous in light of the great vampires of literature being predominantly male to privilege the role of the femalein essence placing the role of the three sisters over that of dracula however black feminists trace their lineage through such actual vampire personages as elizabeth bathory clara geisslerin augusta gordon and emily draper scoffing at any attempt to drag dracula into serious discussions of gender in the community this remains a controversy which finds anna and her colleagues at its center however it has been suggested that since anna herself was converted by a male vampire she ought to be more grateful to the masculine animus and confine herself to more traditional histories the conference will take place july in lodz poland hosted by plogojiwitz university hotels fill up quickly so reservations are suggested much as it was once considered beneath mortal nobility to engage in mercantile activities it is widely asserted that for vampires to produce their own quasifictional texts is vulgar in the highest degree to speak for ourselves threatens the exposure of our entire community and most agree that the formulation of ridiculous and outlandish stories of bloodletting and cannibalism ought to be left to those mortal authors who find it titillating predictably this has caused a number of rumors to arise as to the orientation of dr petrescu while the editors of this site feel that such a subject is merely salacious and has no place in a professional biography or in the parlor rooms of certain aged male faculty members they will note without commentary that dr petrescu has cohabited with the italian edenite

prodigal troll writing as c c finlay he has a historical fantasy trilogy called traitor to the crown just out from del rey consisting of the patriot witch a spell for the revolution and the demon redcoat finlays short fiction has appeared in several magazines and anthologies and has been collected in wild things his novella the political prisoner is a finalist for the hugo and nebula awards finlay says that the appeal of the vampire is about the seduction of easy selfgratifying choices and the prices we pay for our pleasures its about the contradiction that happens when we peer at the darkness within ourselves only to find a light he said i suspect that vampires are a kind of literary rorschach test revealing the suppressed secrets of our individual personalities and emotional states thats why theyre such a source of endless fascination lucy in her splendor is about a couple that owns a bed and breakfast on an island what happens on the island stays on the island even when youd rather have it go away when they were done they sat in the plastic lawn chairs by the lake and listened in the dark to waves lapping the sharp white boulders mounded along the shore the first moth came fluttering from the direction of the pumphouse it slapped into lucys cheek almost accidentally and startled them both she raised her hand against it and the moth settled on one whitetipped nail as she flicked her fingertip it lifted into the air and hurtled back at her face a second and a third moth followed seconds later followed in time by others until a tiny halo of insects swirled around her short platinum blonde hair could be worse martin said trying to wave them off could be mosquitoes she smiled at him shifted her chair closer and leaned against his shoulder god lucy youre hot he said she laughed a little sadly making a warm vibration that resonated in his chest im glad you still think so no he said are you sure you havent turned into a bug lamp i swear youre hot enough to zap those bugs to ashes you she lifted her hand to slap him but he caught it and folded her fingers within his own her skin was dry caked with grit he gave it a little squeeze and looked around but rows of trees blocked the view of their neighbors more bugs flew at lucys head her voice trembled im really sick arent i its just a fever thats all it is he placed her hand in his lap and tried to wave the bugs away one of the moths wings buzzed harshly while the stones tapped against each other in the susurration of the waves lets go inside i dont know what id do without you she whispered without saying anything to reassure her he helped her to her feet propping her up as they strolled back to the house when they passed the handcarved sign that read crows nest bed breakfast little limestone island he flipped the board sorry no vacancy her fever burned all night martin sat on the edge of the bed feeding her tablets of aspirin and ice chips a single moth had followed them inside the house tickling lucy out of her rest until martin turned on the lamp and the tiny creature flew to rest panting on the white shade he smashed it leaving a smear of gray dust and wings walking over to the gable window he gazed out of their attic apartment at the lake all their lifes savings were encompassed by these few acres of land bounded on one end by the stone jetty covered with zebramussel shells and on the other by the apple tree with the bench swing when insects began collecting at the screen he stepped away lucy shuddered in her sleep sucking air through her mouth martin bent over and slipped his tonguebrieflybetween her teeth he expected the soursweet taste of sickness but it wasnt there that only made it worse in the morning martin puttered in the kitchen even though they had no guests making himself a cappuccino and sitting at the dining room table beside the doublehung windows facing the lake an ore carrier moved sluggishly away from the island heading past putinbay for the ohio shore a tall silverhaired man in gold pants and shirttheir neighbor billwalked along the shore with a little girl about four or five years old martins heart began to skip he set his cup down so fast it splashed and ran through the screenedin porch the door clapping shut behind him sunrise glinted off the water he shielded his eyes with his hand as he walked barefoot over the dewdamp grass hey neighbor good morning marty bill replied he gestured at the little girl this heres our granddaughter kelsey say hi darling the little girl looked up at martin panic flashed across her eyes and she spun away from him to look at the lake hi kelsey martin said he noticed the cappuccino running down his arm and absentmindedly lifted his wrist to his mouth to lick it off bill shrugged kids huh folks dont teach em any manners these days he pointed to the pumphouse a squat block of concrete that sat on the edge of the lake when did you block that up oh the farmhouse was over a hundred years old before the island built its water supply the farmers pumped it in directly from the lake a couple days ago i thought you were going to turn it into a sauna thats still the plan but one of our guests was poking around in it after he came back from the winery fell and cut his head pretty big gash he didnt need stitches but we figured liability yeah thats a shame people not being responsible bill looked up to the porch say where are your guests isnt it about breakfast time we had to cancel all our reservations martin said he watched kelsey closely she poked around the rocks searching for a way into the pumphouse lucys been sick gosh im sorry to hear that whats wrong she came down with this fever hey there she is martin turned lucy stood outlined in the attic window the glass caught the sun casting it in such a way that she was surrounded by a corona of jagged golden light bill waved to the attic window and cupped his hands to his mouth get well soon lucy she returned the greeting you have an awful pretty wife there bill said martin frowned some days shes more awful than kelsey pounded on the side of the pumphouse with a rock martin hurried toward her hand outstretched stepping carefully in his bare feet across the stones hey kelsey come here i want to show you something neat the little girl looked to her grandfather who nodded permission shhh martin pressed his forefinger to his lips with exaggerated tiptoeing he led her onto their other neighbors property it was a small cabin seldom used its lake pump had been more modern an eightfoot square of concrete that jutted out from the shore like a single tooth in a childs mouth algaeslick boulders driftwood branches and other debris heaped around it the two inched slowly out on the slab until they reached the edge and saw the snakesa dozen or more of them ranging in length from one to three feet their scales glistened black as they sunned themselves on the rocks kelsey gasped and clung to martins leg pressing her face against his thigh and peeking out martin wrapped his hand around the top of her head and pointed out to the water where a new snake sinuated across the rippled surface toward the shore it lifted its nose turning it like a submarine periscope bill crept up behind them and stomped his foot on the concrete chuckling as they jumped the snakes immediately disappeared among the rocks and driftbrush the snake in the water dived beneath the surface kelsey lifted her head grampa martin straightened letting her go theyre harmless he said lake erie water snakes endangered bill wrapped his arms around his granddaughter just cause theyre endangered dont mean theyre not dangerous tigers are endangered too but theyre still dangerous martin smiled and stepped off the slab you come back any time you want to see my snakes now kelsey they said goodbye to one another martin watched until they were off the property then went inside and watched out the window to be sure they didnt come back the setting sun sheened off the windshield causing martin to slow the car as he passed the blackclad teenagers strolling down the road trading cigarettes a pinkhaired boy sneered at martin and lucy shaping his hand into a claw and gouging at them the other kids laughed are you sure you feel well enough to do this martin asked lucy she ran her fingertips over her face to smooth the skin its been long enough we have to get back to normal some time and i do feel better good martin pulled into the lot of the limestone island winery tires crunching on the gravel he jumped out and opened the door for her they walked up the steps the winery sat on the waterfront within walking distance of the docks the terrace faced the lake so thats where the tourists gathered a jimmy buffet song started over the speakers an impromptu singalong shaking the walls as lucy and martin went into the pub martin traded nods with a few locals watching the tvs and waved to the fortyish woman behind the bar she wore a tight tshirt logoed with a bottle of two worms tequila a picture of a lemon and the slogan suck this she waved back as lucy and martin took their usual booth in the corner then she yelled something into the kitchen threw the towel over her shoulder and came to join them god lucy she said sliding in across the booth youre radiant you look wonderful you sure youve been sick an enthusiastic chorus of wasting away again came through the wall from the terrace outside hi kate martin said above the singing i dont look nearly as wonderful as you lucy answered smiling is that a new perm she struck a pose vamping the hairdo for them what do you think marty looks terrific kates daughter maya a high school senior stepped to the kitchen door looked around and then carried over a bottle of red wine and three glasses thanks honey kate said now dont serve anyone else make mike do it he hates coming out of the kitchen mom kate wagged her finger im not kidding as maya stepped away kate snapped the towel at her butt she twisted around frowning martin winked at her now dont go making eyes at my daughter mr marty van wyk kate said threatening him with the towel here give me the bottle he said ill open it what happened to christie and boyko lucy asked looking around all summer long christie had waited tables while boyko worked the kitchen kate curled her lip dramatically the vulgarians bulgarians martin corrected you ever notice the way they pawed each other all the time kate asked lucy leaned her head on martins shoulder theyre in love with each other its very sweet it was out of control the cork popped out of the bottle martin poured the dark red liquid into their three glasses he slid the first one over to kate why are you talking about them in the past tense didnt you hear hristinakate pronounced it with the accentand boyko disappeared two weeks ago not a wordwe were worried but then someone saw them over at sandusky pointe running the roller coasters at the park they said the pay was better over there and they had some other job at night theyre trying to make as much as they can before their green cards expire and they have to go home lucy sipped her wine everybody disappeared at once kate said first it was those two then you then pitr we all suspected she dropped her voice and lifted her eyebrows foul play martin swallowed his wine the wrong way and coughed pitr was czech from some small town with a castle south of brno he came over through the same agency that hired the other foreign workers pitr he rasped he go over to the mainland too probably kate leaned forward elbows on the table eyes glittering say did he ever come out to your place to fill that hole of yours lucy pressed her leg against martins he wasnt interested in doing any yardwork whos talking about yardwork kate laughed pitrs not interested in any work but hes still good for business god hes gorgeous every woman who came in here wanted him lucy put a hand against her throat he has such a lovely full mouth she said just above a whisper uhhuh added kate who overheard and what was his mouth full of i bet marty knows she glanced down at his crotch and winked at him if i did martin said i certainly wouldnt tell you oh pooh you two are no fun tonight martin dipped his finger in his wine and pressed it against lucys forehead the droplets sizzled were just tired he said and lucys not quite as well as we thought they left the winery sitting at the islands only traffic light just outside the parking lot a tiny beetle of some sort attracted to lucy buzzed around the inside of the dark car oh that was so awful she said trying to chase it away martin reached up and flicked the overhead light on the beetle flew to it rested a second then buzzed back at lucy weve got a little money left enough to get away somewhere no we cant lets go over to the mainland then see if we can find a doctor no ill get better martin could see the light getting ready to change but he waited while a couple trucks full of quarry workers sped through the intersection and parked across the street in front of the ice cellar a rougher bar where locals hung out i suppose it has to get better he said turning onto the road that led to the other side of the island and their house lucy swatted at the beetle it cant get worse the next morning she was too weak from the fever to rise from bed martin sat in the easy chair by the bed and popped the tape into the vcr he turned the sound off so he wouldnt disturb her and hit the play button despite what kate thought martin only liked to watch he had been hiding in the closet under the stairs the day lucy invited pitr over to do the yardwork the peephole made the picture hazy around the edges lucy stepped into the roomthe special guest bedroom next to the closet stairsshook off her robe and turned around right in front of the camera performing for it underneath she wore only a black corset black stockings high heels she had rings on her thumbs and fingers bracelets on her arms she looked as gorgeous as martin had ever seen her ten years younger than her actual age timelessly beautiful the second figure stepped into view from the left pitr prettier than kates description scrumptious to die for lucy had said and martin had agreed dark skin all muscle pale blond hair and lips so full they looked as though they would burst like bubbles if you touched them lucy touched pitrs lips first with her fingernails then with her mouth as her hands began to undress him still performing martin hit pause on the tape when he closed his eyes he could still hear their sounds come through the walls he could still smell the candles that lucy had burned blankets rustled a foot bumped against the wall lucy tossed mumbling in her delirium he stroked her leg once scooting forward to the edge of his seat he hit the forward button on the tape lucy straddled pitr her favorite position but he grabbed her arms and flipped her over forcing himself on top of her roaring as he bulled away between her legs neither she nor martin minded the roughness martin had parted his bathrobe and taken his cock in hand by then watching everything on the little camcorder screenit was an old camera one they had used for years lucy still performing bit into pitrs dark hairless chest martin liked to see her hurt the other men but this time something went beyond the normal rough play grabbing her arms and pinning them above her head pitr slammed into her so hard that she clamped her teeth down twisting her head as if possessed until the skin tore martin so intent on his own desire realized it only when he saw the blood trickling from her mouth he had sat there then in the closet still holding himself loosely frozen with the thought of viruses theyd been exposed before and escaped okay pitr pounded away until he groaned and pulled away lucy rolled over on her side spitting out the blood scrubbing her mouth with the sheets pitr stepped back from the bed out of view of the camera and spoke to her in some language that didnt sound like czech to martin but something far older harsher he slammed the closet door martin snatched up the remote and hit pause a fulllength mirror hung on the closet door when pitr stepped in front of it there was no sign of his bare flesh only a vague indefinite mist rewind play pause again martin watched it over and over frame by frame but there was never anything there but the mist finally he clicked forward pitr stepped away from the mirror lucy leaned back barebreasted chest heaving like a bmovie diva pitr grew to the height of the room cackling at her wiping blood from the wound on his chest with clawed fingers and anointing her like a priest at a baptism she screamed blankets rustled what are you doing lucy asked in a weak sleepy voice nothing martin said he hit the eject button yanking the tape out of the cassette he piled it at his feet until the reels were empty then he carried it downstairs and burned it all in the fireplace martin stood at the kitchen counter making soup for lucy when he saw the rat outside on the rocks it crawled all around the pumphouse trying to scale the sides martin went out to the screenedin porch to watch it finally the rat fell exhausted lethargic martin went out and picked up a large flat rock from the herb garden beside the foundation he crept slowly out to the pumphouse expecting the rat to bolt away at any minute but it crouched there on the concrete base facing the blank wall martin slammed down the rock there was a wet crunch as it connected with the concrete pad blood squirted out one side a ferocious tapping faint but unmistakable came from inside the pumphouse martin cupped his hands to the stone shut up pitr he shouted then he went back inside it was late afternoon before martin gathered the courage to find a pair of gloves and a shovel he went back to the pumphouse and tossed the bloody stone among the other boulders piled up where the waves licked the shore then he buried the rat he covered the bloodstain on the concrete with dirt and scuffed it in as well as he could with his deck shoes when he was done he cupped his hands to the stone how do i make her well again pitr he leaned his ear to the concrete to hear the answer let me to come out and i will tell you the voice croaked so faint martin could barely make it out she is burning with the fire only i can help her fuck you pitr i am come out and you can do that do laughter or choking martin rather hoped it was choking you want young again martin the voice cracked through the stone i can give you the young again yeah you and viagra go to hell pitr something hard pounded on the inside wall you cannot keep me here you cannot run far enough when i martin lifted his ear from the concrete and heard nothing except the sound of the waves and the cries of a few gulls the sky was the color of faded jeans jet contrails seamed the blue taking other people to some point far away martin walked wearily back to the house lucy sat up in bed the blankets were shoved against the footboard but she was wrapped in a kimono the glow inside her lit it up like a japanese lantern you upset him she said her voice cold he grabbed his wallet from the dresser and started changing his clothes you know he was already pissed something about being hit on the head while you were su no i mean it her cold voice shattered with panic like ice in the sun hes going to hurt me martin you promised you wouldnt let him hurt me hes not going to hurt you he pulled on clean pants where are you going into town for a drink she grabbed the lamp on the bedside table and shoved it onto the floor the base cracked are you going to go see kate are you going to go fuck kate is that it martin i dont even like kate he said softly he leaned over and kissed her forehead then pushed her gently onto the bed if it makes you any happier ill go to the icehouse wont even see her im sorry martin i didnt mean that its just i know rising he took their bank deposit bag from its hiding place and emptied the cash into his pocket then he took the rest of their bills and did the same she clutched at his sleeve youre running away omigod martin youre going to catch the ferry and leave me you cant do that i just need time to think he said he pried her fingers loose and left the house before he lost his nerve it was after midnight before he returned driving down the long dirt driveway through the woods to their house he was drunk two other trucks followed his lucy waited for him on the porch in the papasan chair sitting directly under the one bright light the trucks pulled up and parked beside him martin lifted the case of beer off the front seat and carried it over to the picnic table im going to go get some ice to keep this cold guys he shouted over his shoulder staggering to the porch doors slammed in the dark aint gonna last that long a harsh voice said a can popped open the others laughed lucy rose and pressed herself against the screen insects pinged against it trying to reach her bats screeched through the air feasting is that really you martin who are those men just some guys who work from the quarry he said his tongue thick in his mouth i ran into down at the ice cellar theyre good guys we had a few a few beers what are they doing martin shhh his forefinger smashed his lips theyre doing us a lil favor her nostrils flared her mouth flattened out in a ruby o against the screen as she strained to see what they were doing she took a step toward the door and sank to her knees too weak to go any further a stocky bearded man walked stiffly over to the porch howdy missus van wyk he said sounding a little more sober than martin your husband told us bout the problem with the water stagnating in the pumphouse making you sick and alla that well this ought to take care of it can tell you how much i preciate this martin said he grinned and patted a wad of bills in his shirt pocket you already did just remember it wasnt us who did it as he turned and walked away lucy whispered what are its self the fence martin slurred the bats veered suddenly from their random feeding and began to swoop and shriek at the quarry men martin stepped over blocked lucys view the bats flew with less purpose the men finished their work and ran back towards their trucks a hundred and fifty feet away one of them grabbed the beer lucy scraped at the screen making it sing her face a mixture of anguish and hope he said we couldnt kill him he said he could turn into one man shouted something as she spoke then a second then the explosion a sharp blast that was mostly dark not at all like the movies followed by the pebbled drum of debris pattering on the lake someone whistled a note of appreciation that ought about do it someone said and the others laughed they climbed back into their trucks and drove off into the night with their headlights off martin and lucy leaned against each other not touching the screen between them nursing a hangover having hardly slept at all martin walked up and down the shore at the first hint of dawn searching for bones or other pieces of pitr he thought the gulls might come for them the way they sometimes came for dead fish but the gulls stayed way offshore and he found nothing bill came over at sunrise the islands sheriff and his only deputy arrived shortly after martin prepared to confess everything instead heard himself repeating the story about some guest injuring himself with bill corroborating telling them how they bricked in the pumphouse to be safe speculating that maybe there was some kind of gas buildup or something the sheriff and his deputy seemed pretty skeptical about that last part they climbed all over the rocks examining the pieces the deputy waded down into the waters edge the flat rock from the garden stood out among all the watersmoothed boulders the deputy grabbed it flipped it over the rats blood made a dark stain on the bottom martins heart stuck in his throat say is lucy feeling any better yet bill asked her fever broke last night after almost a week martin answered his voice squeaking the deputy let go of the rock it splashed into the water whats that mrs van wyks been sick martin explained how sick shed been what a strain it had been on him with no guests not able to get out of the house the sheriff and the deputy both liked mrs van wyk appreciated the volunteer work she did for the islands chamber of commerce the sheriffs radio squawked some tourist had woken up on his yacht this morning missing his wallet and wanted to report it stolen the two men left their regards for lucy and headed back into town the deputys eyes stared at martin from the rearview mirror as the car pulled away lucy stood by the window wearing a long dress a sweater on top of that with a blanket around her shoulders a slight breeze ruffled the lace curtains slowly twisting them martin pressed his hand to her forehead her temperature felt normal the glow had dissipated i destroyed the camera he told her and all the other tapes i patched up the hole beneath the stairs ill never be warm again martin ill keep you warm he wrapped his arms around her she turned her back against his touch ill never be beautiful again she whispered youre lovely he fastened his lips on the rim of her ear youre perfect she jerked her head away from his mouth outside a remnant of oily mist layered the surface of the lake tiny wisps that coalesced refusing to burn away in the morning sun the wide carnivorous sky by john langan john langan is the author of the novel house of windows and several stories including episode seven last stand against the pack in the kingdom of the purple flowers which appeared in my anthology wastelands stories of the apocalypse and how the day runs down which appeared in the living dead both of those stories also appeared in the magazine of fantasy science fiction as has most of his other fiction a collection of most of langans work to date mr gaunt and other uneasy encounters appeared in late and was named a finalist for this years stoker award this story which is original to this anthology is the tale of a quartet of iraq war veterans who were the only survivors of an encounter with a monstrous blooddrinking creature during the battle of fallujah the story began with its title langan said a couple of months later i was watching an interview with an iraq war veteran who was discussing having been in a hummer that had been struck by an ied he described being pinned by the hummers flipping over so that he was lying on his back staring up at the sky that told me what the story was going to be i pm from the other side of the campfire lee said so its a vampire i did not say vampire davis said did you hear me say vampire it was exactly the kind of thing lee would say the gross generalization that obscured more than it clarified not for the first time since theyd set out up the mountain davis wondered at their decision to include lee in their plans lee held up his right hand index finger extended it has the fangs a mouthful of them lee raised his middle finger it turns into a bat noits wings are like a bats does it walk around with them theyit extrudes them from its arms and sides extrudes lee said han chimed in college not this shit again davis thought he rolled his eyes to the sky dark blue studded by early stars although the suns last light had drained from the air his stomach clenched he dropped his gaze to the fire the lieutenant spoke he means the thing extends them out of its body oh lee said sounds like it turns into a bat to me uhhuh han said whatever davis said it doesnt lee extended his ring finger and spoke over him it sleeps in a coffin not a coffin i know a flying coffin it isntits in lowearth orbit like a satellite what was it you said it looked like the lieutenant asked a cocoon a chrysalis davis said same thing the lieutenant said more or less davis said unwilling to insist on the distinction because even a year and threequarters removed from iraq the lieutenant was still the lieutenant and you did not argue the small shit with him coffin cocoon chrysalis lee said it has to be in it before sunset or its in trouble wait han said sunset yes davis began the principles the same the lieutenant said theres a place it has to be and a time it has to be there by thank you sir lee said he raised his pinky and it drinks blood yeah davis said it does lots han said yeah the lieutenant said for a moment the only sounds were the fire popping and somewhere out in the woods an owl prolonging its question davis thought of fallujah okay lee said how do we kill it ii there had been rumors stories legends of the things you might see in combat talk to any of the older guys the ones whod done tours in vietnam and you heard about a jungle in which you might meet the ghosts of chinese invaders from five centuries before or serve beside a grunt whose heart had been shot out a week earlier but who wouldnt die or find yourself stalked by what you thought was a tiger but had a tail like a snake and a womans voice the guys whod been part of the first war in iraqthe good one a sailor davis knew called ittold their own tales about the desert about coming across a raised tomb its black stone worn free of markings and listening to someone laughing inside it all the time it took you to walk around it about the dark shapes you might see stalking through a sandstorm their arms and legs a childs stickfigures about the sergeant who swore his reflection had been killed so that when he looked in a mirror now a corpse stared back at him even the soldiers whod returned from afghanistan talked about vast forms theyd seen hunched at the crests of mountains the street in kabul that usually ended in a blank wall except when it didnt the pale shapes you might glimpse darting into the mouth of the cave you were about to search a lot of what you heard was bullshit of course the plot of a familiar movie or tv show adapted to a new location and cast of characters and a lot of it started off sounding as if it were headed somewhere interesting then ran out of gas halfway through but there were some stories about which even if he couldnt quite credit their having happened some quality in the tellers voice or phrasing caused him to suspend judgment during the course of his associates degree davis had taken a number of courses in psychologypreparation for a possible career as a psychologistand in one of these he had learned that after several hours of uninterrupted combat he couldnt remember how many had never been any good with numbers you would hallucinate you couldnt help it it was your brains response to continuous unbearable stress he supposed that at least some of the stories hed listened to in barracks and bars might owe themselves to such cause although he was unwilling to categorize them all as symptoms this was not due to any overriding belief in either organized religion or disorganized superstition it derived more from principle specifically a conclusion that an open mind was the best way to meet what continually impressed him as an enormous world packed full of many things by fallujah davis had had no experiences of the strange the bizarre no stories to compare with those hed accumulated over the course of basic and his deployment he hadnt been thinking about that much as they took up their positions south of the city all of his available attention had been directed at the coming engagement davis had walked patrol had felt the crawl of the skin at the back of your neck as you made your way down streets crowded with men and women whod been happy enough to see saddam pulled down from his pedestal but had long since lost their patience with those whod operated the crane hed ridden in convoys his head light his heart throbbing at the base of his throat as they passed potential danger after potential danger a metal can on the right shoulder what might be a shell on the left and while theyd done their best to reinforce their hummers with whatever junk they could scavenge davis was acutely aware that it wasnt enough a consequence of galloping across the kuwaiti desert with the army you had davis had stood checkpoint his mouth dry as he sighted his m on an approaching car that appeared full of women in black burkas who werent responding to the signs to slow down and hed wondered if they were suicide bombers or just afraid and how much closer he could allow them before squeezing the trigger however much danger hed imagined himself in inevitably hed arrived after the sniper had opened fire and fled or passed the exact spot an ied would erupt two hours later or been on the verge of aiming for the cars engine when it screeched to a halt it wasnt that davis hadnt discharged his weapon hed served support for several nighttime raids on suspected insurgent strongholds and hed sent his own bullets in pursuit of the tracers that scored the darkness but support wasnt the same thing as kicking in doors trying to kill the guy down the hall who was trying to kill you it was not the same as being part of the anvil that was how the lieutenant had described their role our friends in the united states marine corps are going to play the hammer he had said the day before they will sweep into fallujah from east and west and they will drive what hostiles they do not kill outright south where we will be waiting to act as the anvil the poet goethe said that you must be either hammer or anvil we will be both and we are going to crush the hostiles between us after the lieutenants presentation han had said greatso the jarheads have all the fun with what davis judged a passable imitation of regret a false sentiment fairly widely held davis had been sure however the certainty a ball of lead weighting his gut that this time was going to be different part of it was that the lieutenant had known one of the contractors whod been killed incinerated and strung up at the saddam bridge last april davis wasnt clear exactly how the men had been acquainted or how well but the lieutenant had made no secret of his displeasure at not being part of the first effort to retake the city in the weeks following the mens deaths he had beenyou couldnt say happy exactly at the failure of that campaignbut he was eager for what was shaping up to be a largerscale operation though seven months gone the deaths and dishonorings of his acquaintances had left the lieutenant an appetite for this mission enough to cause him to disobey his orders and charge into fallujahs southern section davis didnt think so but there was a reason the man still held the rank of lieutenant when his classmates and colleagues were well into their captaincies the other reason for davis s conviction that this time something was on its way to him was a simple matter of odds it wasnt possibleit was not possible that you could rack up this much good luck and not have a shitload of the bad bearing down on you like a scud on an anthill a former altar boy he was surprised at the variety of prayers he rememberednot just the our father and the hail mary but the apostles creed the memorare and the hail holy queen as he disembarked the bradley and ran for the shelter of a desertcolored house the sky an enormous pale blue dome above him davis mumbled his way through his prayers with a fervency that would have pleased his mother and father no end but even as his lips shaped the words he had the strong sense that this was out of gods hands under the control of one of those medieval demigoddesses dame fortune or something later recovering first in germany then at walter reed davis had thought that walking patrol riding convoy standing checkpoint he must have been saved from something truly awful each and every time for the balance to be this steep iii pm i take it stakes are out the lieutenant said sir lee said i unloaded half a clip easy into that sonovabitch and i was as close to him as i am to you closer han said the point is he took a halfstep backwardsmaybebefore he tore my weapon out of my hands and fractured my skull with it thats what im saying the lieutenant said i figure it has to bewhat did you get your hands on some kind of major ordnance davis an rpg a stinger ill love you like a sonhell ill adopt you as my own if you tell me you have a case of stingers concealed under a bush somewhere thosell give the fucker a welcome he wont soon forget fuckinga han said nah lee said a crate of willy pete oughta just about do it serve his ass crispyfried davis shook his head no stingers and no white phosphorous fire isnt going to do us any good how come lee said yeah han said if im right about this thing spending its nights in lowearth orbitin its coffinand then leaving that refuge to descend into the atmosphere so it can hunt its skin has to be able to withstand considerable extremes of temperature like the space shuttle the lieutenant said huh for all intents and purposes its fireproof oh lee said given that it spends some of its time in the upper atmosphere as well as actual outer space im guessing substantial cold wouldnt have much effect either we cant shoot it cant burn it cant freeze it lee said tell me why were here again he waved at the trees fringing the clearing aside from the scenery of course pipe down the lieutenant said when we shot at it davis said im betting half our fire missed it he held up his hand to the beginning of lees protest thats no reflection on anyone the thing was fast cheetahtakingdownagazelle fast not to mention its so goddamned thin anyway of the shots that connected with it most of them were flesh wounds he raised his hand to lee again those who connected with it a nod to lee were so close their fire passed clean through it which is what i was saying lee said theres a lot of crazy shit floating around space davis said little particles of sand rock ice metal some of them get to moving pretty fast if youre doing repairs to the space station and one of those things hits you it could ruin your whole day anything thats going to survive up there is going to have to be able to deal with something that can punch a hole right through you its got a selfsealing mechanism the lieutenant said when lee fired into it its body treated the bullets as so many dustparticles and closed right up davis said like some kind of superclottingfactor maybe thats what it uses the blood for youre saying its bulletproof too lee said shit han said notmore like bulletresistant think of it as a mutant healing ability the lieutenant said like wolverine oh han said those claws it has lee said i guess wolverine isnt too far off the mark no han said sabertooth what lee said the fuckre you going on about sabertooths claws han held up his right hand fingers splayed he curled his fingers into a fist wolverines claws man has a point the lieutenant said whatever lee said heres the thing davis said its bulletresistant but it can still feel pain think about how it reacted when lee shot it it didnt tear his throat open it took the instrument that had hurt it and used that to hurt lee you see what im saying kind of lee said think about what drove it off davis said remember of course the lieutenant said he nodded at han it was han sticking his bayonet in the things side for which it crushed his skull davis could not stop himself from thinking he added his nod to the lieutenants yes he did how is that different from shooting it lee said your bullets went in one side and out the other davis said hans bayonet stuck there the things healing ability could deal with an inandout wound no problem something like this though i think it panicked panicked lee said it didnt look like it was panicking to me then why did it take off right away davis said it was full it heard more backup on the way it had an appointment in fucking samara how the fuck should i know whats your theory the lieutenant said the type of injury han gave it would be very bad if youre in a vacuum something opening you up like that and leaving you exposed you could vent some or even all of the blood you worked so hard to collect the lieutenant said youd want to get out of a situation like that with all due haste even if your healing factor could seal the wounds perimeter davis said theres still this piece of steel in you that has to come out and when it does will reopen the injury costing you still more blood the lieutenant said most of the time davis said i mean like nine hundred and ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine times out of a million the thing would identify any such threats long before they came that close you saw its ears its eyes black on black lee said or noblack over black like the corneas had some kind of heavy tint and what was underneath was all pupil han got lucky davis said the space we were in really wasnt that big there was a lot of movement a lot of noise not to mention lee said all the shooting and screaming the right set of circumstances the lieutenant said saved our asses lee said reaching over to pound hans shoulder han ducked to the side grinning his hideous smile if i can cut to the chase the lieutenant said youre saying we need to find a way to open up this fucker and keep him open so that we can wreak merry havoc on his insides davis nodded to cut to the chase yes exactly how do you propose we do this with these davis reached into the duffel bag to his left and withdrew what appeared to be a threefoot piece of white wood tapered to a point sharp enough to prick your eye looking at it he passed the first one to the lieutenant brought out one for lee and one for han a baseball bat lee said gripping near the point and swinging his like a louisville slugger we gonna club it to death neither davis nor the lieutenant replied they were busy watching han whod located the grips at the other end of his and was jabbing it first underhand then overhand the people you meet working at home depot davis said theyre made out of an industrial resin inchforinch stronger than steel each one has a highexplosive core whoa lee said setting his on the ground with exaggerated care the detonators are linked to this davis said fishing a cell phone from his shirt pocket turn it on pointing to the lieutenant han lee and himself he counted onetwothreefour send thats it i was mistaken the lieutenant said it appears we will be using stakes after all iv at landstuhl briefly and then at walter reed at length an impressive array of doctors nurses chaplains and other soldiers whose job it was encouraged davis to discuss fallujah he was reasonably sure that while under the influence of one of the meds that kept his body at a safe distance he had let slip some detail maybe more how else to account for the change in his nurses demeanor likely she judged he was a psych case a diagnosis he halfinclined to accept even when the lieutenant forced his way into davis s room banging around in the wheelchair he claimed he could use well enough goddamnit davis was reluctant to speak of anything except the conditions of the other survivors of whom he had been shockedtruly shocked profoundly shocked almost more so than by what had torn through themto learn there were only two lee and han manfred bled out on the way to be evacd everyone else long gone by the time the reinforcements had stormed into the courtyard according to the lieutenant han was clinging to life by a thread so fine you couldnt see it hed lost his helmet in the fracas and the bones in his skull had been crushed like an eggshell davis who had witnessed that crushing nodded lee had suffered his own head trauma although compared to hans it wasnt anything a steel plate couldnt fix the real problem with lee was that if he wasnt flooded with some heavyduty happy pills he went fetal thumb in his mouth the works what about you the lieutenant said indicating the armature of casts wires weights and counterweights that kept davis suspended like some overly ambitious kids science project believe it or not sir davis said it really is worse than it looks my pack and my helmet absorbed most of the impact still left me with a broken back scapula and ribsbut my spinal cords basically intact not that it doesnt hurt like a motherfucker sir yourself the taxpayers of the united states of america have seen fit to gift me with a new right leg since i so carelessly misplaced the original he knocked on his pajama leg which gave a hollow plastic sound sir i am so sorry shut it the lieutenant said its a paper cut using his left foot he rolled himself back to the door which he eased almost shut through the gap he surveilled the hallway outside long enough for davis to start counting one mississippi two mississippi then wheeled himself to davis s head he leaned close and said davis sir lets leave out the rank thing for five minutes okay can we do that siryes yes we can because ever since the docs have reduced my drugs to the point i could string one sentence after another ive been having these memoriesdreamsi dont know what the fuck to call them nightmares and i cant decide if im losing it or if this is why lee needs a palmful of m ms to leave his bed so i need you to talk to me straight no bullshit no telling the officer what you think he wants to hear i would genuinely fucking appreciate it if we could do that davis looked away when he saw the lieutenants eyes shimmering keeping his own focused on the ceiling he said it came out of the sky thats where it went after han stuck it so i figure it must have dropped out of there too it explains why one minute were across the courtyard from a bunch of hostiles the next that things standing between us did you see it take off i did after it had stepped on hans head it spread its armsit kind of staggered back from han caught itself then opened its arms and these huge wings snapped open they were like a bats skin stretched over bonethey appeared so fast im not sure but they shot out of its body it tilted its head jumped up high ten feet easy flapped the wings which raised it another ten feet and turnedthe way a swimmer turns in the water you know another flap two and it was gone huh davis glanced at the lieutenant whose face was smooth his eyes gazing across some interior distance he said do you back up the lieutenant said the ten of us are in the courtyard how bigs the place im not very good with at a guess twentyfive feet wide maybe fifty long with all of those jars in the waywhat were they planters threefoottall stone planters for trees they were full of dirt havent you ever seen those little decorative trees inside office buildings oh all right what i was going to say was with the row of planters at either end the place might have been larger noted how tall were the walls taller than any of useight feet easy they were thick too a foot and a half two feet davis said it really was a good spot to attack from open fire from the walls then drop behind them when they cant maintain that position the tall buildings are behind it and we dont hold any of them so they dont have to worry about anyone firing down on them im guessing they figured we didnt know where we were well enough to call in any artillery on them no if we want them we have to run a hundred feet of open space to a doorway thats an easy trap theyve got the planters for cover near and far not to mention the doorway in the opposite wall as an exit agreed to be honest now that were talking about it i cant imagine how we made it into the place without losing anyone by all rights they should have tagged a couple of us crossing from our position to theirs and that doorway they should have massacred us we were lucky when we returned fire they must have panicked could be they didnt see all of us behind the wall thought they were ambushing three or four targets instead of ten charging them may have given the impression there were even more of us it took them until they were across the courtyard to get a grip and regroup by which time we were at the doorway so it was lee all the way on the left with han beside him right and bay and remsnyder then you and petit noit was me and lugo then petit then you yes yes manfred was to my right and weymouth was all the way on the other end im not sure how many six there may have been a seventh in the opposite doorway but he wasnt around very long either he went down or he decided to season his valor with a little discretion it was loudeverybody firing in a confined space i had powder all over me from their shots hitting the wall behind us i want to say we traded bullets for about five minutes but it was what half that less a minute and our guest arrived at firstat first it was like i couldnt figure out what i was seeing im trying to line up the guy whos directly across from meall i need is for him to stick up his head againand all of a sudden theres a shadow in the way that was my first thought its a shadow only whos casting it and why is it hanging in the air like that and why is it fucking eight feet tall none of us understood what was in front of us i thought it was a woman in a burka someone id missed when wed entered the courtyard as you say though you dont meet a lot of eightfoottall women in or out of iraq next thingno that isnt what happened what i was going to say the thingthe shadowwas in among the hostiles which is true it went for them first but before it did there was a moment you saw somethingsomething else yeah davis said this pain shot straight through my head were talking instant migraine so intense i practically puked that wasnt all this chilli was freezing colder than ive ever been like you read about in polar expeditions i couldntthe courtyard what the courtyard wasnti was somewhere high like a hundred miles high so far up i could see the curve of the earth below me clouds continents the ocean what you see in the pictures they take from orbit stars space all around me directly overhead a little farther away than you are from me there was this thing i dont know what the fuck it was biglong maybe long as a house it bulged in the middle tapered at the ends the surface was dark shinydoes that make any sense the thing was covered init looked like some kind of lacquer maybe it was made out of the lacquer anyway one moment my heads about to crack open my teeth are chattering and my skins blue and im in outer space the next all of thats gone im back in the courtyard and the shadowthe thing is ripping the hostiles to shreds and then the lieutenant said it was our turn v november am in the six hundred twentyfive days since that afternoon in the hospital how many times had davis recited the order of events in the courtyard whether with the lieutenant or with lee once his meds had been stabilized or with han once hed regained the ability to speak though not especially well at some point a couple of months on hed realized hed been keeping count thats the thirtyeighth time thats the fortythirdand then a couple of months after that hed realized that hed lost track the narrative of their encounter with what davis continued to think of as the shadow had become daily catechism to be reviewed morning noon and night and whenever else he happened to think of it none of them had even tried to run which there were times davis judged a sign of courage and times he deemed an index of their collective shock at the speed and ferocity of the things assault on the insurgents heads arms legs were separated from bodies as if by a pair of razor blades and wherever a wound opened red there was the things splintered maw drinking the blood like a kid stooping to a water fountain the smells of blood piss and shit mixed with those of gunpowder and hot metal while davis knew they had been the next course on the shadows menu he found it difficult not to wonder how the situation might have played out had leefollowed immediately by lugo and weymouth not opened up on the thing of course the instant that narrow head with its spotlight eyes its scarlet mouth turned in their direction everyone elses guns erupted and the scene concluded the way it had to but if lee had been able to restrain himself lugo was first to die in a single leap the shadow closed the distance between them and drove one of its sharpened hands into his throat venting his carotid over davis whom it caught with its other hand and flung into one of the side walls with such force his spine and ribs lit up like the fourth of july as he was dropping onto his back turtling on his pack the thing was raising its head from lugo s neck spearing petit through his armor and hauling him towards it remsnyder ran at it from behind the things hand lashed out and struck his head from his shoulders it was done with petit in time to catch remsnyders body on the fall and jam its mouth onto the bubbling neck it had shoved petits body against the lieutenant whose feet tangled with petits and sent the pair of them down this put him out of the way of manfred and weymouth who screamed for everyone to get clear and fired full automatic impossible as it seemed they missed and for their troubles the shadow lopped manfreds right arm off at the elbow and opened weymouth like a christmas present from the ground the lieutenant shot at it the thing sliced through his weapon and the leg underneath it now bay han and lee tried full auto which brought the thing to bay whose face it bit off it swatted han to the ground but lee somehow ducked the swipe it aimed at him and tagged it at close range the shadow threw bays body across the courtyard yanked lees rifle from his hands and swung it against his head like a ballplayer aiming for the stands he crumpled the thing reaching out for him and han leapt up his bayonet ridiculously small in his hand he drove it into the things sidewhat would be the floating ribs on a manto the hilt the shadow whose only sound thus far had been its feeding opened its jaws and shrieked a high scream more like the cry of a bat or a hawk than anything human it caught han with an elbow to the temple that tumbled him to the dirt set its foot on his head and pressed down hans scream competed with the sound of his skull cracking in multiple spots davis was certain the thing meant to grind hans head to paste but it staggered off him one claw reaching for the weapon buried in its skin blood so dark it was purple was oozing around the hilt the shadow spread its arms its wings cracked open and it was gone fled into the blue sky that davis would spend the next quarterhour staring at as the lieutenant called for help and tried to tourniquet first his leg then manfreds arm davis had stared at the sky beforewho has notbut helpless on his back his spine a length of molten steel his ears full of manfred whimpering that he was gonna die oh sweet jesus he was gonna fucking die the lieutenant talking over him insisting no he wasnt he was gonna be fine it was just a little paper cut the washed blue bowl overhead seemed less sheltering canopy and more endless depth a gullet over which he had the sickening sensation of dangling as manfreds cries diminished and the lieutenant toldordered him to stay with him davis flailed his arms at the ground to either side of him in an effort to grip onto an anchor something that would keep him from hurtling into that blue abyss the weeks and months to come would bring the inevitable nightmares the majority of them the shadows attack replayed at half full or doublespeed with a gruesome fate for himself edited in sometimes repeating the events on his own or with a combination of the others led to a lessdisturbed sleep sometimes it did not there was one dream though that no amount of discussion could help and that was the one in which davis was plummeting through the sky lost in an appetite that would never be sated vi am once he was done setting the next log on the fire davis leaned back and said i figure its some kind of stun effect how so lee said the thing lands in between two groups of heavily armed men it has to do something to even the odds it hits us with a psychic blast shorts out our brains so that were easier prey didnt seem to do much to lee the lieutenant said no brain han shouted hafuckingha lee said maybe there were too many of us davis said maybe it miscalculated maybe lees a mutant and this is his special gift had the thing zigged instead of zagged gone for us instead of the insurgents i dont think any of us would be sitting here regardless of our super powers speak for yourself lee said for a theory the lieutenant said its not bad but theres a sizable hole in it you he pointed at davis saw the things coffin or whatever lee a nod to him was privy to a batseye view of the things approach to one of its hunts indid we ever decide if it was laos or cambodia no sir lee said it looked an awful lot like some of the scenery from the first tomb raider movie which im pretty sure was filmed in cambodia but im not positive you didnt see angelina jolie running around davis said if only lee said so with lee were in southeast asia the lieutenant said with or without the lovely ms jolie from what hans been able to tell me he was standing on the moon or someplace very similar to it i dont believe he could see the earth from where he was but im not enough of an astronomer to know what that means as for myself i had a confused glimpse of the thing tearing its way through the interior of an airplanewhat im reasonably certain was a b probably during the second world war you see what i mean none of us witnessed the same scenenone of us witnessed the same time which you would imagine we would have if wed been subject to a deliberate attack you would expect the thing to hit us all with the same image its more efficient maybe that isnt how this works davis said suppose what it does is more like a cluster bomb a host of memories it packs around a psychic charge if each of us thinks hes someplace different from everybody else doesnt that maximize confusion create optimal conditions for an attack the lieutenant frowned lee said whats your theory sir i dont have one the lieutenant said regardless of its intent the thing got in our heads and stayed there lee said stuck han said tapping his right temple yes the lieutenant said whatever their precise function our exposure to the things memories appears to have established a link between us and it davis said which is whats going to bring it right here vii when davis was on board the plane to germany he could permit himself to hope that he was however temporarily out of immediate danger of deathnot from the injury to his back which though painful in the extreme he had known from the start would not claim his life but from the reappearance of the shadow until their backup arrived in a hurry of bootsteps and rattle of armor he had been waiting for the sky to vomit the figure it had swallowed minutes moments prior for his blood to leap into the things jagged mouth the mature course of action had seemed to prepare for his imminent end which he had attempted only to find the effort beyond him whenever word of some acquaintances failure to return from the latest patrol had prompted davis to picture his final seconds he had envisioned his face growing calm even peaceful his lips shaping the syllables of a heartfelt act of contrition however between the channel of fire that had replaced his spine and the vertiginous sensation that he might plunge into the skynot to mention the lieutenants continuing monologue to manfred the pungence of gunpowder mixed with the bloody reek of meat the low moans coming from han davis was unable to concentrate rather than any gesture of reconciliation towards the god with whom he had not been concerned since his discovery of what lay beneath his prom dates panties junior year daviss attention had been snarled in the sound of the shadows claws puncturing lugos neck the fountain of weymouths blood over its arm and chest the wet slap of his entrails hitting the ground the stretch of the things mouth as it released its scream despite his back which had drawn his vocal chords taut once the reinforcements had arrived and a redfaced medic peppered him with questions while performing a quick assessment of him davis had strained to warn them of their danger but all his insistence that they had to watch the sky had brought him was a sedative that pulled him into a vague gray place nor had his time at the battalion aid station then some larger facility camp victory with whatever they gave him most of the details a variety of medical staff poured into his ears sluiced right back out again caused him to feel any more secure as the gray place loosened its hold on him and he stared up at the canvas roof of the bas davis had wanted to demand what the fuck everyone was thinking didnt they know the shadow could slice through this material like it was cling film didnt they understand it was waiting to descend on them right now this very fucking minute it would rip them to shreds it would drink their fucking blood at the presence of a corpsman beside him hed realized he was shoutingor as close to shouting as his voice could managebut hed been unable to restrain himself which had led to calming banalities and more vague grayness he had returned to something like consciousness inside a larger space in the csh where the sight of the nearest wall trembling from the wind had drawn his stomach tight and sped a fresh round of protests from his mouth when he struggled up out of the shot that outburst occasioned davis had found himself in a dim cavern whose curving sides rang with the din of enormous engines his momentary impression that he was dead and this some unexpected barebones afterlife was replaced by the recognition that he was on a transport out of iraq who knew to where it didnt matter a flood of tears had rolled from his eyes as the dread coiling his guts had if not fled at least calmed at landstuhl in a solidly built hospital with drab but sturdy walls and a firm ceiling davis was calmer as long as he did not dwell on the way the shadows claws had split petits armor sliced the lieutenants rifle in two that and the surgeries required to relieve the pressure on his spine left him to quote a song hed never liked that much comfortably numb not until he was back in america though reclining in the latemedieval luxury of walter reed the width of an ocean and a continent separating him from fallujah did davis feel anything like a sense of security even after his first round of conversations with the lieutenant had offered him the dubious reassurance that if he were delusional he was in good company a cold comfort made chillier still by lee his meds approaching the proper levels corroborating their narrative davis found it less difficult than he would have anticipated to persuade himself that remsnyders head leaping from his body on a jet of blood was seven thousand miles away and while his pulse still quickened whenever his vision strayed to the rectangle of sky framed by the rooms lone window he could almost pretend that this was a different sky after all hadnt that been the subtext of all the stories hed heard from other vets about earlier wars weird shit happened yessometimes very bad weird shit happenedbut it took place over there in country in another place where things didnt work the same way they did in the good old us of a if you could keep that in mind davis judged frontandcenter in your consciousness you might be able to live with the impossible everything wentyou couldnt call it swimminglyit went anyway until davis began his rehabilitation which consisted of a learning how to walk again and b strength training for his newly reeducated legs of course he had been in pain after the initial injurythough shock and fear had kept the hurt from overwhelming himand his nerves had flared throughout his hospital stayespecially following his surgerythough a pharmacopeia had damped those sensations down to smoldering rehab was different rehab was a long lowceilinged room that smelled of sweat and industrial antiseptic one end of which grazed a small herd of the kind of exercise machines you saw faded celebrities hawking on latenight tv the center of which held a trio of parallel bars set too low and the near end of which was home to a series of overlapping blue mats whose extensive cracks suggested an aerial view of a river basin rehab was slow stretches on the mats then gripping onto the parallel bars while you tried to coax your right leg into moving forward once you could lurch along the bars and back rehab was time on one of the exercise machines flat on your back your legs bent your feet pressed against a pair of pedals connected to a series of weights you raised by extending your legs rehab was about confronting pain inviting it in asking it to sit down and have a beer so the two of you could talk for a while rehab was not leaning on the heavyduty opiates and their synthetic friends it was remaining content with the overthecounter options and icepacks it was the promise of a walk outsidean enticement that made davis s palms sweat and his mouth go dry when the surgeon had told davis the operation had been a success there appeared to be no permanent damage to his spinal cord davis had imagined himself freed of his cast and its coterie of pulleys and counterweights sitting up on his own and strolling out the front door actually hed been running in his fantasy the reality he quickly discovered was that merely raising himself to a sitting position was an enterprise far more involved than he ever had appreciated as was a range of action so automatic it existed below his being able to admit hed never given it much thought he supposed the therapists here were as good as you were going to find but that didnt make the routines they subjected him tohe subjected himself toany easier or less painful it was during one of these sessions his back feeling as if it had been scraped raw and the exposed tissue generously salted that davis had his first inkling that fallujah was not a selfcontained narrative a short grisly tale rather it was the opening chapter of a novel one of those eighthundredpage stephen king specials lucy davis s primary therapist had him on what he had christened the rack his target was twenty leg presses in a fit of bravado he had promised her thirty no doubt davis had known instances of greater pain but those had been spikes on the graph though set at a lower level this hurt was constant and while lucy had assured him that he would become used to it so far he hadnt the pain glared like the sun flaring off a window it flooded his mind white made focusing on anything else impossible that lucy was encouraging him he knew from the tone of her voice but he could not distinguish individual words already his vision was blurred from the sweat streaming out of him so when the blur fractured became a kaleidoscopejumble of color and geometry he thought little of it and raised his fingers to clear his eyes according to lucy davis removed his hand from his face paused then fell off the machine on his right side trembling and jerking for what she called his seizures duration which she clocked at three minutes fifteen seconds davis uttered no sound except for a gulping noise that made his therapist fear he was about to swallow his tongue to the lieutenant then to lee and eventually han davis would compare what he saw when the rehab room went far away to a widescreen movie one of those panoramic deals that was supposed to impart the sensation of flying over the rockies or holding on for dear life as a roller coaster whipped up and down its course a surplus of detail crowded his vision he was in the middle of a sandy street bordered by short buildings whose walls appeared to consist of sheets of long dried grass framed with slender sticks a dozen two dozen women and children dressed in pastel robes and turbans ran frantically from one side of the street to the other as men wearing dark brown shirts and pants aimed kalashnikovs at them some of the men were riding brown and white horses some were stalking the street some were emerging from alleys between the buildings several of whose walls were releasing thick smoke davis estimated ten men the soundsit was as if the soundtrack to this film had been set to record the slightest vibration of air which it played back at twice the normal level screams raked his eardrums sandals scraped the ground guns cracked bullets thudded into skin horses whickered fire snapped an immense thirst worse than any he had known possessed him his throat was not dry it was arid as if itas if he were composed of dust from which the last eyedropper of moisture had long been squeezed one of the mennot the nearest who was walking the opposite direction from daviss position but the next closest whose horse had shied from the flames sprouting from a grass wall and so turned its rider in daviss directioncaught sight of davis his face contracting in confusion at what he saw the man who might have been in his early twenties started to raise his rifle and everything sped up the movie fastforwarded there washis vision wavered and the mans gun dipped his eyes widening davis was next to himhe had halfscaled the horse and speared the hollow of the mans throat with his right hand whose fingers he saw were twice as long as they had been tapered to a set of blades he felt the mans tissue part the ends of his fingers talons scrape bone blood washed over his palm his wrist and the sensation jolted him his talons flicked to the left and the mans head tipped back like a tree falling away from its base blood misted the air and before he realized what was happening his mouth was clamped to the wound full of hot copper liquid the taste was rain falling in the desert in three mighty gulps he had emptied the corpse and was springing over its fellows into the midst of the brightly robed women and children the immediate result of davis s threeminute hallucination was the suspension of his physical therapy and an mri of his brain asked by lucy what he recalled of the experience davis had shaken his head and answered nothing it was the same response he gave to the new doctor who stopped into his room a week later and without identifying himself as a psychiatrist told davis he was interested in the nightmares that had brought him screaming out of sleep six of the last seven nights this was a rather substantial change in his nightly routine taken together with his recent seizure it seemed like cause for concern perhaps davis could relate what he remembered of his nightmares how to tell this doctor that closing his eyesan act he resisted for as long as he could each nightbrought him to that yellowbrown street the lime saffron and orange cloth stretching as mothers hauled their children behind them the dull muzzles of the kalashnikovs coughing fire how to describe the sensations that still lived in his skin his muscles the tearing of skin for his toolong fingers the bounce of a heart in his hand the instant before he tore it from its setting the eggshell crunch of bone between his jaws most of all how to convey to this doctor this shrink who was either an unskilled actor or not trying very hard the concentrate of pleasure that was the rush of blood into his mouth down his throat the satisfaction of his terrific thirst so momentary it made the thirst that much worse although davis had repeated his earlier disavowal and maintained it in the face of the doctors extendedand to be fair sympatheticquestions until the man left a weeks worth of poor sleep made the wisdom of his decision appear less a foregone conclusion what he had seenwhat he had been part of the other week was too similar to the vision hed had in the courtyard not to be related the question was how were davis to summarize his personal horror ride to the psychiatristhe would have to tell him about fallujah first of coursemight the doctor have more success at understanding the connections between his driversseat views of the shadows activities sure davis thought right after hes had you fitted for your straightjacket the ironic thing was how often had he argued the benefits of the armys psychiatric care with lugo it had been their running gag lugo would return from reading his email with news of some guy stateside whod lost it shot his wife himself which would prompt davis to say that it was a shame the guy hadnt gotten help before it came to that help lugo would say from who the army man you must be joking the army dont want nothing to do with no grunt cant keep his shit together no no davis would say sure they still had a ways to go but the army was changing the kinds of combatinduced pathologies it used to pretend didnt exist were much more likely to be treated early and effectively if lee and han were present andor remsnyder theyd ooh and aah over davis s vocabulary oh yeah lugo would reply if they dont discharge your ass right outta here theyll stick you at some bullshit post where you wont hurt anyone no no davis would say that was a rumor oh yeah lugo would say like the rumor about the guys who went to the doctor for help with their ptsd and were told they were suffering from a fucking preexisting condition so it wasnt the armys problem no no davis would say that was a few bad guys oh yeah lugo would say before he and the lieutenantwho had been abducted by a platoon of siblings their spouses and their kids for ten days in floridadiscussed the matter davis passed his nightly struggles to stay awake wondering if the psychiatric ward was the worst place he might wind up his only images of such places came from films like one flew over the cuckoos nest awakenings and kpax but based on those examples he could expect to spend his days robed and slippered possibly medicated free to read what he wanted except during individual and group therapy sessions if it wasnt quite the career as a psychologist hed envisioned hed at least be in some kind of proximity to the mental health field sure it would be a scam but didnt the taxpayers of the us of a owe him recompense for shipping him to a place where the shadow could just drop in and shred his life the windows would be barred or meshed the doors reinforcedyou could almost fool yourself such a location would be safe however with his second episode it became clear that safe was one of those words that had been bayoneted its meaning spilled on the floor davis had been approved to resume therapy with lucy who had been honestly happy to see him again it was late in the day what with the complete breakdown in his sleeping patterns he wasnt in optimal condition for another goaround on the rack but after so much time stuck in his head terrified at what was in there with him the prospect of a vigorous workout was something he was actually looking forward to as before gentle stretching preceded the main event which lucy told davis he didnt have to do but for which he had cavalierly assured her he was if not completely able at least ready and willing with the second push of his feet against the pedals pain ignited up his back and his lack of sleep did not aid in his tolerating it each subsequent retraction and extension of his legs ratcheted the hurt up one more degree until he was lying on a bed of fire this time viii am my vision didnt blurit cracked as if my knees levering up and down were an image on a tv screen and something smacked the glass everything spiderwebbed and fell away what replaced it was movementi was moving up my arms beating down there was this feeling that they were bigger much bigger that when i swept them down they were gathering the air and piling it beneath them i looked below me and there were bodiesparts of bodies organsall over the place there was less blood than there should have been seeing them scattered across the groundit was like having a birdseye view of some kind of bizarre design most of them were men twenties and thirties although there were two women and a couple three kids almost everybody was wearing jeans and workboots sweatshirts baseball caps except for a pair of guys dressed in khaki and im pretty sure cowboy hats what the fuck lee said cowboys han said texas border patrol the lieutenant said so those other people were like illegal immigrants lee said the lieutenant nodded davis said ive never been to texas but the spot looked like what you see on tv sandy full of rocks some scrub brush and short trees there was a muddy streamyou might call it a river i guess if that was what you were used toin the near distance and a group of hills further off the sun was perched on top of the hills setting and that red ball made me beat my arms again and again shrinking the scene below raising me higher into the sky there wasi felt fullmore than full gorged but thirsty still thirsty that same overpowering dryness id experienced the previoustime the thirst was so strong so compelling i was a little surprised when i kept climbing my flight was connected to the sun balanced on that hill a kind ofnot panic exactly it was more like urgency i was moving now the air was thinning my arms stretched even larger to scoop enough of it to keep me moving the temperature had droppedwas dropping plunging down something happenedmy mouth was already closed but it was as if it sealed somehow same thing with my nostrils i mean they closed themselves off my eyes misted then cleared i pumped my arms harder than i had before this time i didnt lose speed i kept moving forward ahead i saw the thing id seen in the courtyarda huge shape big as a house pointed at the ends fat in the middle darkmaybe dark purple maybe notand shiny the moment it came into view this surge ofi dont know what to call it honestly i want to say it was a cross between the way you feel when you put your bag down on your old bed and mommy that little kid feeling except that neither of those is completely right my arms were condensing growing substantial i was heading towards the middle as i drew closer its surface rippled like water moving out from where a stone strikes it at the center of the ripple a kind of pucker opened into the thing that was my destination and lee said lucy emptied her gatorade on me and brought me out of it you have got to be fucking kidding me lee said afraid not davis said how long was this one the lieutenant asked almost five minutes it took her that long to toss her gatorade on you lee said there was some kind of commotion at the same time a couple of guys got into a fight she tried to find help when she couldnt she doused me lee shook his head and you have since confirmed the existence of this object the lieutenant said yes sir davis said it took some doing the things damned near impossible to see and while no one would come out and say so to me im pretty sure it doesnt show up on radar either the couple of pictures we got were more dumb luck than anything we lee said i the lieutenant said i put mr davis in touch with a friend of mine in intelligence oh lee said waitshit you mean the cias involved relax davis said because i swear to god lee said those stupid motherfuckers would fuck up getting toast out of the toaster and blame us for their burned fingers its under control the lieutenant said this is our party no one else has been invited doesnt mean they wont show up lee said stupid assholes with their fucking sunglasses and their were so scary oooh he turned his head and spat davis stole a look at the sky stars were winking out and in as something passed in front of them his heart jumped his hand was on his stake before he identified the shape as some kind of bird the lieutenant had noticed his movement his hand over his stake he said everything all right davis fine davis said bird what lee said bird han said oh lee said so i have a question go ahead the lieutenant said the whole daylight thing lee said the having to be back in its coffin before sunsetwhats up with that it does seematypical doesnt it the lieutenant said vampires are traditionally creatures of the night actually sir lee said thats not exactly true the original draculayou know in the bookhe could go out in daylight he just lost his powers lee the lieutenant said you are a font of information is this what our monster is trying to avoid i dont know lee said could be i dont think so davis said its not as if daylight makes its teeth any sharper then what is it lee said beats me davis said dont we need daylight to make vitamin d maybe its the same uses the sun to manufacture some kind of vital substance not bad the lieutenant said for something you pulled out of your ass lee said heyyou asked davis said perhaps its time for some review the lieutenant said can we agree on that good we have this thingthis vampire holding up a hand to davis that spends its nights in an orbiting coffin at dawn or thereabouts it departs said refuge in search of blood which it apparently obtains from a single source us han said us the lieutenant said it glides down into the atmosphere on the lookout for likely victimsof likely groups of victims since it prefers to feed on large numbers of people at the same time possibly it burns through its food quickly its always thirsty davis said no matter how much it drinks its never enough yeah lee said i felt it too so did we all the lieutenant said it looks to satisfy its thirst at locations where its actions will draw little to no attention these include remote areas such as the usmexico border the sahara and gobi and the andes it also likes conflict zones whether iraq darfur or the congo how it locates these sites is unknown we estimate that it visits between four and seven of them per day that we have been able to determine there does not appear to be an underlying pattern to its selection of either target areas or individuals within those areas the vampires exact level of intelligence is another unknown it possesses considerable abilities as a predator not least of them its speed reaction time and strength nor should we forget its teeth and a rap of the artificial leg claws not to mention that mind thing lee said yes the lieutenant said whether by accident or design the vampires appearance is accompanied by a telepathic jolt that momentarily disorients its intended victims rendering them easier prey for those who survive the meeting a nod at them a link remains that may be activated by persistent pronounced stress whether physical or mental the result of this activation is a period of clairvoyance during which the lucky individual rides along for the vampires current activities whether the vampire usually has equal access to our perceptions during this time is unclear our combined accounts suggest it does not however there are exceptions ix i know how we can kill it davis said at least i think i dohow we can get it to come to a place where we can kill it lee put his big mac on his tray and looked out the restaurant window the lieutenant paused in the act of dipping his fries into a tub of barbecue sauce han continued chewing his mcnugget but nodded twice the other daytwo days ago wednesdayi got to it what do you mean the lieutenant said it was coming in for a landing and i made it mess up bullshit lee said he did not shift his gaze from the window his face was flushed how the lieutenant said i was having a bad day worse than the usual bad day things at home depotthe managers okay but the assistant managers a raging asshole anyway i decided a workout might help id bought these kung fu dvds kung fu the lieutenant said davis shrugged seemed more interesting than running a treadmill through a mouthful of mcnugget han said bruce lee yeah davis said i put the first disc on to start with everythings fine im taking it easy staying well below the danger level my backs starting to ache the way it always does but thats okay i can live with it as long as i keep the situation in low gear i can continue with my tiger style did it help the lieutenant asked my worsethanbad day not really but it was something to do you know the lieutenant nodded lee stared at the traffic edging up the road in front of the mcdonalds han bit another mcnugget this time there was no warning my backs feeling like someones stitching it with a hot needle then im dropping out of heavy cloud cover below a squat hill pushes up from dense jungle a group of men are sitting around the top of the hill theyre wearing fatigues carrying kalashnikovs i think im somewhere in south america maybe these guys are farq maybe theyre some of chavezs boys ive been through the drill enough to know whats on the way a ringside seat for blood and carnage its reached the point when one of these incidents overtakes me i dont freak out the emotion that grips me is dread sickness at whats coming but this happens so fast there isnt time for any of that instead angerthe anger that usually shows up a couple of hours later when im still trying to get the taste of blood out of my mouth still trying to convince myself that im not the one whos so thirstyfor once that anger arrives on time and loaded for bear its like the fire thats crackling on my back finds its way into my veins and ignites me whats funny is the anger makes my connection to the thing even more intense the wind is pressing my face rushing over my armsmy wingsim aware of currents in the air places where its thicker thinner and i twitch my nerves to adjust for it theres one guy standing off from the rest closer to the treeline though not so much ithe thing wont be able to take him i can practically see the route to him a steep dive with a sharp turn at the very end thatll let the thing knife through him hes sporting a bush hat which hes pushed back on his head his shirts open tshirt dark with sweat hes holding his weapon selfconsciously trying to look like a badass and its this more than the smoothness of his skin the couple of whiskers on his chin that makes it clear he isnt even eighteen itiwe jackknife into the dive and thirsty christ thirsty isnt the word this is dryness that reaches right through to your fucking soul ive never understood what makes the thing tickwhat drives itso well at the same time the angers still there the closer we draw to the kid the hotter it burns weve reached the bottom of the dive and pulled up were streaking over the underbrush the kids completely oblivious to the fact that his bloody dismemberment is fifty feet away and closing fast im so close to the thing i can feel the way its fangs push against one another as they jut from its mouth were on top of the kid the things preparing to retract its wings slice him open and drive its face into him the kid is dead hes dead and he just doesnt know it yet only its likeim likei dont even think no or stop or pull up its morei push i shove against the thing im inside and its arms move its fucking arms jerk up as if someones passed a current through them someone hasi have im the current the motion throws off the things strike sends it wide it flails at the kid as it flies past him but hes out of reach i can sensethe things completely confused theres a clump of bushes straight aheadwham the lieutenant had adopted his best youdbetternotbebullshittingme stare he said i take it that severed the connection davis shook his head no sir you would expect thatits what would have happened in the pastbut this time it was like i was so close to the thing it was going to take something more to shake me loose and the lieutenant said lee shoved his tray back toppling his supersized dr pepper whose lid popped off splashing a wave of soda and ice cubes across the table while davis and the lieutenant grabbed napkins lee stood and said what the fuck davis what davis said i said what the fuck asshole lee said several diners at nearby tables turned their heads toward him inside voices the lieutenant said sit down i dont think so lee said i dont have to listen to this shit with that he stalked away from the table through the men and women swiftly returning their attentions to the meals in front of them and out the side door what the fuck davis said dropping his wad of soggy napkins on lees tray that seems to be the question of the moment the lieutenant said sir our friend and fellow is not having the best of months the lieutenant said in fact he is not having the best of years you remember the snafus with his disability checks i thought that was taken care of it was but it was accompanied by the departure of lees wife and their twoyearold compared to what he was lee is vastly improved in terms of the nuances of his emotional health however he has miles to go the shit with his disability did not help nor did spending all day home with a toddler who didnt recognize his father he didnt no but i gather it was a close thing a generous percentage of the wedding flatware paid the price for lees inability to manage himself in short order the situation became too much for shari who called her father to come for her and douglas bitch han said since then the lieutenant said lees situation has not improved a visit to the local bar for a night of drinking alone ended with him in the drunk tank shari s been talking separation possibly divorce and while lee tends to be a bit paranoid about the matter there may be someone else involved an old boyfriend those members of lees family whove visited him called him he has rebuffed in a fairly direct way to top it all off hes been subject to the same intermittent feast of blood as the rest of us oh davis said i had nolee doesnt talk to me never mind finish your story its not a story sorry poor choice of words go on please all right davis said okay you have to understand i was as surprised by all of this aswell as anyone i couldnt believe id affected the thing if it hadnt been so real so like all the other times i would have thought i was hallucinating on some kind of wishfulfillment trip as it was there i was as the thing picked itself up from the jungle floor the angermy angeri guess it was still there buton hold the second the thing was upright someone shouted and the air was hot with bullets most of them shredded leaves chipped bark but a few of them tagged the things arm its shoulder something was wrongmixing in with its confusion there was another emotion something down the block from fear i wasnt doing anything i was still stunned by what id made happen the thing jumped and someonemaybe a couple of guystracked it headed it off hit it in i cant tell you how many placesit felt as if the thing had been punched a dozen times at once it spun off course slapped a tree and went down snapping branches on its way now it was pissed even before it picked itself up the place it landed was being subject to intensive defoliation a shot tore its ear its angerif what i felt was fire this was lava thicker slowermoving hotter it retreated scuttled half a dozen trees deeper into the jungle whoever those guys were they were professionals they advanced on the spot where the thing fell and when they saw it wasnt there anymore they didnt rush in after it instead they fell back to a defensive posture while one of them put in a callfor air support im guessing the thing was angry and hurt and the thirst davis shook his head he sipped his coke what came nextim not sure i can describe it there was this surge in my headnot the things head this was my brain im talking aboutand the thing was looking out of my eyes it turned the tables on you the lieutenant said not exactly davis said i continued watching the soldiers maybe seventyfive feet in front of me but i wasaware of the thing staring at the dvd still playing on the tv it was as if the scene was on a screen just out of view he shook his head im not describing it right anyway that was when the connection broke davis watched the lieutenant evade an immediate response by taking a generous bite of his double quarterpounder with cheese and chewing it with great care han swallowed and said soldiers what soldiers han said through his mouthful of burger the lieutenant said he wants to know what happened to the soldiers right han nodded beats the shit out of me davis said maybe their air support showed up and bombed the fucker to hell maybe they evacd out of there but that isnt what you think the lieutenant said you think it got them yes sir davis said the minute it was free of me i think it had those poor bastards for lunch it seems a bit much to hope otherwise doesnt it yes sir it does when the lieutenant opted for another bite of his sandwich davis said well the lieutenant answered by lifting his eyebrows han switched from mcnuggets to fries as i see it davis began he stopped paused started again we know that the thing fucked with us in fallujah linked up with us so far this situation has only worked to our disadvantage whenever one of us is in sufficient discomfort the connection activates and dumps us behind the things eyes for somewhere in the vicinity of three to five minutes with all due respect to lee this has not been beneficial to anyones mental health but what ifsuppose we could duplicate what happened to me not just once but over and overeven if only for ten or fifteen seconds at a timeinterfere with whatever its doing seriously fuck with it then what the lieutenant said were a thorn in its side so sir davis said those soldiers hit it okay yes their fire wasnt any more effective than ours was but im willing to bet their percentages were significantly higher thats what me being on board in anenhanced way did to the thing we wouldnt be a thornwed be the goddamned bayonet han jammed in its ribs not that we should wait for someone else to take it down im proposing something more ambitious all right if we can disrupt the things routineespecially if we cut into its feedingit wont take very long for it to want to find us assuming the second part of my experiencethe thing has a look through our eyesif that happens again we can arrange it so that we let it know where were going to be we pick a location with a clearing where the thing can land and surrounding tree cover where we can wait to ambush it before any of us goes to ruin the things day he puts pictures maps satellite photos of the spot on display so that when the things staring out of his eyes thats what it sees if the same images keep showing up in front of it it should get the point the lieutenant took the rest of his meal to reply han offered no comment when the lieutenant had settled into his chair after tilting his tray into the garbage and stacking it on top of the can he said i dont know davis there are an awful lot more ifs than i prefer to hear in a plan if we can access the thing the same way you did if that wasnt a fluke if the thing does the reversevision stuff if it understands what were showing it if we can find a way to kill it he shook his head granted davis said theres a lot wed have to figure out not least how to put it down and keep it down i have some ideas about that but nothing developed it would be nice if we could control our connection to the thing too im wondering if what activates the jump is some chemical our bodies are releasing when were under stressmaybe adrenaline if we had access to a supply of adrenaline we could experiment with doses youre really serious about this whats the alternative davis said lee isnt the only one whose life is fucked is he how many more operations are you scheduled for han four five four han said and howre things in the meantime han did not answer what about you sir davis said oh sure your wife and kids stuck around but how do they act after youve had one of your fits or spells or whatever the fuck you call them do they rush right up to give daddy a hug or do they keep away from you in case you might do something even worse werent you coaching your sons soccer team hows that working out for you i bet its a lot of fun every time the ref makes a lousy call enough davis it isnt as if im in any better shape i have to make sure i remember to swallow a couple of tranquilizers before i go to work so i dont collapse in the middle of trying to help some customer load his fertilizer into his car okay rochelle had dumped me while i was away but let me tell you how the dating scene is for a vet whos prone to seizures should things get a little too exciting as for returning to college earning my bsmaybe if i could have stopped worrying about how goddamned exposed i was walking from building to building i couldve focused on some of what the professors were saying and not fucking had to withdraw this isnt the magic bullet davis said it isnt going to make all the bad things go away itsit is what it fucking is all right the lieutenant said im listening hanyou listening listening han said x am so where do you think it came from lee said what do you mean davis said we know where it comes from no lee said i mean before its secret origin the lieutenant said yeah lee said how should i know davis said youre the man with the plan lee said mr idea the lieutenant said i take it you have a theory lee lee glanced at the heap of coals that had been the fire nah not really that sounds like a yes to me the lieutenant said yeah han said come on davis said what do you think well lee said then broke off laughing no no talk davis said you tell us your theory the lieutenant said ill tell you mine okay okay lee said laughing all right the way i see it this vampire is like the advance for an invasion it flies around in its pod looking for suitable planets and when it finds one it parks itself above the surface calls its buddies and waits for them to arrive not bad the lieutenant said hang on davis said what does it do for blood while its boldly going where no vampire has gone before i dont know lee said maybe it has some stored in its coffin thats an awful lot of blood davis said even in mre form the lieutenant said maybe it has something in the coffin that makes blood for it then why would it leave to go hunting davis said its in suspended animation lee said thats it it doesnt wake up till its arrived at a habitable planet how does it know its located one davis said obviously the lieutenant said the coffins equipped with some sophisticated tech thank you sir lee said not at all the lieutenant said i dont know davis said what do you know lee said i told you be real lee said youre telling me you havent given five minutes to wondering how the vampire got to where it is i yeah han said im more concerned with the things future than i am with its past davis said but yes i have wondered about where it came from theres a lot of science i dont know but im not sure about an alien being able to survive on human bloodabout an alien needing human blood it could be i guess it just seems a bit of a stretch youre saying it came from here the lieutenant said thats bullshit lee said why shouldnt it davis said theres been life on earth for something like three point seven billion years are you telling me this couldnt have developed your logics shaky the lieutenant said just because something hasnt been disproved doesnt mean its true all im saying is we dont know everything thats ever been alive on the planet point taken the lieutenant said but this thing lives abovewell above the surface of the planet how do you explain that some kind of escape pod davis said i mean you guys know about the asteroid right the one thats supposed to have wiped out the dinosaurs suppose this guy and his friendssuppose their city was directly in this asteroids path maybe our thing was the only one who made it to the rockets on time or maybe it built this itself like superman lee said only hes a vampire and he doesnt leave krypton he just floats around it so he can snack on the other survivors sun han said what lee said yellow sun han said davis said he means superman needs a yellow sun for his powers krypton had a red sun so he wouldnt have been able to do much snacking yeah well we have a yellow sun lee said so whats the problem never mind or maybe youve figured out the real reason the dinosaurs went extinct lee said vampires got them all thats clever davis said youre very clever lee what about you sir lee said me the lieutenant said im afraid the scenario ive invented is much more lurid than either of yours i incline to the view that the vampire is here as a punishment for what davis said i havent the faintest clue the lieutenant said what kind of crime does a monster commit maybe it stole someone elses victims maybe it killed another vampire whatever it did it was placed in that coffin and sent out into space whether its fellows intended us as its final destination or planned for it to drift endlessly i cant say but i wonder if its blooddrinkingthat cravingmight not be part of its punishment how lee said say the vampires used to feeding on a substance like blood only better more nutritious more satisfying part of the reason for sending it here is that all that will be available to it is this poor substitute that leaves it perpetually thirsty not only does it have to cross significant distances expose itself to potential harm to feed the best it can do will never be good enough that lee said is fucked up theres a reason they made me an officer the lieutenant said he turned to han what about you han any thoughts concerning the nature of our imminent guest devil han said ah the lieutenant said which lee asked a devil or the devil han shrugged xi to start with the lieutenant called once a week on a saturday night davis could not help reflecting on what this said about the state of the mans life his marriage that he spent the peak hours of his weekend in a longdistance conversation with a former subordinateas well as the commentary their calls offered on his own state of affairs that not only was he always in his apartment for the lieutenants call but that starting late thursday up to a day earlier if his week was especially shitty he looked forward to it there was a rhythm almost a ritual to each call the lieutenant asked davis how hed been he answered fine sir and offered a précis of the last seven days at home depot which tended to consist of a summary of his assistant managers most egregious offences if hed steered clear of adams he might list the titles of whatever movies hed rented along with one or twosentence reviews of each occasionally he would narrate his latest failed date recasting stilted frustration as comic misadventure at the conclusion of his recitation davis would swat the lieutenants question back to him the lieutenant would answer cant complain and follow with a distillation of his week that focused on his dissatisfaction with his position at stillwater a defense contractor who had promised him a career as exciting as the one hed left but delivered little more than lunches dinners and cocktail parties at which the lieutenant was trotted out he said so everyone could admire his goddamned plastic leg and congratulate his employers on hiring him at least the money was decent and barbara enjoyed the opportunity to dress up and go out to nicer places than hed ever been able to afford the lieutenant did not speak about his children although if asked he would say that they were hanging in there from time to time he shared news of lee whom he called on sunday and whose situation never seemed to improve that much and han whose sister he emailed every monday and who reported that her brother was making progress with his injuries in fact han was starting to email the lieutenant himself this portion of their conversation which davis thought of as the prelude over the real reason for the callwhat davis thought of as the sitrepensued the lieutenant whose sentences hitherto had been loose lazy tightened his syntax as he quizzed davis about the status of the plan in response davis kept his replies short to the point have we settled on a location the lieutenant would ask yes sir davis would say thompsons grove that was the spot in the catskills the lieutenant would say south slope of winger mountain about a half mile east of the principle trail to the summit exactly sir davis would say research indicates the mountain itself is among the least visited in the catskill preserve and thompsons grove about the most obscure spot on it the location is sufficiently removed from civilian populations not to place them in immediate jeopardy yet still readily accessible by us good good the lieutenant would say ill notify lee and han the sitrep finished davis and the lieutenant would move to coming attractions review their priorities for the week ahead wish one another well and hang up as the months slid by and the plans more elaborate elements came into playespecially once davis commenced his experiments dosing himself with adrenalinethe lieutenant began adding the odd wednesday night to his call schedule after davis had determined the proper amount for inducing a look through the shadows eyesand after hed succeeded in affecting the thing a second time causing it to release its hold on a man davis was reasonably sure was a somali piratethe wednesday exchanges became part of their routine certainly they helped davis and the lieutenant to coordinate their experiences interrupting the shadows routine with the reports coming in from lee and han which arrived with increasing frequency once lee and han had found their adrenaline doses and were mastering the trick of interfering with the shadow however in the moment immediately preceding their setting their respective phones down davis would be struck by the impression that the lieutenant and he were on the verge of saying something else something morehe couldnt say what exactly only that it would be significant in a wayin a different way from their usual conversation it was how hed felt in the days leading up to fallujah as if with such momentous events roiling on the horizon he should be speaking about important matters meaningful things twice they came close to such an exchange the first time followed a discussion of the armaments the lieutenant had purchased at a recent gun show across the border in pennsylvania god love the nra hed said and listed the four glock sfs sixteen extra clips ten boxes of ammunition four ars sixteen extra highcapacity magazines for them thirty boxes of remington ammo and four usgi m bayonets jesus sir davis had said when the lieutenant was done thats a shitload of ordnance i stopped at the grenade launcher the lieutenant said it seemed excessive you do remember how much effect our guns had on the thing the last time think of this as a supplement to the plan even with one of us on board once the thing shows up its going to be a threat we know its easier to hit when someones messing with its controls so lets exploit that the more we can tag it the more we can slow it down improve our chances of using your secret weapon on it fair enough good im glad you agree davis was opening his mouth to suggest possible positions the four of them might take around the clearing when the lieutenant said davis sir would you say youve had a good life scratch thatwould you say youve had a satisfactory life ii dont know i guess so ive been thinking about my father these past few days its the anniversary of his death twentyone years ago this monday he came here from mexico city when he was sixteen worked as a fruit picker for a couple of years then fell into a job at a diner he started busing tables talked his way into the kitchen and became the principle cook for the night shift that was how he met my mother she was a waitress there she was from mexico too although the countryapparently she thought my old man was some kind of cityslicker not to be trusted by a virtuous girl i guess she was right because my older brother was born seven months after their wedding but i came along two years after that so i dont think that was the only reason for them tying the knot he died when i was five my father an embolism burst in his brain he was at work just getting into the swing of things the coroner said he was dead before he reached the floor he was twentyseven what i wonder is when he looked at his life at everything hed done was it what he wanted even if it was different was it enough how many people do you suppose exit this world satisfied with what theyve managed to accomplish in it davis how many of our fellows slipped their mortal coils content with what their eighteen or twentyone or twentyseven years had meant there was the mission davis said ask them in public and theyd laugh offer some smartass remark but talk to them oneonone and theyd tell you they believed in what we were doing even if things could get pretty fuckedup im not sure if that wouldve been enough for lugo or manfredfor anyonebut it wouldve counted for something true the lieutenant said the question is will something do i guess it has to their second such conversation came two weeks before the weekend the four of them were scheduled to travel to upstate new york they were reviewing the final draft of the plan which davis thought must be something like the plan version although little had changed in the way of the principles since theyd finalized them a month earlier ten minutes before dawn they would take up their positions in the trees around the clearing if north was twelve oclock then lee and han would be at twelvenecessary because han would be injecting himself at tminus one minute and would require protectionthe lieutenant would take two and davis three the woods were reasonably thick if they positioned themselves about ten feet in then the shadow would be unable to come in on top of them if it wanted them it would have to land shift to foot and that would be the cue for the three of them aiming their ars to fire in the meantime han would have snuck on board the shadow and be preparing to jam it as soon as he saw the opportunity he would do his utmost to take the things legs out from under it a maneuver he had been rehearsing for several weeks and become reasonably proficient at the average time han guesstimated hed been able to knock the shadows legs out was fifteen seconds though he had reached the vicinity of thirty once this would be their window the instant the things legs crumpled two of them had to be up and on it probably davis and lee since the lieutenant wasnt placing any bets on his sprinters start one of them would draw the shadows notice the other hit it with the secret weapon if for any reason the first attacker failed the second could engage if he saw the opportunity otherwise he would have to return to the woods because hans hold on the thing would be wearing off once the lieutenant observed this he would inject himself and they would begin round two round two was the same as round one except for the presumed lack of one man just as round three counted on two of them being gone round four the lieutenant said was him eating a bullet by that point there might not be anything he could do to stop the ugly son of a bitch drinking his blood but that didnt mean he had to stay around for the event davis knew they would recite the plan again on saturday and then next wednesday and then the saturday after that and then the wednesday two weeks from now at the quality inn in kingston they would recite the plan and again as they drove into the catskills and yet again as they hiked up winger mountain preparation the lieutenant had said in iraq is what ensures you will fuck up only eighty percent of what you are trying to do if the exact numbers sounded overly optimistic to davis he agreed with the general sentiment without preamble the lieutenant said you know davis when my older brother was twentyfour he left his girlfriend for a married russian émigré six years his seniorwhom he had met ironically enough through his ex who had been tutoring margarita her husband sergei and their fouryearold stasu in english no sir davis said im pretty sure you never told me this you have to understand the lieutenant went on until this point my brother alberto had led a reasonably sedate and unimpressive life prior to this the most daring thing hed done was go out with alexandra the tutor who was jewish which made our very catholic mother very nervous yet here he was packing his clothes and his books emptying his meager bank account and driving out of town with margarita in the passengers seat and stasu in the back with all the stuff they couldnt squeeze in the trunk they headed west first to st louis for a couple of months next to new mexico for three years and finally to portlandactually its just outside portland but i can never remember the name of the town she was a veterinarian margarita with albertos help she succeeded in having her credentials transferred over here has her own practice these days treats horses cows farm animals alberto helps her hes her assistant and office manager sergei gave them custody of stasu they have two more kids girls helena and catherine beautiful kids my nieces you have any brothers or sisters davis a younger brother sir he wants to be a priest really yes sir isnt that funny xii am lying on the ground hed swept clear of rocks and branches his rifle propped on a small log the sky a red bowl overhead davis experienced a moment of complete and utter doubt not only did the course of action on which they had set out appear wildly implausible but everything from the courtyard in fallujah on acquired the sheen of the unreal the delusional an eightfoottall space vampire visions of soaring through the sky of savaging scores of men women and children around the globe injecting himself with adrenaline for christs sake what was any of this but the worlds biggest symptom a massive phantasy his mind had conjured to escape a reality it couldnt bear what had happenedwhat scene was the shadow substituting for had they in fact found a trap in the courtyard an ied that had shredded them in its fiery teeth was he lying in a hospital bed somewhere his body ruined his mind hopelessly crippled when the shadow was standing in the clearing swinging its narrow head from side to side davis felt something like relief if this dark thing and its depravities were a hallucination he could be true to it the shadow parted its fangs as if tasting the dawn davis tensed prepared to find himself someplace else subject to a clip from the things history but the worst he felt was a sudden buzzing in his skull that reminded him of nothing so much as the old fuse box in his parents basement he adjusted his rifle and squeezed the trigger the air rang with gunfire davis thought his first burst caught the thing in the belly he saw it step back though that might have been due to either lee or the lieutenant who had fired along with him almost too fast to follow the shadow jumped a black scribble against the sky but someone anticipated its leap and aimed ahead of it at least one of the bullets connected davis saw the shadows right eye pucker stickarms jerking it fell at the edge of the treeline ten feet in front of him he shot at its head its shoulders geysers of dirt marked his misses the shadow threw itself backwards but collapsed where it landed now the lieutenant screamed davis grabbed for his stake with his left hand as he dropped the rifle from his right almost before his fingers had closed on the weapon he was on his feet and rushing into the clearing to the right lee burst out of the trees his stake held overhead in both hands his mouth open in a bellow in front of them the shadow was thrashing from side to side like the worlds largest insect pinned through the middle its claws scythed grass bushes davis saw that its right eye had indeed been hit and partially collapsed lee was not slowing his charge davis sprinted to reach the shadow at the same time although the things legs were motionless its claws were fast as ever as davis came abreast of it jabbing at its head its arm snapped in his direction pain razored up his left arm blood spattered the grass the shadows head jerked towards him and the momentary distraction this offered was perhaps what allowed lee to tumble into a forward roll that dropped him under the shadows other claw and up again to drive his stake down into the base of its throat reaching for the cell phone in his shirt pocket davis backpedaled the things maw gaped as lee held on to shove the weapon as far as it would go the shadow twisted and thrust its claws into lees collarbone and ribs his eyes bulged and he released the stake davis had the cell phone in his hand the shadow tore its claw from lees chest and ripped him open davis pressed the three and hit send in the woods there was a white flash and the crump of explosives detonating a cloud of debris rushed between the trunks the shadow jolted as if a bolt of lightning had speared it shit the lieutenant was screaming shit the shadow was on its feet lee dangling from its left claw like a childs bedraggled plaything davis backpedaled with its right claw the shadow reached for the stake jutting from its throat davis pressed the two and send he was knocked from his feet by the force of the blast which shoved the air from his lungs and pushed sight and sound away from him he was aware of the ground pressing against his back a fine rain of particles pattering his skin but his body was contracted around his chest which could not bring in any air suffocating he was suffocating he tried to move his hands his feet but his extremities did not appear to be receiving his brains instructions perhaps his handcrafted bomb had accomplished what the shadow could not what he could feel of the world was bleeding away xiii although lee wanted to wait for sunset if not total darkness a preference davis shared the lieutenant insisted they shoulder their packs and start the trail up winger mountain while the sun would be broadcasting its light for another couple of hours at the expressions on lee and davis s faces he said relax the thing sweeps the grove first thing in the morning its long gone off feeding someplace the trail was not unpleasant had they been so inclined its lower reaches were wide enough that they could have walked them two abreast they opted for single file lee taking point han next the lieutenant third and davis bringing up the rear it spread the targets out the ground was matted with the leaves of the trees that flanked the trail and stationed the gradual slopes to either side while he had never been any good at keeping the names of such things straight davis had an idea the trees were a mix of maple and oak the occasional white one a birch with their crowns full of leaves the trees almost obscured the skys blue emptiness all the same davis didnt look up any more than he could help they reached the path to thompsons grove sooner than davis had anticipated a piece of wood weathered gray and nailed to a tree chesthigh pointed right to a narrower route that appeared overgrown a hundred yards or so in the distance lee withdrew the machete he had sheathed on his belt and struck the sign once twice until it flew off the tree into the forest hey davis said thats vandalism sue me lee said once they were well into the greenery the mosquitoes which had ventured only the occasional scout so long as they kept to the trail descended in clouds damnit the lieutenant said slapping his cheek i used bug spray probably tastes like dessert topping to them sir lee called although damn at this rate there wont be any blood left in us for count dracula thompsons grove was an irregular circle forty feet across grass stood thighhigh a few bushes punctuated the terrain davis could feel the sky hungry above them lee and han walked the perimeter while he and the lieutenant stayed near the trees all of their rifles were out lee and han declared the area secure but the four of them waited until the sun was finally down to clear the center of the grove and build their fire lee had been davis supposed the word was off since theyd met in kingston that morning his eyes shone in his face whose flesh seemed drawn around the bones when davis embraced him in the lobby of the quality inn it had been like putting his arms around one of the support cables on a suspension bridge something bracing an enormous weight it might be the prospect of their upcoming encounter although davis suspected there was more to it the lieutenants most recent report had been that lee was continuing to struggle shari had won custody of douglas with whom lee was permitted supervised visits every other saturday hed enrolled at his local community college but stopped attending classes after the first week the lieutenant wasnt sure hed go so far as to call lee an alcoholic but there was no doubt the man liked his beer a good deal more than was healthy after the wood was gathered and stacked the fire kindled the sandwiches davis had prepared distributed lee cleared his throat and said i know the lieutenant has an order he wants us to follow but theres something i need to know about all right the lieutenant said through a mouthful of turkey on rye ask away its the connection we have to the thing lee said okay so weve got a direct line into its central nervous system the right amount of adrenaline and we can hijack it problem is the link works both ways at least we know that when the things angry it can look out of our eyes what if it can do more what if it can do to us what weve done to it take us over theres been no evidence of that davis said dont you think if it could do that it would have by now not necessarily lee said oh why not why would it need to were trying to get its attention it doesnt need to do anything to get ours its an unknown the lieutenant said its conceivable the thing could assume control of whoevers hooked up to it and try to use him for support i have to say though that even if it could possess one of us i have a hard time imagining it doing so while the rest of us are trying to shorten its lifespan to tell you the truth should we succeed in killing it id be more worried about it using the connection as a means of escape escape davis said lee said the lieutenant means it leaves its body behind for one of ours could it do that i dont know the lieutenant said i only mention it as a worstcase scenario our ability to share its perceptions to affect its actions seems to suggest some degree of congruity between the thing and us on the other hand it is a considerable leap from there to its being able to inhabit us maybe thats how it makes more of itself lee said one dies ones born phoenix han said this is all pretty speculative davis said yes it is the lieutenant said should the thing seize any of us however it will have been speculation wellspent what do you propose then sir davis said assuming any of us survives the morning the lieutenant said we will have to proceed with great caution he held up his pistol xiv am davis opened his eyes to a hole in the sky round blackfor a moment he had the impression the earth had gained a strange new satellite or that some unimaginable catastrophe had blown an opening in the atmosphere and then his vision adjusted and he realized that he was looking up into the barrel of the lieutenants glock the man himself halfcrouched beside davis his eyes narrowed his lips moved and davis struggled to pick his words out of the white noise ringing in his ears davis he said you there yeah davis said something was burning a charcoal reek stung his nostrils his mouth tasted like ashes he pushed himself up on his elbows is it whoa the lieutenant said holding his free hand up like a traffic cop take it easy soldier that was some blast did we we did yeah we blew it to kingdom come the lieutenant said no doubt there are pieces of it scattered here and there but the majority of it is so much dust lee you saw what the thing did to himalthough stupid motherfucker it serves him right grabbing the wrong goddamned stake of all the stupid fucking davis swallowed han the lieutenant shook his head davis lay back fuck never mind the lieutenant said his pistol had not moved shit happens the question before us now is did it work are we well and truly rid of that thing that fucking blooddrinking monster or are we fooling ourselves what do you say davis i his throat was dry lee grabbed the wrong one he did how is that possible i dont know the lieutenant said i do not fucking know i specifically gave each of us i know i watched you in the excitement of the moment lee and han must have mixed them up mixed davis raised his hands to his forehead behind the lieutenant the sky was a blue chasm or could be the confusion was deliberate what maybe they switched stakes on purpose no i dont think so either but we all know it wasnt much of a life for han that doesnt mean it doesnt jesus davis sat up the lieutenant steadied his gun so i take it youre fine as far as ive been able to determine yes could the thing have had something to do with it the mixup made han switch the stakes or something that presumes it knew what they were which supposes it had been spying on us through hans eyes for not a few hours which assumes it comprehended usour language our technologyin excess of prior evidence yeah davis said still it was an accident the lieutenant said let it go what makes you so sure youre all right ive had no indications to the contrary i appear in control of my own thoughts and actions im aware of no alien presence crowding my mind while i am thirsty i have to desire to quench that thirst from one of your arteries would you be though aware of the thing hiding in you the lieutenant shrugged possibly not youre taking a long time to answer my question you know that i dont know how i am davis said no i cant feel the thing either and no i dont want to drink your blood is that enough davis the lieutenant said i will do this you need to understand that you are as close to me as anyone these days and i will shoot you in the head if i deem it necessary if i believed the thing were in me i would turn this gun on myself without a second thought am i making myself clear let me know its over or let me finish it the lieutenants face was flushed all right davis said he closed his eyes all right he took a deep breath another when he opened his eyes he said its gone youre positive yes sir you cannot be lying to me i know im not the end of the pistol wavered and for a moment davis was certain that the lieutenant was unconvinced that he was going to squeeze the trigger anyway he wondered if hed see the muzzle flash then the pistol lowered and the lieutenant said good man he holstered the gun and extended his hand come on theres a lot we have to do davis caught the lieutenants hand and hauled himself to his feet behind the lieutenant he saw the charred place that had been the shadow lees torn and blackened form to one side of it further back smoke continued to drift out of the spot in the trees where han had lain the lieutenant turned and started walking towards the trees he did not ask and davis did not tell him what he had seen with his eyes closed he wasnt sure how he could have said that the image behind his eyelids was the same as the image in front of them the unending sky blue ravenous for fiona and with thanks to john joseph adams one for the road by stephen king stephen

classic folklore imagined the brooding mists of transylvania as malignant corporeal beings here king does the same for the whiteouts of cumberland these vampires are avatars of winter chilling in every respect it was quarter past ten and herb tooklander was thinking of closing for the night when the man in the fancy overcoat and the white staring face burst into tookeys bar which lies in the northern part of falmouth it was the tenth of january just about the time most folks are learning to live comfortably with all the new years resolutions they broke and there was one hell of a northeaster blowing outside six inches had come down before dark and it had been going hard and heavy since then twice we had seen billy larribee go by high in the cab of the town plow and the second time tookey ran him out a beeran act of pure charity my mother would have called it and my god knows she put down enough of tookeys beer in her time billy told him they were keeping ahead of it on the main road but the side ones were closed and apt to stay that way until next morning the radio in portland was forecasting another foot and a fortymileanhour wind to pile up the drifts there was just tookey and me in the bar listening to the wind howl around the eaves and watching it dance the fire around on the hearth have one for the road booth tookey says im gonna shut her down he poured me one and himself one and thats when the door cracked open and this stranger staggered in snow up to his shoulders and in his hair like he had rolled around in confectioners sugar the wind billowed a sandfine sheet of snow in after him close the door tookey roars at him was you born in a barn ive never seen a man who looked that scared he was like a horse thats spent an afternoon eating fire nettles his eyes rolled toward tookey and he said my wifemy daughter and he collapsed on the floor in a dead faint holy joe tookey says close the door booth would you i went and shut it and pushing it against the wind was something of a chore tookey was down on one knee holding the fellows head up and patting his cheeks i got over to him and saw right off that it was nasty his face was fiery red but there were gray blotches here and there and when youve lived through winters in maine since the time woodrow wilson was president as i have you know those gray blotches mean frostbite fainted tookey said get the brandy off the backbar will you i got it and came back tookey had opened the fellows coat he had come around a little his eyes were half open and he was muttering something too low to catch pour a capful tookey says just a cap i asks him that stuffs dynamite tookey says no sense overloading his carb i poured out a capful and looked at tookey he nodded straight down the hatch i poured it down it was a remarkable thing to watch the man trembled all over and began to cough his face got redder his eyelids which had been at halfmast flew up like window shades i was a bit alarmed but tookey only sat him up like a big baby and clapped him on the back the man started to retch and tookey clapped him again hold onto it he says that brandy comes dear the man coughed some more but it was diminishing now i got my first good look at him city fellow all right and from somewhere south of boston at a guess he was wearing kid gloves expensive but thin there were probably some more of those grayishwhite patches on his hands and he would be lucky not to lose a finger or two his coat was fancy all right a threehundreddollar job if ever id seen one he was wearing tiny little boots that hardly came up over his ankles and i began to wonder about his toes better he said all right tookey said can you come over to the fire my wife and my daughter he said theyre out there in the storm from the way you came in i didnt figure they were at home watching the tv tookey said you can tell us by the fire as easy as here on the floor hook on booth he got to his feet but a little groan came out of him and his mouth twisted down in pain i wondered about his toes again and i wondered why god felt he had to make fools from new york city who would try driving around in southern maine at the height of a northeast blizzard and i wondered if his wife and his little girl were dressed any warmer than him we hiked him across to the fireplace and got him sat down in a rocker that used to be missus tookeys favorite until she passed on in it was missus tookey that was responsible for most of the place which had been written up in down east and the sunday telegram and even once in the sunday supplement of the boston globe its really more of a public house than a bar with its big wooden floor pegged together rather than nailed the maple bar the old barnraftered ceiling and the monstrous big fieldstone hearth missus tookey started to get some ideas in her head after the down east article came out wanted to start calling the place tookeys inn or tookeys rest and i admit it has sort of a colonial ring to it but i prefer plain old tookeys bar its one thing to get uppish in the summer when the states full of tourists another thing altogether in the winter when you and your neighbors have to trade together and there had been plenty of winter nights like this one that tookey and i had spent all alone together drinking scotch and water or just a few beers my own victoria passed on in and tookeys was a place to go where there were enough voices to mute the steady ticking of the deathwatch beetleeven if there was just tookey and me it was enough i wouldnt have felt the same about it if the place had been tookeys rest its crazy but its true we got this fellow in front of the fire and he got the shakes harder than ever he hugged onto his knees and his teeth clattered together and a few drops of clear mucus spilled off the end of his nose i think he was starting to realize that another fifteen minutes out there might have been enough to kill him its not the snow its the windchill factor it steals your heat where did you go off the road tookey asked him ssix miles sssouth of hhere he said tookey and i stared at each other and all of a sudden i felt cold cold all over you sure tookey demanded you came six miles through the snow he nodded i checked the odometer when we came through ttown i was following directions going to see my wifes ssister in cumberland never been there before were from new jersey new jersey if theres anyone more purely foolish than a new yorker its a fellow from new jersey six miles youre sure tookey demanded pretty sure yeah i found the turnoff but it was drifted in it was tookey grabbed him in the shifting glow of the fire his face looked pale and strained older than his sixtysix years by ten you made a right turn right turn yeah my wife did you see a sign sign he looked up at tookey blankly and wiped the end of his nose of course i did it was on my instructions take jointner avenue through jerusalems lot to the entrance ramp he looked from tookey to me and back to tookey again outside the wind whistled and howled and moaned through the eaves wasnt that right mister the lot tookey said almost too soft to hear oh my god whats wrong the man said his voice was rising wasnt that right i mean the road looked drifted in but i thought if theres a town there the plows will be out and and then i he just sort of tailed off booth tookey said to me low get on the phone call the sheriff sure this fool from new jersey says thats right whats wrong with you guys anyway you look like you saw a ghost tookey said no ghosts in the lot mister did you tell them to stay in the car sure i did he said sounding injured im not crazy well you couldnt have proved it by me whats your name i asked him for the sheriff lumley he says gerard lumley he started in with tookey again and i went across to the telephone i picked it up and heard nothing but dead silence i hit the cutoff buttons a couple of times still nothing i came back tookey had poured gerard lumley another tot of brandy and this one was going down him a lot smoother was he out tookey asked phones dead hot damn tookey says and we look at each other outside the wind gusted up throwing snow against the windows lumley looked from tookey to me and back again well havent either of you got a car he asked the anxiety was back in his voice theyve got to run the engine to run the heater i only had about a quarter of a tank of gas and it took me an hour and a half to look will you answer me he stood up and grabbed tookeys shirt mister tookey says i think your hand just ran away from your brains there lumley looked at his hand at tookey then dropped it maine he hissed he made it sound like a dirty word about somebodys mother all right he said wheres the nearest gas station they must have a tow truck nearest gas station is in falmouth center i said thats three miles down the road from here thanks he said a bit sarcastic and headed for the door buttoning his coat wont be open though i added he turned back slowly and looked at us what are you talking about old man hes trying to tell you that the station in the center belongs to billy larribee and billys out driving the plow you damn fool tookey says patiently now why dont you come back here and sit down before you bust a gut he came back looking dazed and frightened are you telling me you cant that there isnt i aint telling you nothing tookey says youre doing all the telling and if you stopped for a minute we could think this over whats this town jerusalems lot he asked why was the road drifted in and no lights on anywhere i said jerusalems lot burned out two years back and they never rebuilt he looked like he didnt believe it it appears that way i said and looked at tookey what are we going to do about this cant leave them out there he said i got closer to him lumley had wandered away to look out the window into the snowy night what if theyve been got at i asked that may be he said but we dont know it for sure ive got my bible on the shelf you still wear your popes medal i pulled the crucifix out of my shirt and showed him i was born and raised congregational but most folks who live around the lot wear somethingcrucifix st christophers medal rosary something because two years ago in the span of one dark october month the lot went bad sometimes late at night when there were just a few regulars drawn up around tookeys fire people would talk it over talk around it is more like the truth you see people in the lot started to disappear first a few then a few more than a whole slew the schools closed the town stood empty for most of a year oh a few people moved inmostly damn fools from out of state like this fine specimen heredrawn by the low property values i suppose but they didnt last a lot of them moved out a month or two after theyd moved in the others well they disappeared then the town burned flat it was at the end of a long dry fall they figure it started up by the marsten house on the hill that overlooked jointner avenue but no one knows how it started not to this day it burned out of control for three days after that for a time things were better and then they started again i only heard the word vampires mentioned once a crazy pulp truck driver named richie messina from over freeport way was in tookeys that night pretty well liquored up jesus christ this stampeder roars standing up about nine feet tall in his wool pants and his plaid shirt and his leathertopped boots are you all so damn afraid to say it out vampires thats what youre all thinking aint it jesusjumpedupchrist in a chariotdriven sidecar just like a bunch of kids scared of the movies you know what there is down there in salems lot want me to tell you want me to tell you do tell richie tookey says it had got real quiet in the bar you could hear the fire popping and outside the soft drift of november rain coming down in the dark you got the floor what you got over there is your basic wild dog pack richie messina tells us thats what you got that and a lot of old women who love a good spook story why for eighty bucks id go up there and spend the night in whats left of that haunted house youre all so worried about well what about it anyone want to put it up but nobody would richie was a loudmouth and a mean drunk and no one was going to shed any tears at his wake but none of us were willing to see him go into salems lot after dark be screwed to the bunch of you richie says i got my fourten in the trunk of my chevy and thatll stop anything in falmouth cumberland or jerusalems lot and thats where im goin he slammed out of the bar and no one said a word for a while then lamont henry says real quiet thats the last time anyones gonna see richie messina holy god and lamont raised to be a methodist from his mothers knee crossed himself hell sober off and change his mind tookey said but he sounded uneasy hell be back by closin time makin out it was all a joke but lamont had the right of that one because no one ever saw richie again his wife told the state cops she thought hed gone to florida to beat a collection agency but you could see the truth of the thing in her eyessick scared eyes not long after she moved away to rhode island maybe she thought richie was going to come after her some dark night and im not the man to say he might not have done now tookey was looking at me and i was looking at tookey as i stuffed my crucifix back into my shirt i never felt so old or so scared in my life tookey said again we cant just leave them out there booth yeah i know we looked at each other for a moment longer and then he reached out and gripped my shoulder youre a good man booth that was enough to buck me up some it seems like when you pass seventy people start forgetting that you are a man or that you ever were tookey walked over to lumley and said ive got a fourwheeldrive scout ill get it out for gods sake man why didnt you say so before he had whirled around from the window and was staring angrily at tookey whyd you have to spend ten minutes beating around the bush tookey said very softly mister you shut your jaw and if you get the urge to open it you remember who made that turn onto an unplowed road in the middle of a goddamned blizzard he started to say something and then shut his mouth thick color had risen up in his cheeks tookey went out to get his scout out of the garage i felt around under the bar for his chrome flask and filled it full of brandy figured we might need it before this night was over maine blizzardever been out in one the snow comes flying so thick and fine that it looks like sand and sounds like that beating on the sides of your car or pickup you dont want to use your high beams because they reflect off the snow and you cant see ten feet in front of you with the low beams on you can see maybe fifteen feet but i can live with the snow its the wind i dont like when it picks up and begins to howl driving the snow into a hundred weird flying shapes and sounding like all the hate and pain and fear in the world theres death in the throat of a snowstorm wind white deathand maybe something beyond death thats no sound to hear when youre tucked up all cozy in your own bed with the shutters bolted and the doors locked its that much worse if youre driving and we were driving smack into salems lot hurry up a little cant you lumley asked i said for a man who came in half frozen youre in one hell of a hurry to end up walking again he gave me a resentful baffled look and didnt say anything else we were moving up the highway at a steady twentyfive miles an hour it was hard to believe that billy larribee had just plowed this stretch an hour ago another two inches had covered it and it was drifting in the strongest gusts of wind rocked the scout on her springs the headlights showed a swirling white nothing up ahead of us we hadnt met a single car about ten minutes later lumley gasps hey whats that he was pointing out my side of the car id been looking dead ahead i turned but was a shade too late i thought i could see some sort of slumped form fading back from the car back into the snow but that could have been imagination what was it a deer i asked i guess so he says sounding shaky but its eyesthey looked red he looked at me is that how a deers eyes look at night he sounded almost as if he were pleading they can look like anything i says thinking that might be true but ive seen a lot of deer at night from a lot of cars and never saw any set of eyes reflect back red tookey didnt say anything about fifteen minutes later we came to a place where the snowbank on the right of the road wasnt so high because the plows are supposed to raise their blades a little when they go through an intersection this looks like where we turned lumley said not sounding too sure about it i dont see the sign this is it tookey answered he didnt sound like himself at all you can just see the top of the signpost oh sure lumley sounded relieved listen mr tooklander im sorry about being so short back there i was cold and worried and calling myself two hundred kinds of fool and i want to thank you both dont thank booth and me until weve got them in this car tookey said he put the scout in fourwheel drive and slammed his way through the snowbank and onto jointner avenue which goes through the lot and out to snow flew up from the mudguards the rear end tried to break a little bit but tookeys been driving through snow since hector was a pup he jockeyed it a bit talked to it and on we went the headlights picked out the bare indication of other tire tracks from time to time the ones made by lumleys car and then they would disappear again lumley was leaning forward looking for his car and all at once tookey said mr lumley what he looked around at tookey people around these parts are kind of superstitious about salems lot tookey says sounding easy enoughbut i could see the deep lines of strain around his mouth and the way his eyes kept moving from side to side if your people are in the car why thats fine well pack them up go back to my place and tomorrow when the storms over billy will be glad to yank your car out of the snowbank but if theyre not in the car not in the car lumley broke in sharply why wouldnt they be in the car if theyre not in the car tookey goes on not answering were going to turn around and drive back to falmouth center and whistle for the sheriff makes no sense to go wallowing around at night in a snowstorm anyway does it theyll be in the car where else would they be i said one other thing mr lumley if we should see anybody were not going to talk to them not even if they talk to us you understand that very slow lumley says just what are these superstitions before i could say anythinggod alone knows what i would have saidtookey broke in were there we were coming up on the back end of a big mercedes the whole hood of the thing was buried in a snowdrift and another drift had socked in the whole left side of the car but the taillights were on and we could see exhaust drifting out of the tailpipe they didnt run out of gas anyway lumley said tookey pulled up and pulled on the scouts emergency brake you remember what booth told you lumley sure sure but he wasnt thinking of anything but his wife and daughter i dont see how anybody could blame him either ready booth tookey asked me his eyes held on mine grim and gray in the dashboard lights i guess i am i said we all got out and the wind grabbed us throwing snow in our faces lumley was first bending into the wind his fancy topcoat billowing out behind him like a sail he cast two shadows one from tookeys headlights the other from his own taillights i was behind him and tookey was a step behind me when i got to the trunk of the mercedes tookey grabbed me let him go he said janey francie lumley yelled everything okay he pulled open the driversside door and leaned in everything he froze to a dead stop the wind ripped the heavy door right out of his hand and pushed it all the way open holy god booth tookey said just below the scream of the wind i think its happened again lumley turned back toward us his face was scared and bewildered his eyes wide all of a sudden he lunged toward us through the snow slipping and almost falling he brushed me away like i was nothing and grabbed tookey how did you know he roared where are they what the hell is going on here tookey broke his grip and shoved past him he and i looked into the mercedes together warm as toast it was but it wasnt going to be for much longer the little amber lowfuel light was glowing the big car was empty there was a childs barbie doll on the passengers floormat and a childs ski parka was crumpled over the seatback tookey put his hands over his face and then he was gone lumley had grabbed him and shoved him right back into the snowbank his face was pale and wild his mouth was working as if he had chewed down on some bitter stuff he couldnt yet unpucker enough to spit out he reached in and grabbed the parka francies coat he kind of whispered and then loud bellowing francies coat he turned around holding it in front of him by the little furtrimmed hood he looked at me blank and unbelieving she cant be out without her coat on mr booth why why shell freeze to death mr lumley he blundered past me still holding the parka shouting francie janey where are you where are youuu i gave tookey my hand and pulled him onto his feet are you all never mind me he says weve got to get hold of him booth we went after him as fast as we could which wasnt very fast with the snow hipdeep in some places but then he stopped and we caught up to him mr lumley tookey started laying a hand on his shoulder this way lumley said this is the way they went look we looked down we were in a kind of dip here and most of the wind went right over our heads and you could see two sets of tracks one large and one small just filling up with snow if we had been five minutes later they would have been gone he started to walk away his head down and tookey grabbed him back no no lumley lumley turned his wild face up to tookeys and made a fist he drew it back but something in tookeys face made him falter he looked from tookey to me and then back again shell freeze he said as if we were a couple of stupid kids dont you get it she doesnt have her jacket on and shes only seven years old they could be anywhere tookey said you cant follow those tracks theyll be gone in the next drift what do you suggest lumley yells his voice high and hysterical if we go back to get the police shell freeze to death francie and my wife they may be frozen already tookey said his eyes caught lumleys frozen or something worse what do you mean lumley whispered get it straight goddamn it tell me mr lumley tookey says theres something in the lot but i was the one who came out with it finally said the word i never expected to say vampires mr lumley jerusalems lot is full of vampires i expect thats hard for you to swallow he was staring at me as if id gone green loonies he whispers youre a couple of loonies then he turned away cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed francie janey he started floundering off again the snow was up to the hem of his fancy coat i looked at tookey what do we do now follow him tookey says his hair was plastered with snow and he did look a little bit loony i cant just leave him out here booth can you no i says guess not so we started to wade through the snow after lumley as best we could but he kept getting further and further ahead he had his youth to spend you see he was breaking the trail going through that snow like a bull my arthritis began to bother me something terrible and i started to look down at my legs telling myself a little further just a little further keep goin damn it keep goin i piled right into tookey who was standing spreadlegged in a drift his head was hanging and both of his hands were pressed to his chest tookey i says you okay im all right he said taking his hands away well stick with him booth and when he fags out hell see reason we topped a rise and there was lumley at the bottom looking desperately for more tracks poor man there wasnt a chance he was going to find them the wind blew straight across down there where he was and any tracks would have been rubbed out three minutes after they was made let alone a couple of hours he raised his head and screamed into the night francie janey for gods sake and you could hear the desperation in his voice the terror and pity him for it the only answer he got was the freighttrain wail of the wind it almost seemed to be laughin at him saying i took them mister new jersey with your fancy car and camelshair topcoat i took them and i rubbed out their tracks and by morning ill have them just as neat and frozen as two strawberries in a deepfreeze lumley tookey bawled over the wind listen you never mind vampires or boogies or nothing like that but you mind this youre just making it worse for them we got to get the and then there was an answer a voice coming out of the dark like little tinkling silver bells and my heart turned cold as ice in a cistern jerry jerry is that you lumley wheeled at the sound and then she came drifting out of the dark shadows of a little copse of trees like a ghost she was a city woman all right and right then she seemed like the most beautiful woman i had ever seen i felt like i wanted to go to her and tell her how glad i was she was safe after all she was wearing a heavy green pullover sort of thing a poncho i believe theyre called it floated all around her and her dark hair streamed out in the wild wind like water in a december creek just before the winter freeze stills it and locks it in maybe i did take a step toward her because i felt tookeys hand on my shoulder rough and warm and stillhow can i say iti yearned after her so dark and beautiful with that green poncho floating around her neck and shoulders as exotic and strange as to make you think of some beautiful woman from a walter de la mare poem janey lumley cried janey he began to struggle through the snow toward her his arms outstretched no tookey cried no lumley he never even looked but she did she looked up at us and grinned and when she did i felt my longing my yearning turn to horror as cold as the grave as white and silent as bones in a shroud even from the rise we could see the sullen red glare in those eyes they were less human than a wolfs eyes and when she grinned you could see how long her teeth had become she wasnt human anymore she was a dead thing somehow come back to life in this black howling storm tookey made the sign of the cross at her she flinched back and then grinned at us again we were too far away and maybe too scared stop it i whispered cant we stop it too late booth tookey says grimly lumley had reached her he looked like a ghost himself coated in snow like he was he reached for her and then he began to scream ill hear that sound in my dreams that man screaming like a child in a nightmare he tried to back away from her but her arms long and bare and as white as the snow snaked out and pulled him to her i could see her cock her head and then thrust it forward booth tookey said hoarsely weve got to get out of here and so we ran ran like rats i suppose some would say but those who would werent there that night we fled back down along our own backtrail falling down getting up again slipping and sliding i kept looking back over my shoulder to see if that woman was coming after us grinning that grin and watching us with those red eyes we got back to the scout and tookey doubled over holding his chest tookey i said badly scared what ticker he said been bad for five years or more get me around in the shotgun seat booth and then get us the hell out of here i hooked an arm under his coat and dragged him around and somehow boosted him up and in he leaned his head back and shut his eyes his skin was waxylooking and yellow i went back around the hood of the truck at a trot and i damned near ran into the little girl she was just standing there beside the driversside door her hair in pigtails wearing nothing but a little bit of a yellow dress mister she said in a high clear voice as sweet as morning mist wont you help me find my mother shes gone and im so cold honey i said honey you better get in the truck your mothers i broke off and if there was ever a time in my life i was close to swooning that was the moment she was standing there you see but she was standing on top of the snow and there were no tracks not in any direction she looked up at me then lumleys daughter francie she was no more than seven years old and she was going to be seven for an eternity of nights her little face was a ghastly corpse white her eyes a red and silver that you could fall into and below her jaw i could see two small punctures like pinpricks their edges horribly mangled she held out her arms at me and smiled pick me up mister she said softly i want to give you a kiss then you can take me to my mommy i didnt want to but there was nothing i could do i was leaning forward my arms outstretched i could see her mouth opening i could see the little fangs inside the pink ring of her lips something slipped down her chin bright and silvery and with a dim distant faraway horror i realized she was drooling her small hands clasped themselves around my neck and i was thinking well maybe it wont be so bad not so bad maybe it wont be so awful after a whilewhen something black flew out of the scout and struck her on the chest there was a puff of strangesmelling smoke a flashing glow that was gone an instant later and then she was backing away hissing her face was twisted into a vulpine mask of rage hate and pain she turned sideways and then and then she was gone one moment she was there and the next there was a twisting knot of snow that looked a little bit like a human shape then the wind tattered it away across the fields booth tookey whispered be quick now and i was but not so quick that i didnt have time to pick up what he had thrown at that little girl from hell his mothers douay bible that was some time ago im a sight older now and i was no chicken then herb tooklander passed on two years ago he went peaceful in the night the bar is still there some man and his wife from waterville bought it nice people and theyve kept it pretty much the same but i dont go by much its different somehow with tookey gone things in the lot go on pretty much as they always have the sheriff found that fellow lumleys car the next day out of gas the battery dead neither tookey nor i said anything about it what would have been the point and every now and then a hitchhiker or a camper will disappear around there someplace up on schoolyard hill or out near the harmony hill cemetery theyll turn up the fellows packsack or a paperback book all swollen and bleached out by the rain or snow or some such but never the people i still have bad dreams about that stormy night we went out there not about the woman so much as the little girl and the way she smiled when she held her arms up so i could pick her up so she could give me a kiss but im an old man and the time comes soon when dreams are done you may have an occasion to be traveling in southern maine yourself one of these days pretty part of the countryside you may even stop by tookeys bar for a drink nice place they kept the name just the same so have your drink and then my advice to you is to keep right on moving north whatever you do dont go up that road to jerusalems lot especially not after dark theres a little girl somewhere out there and i think shes still waiting for her goodnight kiss for further reading compiled by ross e
