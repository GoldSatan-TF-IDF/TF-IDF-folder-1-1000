letters to ann borrow and other correspondents letter i to ann borrow spain postmark february th my dear mama as i am afraid that you may not have received my last letter in consequence of several couriers having been stopped i write to inform you that i am quite well i have been in some difficulties i was selling so many testaments that the priests became alarmed and prevailed on the government to put a stop to my selling any more they were likewise talking of prosecuting me as a witch but they have thought better of it i hear it is very cold in england pray take care of yourself i shall send you more in a few weeks god bless you my dear mama g b letter ii to a correspondent oulton lowestoft suffolk august th my dear sir many thanks for your interesting and kind letter in which you do me the honour to ask my opinion respecting the pedigree of your island goblin le feu follet belenger that opinion i cheerfully give with a promise that it is only an opinion in hunting for the etymons of these fairy names we can scarcely expect to arrive at any thing like certainty i suppose you are aware that the name of bilenger or billinger is of occasional though by no means frequentoccurrence both in england and france you have heard of billingsgate and of billingham the unfortunate assassin of poor percival likewise of billington all modifications of the same root belingart bilingshome or billingston but what is billinger clearly that which is connected some way or other with billing you will find ger or something like it in most european tonguesboulanger horologer talker walker baker brewer beggar in welsh it is of frequent occurrence in the shape of ur or gwrhinur an elder herwr a prowler in russian the ger gwr ur er appears in the shape of ik or ksapojgnik a shoemaker chinobuik a man possessed of rank the root of all these as well as of or in senator victor etc is the same as ker or kir which means lord master maker doer possessor of something or connected with something we want now to come at the meaning of beling or billing which probably means some action or some moral or personal attribute bolvile in anglosaxon means honest danish bollig wallen in german to wanken or move restlessly about baylan in spanish to dance connected with which are to whirl to fling and possibly walloon and fleming belenger therefore may mean a billiger or honest fellow or it may mean a walterger a whirlenger a flinger or something connected with restless motion allow me to draw your attention to the word will in the english word will of the wisp it must not be supposed that this will is the abbreviation of william it is pure danish vild pronounced will and signifies wild vilden visk vilden visk the wild or moving wisp i can adduce another instance of the corruption of the danish vild into will the rustics of this part of england are in the habit of saying they are led will vild or wild when from intoxication or some other cause they are bewildered at night and cannot find their way home this expression is clearly from the old norse or danish i am not at all certain that bil in bilinger may not be this same will or vild and that the word may not be a corruption of vilden old or elder wild or flying fire it has likewise occurred to me that bilinger may be derived from volundr the worship of the blacksmith or northern vulcan george borrow letter iii to mary borrow constantinople september th my darling carreta i am about to leave constantinople and to return home i have given up the idea of going to russia i find that if i go to odessa i shall have to remain in quarantine for fourteen days which i have no inclination to do i am moreover anxious to get home being quite tired of wandering and desirous of being

carreta i have got your letter and glad enough i was to get it the day after tomorrow i shall depart from here for fort augustus at some distance up the lake after staying a few days there i am thinking of going to the isle of mull but i will write to you if possible from fort augustus i am rather sorry that i came to scotlandi was never in such a place in my life for cheating and imposition and the farther north you go the worse things seem to be and yet i believe it is possible to live very cheaply here that is if you have a house of your own and a wife to go out and make bargains for things are abundant enough but if you move about you are at the mercy of innkeepers and suchlike people the other day i was swindled out of a shilling by a villain to whom i had given it for change i ought perhaps to have had him up before a magistrate provided i could have found one but i was in a wild place and he had a clan about him and if i had had him up i have no doubt i should have been outsworn i however have met one fine noble old fellow the other night i lost my way amongst horrible moors and wandered for miles and miles without seeing a soul at last i saw a light which came from the window of a rude hovel i tapped at the window and shouted and at last an old man came out he asked me what i wanted and i told him i had lost my way he asked me where i came from and where i wanted to go and on my telling him he said i had indeed lost my way for i had got out of it at least four miles and was going away from the place i wanted to get to he then said he would show me the way and went with me for several miles overmost horrible places at last we came to a road where he said he thought he might leave me and wished me goodnight i gave him a shilling he was very grateful and said after considering that as i had behaved so handsomely to him he would not leave me yet as he thought it possible i might yet lose my way he then went with me three miles farther and i have no doubt that but for him i should have lost my way again the roads were so tangled i never saw such an old fellow or one whose conversation was so odd and entertaining this happened last monday night the night of the day in which i had been swindled of the shilling by the other i could write a history about those two shillings george borrow letter xv to mrs macoubrey oulton lowestoft april st dear
