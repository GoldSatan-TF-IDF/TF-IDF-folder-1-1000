rat run gerald seymour prologue the life of malachy kitchen moved on and he neither knew in what direction nor cared he sat bolt upright in the passenger seat rigid the radio played a pirate station the drivers choice of music but the voice boomed in his ear and could not be escaped it was your shoes i reckoned them as a toffs shoes dont get the wrong idea im not a man who draws lines under people those that should get the bestest treatment what your shoes did they sort of interested me i get to see all sorts and some tickle me and some dont malachy had slept the last night in a dossers hostel behind the great canopy of waterloo station not well because of the coughing moaning and snoring in the dormitory home for that week had been the rows of dosepacked beds the smell of the disinfectant and the stink of the fried food in the canteen the stench of the bodies the sound of fights and yelled arguments each morning he and the others had been turned out on to the street after breakfast and the rest had shuffled off up the pavements towards the river he had sat on the steps between the pavement and the shut door and had waited all day for the scrape of the lock being turned the bolt drawn down and the creak of the hinges as the door swung open lighten up thats what im telling you i saw you found you and the shoes hit my eyes and i thought you were worth giving a lift up to i see derelicts vagrants addicts of alcohol and narcotics see them all the time and i have an opinion and i make a judgement a few times not often i get the feeling in my water that a man is worth a few hours of my day you want to know what gets worst up my nose well i shall take the liberty of telling you when i make the effort and the customer does not that sticks in my nose and it itches bad are you hearing me god man what does it take you to talk dont you understand when youre being helped did you fall that far before the hostel he had been at the cardboard city in the underpasses of the elephant and castle junction his own space had been a carton in which a twentyeightinch widescreen colour television had been packaged and another that had held a standup fridgefreezer he had begged during the day and drunk at night before sleeping wrapped in the blanket of a man who had not woken one morning had been dead when the first commuters had tripped past malachy had fallen that far he had queued for soup he had shied away from the young policemen who patrolled at night he had stayed clear of the junkies some days he had walked on the bridge beyond the station and had looked down into the muddy swirl of the river but had not had the courage to lever himself up on to the wall if he had and his thin fleshless fingers had not been able to take the weight it would have ended when i saw those shoes stuck out from under your blanket half covered over with the cardboard i said sure as god walks this earth ivanhoe manners this man can be given a hand up with me my friend you get one chance one chance alone you fuck that chance and you dont see me back plenty of others to spend my time on you live under the cardboard you beg and you drink and your future is an ambulance in the morning and a space left in an underpass you want that you can have it but the warden told me that since you went into the hostel there was no smell of drink on you but its still one chance with me one chance alone i cant do it for you what he possessed were the empty olivegreen rucksack which had been filled with old newspapers to make a pillow in the underpass the fibre dogtags that listed his name number religion and blood group the clothes on his back and the shoes they were all from time gone by yet he had clung to them the rucksack had the grime of the streets on it tears in the front pouches and two of the fastening buckles were broken the dogtags were from basic training always hidden by his fist when he was in the hostel showers because they were the proof of who and what he had been before the clothes almost unrecognizable now were those of a civilian who dressed well the trousers had rips at the knees and were coated with dirt and the jacket was frayed at the cuffs and elbows it was held across his chest with string his pullover had unravelled his shirt collar was part disintegrated his socks were holed at the toes and heels and were damp from last nights scrub in the hostels washhouse his shoes were brogues smart when his mother had bought them for him before he had gone away on the last posting before he had fallen when he had been dropped off at wherever this journey was taking him he thought that the grossly large west indian social worker would take a stiff brush a bucket of soapy water and an aerosol spray to the car to clean it the smell not commented on curled the mans nostrils if you dont care to communicate thats your problem see if i give a damn its in your hands whether you want to climb out of the shit or whether you want to drop back into it folk can feel sorry for themselves and reckon the worlds done them wrong or they can pick themselves up doesnt mean im confident about you satisfaction in my job doesnt come frequent but i just dont know whether youre crap useless or not the car edged out of the traffic flow into a tight gap and parked he knew the road and had begged in it the driver hoisted his rucksack and walked across the pavement malachy followed him into the charity shop he stood inside the door nervous and clutching his hands together he was ignored except when estimates were made of his chest size waist measurement and inner leg he was not asked what he wanted and the banter between the staff and the social worker did not include him the clothes were from house clearances or from the dead they were chosen for warmth because autumn was closing in and the air carried a spit of rain two pairs of trousers three shirts underclothes socks a brownflecked overcoat that a stooping old man might have worn an anorak a sports jacket and a pair of bulging trainers were piled on the counter paid for then forced into the mouth of the rucksack they stopped at a supermarket milk bread margarine a jar of coffee a packet of teabags and a pile of chilled meals for one person were dropped into the basket he had nothing to decide the food was chosen for him and the dusters the toothpaste the disposable razor blades and the shoe polish he was driven on he saw the wide smile the flash of the teeth oh dont thank me dont bother to dont think of thanking me because you dont know yet where im taking you theres a cop i know at walworth road who says where im taking you its best not to go there unless youre inside a battle tank its what he says behind them was the street market that he was told was a den for pickpockets and the little corner shop that had been robbed twelve times in the last twentyfour months and then the estate loomed welcome to the amersham the contract architect came back five years after it was finished walked round and saw what he had created then he drove home and topped himself thats what they say welcome to the amersham estate a concrete edifice his guide remarked that was home to eleven thousand souls and now him towered through the windscreen on which the wipers worked hard he could have asked his driver to stop could have pushed himself up out of the car taken the rucksack and emptied it out on to the back seat could have walked away into the thickening rain they came into the forest of the blocks from which high walkways branched on the begging pitches in the underpass and the dormitory of the hostel there had been a clinging sense of camaraderie and he knew that if he came on to the estate he would be without that comfort little clusters of youths watched an old woman hurried past them as they left the car in front of the entrance to the bunker that was the housing allocation office a man as sparse built as a scarecrow gazed at them and dragged on a needlethin cigarette a woman screamed at a clutch of children they went inside the bunker and he was told it had once been a carparking area but was given up by residents as unsafe from vehicle thieves and vandals walls had been put in the conversion made to office space he thought of the command and control posts he had known long ago barricaded and reinforced against incoming hostiles and dark and there was the gleam of light from computer screens he was led to a desk he could not hear what the social worker said to the housingallocation officer then her voice rapped at him what was his name malachy david kitchen date of birth twentyfifth of may occupation he hesitated then spat it none had he never had an occupation he clamped his lips what was the name and address of his next of kin he paused then shook his head and saw the grim smile of the housingallocation officer and knew she thought him one more wretch running from the world social security or national insurance numbers he shrugged he was given two keys and barely heard the trilled and good luck to you mr kitchen they went up the staircase of block nine because the lift had an outoforder sign slung across the door and tramped to level three he stepped over discarded syringes and scorched concrete where fires had been lit he kept his eyes down so that he saw the least in the low light of the afternoon on level three the rain cut over the wall and splattered on his face but he did not feel it the majority of the entrances two out of three had closed grille gates on the entrances as if it were valuable to have the further protection of the barricades the plastic numbers of flat thirteen were askew on the door he waited for it to be opened but was told it was his his place and he could goddamn do it himself he went into the onebedroom unit his home his refuge for a moment like sun on his face he felt the relief as if through the door he would be safe from the sneers and the jibes the fraudulent compassion there was a living room a bathroom a bedroom and a kitchen and a door that could be closed against the world his rucksack and the plastic bags from the supermarket were on the floor well thats it thats what you get from ivanhoe manners something or nothing depends on your opinion i say it again its your choice you can blow it or you can make it work if i hadnt seen you then you were dead finished a heap of rubbish but i did see you and knew you were worth helping and i saw your shoes and i needed the bed at the hostel there was no handshake he was given a brown envelope felt the coins and the folded banknotes in it and was told it would tide him over until he was back in the system ivanhoe manners was gone out through the door didnt bother to close it behind him he looked around the room seemed to see nothing but the bulk of the big west indian striding away down level three and the tears ran down his face the voice ripped into him just a few words friend so we get off to the right start and understand each other heh im speaking to you behind him by the door to flat fourteen was a short pudgy man midforties in a tight suit shirt collar straining round a reddened neck and a tie that had slipped he swiped away the tears and blinked to clear them half hidden masked by the shoulder he saw a sparrow of a woman seventy at least might have been older when i talk to you you damn well listen listening thats good this is my aunt mildred johnson mrs johnson to you anyone who lives alongside her i find out who they are if i dont like what i learn then youre out on your neck you look after that lady if you dont you mess with her ill break your fucking back thats pretty simple isnt it im a good friend but a lousy enemy watch out for her he stared back at the man and saw the veins swell in the neck ill see you millie you take care he watched the man stamp away long after hed gone and the grille gate had been locked he stood at the edge of the level three balcony he heard the tv start up in flat fourteen the mist sat over the flat roofs of the towers and darkened the concrete he rubbed hard at the stubble on his cheeks the light was failing and he saw below him the way that people hurried to be back inside their homes before the dusk closed on them and the groups of kids grew in size he sensed the fear around him slinking towards the youths were the shadows of vagrants dressed like him dressed rough another hour he stood there and he heard the first of the joyriders cars and saw the first trading done in fast furtive contacts and the first fire lit in a stairwell across the plaza and a key turned her voice was brisk and reedsharp youll catch your death out there do you have a name im malachy hes all bark and no bite my nephew dont worry about him hes police do you drink tea malachy thank you always like a cup of tea it was brought to him a mug with painted flowers and a chip at the rim was passed through the grille gate then the door was locked again he cradled the mug and the heat from it seeped into his hands later a woman screamed and the noise was like a rabbit with a cat at its throat and echoed between the blocks it frightened him unsettled him and he swallowed the last of the tea put the mug down behind her grille gate and went inside flat thirteen his place locked the door and pushed up the bolt that night he slept on the floor dressed hungry his shoes still laced on his feet he did not know where his journey took him or care he had fallen so far the sleep was deep from exhaustion and his mind was black blank and he did not dream small mercy of whom he had been and where he had once walked and what had been said of him on the worn stained carpet that was pocked with cigarette burns he slept away the night and he did not know of the road that now stretched in front of him chapter one malachy kitchen lived behind the locked and bolted door the autumn days had come and gone from the amersham the winter weeks had visited the estate freezing the rainwater pools on the level three walkway with chilled winds funnelled up the stairs and round the flaking concrete corners of the blocks spring beckoned and in the windowboxes of a few groundfloor units daffodils bloomed and where there had once been gardens now used as shortcut paths there were a few battered crocuses the seasons had changed but the torment in his mind had not calmed for all the hours days weeks and months he could malachy stayed inside the cell that was flat thirteen on level three in block nine the doctors from his past and the psychiatrist had had trite names for his condition and explanations they had not allayed his feeling of disgust for himself and the shame that had come with his actions all a long way back inside the flat behind the locked door and with the bolt pushed home he felt secure everything that had gone before childhood in married quarters boardingschool the teenage home in a devon village the inevitability of following his fathers career was erased from his thoughts in waking hours but came stabbing at him during the night so that he would wake and find the perspiration dripping from him and not know whether in the last moments of sleep he had screamed at the darkened walls he existed through the autumn his salvation had been the heavy thudded knock of the big west indians fist on his door less often in the winter now he never came as if ivanhoe mannerss life had gone on as if he had found new destitutes to throw his time at through manners he had learned of the estates pulsebeat he could stand now at the back window of the unit and look down on the square below where the kids playground apparatus was broken where the grass was worn away where many windows had plywood hammered over them where graffiti were spraypainted on the walls and watch the rule of the youth gangs some days he would unlock the door draw down the bolt and go out on to the walkway to stare across the estates inner roads but only when he knew the door behind him was open and there for fast retreat the key in the door for turning in the early days of life on the amersham manners had come thrown the charityshop overcoat at him and made him walk had bullied him as if that were the therapy he required so malachy knew where the crackhouses were on the estate groundfloor units with heavy bars on the windows and steel plates on the inside of the doors where rocks of cocaine were sold and consumed fortresses man they seem to know when the police are coming and can spot the surveillance they have a nose for the raid thats on its way and nothings ever found he knew where the vagrants lived in which disused garages they slept he recognized some from the pitches where they begged in the underpass at the elephant and castle youll know this yourself malachy youre in the underpass and well say that four hundred people pass you in an hour four thousand in a tenhour begging shift and fifty people drop a pound coin in your cap in the ten hours and think its for dog food or for your cup of tea fifty pounds in a day thats good work and good people have massaged their consciences as they hurry by and youll know that dossers empty the cap so often because its bad for trade if people see whats actually given them its all for drugs and the dog goes hungry ivanhoe manners had walked him round the worst dark corners of the estate where he was safe only because he had the massive prizefighter build of the social worker with him where the ceiling lights of the inner tunnels were smashed where the onetime shopping arcades were wrecked scorched where the vagrants hunted they need wraps of brown they have to jack up at least every twentyfour hours you know that youve seen it when you were under the cardboard theyre scum when theyre on heroin the brown destroys them theyll steal from their only friend to get the hit think nothing of stealing from family they inject and they chuck the syringes away even when theres a councilprovided needle exchange and kids find them they got hepatitis a or b or c they got tuberculosis theyre going to get thrombosis they thieve anything they can sell on but best is a purse or a wallet the cops all wear stabproof vests because a used needle is a weapon for the vagrants they are dangerous and dont ever forget it and you go carefully when its dark on the amersham back in the autumn ivanhoe manners had walked him by the shoeboxshaped flatroofed public toilets they had to close them the council did a pensioner male goes inside and a girl follows him shes offering a blow for fifty pence hes in the cubicle panting gasping shes doing it what else is she doing doesnt need her hands for a blow her hands are on his wallet inside his coat shes got it shes off and running and his trousers and his pants are down round his ankles hes too embarrassed poor sod to come charging out and chase her if he could the council closed the toilets and after theyd done their walking ivanhoe manners would come back with him to flat thirteen on level three and theyd use the chess set that the social worker had given him and with the chess games came the monologues that malachy seldom interrupted this is where the real war is a war worth fighting i never been to afghanistan and im not going to iraq but they dont seem to me as places that matter not to me maybe just possible we can win a war in afghanistan or in iraq but sure as hell were losing the war at our doorstep you go up to the top of block nine and look all around you from that roof youll see wealth and power and parliament youll see where all the big people make their money youll see the city banks and insurance youll see the ministries fat cats running your life but if you look down by your feet youll see where the war is the amersham is a dump ground for dysfunctionals you shouldnt be here malachy no you shouldnt it was seven weeks now since ivanhoe manners had last called by days slipped away in which malachy went nowhere spoke to no one what drove him from flat thirteen most often was that the fridge was empty no bread no milk no coffee no meals for one but every fourteen days regular the first and third thursday of each month he was invited next door for tea that thursday morning malachy kitchen dressed in the best of the clothes bought for him at the charity shop seven months earlier kicked off the trainers and wiped the brogues with a cloth so that their old brightness returned he would while away the hours lost in thoughts and pitying himself till he heard the faint knock on the common wall he had little else to live for he washed himself in the shower pipinghot water cascaded down on him ricky capel always had the lever turned high in the hot sector when he sluiced his body always washed well and the suds of liquid soap rolled from his face and chest and down his groin his short dark hair plastered his scalp joanne never had the shower water turned that high it scalded his skin reddened it but he had no fear of pain each time he took a shower it was as if he needed to test his ability to withstand pain that morning he had seen pain another mans and it mattered little to him above the showers hiss he heard joannes shout when was he going to be ready he did not answer he would be ready when he cared to be ready the overalls he had worn that morning and daveys had gone into the petrol drum at the back of the warehouse where the fire was lit so that no trace of his visit to the cavernous derelict unit remained but he always washed afterwards and so thoroughly because he knew of the skills of the forensic experts with a towel loose round him and water dripping down he stood in front of the fulllength mirror beside the cubicle he glowed and that brought a smirk to his rounded childlike face no one not any of them in his circle would have dared to suggest it was a babys face but it was untouched by lines of worry anxiety stress selfrespect was everything to ricky capel and respect was what he demanded he had burned his overalls because a man had denied him respect the man who had made that mistake was now on the road south of the capital and heading for the coast he was thirtyfour years old though his complexion put him younger he had married joanne in and had the one child wayne one of the few decisions he had allowed her was to give him that name the boy was now seven and an overfed lump without his fathers sleek stomach line the man whod denied him respect was the eighth to have died under the supervision of ricky capel at that young age he controlled an area of the capital running from bermondsey and woolwich in the north eltham in the east catford in the south and lambeth in the west inside that box he had authority over all matters of business he chased after but on benjis advice he had gone into the city of london at the start of the year across the river big money was to be made from the kids who worked in front of the banks computers who traded the high numbers and who snorted white to keep themselves alive alert and awake the man who was now bumping in the back of a van and going south towards the cliffs had done the trade in the city had taken the white and had pleaded a cashflow crisis he had promised that last week an outstanding payment would be made the promise was not kept cocaine to a street value of five hundred and sixty thousand pounds had been given over on trust and had not been paid for that was a denial of respect for ricky capel go soft on one and word would spread like the smell of old shit every last trace of the warehouse was gone by the time he was dressed and little memory of it remained in his mind the man had been blindfolded when he was brought to the warehouse still in his pyjamas and hed been alternately blustering protests at this fucking liberty and whimpering certainties of finding what was owed by that night on my mums life i swear it too late friend too bloody late the bluster and the whimper had gone on right through the moments that the man had been tied down on to a chair with wide sheets of plastic under it right boys get on with it ricky had said he neednt have spoken neednt have declared he was there and lounging against a rusted pillar need not have identified his presence he had spoken so that the man would know who had had him brought to the warehouse and his voice would have been recognized in those seconds the man would have realized he was condemned suddenly there was a stain on the pyjamas and the stink of him because he knew he was dead rickys life was all about sending messages it would go clear through the rumour mill that a big boss had been cheated and the message of the penalty for that would run crystal sharp to others who did business with him the merks that was what benji called the guys with the pickaxe handles they were small muscled swarthy had the faces of gypsies and were hard little bastards theyd brought cheap sports bags with them so that afterwards theyd have clean clothes to change into they wore plastic gloves like a butcher would use and stockings over their faces so that the drops of blood couldnt mark them the man had kicked with his tied feet and the chair had toppled hed tried to heave himself away frantic his bare feet slithering on the plastic sheets and then hed screamed the first blow from a pickaxe handle had battered across his lower face blood and teeth had spewed out the blows broke his legs arms and ribs then fractured his skull he was hit until he died and then some more afterwards while ricky watched the mans body trussed up in the plastic sheeting davey lit the fire for the clothing charlie checked the floor went down on his hands and knees to be certain that nothing remained ricky capel liked to keep business inside the family he had three cousins davey was the enforcer and did security benji did thinking and what he liked to call strategy and charlie had the books the organized mind and knew how to move money hed have trusted each of them with his life the merks were no problem good as gold reliable as the watch on rickys wrist charlie drove him back from the warehouse to bevin close and dropped him off for his shower it had all gone well and he would not be late lor lunch he put on a clean white shirt well ironed by joanne and a sober lie it was right to dress smart for a birthday celebration while he dressed and selected wellpolished shoes the body was in a plain white van driven by davey who had benji with him theyd get near to the coast park up till it was dark then drive on to beachy head from the cliffs there which fell feet to the seashore they would tip the body over the tide benji had said would carry it out to sea but in a couple of days or a week the plasticwrapped bundle would be washed up on the rocks as intended the police would be called statements made and then the rumours would eddy round the pubs and clubs that a man who supplied cocaine in the city had been mercilessly brutally viciously put to death it would be assumed he had failed to make a payment and that this was retribution the name of ricky capel might figure in the rumours loud enough to make certain that no other bastard was late with payments scented with talc and aftershave ricky led joanne and wayne who carried the present next door to celebrate his grandfathers birthday the eightysecond bevin close was where he had spent his whole life in early a v flying bomb had destroyed the lower end of a lewisham street between loampit vale and ladywell road after the war the gap had been filled with a culdesac of councilbuilt houses grandfather percy lived with his son and daughterinlaw mikey and sharon in number eight while ricky joanne and wayne were next door in number nine eighteen years back mikey had bought his council house freehold and been able after a choice days work with a wages delivery truck to buy the property alongside it ricky liked bevin close he could have bought the whole culdesac or a penthouse overlooking the river or a bloody manor house down in kent but bevin close suited him only what ricky called the fucking idiots went for penthouses and manor houses everything about him was discreet rumour would spread but rumour was not evidence he breezed in next door wayne ran past him with grandfather percys present he called happy birthday granddad how you doing dad hi mum what we got the voice came from the kitchen your favourite what else lamb and three veg and then the lemon gateau oh harrys missus rang he cant make it expect hes out pulling cod up what a way to earn a living poor old harry he would never let on to his mum sharon that her brother was important to him uncle harry was integral to his network of power and wealth they were making good time more than eight knots against them was a gathering southwesterly but they would be in an hour after dusk and before the swell came up march always brought unpredictable weather and poor fishing but on board the annaliese royal was a good catch as good as it ever was harry rogers was in the wheelhouse of the beam trawler and about as far from his mind as it could get wiped to extinction was the thought that he had missed the birthday lunch of his sisters fatherinlaw the family that sharon had married into was in his opinion and he would never have said it to her a snakes nest but they owned him ricky capel had him by the balls any moment he wanted ricky capel could squeeze and twist and harry would dance ahead the cloud line settled on a darker seam the division between sky and sea the deeper grey strip was the norfolk coast and the town of lowestoft where the ness marked britains most easterly point in the north sea the annaliese royal was listed as coming from dartmouth on the south devon coast but she worked the north sea she could have fished in the western approaches of the channel or in the irish sea or around rockall off ulsters coast and had the navigation equipment to go up off scandinavia or towards scotlands waters or the faroe islands but the catches for which he was a prisoner were in the north off the german port of cuxhaven and the island of helgoland he had no choice he had been a freelance skipper sometimes out of brixham more often out of penzance in truth out of anywhere that he could find a desperate owner with a mortgage on a boat and a regular skipper laid low with illness he would work a deepsea trawler heading for the atlantic a beam trawler in the north sea even a crabber off the south devon coast the sea was in his mind body and heritage but it was damn hard to get employment from it then had come the offer hed talked often to sharon on the phone kept in touch even when she had married into that family and had stayed in contact when the husband mikey was away she always called his time three years five a maximum of eight away didnt seem able to say down the telephone that her man had been sent to gaol it was the summer of and if there had been work on a construction site in plymouth and his boy billy worked on one installing centralheating systems then he would have chucked in the sea as a life closed it down as a profession and learned to be a labourer hed poured it out to sharon in an hour on the phone he had told her more about the dark moods than he would have spoken of to his own annie and also that the dream of his retirement was wrecked got it off his chest like a man had to and could do best on a telephone two days later his phone had rung he couldnt have said back then that he knew much of sharons son ricky what little he did know made bad listening now the girls were grand and theyd gone as soon as they were old enough to quit but what he knew of ricky was poison ricky on the phone all sweetness i think i might be able to help you uncle harry always best to keep money in the family ive been lucky with business and id like to share that luck what i understand from mum is that youre short of a boat ive this cousin charlie you probably dont know him because hes dads side of the family well charlie did some work on it would it be a beam trawler you need theres one for sale in jersey doesnt seem a bad price a hundred and fifty tons eight years old and theyre looking for a cash sale i think we can do that for you dont go worrying about the finance just get yourself over there next week and meet up with charlie that going to be all right uncle harry charlie had called him and theyd arranged to fly to the channel islands at the boat was dirt cheap and when hed met charlie at the airport the cousin had been lugging a suitcase and he didnt need that many clothes for a twentyfourhour stopover hed named her with annies input and her blushes the anneliese royal and she was best quality from a renowned dutch yard his dream of life after retirement was reborn billy his boy came off the building sites and with his knowledge of centralheating systems was able to learn the engineering his grandson paul left school and had started eighteen months back to sail with them he had a year of happiness and dumb innocence then hello uncle harry its ricky here id like to come down and see your boat when do you suggest like tomorrow one sailing in three he would receive a short coded note where when a gps number and the port he was to return to with the catch sometimes he had a hold full of plaice and sole to bring ashore and sometimes the hold was bloody near empty the big catch from one sailing in three was off the north german coast hed be guided on to a buoy by a gps reference and attached to the buoys anchoring chain the package would be wrapped in tight oilskin this one which he was now bringing towards the fishing harbour of lowestoft had weighed real heavy billy and he had struggled to drag it up over the gunwale on the port side he reckoned it twentyfive kilos in weight harry read the papers and could do sums at street value hed read that heroin sold at sixty thousand pounds a kilo arithmetic told him that down below stashed in the fish hold he had a package valued at million give or take he was brought his mug of tea and snapped at his grandson who fled below always a foul temper when they came into port because that was where hed see the police wagon or the customs landrover parked and waiting they used five of the north sea ports varied it never regular enough for the law and the harbour masters to know too much about them never infrequent enough for them to stand out and attract suspicion in two years he would retire he had ricky capels promise and then he could live his dream but not yet he didnt talk about it to billy just gave him his cut and turned away he thought he might be destroying the life of paul his grandson but there had never been a right time to jump off the treadmill in the middle afternoon as the wind force grew the shoreline came clearer billy would have finished gutting would be breaking up the package and dividing it between rubbish sacks and their own kitbags they would take it onshore then in his car he would reassemble the twentyfive kilos and drive it alone to the dropoff point afterwards harry would take himself to the long bar in town drink till he staggered off to the bandb where he had a frontdoor key by midnight rickys cousin would have done the collection and harry would be snoring drunk and asleep he was ashamed that he had shouted at his grandson but the tension was always bad when they were within sight of shore and had a package on board the trail started in the foothills of northern afghanistan far into remote mountains in little irrigated fields farmers grew the poppies and were the first to take the cut it was subsistence farming and without the poppy crop they would have starved for the farmers the recent americanled invasion of their country had been a gift from god their previous rulers had reduced on pain of death the growing and harvesting of the poppies but now no government writ reached them it was a slowmoving trail eighteen months from start to end at first the journey took the poppy seeds to market for haggling and argument then buying as opium the product travelled in caravans of lorries camel trains or in pouches on mules north out of afghanistan it reached the old spice route half a millennium old and in dushanbe samarkand or bokhara customs men warlords and politicians took more cuts the price was beginning to ratchet then on to turkey the nexus point of the trade where the laboratories waited to render opium into raw heroin ten kilograms of opium made one kilogram of heroin more cuts more profits to be taken from the farmers labour turkey was only a staging point not a place of consumption europe was the target each year the craving for and addiction of europeans to heroin demanded a supply of an estimated eighty tonnes turkish gangs took it on across the bosphorus or by ferry over the black sea and a landing in mainland europe up into the warravaged balkans and more division of the product made in belgrade or sarajevo and the price kept climbing as more men took their share of the profits when wads of dollar bills were passed the lorries drove unsearched through international boundaries on into the netherlands and germany the trail led to the united kingdom the biggest consumer of heroin inside the european union expenses soared wealth was being made that the humble illiterate farmer in afghanistan could not comprehend but the men bringing the trail to its end had made evaluations of risk against profit the risk was a prison sentence of twentyfive years in a maximumsecurity gaol but the profit was huge only a few had the skill to stay ahead of the ever more sophisticated techniques of law enforcement set against them by ferry tunnel car or coach in the bags of pensioner tourists who saw no wrong in making easy money inside the cargoes of lorries and by boat to unsuspected landing points where vigilance had slipped the freight landed a man had paid up and housed what he had bought in a warehouse or a lockup garage he was a baron and remote from the process of the street he sold split portions of what he had purchased to a network of regular suppliers he was handsoff crucial to the process but distancing himself as far as he could from risk while retaining as much as he could of the profit the supplier further diluted the purity of the heroin with flour chalk or washing powder made more divisions and traded with dealers the street gangs who controlled a small area of territory in a country town a provincial city or in the capital the supplier took his share the dealers sold on the street but only after further dilution they were the last in line and their cash rewards were as meagre as those of the mountain farmers the dealers had the addicts begging them for wraps tonnage reduced down to a single gram enough for a days hit no cash no sale without money the addict was shut out as a customer thieving begging mugging stealing were the only ways the addict could feed the need on a housing estate in southeast london the trail marked out for one little share of afghanistans poppy harvest came to an end malachy knew her life story and more he had been led into each cranny of her existence he sat opposite mrs mildred johnson and drank tea poured through a strainer that caught most of the leaves a present from a distant relative on her wedding day he ate ham and cucumber sandwiches her late husbands favourite filling for his lunch when hed driven a doubledecker bus in london not expected to talk only to listen he occasionally nodded and tried to be attentive he knew her life story because the same mixture of anecdote and memory was served up each fortnight but he never showed signs of boredom or irritation at the repetition he would be there for two hours she had a small carriage clock with a tinkling chime a present from her nephew tony and at four oclock on the first and third thursday in the month the knock would come on the wall and at six oclock without ceremony and always the refusal that he should wash up the cups saucers and plates when the hour was struck he would be told that it was time for her to dress to go out to bingo he was then dismissed he knew she was seventyfour she had been widowed twelve years back after thirtynine years of marriage her husband phil had left no money and she survived on the states meagre generosity her elder brother graham and her sisterinlaw hettie were dead her only living relative was her nephew graham and hetties son tony something important in the police and shed snort he thought she must spend the first three hours of each day scrubbing cleaning dusting her onebedroomed flat it was spotless if a crumb from a sandwich fell from his mouth malachy was always careful immediately to pick it off his trousers so that it should not fall to the carpet her first married home when she was a schooldinner lady had been in a terrace that had been demolished to make way for the amersham she phil and the budgerigar had moved into the first block to be completed thirtytwo years ago after his death she had been transferred to block nine level three flat fourteen however bad it became she said each fortnight she was not leaving the amersham she had stayed on refusing to cut and run while all her friends and longtime neighbours had either died or left the nephew tony and she did a good imitation of the whip of his voice had alternately nagged and pleaded with her to quit even to come and live with his family she had refused she liked to tell that story tony had paid for the grille gate three hundred pounds even though the fire people at the council had warned that a locked grille gate made a potential deathtrap for the elderly she was staying on to entertain malachy to tea and he reckoned it one of the reasons he was asked on those two thursdays a month she wore every item of jewellery she possessed her fingers were ablaze with rings her wrists with bracelets her throat with chains and a christian cross and he thought that if she had been able to plug into the lobes more than a single pair of earrings she would have he assumed they were kept in a box under her bed for just these occasions she would not have worn them outside because she was streetwise she had told him she never took money with her that she did not need to spend when she went to the outdoor market stalls she only went to the bingo on a thursday night with dawn from flat fifteen she read the weekly paper and sometimes over tea with malachy she would recite the reporting on the most violent crime on the amersham he had been listening again to the story of the last coach outing of the pensioners association to brighton four months ago when she changed her tack abruptly you want to know what tony says you are i dont think its important he shrugged but he could feel the cold at his back and his hand shook the last tepid tea slopped on to his lap tony says youre a loser hes cruel tony is what tony says is that youre a loser malachy and a failure i expect in his job he has to make evaluations probably the right judgement most of the time malachy said quietly simply he had not spoken to tony the nephew since the first day he had kept his distance had stayed behind his locked door what happened in your life to bring you down here must have been something awful you dont belong with us something awful worse an earthquake she seemed to struggle for the words and the abrasive independence that was her hallmark wavered tony says youre a waste of space and im not to spend time with you was it something i couldnt understand like a catastrophe he said its nobodys business but mine i the clock chimed he did not wait for the final stroke of six he was up out of his chair and scurrying for the door he didnt thank her for the tea or the sandwiches he thought he would be dissected with dawn that evening at the bingo and when the next knock came on the common wall on a thursday he would ignore it he closed her front door behind him fastened the gate and ran next door to his own refuge with the lock turned the chain across and the bolt up he sat on the floor and the darkness blanketed him he did not know that outside on the walkways and in the alleys shadows gathered and searched for the price of a wrap of brown to feed a needle i cant come millie i got the flu pain where i didnt know pain was im sorry dawn was tall would once have been beautiful she had the ebony skin of wet coal was from nigeria and cleaned whitehall offices perhaps her generosity was used or perhaps mildred johnson truly regarded her as a friend but never as an equal her one son was in the merchant marine a deckhand for a panamanianregistered company and he never came home dawn minded her neighbour and was occasionally thanked for it she was in her dressing gown i tell you just to come from my bed get myself to the door and your door that was agony i mean it they went to the tenants association evenings and on the pensioners association outings and sat beside each other at the senior citizens christmas lunch they were together on shopping trips and at the east street stall market she was with millie on one sunday a month when they went on the bus to the cemetery where phils ashes were buried together once a week at the cypriot cafe they splashed out on pie and chips and milky tea dawn was always there if millie was ill and cared for her she had been told that everything in the box under millies bed was left in the will to her not the nephews stuckup woman she saw annoyance spread on the slight face below her own well thats it then dawn croaked im sorry millie but im really sick im going back to bed i cant help it i didnt say you could get the man him dawn gestured feebly to the next door on the level three walkway get him to walk you or dont go the door was closed on her and the grille gate she staggered back into flat fifteen slumped back on to her bed and the pains surged january the sign on the lightweight door said knock then wait to be admitted but every room in battalion headquarters was part of the fiefdom of fergal as adjutant he had free run he pushed open the door there was no electricity from the main supply that day because bad guys had dropped a pylon and the standby generators were barely able to match hqs requirements no airconditioning was permitted and the wall of heat hit him inside he could detect the scent used sparingly by the sergeant pretty little plump cherie and stronger the body smell of the new man morning cherie and morning to you mal hows things in spooksville fergal had a drawl to his voice knew it made him sound as if he was perpetually taking the piss and didnt care because an adjutant cared damn all for anything other than the welfare of his colonel codeword sunray not too bombarded i hope with this gfhs problems sorry mai i was forgetting you were new with us gfh god forsaken hole he leered at the sergeant in the officers mess there was a sweepstake on when she would first get herself shagged it was held by a lieutenant who ran the battalions transport and hed decreed that her probably outsize knickers as a minimum would be required as proof the prize now stood at thirtynine pounds sterling the way she looked with the glow on her cheeks and the sweat stains on her tunic blouse fergal didnt think it would be long before there was a claimant a girl always looked good with a damn great browning mm hanging in a holster on her hips but his business was with the captain her companion who was not that new had been with them for four months yes mai sunray would like you up at bravo if you didnt know it ive actually a fair bit to be getting on with right here are you not hearing me too well he heard cheries snigger i said that sunray wanted you up at bravo its not for discussion its what hed like the battalion in which fergal was adjutant recruited other ranks from the tenements of glasgow and the housing estates of cumbernauld the fathers or uncles of many had served two decades earlier the officers those with good prospects of advancement came from the landed estates of the west highlands they were a family a brotherhood the feeling of being part of a clan with a regimental history of skirmishes bloody defences heroic advances and battles stretched back for three centuries their museum was packed with trophies from the campaigns of marlborough the epic of waterloo colonial garrisoning the foothills between jalalabad and peshawar on the north west frontier the kops of south africa the fields of passchendaele and the hedgerows of normandy then palestine malaya kenya the aden protectorate and endless dreary little towns in northern ireland soon when the booty had been crated up museum space would have to be found for souvenirs of the iraqi desert the battalion had heritage and tradition and its family strength recognized the danger of allowing strangers to infiltrate its ranks outsiders were not wanted if youre not too busy mal the sneer was rich in fergals voice sunray would like you up at bravo tomorrow alongside the battalions headquarters building separated by its sandbag blast walls and its coils of razor wire was the portakabin occupied by the intelligence corps personnel assigned to them the sergeant cherie and the captain mai as he was called in the mess put bluntly and it was fergals right as adjutant to be direct the intelligence corps captain was a cuckoo he didnt fit was not part of the family or a member of the brotherhood the battalion had its own intelligence officer rory a good man they did not need the stranger who knew nothing of the history tradition heritage that would see them through if god was kind the sixmonth posting to iraq the man didnt mix well didnt share their culture weve a resupply convoy going up at ohsix hundred hours local tomorrow you can go with them what have you got on your plate at the moment the answer was crisply put as if the captain mal accepted the unconcealed hostility shown to an intruder there was a rattle of information on pipeline sabotage clusters of incidents where the crudeoil supply from the wells was disrupted on routes through the battalions area of responsibility profiles of suspected bad guys and the man never looked up from his screen as he spoke what does that add up to that we dont have the resources to guard the pipes that they can be blown up virtually at will that the oil supply is persistently vulnerable that were charging around and getting nowhere i have to have more time because i havent yet sorted a pattern of attacks whos doing it identities safehouses whether theyre iraqis or from over the iran border i dont know thats whats on my plate my opinion at the moment were wasting our time two nights before in sunrays office the same statement had been made and not appreciated after the captain mai had gone sunray had told his adjutant i wont have that defeatist crap christ im under enough pressure from brigade on these damn pipes i want answers from him not just excuses for ignorance arent answers what we have the right to expect from the intelligence corps if he cant do better then perhaps we should get him doing something useful away from that wretched little screen work on it fergal he had something useful was at bravo company eighty miles up the road and sunray had concurred what the battalion could do without when brigade was breathing hard on them was to be told they were wasting their time it was probably true but it shouldnt have been said by an interloper up at bravo an elder was murdered driveby shooting i know he was a good friend of ours and shot because he was a good friend we like to peddle this heartsandminds stuff delude ourselves the majority love us and are grateful for liberation that the opposition is only a minority and mostly from over the border he was killed because of his association with us thats a death sentence icily if you dont mind allowing me to finish mal thank you were going to show the flag up there have an arrest sweep we have to react youre a locallanguage speaker so youll do the initial screening and interrogation see who should be passed down the line be happy to if your jocks havent beaten them all half insensible that is fucking outrageous an insult please yourself the adjutant was at the door he knew the answer to what hed say knew what training the intelligence corps people had pretty little plump cherie couldnt hit a main battle tank at twentyfive yards with her browning mm and the quartermaster who took her on shooting practice wedged his knee between her thighs to keep her steady and held her arms out rigid but she still missed the biggest target they could knock up he put the question youre trained on combat weapons and patrol procedures you should be if youre going up to buffalo bill territory bravos ground of course you are he knew she was not back yet and it made him fidget malachy was aware of all of the night sounds of the amersham every noise from the plaza at the back he should first have heard the clatter of dawns flat shoes and the shuffle of mildred johnsons feet then the screech of the grille gate the front door opening and shutting the blast of the tv through the common wall she had disrupted what little peace he owned he could not have told her how much he appreciated the two sessions a month of tea and sandwiches and listening to her talk and now he sensed the relationship was broken past repair he still sat on the floor wrapped by the darkness that was barely reached by the plazas lights her prying had brought back the pain of memory not to be escaped from he could see it a child lost in his imagination succouring fantasies playing solitary games around the married quarters at tidworth catterick larkhall or colchester father was the northern ireland expert and always there mother a deserter from a nursing career fulltime unpaid organizer of other ranks wives clubs and counsellor of teenage brides on creditcard debt and trying to keep together a hopeless partnership walter and araminta kitchen had been too consumed with the job and the good deeds to notice that their lone child was isolated he remembered coming into the kitchen with homework arithmetic that he couldnt do unaware that his father had learned that afternoon he was not sailing with the task force to the south atlantic and getting a volley of abuse over a gin glass for thinking homework counted in the scale of things and running sent to boardingschool in somerset short visits from his mother and an aloof one from his father to see the school play worst day ever at school was his fathers visit a year after his retirement as brigadier with full dress and medals to inspect the combined cadet force not an unhappy childhood compared to what some at the school put up with but remote from love of course he would join the army his small act of rebellion and it had taken bottle was to decide himself when and where and then the pucefaced spluttering reaction of his father when he announced that hed enlisted that afternoon and been passed through by a birmingham recruitment office to be a private soldier and bottom of the heap silly little bugger walter had called him and araminta had said quietly to her husband not to worry darling it never lasts when middleclass boys go slumming it all the sounds that evening of the estate had wafted up to his room music and screams the wail of the sirens then the intermittent flashes of blue emergency lights the memories came round as if in a loop as they always did he was in childhood father away and mother out too awake to sleep no escape possible he heard the stampede of feet the thud of them then the hammering on his door malachy felt the fear catch his body he crawled away across the floor towards the far wall the beating on the door was ever more insistent and there was the cry of dawns voice it came in a torrent when he finally opened the door if he had interrupted it would not have halted her she was in her night clothes no slippers on her feet incoherent and with tears welling its millie what happened to millie do you not know the bingo she went i got flu i cant go to the bingo i tell her i say to get you to walk her or not go did she get you she went on her own i told her not to nobody ever goes to bingo alone and comes back alone she did they got her the vagrants got her shes mugged you know what she has in her bag she never has more than five pounds that is before the bingo starts they went for her bag after the bingo and a cup of tea there would be two pounds only she didnt give it she hung on to it for two pounds they dragged her she fell she is an old lady she hit her head and then they took her bag he rocked felt himself cringe he did not say what her nephews opinion of him was a loser and a failure malachy could not tell her that mildred johnson would not have asked him to walk her to and from bingo because he had said that a story of a catastrophe was nobodys business but his that he was the last man from whom the proud obstinate little lady would have begged a favour shes in the hospital the police had found her bag without two pounds in the bag is my name and my flat number in my bag is her name and her number i cried when the police told me why mr malachy did she not call you to take her and to bring her back why you were her friend why did she not ask you chapter two how is she the nurse looked up she had been hovering over the bed are you a relative no no im not just a friend malachy held the flowers beside his leg and the water off them ran down his trousers how close a friend i live next door to mrs johnson he was supposed to have been once an expert in interrogation with the tables turned now the questioning unsettled him he shuffled his feet the nurses body blocked his view of millie it was the furthest he had been away from the amersham since he had come to live there the previous autumn it had been a big journey for him to get to the sprawled complex of st thomass hospital that morning dawn had come again to his door she must have been on her way home after the early cleaning shift in whitehall he had thought of millie and the guilt had seared him i suppose thatll do the nurse had a freckled face and bags under her eyes seemed half asleep with tiredness and spoke with an accent that was west of ireland she was knocked out we thought about intensive care but there wasnt a bed she got the best we could give her but it wasnt ic with pulse blood pressure and pupils checks every halfhour and we didnt think there was intercranial bleeding thats why shes in general medical so its serious bruising to the head and a broken arm not a complicated break always the same with the old folk they hang on and dont let the bag go silly but thats them for you the nurse moved started to smooth down the bed millie to him looked so small she was half sat up against a pile of pillows she wore a loosefitting smock several sizes too large for her her face usually proud independent and haughty was a coloured mass of bruises and the right side of her grey hair had been shaved away above the ear he could see the twoinchlong gash with the stitches in it her right arm was across her small chest enveloped in a sling she seemed to stare at him baleful and defensive he did not know whether he was recognized if that was the stare she gave to anyone approaching her bed the nurse slipped a thermometer into her mouth which was puffed with distorted lips shell be in two or three days because she lives alone and theres no one to look after her problem is that we might ship her out today and if she starts vomiting or goes to sleep weve an inquiry to worry about when the swellings down on the arm itll be pinned or plated and shell have to manage thats the way it is these days theres a friend next door to her a good lady shell be there and you said you were a neighbour the nurse put down the thermometer then fixed malachy with her eye i expect youll give her a hand or do you go to work ill do what i can he murmured i dont suppose you have a vase he had gone to the east street market he had considered how much he could spend the benefit he was entitled to after deductions left him with eighty pounds to last for two weeks divided up that gave him spending money of five pounds and seventyone pence each day he had asked the woman on the flower stall for the best she could do with five pounds it was a good display of bright chrysanthemums that he had brought to the hospital the nurse reached to the bottom cupboard of the cabinet beside the bed and took out a mans urinesample bottle grinned filled it with water from the basin and took the flowers from malachy as if shed made the judgement that he wasnt capable of flowerarranging she did it for him and settled the stems in the bottle the vases all get nicked she said its the best i can manage dont stay too long you shouldnt tire her she left him malachy sat on the end of the bed beside the little bump her feet made he did not know what to say or whether it was right to say anything he tried to smile encouragement she had turned her battered head enough to see the flowers he felt his inadequacy when he was with the dossers sleeping in the underpass on and under cardboard drinking with what he had made from begging and knowing he could not fall further he had not felt this low the silence nagged between them maybe an hour passed she slept and he sat dead still so as not to wake her the question cracked in his ear brusque whats a piece of shit like you doing here the nephew was behind him he carried a large varied bouquet in one hand and a clear plastic bag in the other packed with apples pears bananas peaches a pineapple and grapes why are you here he was shivering his whisper was a chatter in his teeth i came to see if i could help oh thats good help didnt help enough to walk her there and back no no malachy stammered she didnt ask me if shed asked me no fool aunt millie wouldnt have reckoned you up to it walking her there and back she didnt ask you came down from a great height right hit the bottom right i know who you were and what you did i know what they called you fancy phrases from the medics but the truth from the jocks i know his head drooped into his hands he sensed the nephew go past him and he heard the kiss placed on millies forehead would have been where the bruises were more sounds the splash of water then the thud in the tin wastebin the crackle of the cellophane wrapping on the bouquet he kept his hands tight on his face could feel the stubble on his palms what i dont know my friend my little piece of shit is where youre going are you going to go on failing thats easy isnt it i dont know if the only road youre comfortable with my friend is the easy one take your bloody hands off your face look at her does that take guts looking at an old lady whos been done over for her purse look at her and remember her he did he saw the slightness of her and the bruises in their mass of colours the thin upper arm in its sling and he saw the stems of his flowers upside down in the bin and the glory of the bouquet on the cabinet he pushed himself up from the bed and turned for the aisle that ran through the ward theres an easy road and a hard one most when theyve fallen like you have take the easy one out of the hospital he walked on the embankment the river seemed sour and dirtied rain ran down his face was not wiped away he walked on and did not know where walked until a massive cream and green building an architects dream blocked his path then he turned retraced his steps and headed back to the amersham where he could hide behind a door that was locked and bolted had frederick gaunt looked out through his fifthfloor window reinforced and chemically treated glass that could withstand bomb blast and electronic eavesdropping he would have seen a man walk on the albert embankment towards the wall that blocked further progress to the building where he worked then loiter and drift away but there was more on gaunts mind that lunchtime than the aimless advance and retreat of another of the capitals workshy lowlife that would have been his description if he had seen the loafer his sandwiches were untouched and his bottle of mineral water unopened gaunts room in vauxhall bridge cross the monolith occupied by the secret intelligence service was in an isolated corner of the building nominally eight per cent of the services budget was devoted to the investigation of organized crime but the resources made available to this section of the fifth floors openplan areas cubicles and rooms had been pared down to meet the demands of iraq and the burgeoning alqaeda desks gaunt did albania on another mans back it would have been a hairshirt an irritation that required continued scratching without relief but he knew the way the system worked and would have reckoned bloodyminded sulking to be vulgar the lunch was uneaten and the water undrunk little that normally landed on his desk dumped without ceremony by gloria required more than dutiful attention albanias organized crime was the trafficking of narcotics firearms and people his cx reports were carefully crafted always readable and painted a clear picture of a society wedded with enthusiasm to criminality most could have been drafted when he was half asleep not the one that now turned in his mind you havent touched them you have to eat gloria put down a further file on his desk already crowded with seven paper heaps no breakfast no lunch and ill wager nothing proper last night he grimaced she scolded because she cared about him the first of the files had arrived the previous morning and the heap had built through the day most of the pages now referred to telephone traces sucked down by the farm of dishes on the yorkshire moors once he had been on the cusp of the services investigations before he was moved aside a victim of the services need to produce scapegoats after its greatest ever and most humiliating intelligence failure now he was again at the centre little irrelevant corrupt fourthworld albania was top of the tree he chortled to himself he had been at his desk till ten oclock last night back in at a few minutes after five that morning and would be there that evening long after the day shifts had finished i really do insist that you eat it had been the day when alqaeda came to albania what he had lived and dreamed for he thought they must have almost forgotten down on the aq desks that frederick gaunt still inhabited a little corner of their space a link was made and hed have admitted it was a tortuous one between the kings of the terrorist war and the barons of european criminality happy days happy times please mr gaunt please eat something what never ceases to amaze me gloria is that they still use the old telephone god will they never learn one file listed an address in the city of quetta in westcentral pakistan in the foothills of the mountains that straddled the afghan border probably close to where the venerable osama was holed up in a damp cave with an estimated population of and among them was farida wife of muhammad iyad listed occupation bodyguard she lived there with the kids but he was long gone the second file was of the life and times of muhammad iyad more important whom he guarded all choice items the third file comprised a security report from islamabad of a surveillance teams witnessing of a giftwrapped parcel being handdelivered to the house included were blackandwhite stillframe images of her showing her mother a gold chain necklace anyone close to her would have passed the gift to her in person who other than a husband in hiding somewhere would have sent a married woman an expensive present records attached showed it to have been her wedding anniversary when she received the gift the fourth file listed a telephone call made on the landline from the house to a number in dubai in the gulf the transcript of the brief call listed no names her love gratitude and always my prayers the fifth file was slim the only overseas call made from the dubai number no transcript provided was to a satellite phone in southern lebanon the sixth file again a single sheet of flimsy paper and again no transcript recorded a call from the satellite phone located inland from the city of sidon to a number in prague capital of the czech republic the seventh file courtesy of the bis in the city identified a message received in prague on a number that was tapped the transcript was one line gift received love gratitude and always my prayers the number in prague to which the message had been sent was monitored because it was used by an albanian national believed involved in the organizedcrime racket of moving romanian ukrainian and bulgarian girls to northern europe for prostitution the warmth of his smile spread because wilcos signature was on the cover note in front of him now brought to him by his faithful pa and hed have sworn she had the same caring eyes as her spaniel was wilcos latest message the albanian was a cafe owner and prosperous records showed he also owned a thirdfloor apartment in the old quarter of prague and the unpronounceable name of a street was listed he began to wolf his sandwich gulping it down then swilling his mouth with the water satisfied its only you im thinking of mr gaunt she could have called him frederick or freddie she had been with the service for twenty years fifteen of them running his desk at home and abroad but she was never familiar without her his professional life as a senior intelligence officer would have been so much the poorer he said im going off to see the add dear gilbert to tell him i want to run with this meantime message wilco that im controlling it and all signals come to me please he was up and scraping sandwich detritus from his shirt then buttoning his waistcoat reaching for his suit jacket from the hanger shouldnt i wait till youve received the assistant deputy directors confirmation she seemed to tease take it as read theyre all callow youths and girls on aq central europe hell be glad to give it to someone who knows his butt from his arm oh and say something nice to wilco he strode away noisy on steelheeled shoes terrorists in bed with criminals made for formidable copulation he walked up the street with a plastic bag dangling heavy from his hand it was the last time that muhammad iyad the bodyguard would need to collect food from the halal butcher in the market behind the old town square salad vegetables and bread by the following evening they would have started on another stage of the journey because this was his work and why he was respected he tried to be as clearheaded and alert as his reputation demanded among the few who knew him it was said that he was the most suspicious most cunning of all the men given the task of minding the precious and highly valued operatives of the organization coming back to the apartment on the top floor of the building in the narrow alley behind kostecna muhammad iyad used all the techniques that had long become second nature to him three times between the old town square and kostecna he had broken the slow ambling pace of his walk had darted round corners then stood back flush to the doors at the entrance of old buildings and waited the necessary minute to see whether a tail would come after him twice he had stopped in front of womens clothes shops and positioned himself so that the reflection showed the street and both pavements behind him once on dlouha at the entrance to the pizzeria he had abruptly turned on his heel and gone back a hundred metres a fast stride that would have confused men who followed him and they would have ducked away would have shown themselves to him the expert from the doorways and shop fronts and by the pizzeria he had seen only a fog wall of tourists bodies local kids striding office workers and meandering women but that day his mind was clouded he knew the man he guarded as abu khaled but his thoughts were not on him and his security on pain of death or on the worse pain of disgrace he would not have told the man of what he had done while they had travelled and of the reward it had won him the man did not know that a necklace had been purchased in the gold market of riyadh the money to buy it had been from the banker who handled transactions for the organization he himself muhammad iyad had chosen the necklace of thick highquality links and the banker had promised that it would be delivered by courier to the address in quetta not by mail because that would have been unreliable and would have endangered his safety if it had been known what he had done he would never again have been entrusted with taking a man of importance towards his target the message had come back to him two days before gift received love gratitude and always my prayers he had rejoiced the image of her and the little children had filled every cranny of his mind he could see her touch her hear her it had been wrong of him to make the gift it was against every law laid down by the organization but the weakness had come from long years of separation his love of the organization was shared with his love for his family for the woman who had borne his children he did not know when if ever he would see her again the net around the organization was tighter more constricting it seemed at times worst when he tried to sleep to suffocate him so walking towards the alley behind kostecna between narrow streets and old buildings of brick and timber he attempted to maintain his habitual alertness but the picture of her with the necklace he had chosen competed he was certain of it he would have sworn to it on the book there was no tail fully focused as he was not muhammad iyad might have noticed that the noparking sign at the end of the alley on kostecna which had not been obscured when he had passed it at the start of his shopping trip was now covered with old sacking bound tight with twine he had been two months with abu khaled moving and minding and watching over him he had collected him in secrecy from a lodginghouse in the yemens capital sanaa they had travelled overland north into saudi arabia the home of the swine who danced to the tune of the great satans whistle had skirted the desert and gone up the red sea coast then cut back towards the desert interior and into jordan all of the organizations planning had been as always without flaw from jordan into syria then turkey at each stage safehouses transport and documentation had met them then across the sea by ferry and to bulgaria and the change that had first unsettled muhammad iyad they were in the hands of albanians the common language was broken english or halting italian they were muslims but without the dedication to the faith that was his and abu khaleds but those were the arrangements made by the organization he could not and he had tried to fault them but he did not trust them from bulgaria via plovdiv and sofia to romania overnight stops in romania at brasov and satu mare then into hungary more documentation and new cars waited for them at szeged and gyor before they had slipped over the frontier and into slovakia if they had used airports his face and that of abu khaled would have been caught on the overhead cameras and their papers would have been copied and stored the cameras were dangerous because they could recognize a mans features whether he wore spectacles or a beard the computers could identify him the borders they had crossed were always remote not the main routes where the customs men had been trained in techniques by the crusaders they had come after sleeping two nights at prievidza out of slovakia and into the czech republic and had been taken to a cafe in prague then driven to the safehouse an apartment high in an old building the word given him and he could not doubt it was that with each step towards the destination greater care was required they had been five nights in prague while the detail of the final stages was finalized in each car or lorry they had been moved in under the back wheel in the trunk or stowed behind the seats in the cab was the black canvas bag that he was never without against his body at each border crossing in yemen and saudi arabia jordan syria and turkey a snubnosed pistol loaded and in a lightweight plastic holster had gouged into the soft inner flesh of his right thigh at every stop point his hand had hovered on his lap and his belt had been loosened so that he could reach down for it and shoot he would never be taken and it was his duty to ensure that a prized man such as abu khaled was not captured alive too many had been too many had talked to their interrogators the first bullets would be for those who questioned them at a border crossing the last two would be for abu khaled and himself nor did he take note of the greenpainted delivery van cab empty without side windows that was parked where every other day it was forbidden to stop by the sign that was now covered the following night they would cross the frontier into germany in the hands of the albanians the pistol was now in his waistband at the back under his jacket and the coat he wore against the cold at the street door he swung round gazed back up the alley no one followed him no man or woman turned away quickly or ducked their face to light a cigarette or snatched a newspaper from a pocket and opened it cars without slowing sped past the green van on kostecna he went in closed the door behind him the next evening they would start the last leg of the journey it would end far away on a northern coastline and there he would hug his man kiss his cheeks and pray that god walked with him he began to climb the stairs the plaster had flaked from the walls with damp and the light of the alley had been extinguished by the shut street door but he thought only of his wife the organization had ordered that he should leave his man his work done on that seashore he lived in paradise but it brought him little comfort all his waking hours worry squirmed perpetually in oskar as the light failed the rain off the sea thickened and the wind whipped the white caps behind him oskar netzer sat on the bench in the low watchtower among the islands dunes at his back four or five hundred metres behind the towers wooden plank wall was the north sea what he studied through the towers hatch window was a lagoon a bog of rank water and marsh reeds and the eiders the island was at the centre of what would have seemed if seen from a high aircraft the longcleaned vertebrae of a great mammal but one that in the moment of death had tucked its legs into its body the islands formed an archipelago a few kilometres north of the frisland coast of germany the head of this fallen beast was borkum island the base of the skull was memmert and juist was the neck the shoulders the largest of the islands was norderney then came a bump on the spine baltrum baltrum was the jewel the long backbone continued broken by a channel between langeoog and spiekeroog the creatures drooped tail was wangerooge the tip minsener oog together they acted as a sea wall that protected the mainland from the worst of the winter storms blowing in off the north sea the islands had been created over centuries by the tides and currents pushing together displaced mounds of seabed sand they had shifted continuously their basic shapes surviving only when the seeds of the tough dune grass had taken root and bound the sand grains together they had no soil that could be cultivated and the greenery that had sprouted was only the coarse grass thick low scrub and occasional weatherbent trees the upper point of all the individual islands was never more than twentyfour metres over the hightide sea level the smallest and the most beautiful baltrum was five thousand metres long and a maximum at low water of fifteen hundred wide baltrum was oskar netzers home he was sixtynine and five years ago he had watched his wifes coffin lowered into the sand of the small cemetery in ost dorp overlooking the lowtide mudflats and the mainland after fortyone years of marriage he loved no other human being and was himself unloved by all of the five hundred permanent residents on baltrum he was unloved because he struggles every day and with every breath to block the march forward that he was told was necessary if the islands community was to survive he was wiry without a trace of fat on his stomach his cheeks always seeming to carry three days bristle were mahoganycoloured from sun rain and wind he wore that day as all days whether the sun baked or the chill wind cut a pair of faded blue fishermens overalls and stout walking boots with the cap half rotted of a frislander on his silver hair a third of his island his home was now covered with the little redbrick homes of those who came only in the summer and of those residents who let rooms for the wasp swarms of summer visitors it was argued by the islands mayor and the elected council that visitors needed facilities oskar fought each one with passion the latest which he would fight that evening at a public meeting was an application to expand the floor space of an existing italianowned fastfood pasta and pizza outlet from the tower he watched the eider ducks feed in the lagoon preen and sleep on its banks they were elegant peaceable and so vulnerable each development he believed eroded their place on the island his anger at development burned in him as he sat on the bench and muttered the arguments not so loud as to disturb the eiders below him that he would use later against the intrusion of more strangers the season for visitors would not start till easter week there was still a month before they came the quiet was around him and the rumble of the sea far behind him he would fight because without him the islands calm was shorn of defence and he did not care whose march he blocked the note was on the floor just inside the outer door malachy had been in the kitchen cooking sausages and chips without the tvs noise through the common wall and his own was not switched on it had been deathly quiet in flat thirteen with only the whir of the microwave and the bleep of its bell but he had heard nothing no footsteps padding along level threes walkway and no rustle of paper as it was inserted between the bottom of the door and the carpet he had brought in the plate with the sausages and chips and put it on the table as he had pulled out his chair he had seen the note he went to it and bent to pick it up it was folded in half his first thought was that it was from dawn a report on mildred johnsons progress no she would have knocked on the door he lifted it opened it once handwriting was something he had known about in the first days at chicksands years back they had spent half a day learning the points to be recognized from handwriting illeducated writing intelligent writing disguised writing the hand of this note had formed large clumsy characters in ballpoint on a sheet from a notepad the pressure of the point and the size of the letters told malachy that a righthanded person had written with their left hand your phone will ring three times then stop a minute later it rings three more times then stops after minutes be in the parking area under block bay he shivered far out over the estate he could hear music played loud and shouts of argument but around him was silence he crumpled the paper then let it drop he turned to go to the table where the food waited for him then hesitated and retrieved the note this time he ripped it into fragments carried them to the toilet and flushed them as if that might help him forget the demand made of him an intruder had broken into his world he sat at the table and ate his meal the telephone was on a low table of stained wood the rooms furnishing was basic battered a table and two upright chairs of which only one would safely take his weight a twoseater settee whose coarse covering was worn on the arms by age and previous tenants a bookcase with empty shelves a single picture hung on one wall a fading print of flowers beside a river the glass was cracked at the upper left corner a light with a plastic shade hung from the centre of the ceiling and there was the low table with the telephone it was the same as the day on which ivanhoe manners had brought him to the amersham he had done nothing in those months to stamp his character on the room in fact it mirrored malachy kitchen it was as if he had determined to show nothing of himself as if he were frightened to display himself what there was he kept clean but did not add to it as the hours passed malachy sensed his life had changed again but he did not know whose hand controlled him maybe he should pack his clothes into a black binbag go out through the door close it behind him and walk away go down the stairs from level three turn his back on block nine and head off into the night but he sat on the carpet where he could see the telephone the demons came again and what had been said to him and of him the squirming sense of shame there was no one he could have turned to ricky felt the excitement always the same when he took delivery he wore plastic gloves he counted out the packages in the light thrown by a battery lamp and the contents of each weighed one kilo with a knife he had slit one open had seen the dark powder and sniffed it he would not open any of the other twentyfour tightly bound packets of brown no need to not where they had come from the last divisions of the load coming to him had been made in germany and he would have trusted that source with his life ricky was in a derelict factory on the north side of the peckham road once it had produced cheap leather coats but that market had now gone to turkey and he rented the premises he had realized long ago that it was a waste of his money and dangerous to own the property where the twentyfivekilo or fiftykilo parcels were split around him but with cutoffs for security was a loose network of experts and facilitators he wanted a driver for a shipment he hired one he wanted enforcers such as the merks he went outside for them he wanted premises he rented them he wanted information he bought it he wanted a chemist he went into the marketplace it was his way of operating and he believed it to be the safest security was everything with ricky capel little details missed sent men down for the big bird stretches the men in the a category gaol wings had all missed little details and would do fifteen years for the mistake he despised them each packet was checked after the one that had been opened to be certain that the sealing had survived the immersion in the north sea but he wore gloves and out in the yard between the building and the high wall a brazier was already lit he wore gloves so that fingerprints would not be on the oilskin wrappings or the taping but his sweat would line the interior of the gloves and dna traces could be taken from a plastic glove the gloves would be burned and where he and charlie had walked on the factory floor would be hosed down as they left so that their footprints were washed away the checking in the factory was the only time that ricky capel would be handson with the packages charlie had driven the parcel up from the east coast still with the smell of the sea on it and the stink of fish davey and benji would move the singlekilo parcels on to the dropoffs more labyrinthine arrangements and more gloves for burning of course there were risks everything about life was risks but they were kept minimal his success in achieving this was why ricky was not in category a why he created fear why he was worth so charlie told him more than eightyfive million pounds yeah yeah not bad for a young un still short of his thirtyfifth birthday and the factory was always swept for bugs camera and audio the day before a package was brought for splitting ricky dragged off his gloves charlie had the parcels he was splashing them with water from the hose washing away the smell of fish and the sea then walking them to the doorway outside davey and benji were in the wheels a jobbing builders van and a pickup with a sign on it for garden clearance he never moved the stuff in a mercedes or in a beemer not in anything that would be noticed the van and the pickup drove away he dropped his gloves into the fire then heard the hose water on the floor behind him he knew all the stories because benji told him of the mistakes men had made and the details that had been missed the latest in benjis list the guy who did cocaine and was bringing in kilos when he was lifted he ran racehorses and had called one of the nags by the name of the top tec whod done the krays which was just pathetic and shouted from the roofs for attention hed got fourteen years another guy stole a dog a bull mastiff off a kid kept it as his own and let it ride in his car then killed a punter he was in dispute with put the body in the car to dump it and there were dog hairs on the body that were matched to the dog hed nicked and it was life with at least twentyone years his granddad didnt do details and had been third rate his dad had missed the obvious and was fourth rate not the boy not ricky capel charlies gloves went into the fire you ok ricky never been better he watched the gloves disintegrate later that night fifteen suppliers would have the twentyfive packets and would have paid for them where they went after that cut down divided and sliced up across southeast london was not his concern the trade on estates in backstreet pubs and from unlit corners was beneath ricky capels interest im feeling good the room was a mess of shadows when it rang the telephone was faintly lit by the streetlights below the window filtering inside at first malachy started to crawl forward to pick it up but before he had reached it the bell had gone three times and then the silence startled him he did not know who played with him his hand dropped and he slumped he could have reached out and lifted the receiver then let it hang from its cable and drop to the carpet had he done so the telephones bell could not have pealed again instead he cringed left it in its cradle the bell screamed for him seemed to shatter the rooms quiet half an hour later malachy closed the outer door behind him and padded down the walkway it was near to midnight over the railing he could see the little clusters of figures where they would have been when mildred johnson came back from the bingo on the last flight of the stairs he had to scrape himself against the graffiti to get past two vagrants hunched down one had the sleeve of his coat rolled up and a syringe poised above the skin the other was probing with his fingers for a vein in the back of his leg contorting himself and cursing at the effort he could smell them they seemed not to notice him he thought the first would use the syringe and then if the other had found a vein it would be used again when he was past them he stumbled down the last flights of the steps then leaned against the street wall and panted to go on or turn back if he turned back he would have to retrace the route past the vagrants with the needle it had been the intention of the architect responsible for the amershams design that residents should park their cars and vans under the blocks but for the last fifteen years no man or woman had dared to leave a vehicle in the garage spaces smashed windows stolen radios and tyres vandalized paintwork had cleared the cavern areas interior lights set in the support pillars were broken and only the streetlights reached under the low concrete ceilings the residents who had cars left them out on the street now under the high lights they could come out from their barricaded front doors peer down from the walkways above and check them between distant pillars a small fire guttered shadows flitted round it and he heard low voices above him was a sign paint flaking detailing the numbers of the parking bays he looked for the number he had been given then breathed hard and stepped into the interior he had on the rubbersoled trainers from the charity shop but however lightly he attempted to walk his tread seemed to shout his advance sometimes his feet crunched on broken glass and once he stepped and slid in fresh faeces he could just see some of the numbers on the pillars enough to guide him towards the far wall the outline of a car loomed in front of him he felt the weakness in his gut and at his knees then the hiss of a window being electrically lowered he tried to see inside and could make out a head in a balaclava the voice was muffled through the wool is that you it is me wanted to hear your voice know it was you he knew the voice whats a piece of shit like you doing here and you look after that lady watch out for her he said curtly i know your voice and we do not need for whatever your purpose this crap in the middle of the night fighting talk from a big brave boy understand me i am not here i was never here ever get the idea that i was here and shout about it and itll be your word against mine and your medical history against the busload of people who will stand up and swear on the bible good and firm that i was elsewhere forget it those are the rules i am not here and you never met me here you got hold of the rules if you say so i say it i said that id find out about you you did dont interrupt me doesnt make me happy a pencil torch flashed on in the car and the beam shone down on a file of papers you are malachy walter kitchen i am son of walter and araminta kitchen born yes on leaving school a years teaching in krakow poland i cannot see that that is relevant to anything everything of you to me is relevant the papers on the lap were turned you joined the army your father was a senior officer now retired you were recruited into the ranks basic training then germany logistics corps i suppose it was a gesture a poor one and it did not last right id have thought you had better things to do with your time than pry into my past easy malachy easy theres a good fellow there was a stifled chuckle you were pulled out theres a letter in the files from your father a request was made to friends to give you a hand up he ground his teeth i didnt know if i had i wouldnt have accepted the offer thats convenient always good to keep the pride so you went to sandhurst to the royal military academy to be made into an officer not much of one only fair ratings for team work described as a loner but theyre down on numbers these days and they pass through what theyve got my academic work was graded above average i was good enough for what i wanted to do absolutely right you were accepted into the intelligence corps in dad couldnt complain about that it was respectable you were at the corps base at chicksands for three years your assessments give no indication of what will happen it is said of you that you show aptitude for working under pressure on your own you were one of those solitary people who makes a virtue of not needing company where i am we have a few theyve slipped through the net and theyre arrogant opinionated not good work colleagues once weve spotted them theyre out do you recognize yourself i recognize nothing its your game you married roz in wasnt clever but you did daughter of a warrantofficer instructor at sandhurst you set up home in married quarters at chicksands but thats not my business that is not your bloody business not my business except when i can see im pouring salt on to a raw wound trekking on youre then posted to rome to be on the military attaches staff that must have been nice bit of a doddle id have thought cocktail parties nato exercises and updating the italian army heavy stuff i did what was asked of me back to chicksands working to major brian arnold rarefied longrange guessing on the agenda what do we know about the iraqi order of battle how mobile is a republican guard armoured division who are the personalities in command of iraqi units where have they been trained what is the quality of iraqi logistics and support arms war is getting closer work hours longer earlier away from the little woman and later back immersed in work head never above the parapet am i getting it right if you want to believe it you can believe it dont get shirty with me malachy im the one with a home and family to go back to youve neither the war starts all those clever papers youve written theyre all proven crap the yanks slice through the defences which was not in your predictions no you hadnt got that right hardly time to blink and the fighting wars over and its peace you are one of many suddenly sitting on your hands and looking at the sun shining down on chicksands your trouble though and its the same trouble for all the workobsessed geeks is that you dont do hobbies nothing to fill your days and nights not going well with the lovely roz eh then major arnold drops his bombshell youre off to iraq he understood it was as if a rope had tightened round his throat he said hoarsely there was work worthwhile work to be done there thats better now were singing from the same hymn sheet excellent and the excretas in the fan supposed to be mission accomplished but its not the time for rose petals chucked under the tracks of tanks is a memory its about terrorism and about improvised explosive devices and lawandorder breakdown and the assassination of collaborators and a dream thats as sour as old milk first you get to brigade in basra i expect they get the message another junkie from intelligence boasting brain power over brawn and telling the brigadier where hes doing it wrong shortcut to getting popular eh i was coming with a different viewpoint soon as they could get rid of you brigade did the business and packed you off to a battalion of jocks somewhere out in the sand that must have been a thrill theyre real soldiers getting their arses shot at and now on their territory is a guy from outside their ranks i expect you didnt hesitate with the full weight of your intelligence corps expertise to point out to the commanding officer where they were going wrong i read a little note from someone at the hq a gathering in the officers mess and everyones yapping about what should be done but the i corps officer reckons theyre talking shit and cant keep his mouth shut says my opinion anyone who thinks he knows the shortfix answer to southern iraqs problems is ill informed ill bet that went down as well as if youd pulled the pin and dropped a hand grenade so they sent you all i did was tell them what i thought back to the old selfopinionated stubbornness couldnt let it go then and cant now they sent you up to a company base codename bravo id hazard that there were a fair few at brigade battalion and company whod have raised a cheer if theyd known you were going to fall on your face you went out on patrol thats enough not good listening eh getting sensitive is it it wasnt like anyone said what did they call you malachy after the patrol i dont have to listen he was shouting what was their description of you malachy go fuck yourself a bit of spirit malachy thats what i want to hear i think were progressing you dont want me to say what they called you all right how they described you all right you havent forgotten its hung round your neck i said you were a failure a man can live with that but a man cant live with what they called you am i right malachy cannot anyone stand your corner speak for you i dont think so think of topping yourself malachy ending it thought of it and you fell no work no wife no family no friend collapse booze mind broken you were lucky you ended here the fire beyond the pillars flared and there was a shriek of laughter that echoed through the car park across the empty bays what did you lose malachy the voice had softened what replaced personal pride selfesteem respect shall i answer would it be shame malachy whispered it disgust whats it like i dont know its demons its always with you its a torture chamber theres no time in the day or the night that its not with you let me tell you a story malachy and listen well im a young copper im with a mate and its the middle of a ballsfreezing night and we get this call in hackney intruder on the roof of a warehouse my mate goes up on the roof and im tracking along on the ground my mate goes through the roof i saw him in stoke mandeville when he hadnt been there the spinal injuries unit more than two days he was weeping his eyes out couldnt have been consoled because he was diagnosed as near quadriplegic i made a big effort because it had cut me right up saw him again in a month and when i went into the ward i could hear his laughter it was food time and he was learning to eat and it was all over his front and his face just like everyone else had it he said to me quiet what you learn in here theres always someone worse off than yourself a good sob story yes last i heard of him he was doing a job from a wheelchair in police communications being called a cripple thats not as bad as what they called you but its down that road he was thought of as useless are you useless malachy i dont know he said simply do you want to find out a ripple of panic caught him he sensed that everything was choreographed what if theres no road back he blurted always is you have to believe that otherwise stop fucking about and living like a goddamn recluse walk on to the bridge and bloody well jump but you have to believe it malachy get something in your mind tell me you saw her bruises broken arm violated like theyd raped her i saw her theres a road back malachy through the open window a slip of paper was passed to him by a hand gloved in black leather he saw the glint of the eyes through the balaclavas slit as the man reached across there was no light to read what was written on the paper and he pocketed it what do i have to do dont have to do anything malachy the vagrants steal to buy the wraps with the money they steal from an old ladys purse they buy the dealers sell to them you do what you want to do malachy you do what you think is right and maybe thatll make a ladder for you goodnight keep safe the window was raised and the engine was gunned to life without headlights the car reversed sharply and swung squealed tyres between the pillars and out into the lit street malachy stood rooted his mind pounding confusion chapter three he woke it was already past eleven oclock the banging on his door drummed into his head if it had not been for the sound malachy would have slept on he dragged himself off the bed it had been a sleep he had not known for months for a year no dreams and no nightmares no images squirming in his mind the banging persisted he shouted out that he was coming but his voice was faint from a driedout throat and the banging did not stop he pulled on his trousers that he had dumped last night on the carpet when he had fallen collapsed on to the bed yes im coming for gods sake im coming out of the bedroom he walked past the table there was the mat on which he put his plate the little plastic containers for salt and pepper a mug hed left there from which hed drunk instant coffee and the sheet of paper he snatched it up and buried it in his pocket he went towards the door last night back from the parking bays under the block he had read again and again what had been passed to him through the cars window he had sipped the coffee and told himself he would sleep on it not decide anything till the morning he would not commit himself till the morning he did not have to his decision it had been the best nights sleep he could remember but nobody owned him im coming he unlocked the door and dragged down the bolt he paused seemed to suck air down into his body he could not remember when last his door had been banged on but then he could barely remember when he had last slept a whole long night and been free of the demons dawn was there i went to see her she said yes are you not concerned for her of course im concerned for her you want to know how she is id like to i thought you would be there i thought you would have visited her she had tony early before he went to work then me when i have finished i thought you would be there but i look at you and i see you were asleep i thought id go later on he said weakly she does not sleep she has the pain in her head and the pain in her arm both are severe worst is the pain in her soul do you understand me his voice was limp please explain to me a policeman came yesterday afternoon and gave her a victim number he asked her if she could describe her attackers it was dark so she could not the policeman said there was a camera covering the stairwell but it did not have film in it there are many cameras for show but few with film in them it hurts her that no one will be punished i am sorry that you did not travel to see her i slept in late didnt mean to he thought his excuses demeaned him to the tall african woman elderly but still cleaning ministry offices and staircases and thought she regarded him with contempt probably working through her mind were the snippets of his history that she knew had once been a gentleman like the men with individual offices that she rose early to clean had been disgraced and had collapsed had been a vagrant living rough like the vagrants who had stolen from her millie dont you go tiring yourself mr malachy you go back to bed not good for a young man to exhaust himself in three days she will be coming out when they have done the pin in her arm i apologize mr malachy for disturbing you she was gone away with her dignity he closed the door he pulled the piece of paper out of his pocket three names not the names of vagrants but of members of the high fly boys who strutted the amersham he studied them then took a pencil stub and began to write down hesitantly at first then feverishly what he would need to buy january baz was the sections star had to be one and it was him the way he was going he was close to being the platoons star the company commander always noticed him and hed heard he was listed for his first stripe and hed get it within the next fortnight baz was the best shot in the platoon and when other jocks in the section couldnt reassemble an sm or a gpmg after cleaning it was to baz they turned back at the depot east of inverness baz played right central stopper in the battalion soccer team as a member of hq platoon of the company iraq suited baz as well as a good glove fitted a hand he listened to the briefing baz didnt rate the corporal he himself could have done the job better blindfolded and with an arm behind his back because he didnt rate him he hardly listened as the corporal reading off notes told them what route they would take on foot out of bravo two and a half hours of showing the presence baz like every other jock at the police station knew a lift was coming the following morning and that the patrol was going out that afternoon to give the impression that everything was normal quiet routine a break in the patrolling pattern might sound a warning to those in the identified buildings who were to be lifted baz always liked to speak up to show he was alert excuse corp arent we short of an interpreter behind you mr kitchens coming with us he turned baz hadnt seen the officer must have reached the briefing when the gats and the gimpy were being checked and armed the officer was standing with sergeant mcqueen hed seen him arrive when the resupply convoy had come in from battalion in the morning talk round the hq platoon was that he was a desk driver from intelligence and it had been overheard in the mess by a jock doing officers breakfasts that he was an eternal flame never went out though he was alongside old queenie baz was struck by his aloneness like he didnt fit and knew it seemed remote from them a goodsized man but his uniform was clean as if it was straight out of the dhobi line his boots hadnt dirt on them and his webbing was looser than it should have been his flak jacket was not fastened across his chest he had no camcream on his cheeks and forehead and he held an sm as if it wasnt part of him does he do wormspeak corporal he reads arabic writing and speaks arabic lingo hell do any interpreting we need and youll watch his back baz be a pleasure corporal dont like his face though baz spat into his cupped hands then crouched scooped sand into his palms then went the two strides to the officer dont mind me sir but youve no camcream thisll do he wiped the mess spittle and sand on to the officers cheeks forehead and chin smeared it good and hard right up to the rim of his helmet which was askew like he wasnt used to wearing one he could sense the nervousness like this was a new experience for a rupert all young officers were ruperts all ruperts were fair game there was a little wave of laughter behind him from the section then old queenie slapped his hand down just trying to help thats much better sir they didnt have to be told what they might face when they were out in the village it might be a scrum of cheerful screaming kids offers of godawful sweet coffee from the stalls an rpg round or a burst of automatic might be a welcome or might be a fullblown ambush not knowing was what made it good for baz right lets movethe corporal was on his way baz was not surprised that the company commander and the platoon commander hadnt come out to hear the briefing and see them go theyd have been working on the planning of the morning lift heads down over the maps of the locations and where the block forces would be to stop the bastards legging it at the weapons pit a square metre of sand between three walls of sandbags they armed the rifles and the gimpy the machinegun he didnt hear the scrape of the mechanism behind him baz could always muster a nice smile didnt have to say anything he smiled well as he took the officers rifle worked the bullet into the breech checked the safety was on murmured that they always had one up the spout when on patrol he saw the blush on the officers face bloody rupert useless rupert the blush showed up through the smears of sand and spittle all of the sections faces everyone at bravos was sunburned or tanned dark but this man drove a desk and never went out there ivas a whisper of thanks barely heard and bazs smile was sweeter he was in control like he always wanted to be there was banter among them a few cracks as they tracked along the embankment towards the village then joke time finished they looked for freshly moved sand at the side of the road where a bomb might be buried and they looked for control wires baz was backmarker and in front of him the officers shoulders heaved up and then sagged like he was breathing hard in iraq nothing frightened baz he was a star now coming to the villages first buildings he knew the officer was not battletrained and it amused him nine in the section plus the officer two sticks of five on each side of the one street and far up in front of them was the square he sensed it and the corporal would have done all of them would have sensed that that afternoon the place was bad no grins or little waves from the shopkeepers the binliners the women head to toe in black were scurrying to get clear of their approach and there werent kids mobbing them for sweets most days in the village the atmosphere was good a few days it was bad if it was bad he would get to shoot if he fired he would slot baz was the best shot in the headquarters platoon but the place not to be in action was backmarker he ran forward loped half a dozen strides he was at the officers shoulder saw the way the rifle was held with white knuckles do tailend charlie watch me do as i do keep my arse safe dont lose me he was past the officer the section was strung out on either side of the street and had started to make the short fast surges that the sergeants who had done belfast taught them he watched for the corporals hand signals when to move and when to be in a doorway a steel shutter slammed down the last stretch of the street into the square emptied baz knew it the shutter going down was the sign two shots none of the jocks down a single shot all of the jocks sprinting the instructors called it doing hard targets run take cover search for enemy run again making it hard for the bastards to get a target he saw just before the forward jocks of the section reached the square the corporals hand signal jagging to the left where a street came in at right angles to the main drag they were all sprinting more than half of the jocks were already gone into the street off to the left he would have looked behind him checked for the officer but he saw the bad guy saw him clean clear bearded in a robe ammunition pouches on webbing on his chest ak in his hand baz had the rifle up was controlling his breathing trying to find the bastard in his magnifying sight and he could smell behind him filtered through the shutters the scent of freshbaked bread there was a thunderclap of noise behind him he recognized it rocketpropelled grenade he looked up fast high saw the impact point a dozen feet over him between two windows and glass came down he didnt look for the officer but shouted for him to move himself he had the bad guy again in the sight one shot aimed ice cool like it was the practice range breath controlled the trigger squeezed baz saw the white robe lift up and the ak rifle seemed to be thrown aside then the target was lost behind the mass of deserted stalls i slotted him i got a hit baz yelled he felt the pride then he was charging for the street corner two more single shots came in and out of doorways the section stampeded along the street spread far apart he was backmarker tailend charlie was his place baz was always last man in the section on patrol because he was the best he thought for a brief moment of the officer would have got past him running when baz was aiming and preparing to fire a hell of a shot two hundred yards definite no less and he forgot him all sprinting until they had doubled round the back of the mosque and had reached the school gates they were crouched against the wall of the school and the corporal darted back to him no more gunfire but a siren sounded urgently back in the squares area the corporal reached him you all right baz im all right he isnt hear the feckin ambulance i slotted one wheres the rupert i slotted him well saw him go down had an ak confirmed kill up ahead hes not holy cow jesus wheres the rupert definite he wasnt hit there was an incoming rpg but way high by the bread shop but no small arms incoming all the small arms was forward so where the hells the rupert all i bloody need im not his bloody nanny i wasnt pushing him in a goddam pram i got a kill hes not hurt the rupert because there were no shots that could have hit him i tell you what i got i got a marksman and dropped him how do i feckin know where he is baz heard the corporal on the radio and the staccato response that the section should work their way back use the route theyd taken there was a shortage of manpower at hq but they were trying to put together a response and at the end for gods sake how have you lost him they left the school and came back round the rear of the mosque then along the narrow street theyd used to get clear of the ambush and on to the main route into the square the ambulance came past them the back door flapping open to show the feet on the stretcher baz caught a glimpse of the blood staining the robe they checked doorways and alleys behind and under cars then the lead jock yelled out and crouched in a gutter beside a dropped helmet a hundred yards on the flak jacket was lying in a heap of goat shit when they saw him he was on the embankment he was shambling back towards bravos hq and behind him was a gang of small children the jeering laughter of the kids came back to them and baz saw that some the boldest ran to within a few yards of him and threw stones at him trying to hit his bare head but missed and baz saw the hands hanging loose not holding a personal weapon he heard the corporal mutter the idiot hes lost his gat they ran to him heaving for breath and the feckinsun beat down on them bazs mind worked hard where he had been and what he had said he would have died for his section gone to his maker for his platoon not for an outsider they reached him as a personnel carrier came in a dust storm from the gates of bravo he seemed to stare straight ahead and there was no recognition in his eyes for those who gathered round him and no response to the corporals repeated and ever more frantic questioning was he ok what had happened to him where was his weapon he just walked on baz took the moment he couldnt feckin hack it corporal he ran he dumped us and ran he chucked his helmet and his jacket and his gat thats yellow corporal hes a feckin coward couldnt do the business he legged it look theres not a mark on him a feckin piece of wet shit what he is look at him is a lurker or a skiver a bloody coward thats what he is if it had been the same van still the green one muhammad iyad would not have noticed it they had eaten bread salad and goats cheese and later he would pack in good time for them to be ready to move as soon as the car pulled up at the street door before that he would sleep so that for the journey through the night he would be alert his senses sharpened by rest it was not the same van it was smaller blackpainted and newer when he stood at the far side of the window under the eaves of the building he could just see the top of the noparking sign covered with sacking held by twine his mind turned on the problem kostecna in the oldest part of the city churned with traffic it was forbidden to park on kostecna permission might have been given for one vehicle perhaps to park while urgent work was done in a building there was no sign of work no artisans came with equipment to and from the van muhammad iyad had a mind that bred suspicion the position of the van was perfect the view except that it had no windows from the centre of its side gave direct access to a watcher down the alley he heard a belch behind him then a murmured question what did he see not taking his eyes from the window muhammad iyad asked to be passed his binoculars a pocket pair from his black bag he held out his hand behind him and when the binoculars touched his fingers he snatched them with them at his eyes whipping at the focus he began minutely inch by inch to examine the sleek shiny side of the van for a moment he was not aware as he strained to find what he searched for that the man abu khaled was behind him and had wriggled against the wall to look over his shoulder see what he saw suspicion had kept him alive in sanaa riyadh amman or damascus if it were not believed he could be captured he would have been shot on sight he would not be captured never would be a little hiss of anger slipped his lips because the traffic on kostecna had logjammed and a high lorry obscured his view his eyeline had been on the indentation in the vans side where plate sheeting could have been removed to make way for windows there was rare sunlight that afternoon in prague and it fell on the van highlighting the indent he squirmed to better his position the lorry moved on his gaze moved over the paintwork then slipped back to the indentation the breath of the man was in his ear he would have sighed his satisfaction he saw the machineworked hole the size of a single yemeni riyal coin or one syrian lira drilled but not punched in the way a calibre bullet would have done he had found it with almost savage strength muhammad iyad propelled the man away from him he heard abu khaled stumble back trip fall to the floor and then his oath he stepped back from the window saw the man he guarded lying on his back and scrabbling with his hands and feet to stand sweat was clinging to him in all the days and nights they had been in prague abu khaled had never been out of the thirdfloor apartment it had been his cell the mark of his importance was that he should never leave the building for fear of being identified by a camera or a security official five nights and most of six days he had been shut away from sight now the alley and the street door were watched sweat clung to the bodyguard because he remembered her words passed to him gift received love gratitude and always my prayers quietly matter of fact because panic was never his muhammad iyad said we are watched they have observation on us did you get it i did she had heard the rattle of the cameras shutter he eased the camera down from the aperture it was on his lap and she strained forward to see the screen the images flickered what do you think happened up there polly asked first he was looking down the street then he had binoculars i think he was studying us then another man came look there is the second man difficult to identify then movement and both are gone its a bastard isnt it any showout polly is a bastard i think ludvik that we should back off he raised his eyebrows high because you want to piss or you do not like czech cigarettes or because we have shown out she punched his arm polly wilkins shared the interior of the black van with ludvik who was middleranking midthirties middle ambition and opinions in the bezpecostniinformacni sluzba he fancied her no way was she going to get herself involved in a relationship on the rebound with a czech counterintelligence officer even if she had been dumped by email and this was not a place for a relationship to flourish she was desperate to pee but there was no bucket in the van no bucket but a mountain of squashedout cigarette butts between their feet relationships had not been on her mind since she had received dominics new year email i think we should get out leave them undecided not sure you are the boss the representative of the expert in such procedures he seemed to laugh at her as well he might polly wilkins was big on iraq could have bored to goldmedal standard on weaponsofmassdestruction evaluation but was now on a fast learning curve on the czech republic peopletrafficking across porous borders albanian criminality and alqaeda movement there werent enough hours in the day or the night to satisfy the steepness of the curve which was good meant dominics bloody email the hurtful bastard from buenos aires was getting to be history she reckoned ludvik laughed at her because he thought she was wet behind the ears and knew precious little of nothing about stakeouts and surveillance and what would happen next and i want the pix printed up he wriggled into the front she looked back a last time through the hole at the upper window and a dishcloth now hung from it as if to dry but there was rain in the wind he drove away fast leaving her to fall about in the back and cling to the camera she told him about the dishcloth and he swore down kostecna he was shouting into the microphone of his headset god did the daft dumb sweet boy never look at the traffic in front of him he had turned to her teeth shining as he grinned thatll be the signal people who would never pain of death use a phone a signal that they are threatened we have the squad readied well go tonight you want to watch polly want to be there thank you more than rubbernecking on a storm squad going in watching from long distance she wanted to get her hands on the prints off the digital camera wanted them on the airwaves to gaunt shed had his signal that he was taking charge he was almost a parent to her at the end of kostecna half on the pavement were two more closed vans like the green one they had used and the black one and she assumed that that was where the storm squad waited it would be a coup a triumph for him she had time to get a download of the pictures get to the embassy and secure communications send the signals then be back to grandstand the storm squad she giggled she thought of gloria bringing in her signal with the good closeup photograph of the man with the shopping and the longlens image of two men at the window she could imagine old gaunts shoes jerking off his table as he hunched to read what she had sent why do you laugh ludvik called from the front classified she said mockhaughtily uk eyes only the shoes brightly burnished swung from his desk and tipped a file on to the floor gaunt leaned forward and peered down at the photographs little gasps of pleasure slipped from his lips he had a magnifyingglass out of the drawer by his knees and bent lower so that his head was close to the top pictures black and white blown up to plate size without ceremony gloria retrieved the file from the carpet he asked her not looking up if she would be so kind as to cancel dinner that night with the deputy director general a merciful relief but the excuse was cast iron and to ring roman archaeology fourth century at the british museum and postpone with apologies his lunch date for the next day the second set of photographs was more problematic a face at the end of a telephoto image grained and difficult and the same face half masked by a pair of pocket binoculars then a second face behind it but in shadow and indistinct almost with reluctance as if it were a distraction he reached for his telephone he dialled internally was connected to the assistant deputy directors aide and asked steel in his voice not for negotiation for an appointment soonest like in five minutes gloria hovered would she please signal wilco with his congratulations and thanks tie straightened waistcoat fastened jacket on files scooped up and tucked under his arm he headed for the top floor and the adds eyrie the assistant deputy director was gilbert his office was at the start of the corridor leading from the lift promotion for which gilbert strove would take him further down the corridor and ultimately to the double doors and the suite of rooms at the end gilbert had survived the earthquake that had destroyed careers in weapons of mass destruction he had presided over the dismantling of the desk and the shuffling away to side eddies of the victims he was always guiltily awkward in frederick gaunts company yet gaunts approach to him was one of magnanimity and scrupulous deference with the intention of exacerbating the guilt it is muhammad iyad that is confirmed muhammad iyad is a bodyguard a minder he watches the backs of principals and moves them in safety that he set up this flawed chain of messages to get a gift to his wife and then to hear back from her of its safe arrival is and with your experience youll know this better than me quite extraordinary in the past he has escorted highvalue targets into and out of afghanistan into and out of saudi arabia et cetera et cetera you know all that of course you do now and it is a present from heaven to us we have him in prague i venture and id appreciate your opinion on this that he is currently bringing an hvt into western europe i would hazard that such a highvalue target an individual of such importance that muhammad iyad has been given responsibility for him would be a coordinator not a footsoldier or a bomblayer not even a recruiter what i think were looking at and i hope youll feel able to confirm my thought is an albanianorganized rat run for alqaeda isnt that the phrase all the suburbanites bitch about use of sidestreets alleys lanes for the school run in this case the rat run avoids all but the remotest border crossings only goes where there is least scrutiny anyone being brought through with that degree of effort can only be an hvt i guess that were looking at a coordinator theres a face here he shuffled the photographs on the adds desk then laid on top of them the sequence showing the minder with the binoculars and the blurred indistinct image of the partially hidden face behind i suggest that there is our coordinator and if you agree id like to run it through the boffins this evening our friendly czech sisters will arrest iyad and this unidentified man and polly wilkins will be on hand to fight our corner theyre bottled up the bis are only waiting for darkness it should be quite a coup gilbert youll smell deservedly of roses youll be toasted in langley the americans are outside the loop at the moment when we care to announce it with trumpets he was going out carrying his files was at the door may i say freddie that i much admire your attitude you know to life so very professional thank you kind words are always appreciated a blurt i was very sad at what happened to you i moved mountains to block it but was overruled from on high it wasnt me never thought it was gilbert im grateful for your friendship a coordinator will be a good catch and hell be all yours he strode off down the corridor towards the lift it was said throughout the lower floors of vauxhall bridge cross that the assistant deputy director had saved himself only by an excess of brownnosed diligence but it made frederick gaunt happier to hear the cretin squirm but true happiness would be the capture of a coordinator and the breaking of a rat run he stood naked in front of the wardrobe and sang to himself a song of the mountains a fighting mans song his fingers ran over the material of the suit jackets hanging in front of him his voice reached a crescendo as he made his choice there were ten suits from which timo rahman could select the one he would wear and twenty ironed and folded shirts were in the wardrobe drawers on the rail inside the left door were forty ties at his fathers knee he had first learned the words of the song and the lilt of its tune the suit he took from its hanger was expensive but not ostentatiously priced in the shop overlooking the waters and the needle fountain of the inner alster the shirt had been bought for him by alicia in the monckebergstrasse where she liked to go where the bear accompanied her the tie had been a present from the girls for his last birthday his fiftythird what he would wear that evening had quiet class he thought but would not have cost as much as what would be worn by any of the three men who would entertain him for the concert and then for business over a late dinner they were bankers they could show the finery and demonstrate the wealth of their profession timo rahman and it was the basic rule of his life never courted attention the mirror on the right door of the wardrobe as his song died from its peak reflected his body in the flesh at the side of his chest was a puckered still angry scar the width of a pencil the result of a calibre bullet on his muscled belly near his navel was a second scar five centimetres in length where a knife had slashed but had not penetrated the stomach wall that evening the bankers would see neither the bullet nor the knife wound they were from many years back it was eighteen years since timo rahman had left his father left the mountains north of lake shkodra and had been one more albanian making the trek to the german city of hamburg in search of success he had found it the evidence of it was that he would be the guest of three bankers for a concert at the city hall and would be taken to the fischerhaus a private room for dinner where they would scrabble for his investment cash the days when he had fought were long past success was his timo rahman was the pate of hamburg at police headquarters far out to the north of the city at brunogeorgesplatz they would refuse to accept the presence of a godfather in the city but he ruled it the city was his as he dressed the girls came to him brought by their mother they chattered to him of their day at school in blankenese and what they would be doing the next day they could have walked to school from the villa but that argument was long over they did not walk the five hundred metres to the school with their friends they were driven by the bear it was his rule and beyond dispute their mother alicia knew it but the girls did not a man of timo rahmans prominence in the world of organized crime had many enemies they drove to school and the bear was always armed and the pistol listed as being for target practice was legally held the girls had holidayed in albania his country and alicias but they would grow up as germans and would know nothing of the source of their loving fathers wealth they chattered about school outings sports events and music lessons he was straightening his tie listening to them and indulging them and he turned both the girls had their backs to the picture on the dressingroom wall they never noticed it now had not spoken of it since they were small he looked past them listening to them but without attention timo rahman could have bought any painting in any gallery in the city of hamburg financially no work of art oils or watercolour was beyond him on the wall behind the girls in his dressing room was the picture of which he was most proud once black and white now sepiatinted with little tears at the sides and a line across it diagonally where it had once been crudely folded it had written on it in faded writing in the english language for mehmet rahman a worthy comrade in arms and a most loyal friend affectionately hugo anstruther lake shkodra april it showed a hillside and a cave and in the foreground was a smoking fire with a cooking tin on it three men sat crosslegged near the fire anstruther was the tallest head and shoulders above mehmet timos father and the squat cheerful little man who was percy capel behind nearer to the caves entrance were five of his fathers followers all draped with ammunition belts and proudly displaying the weapons dropped for them on the day of his fathers burial near to that cave his mother had given timo rahman the picture from his fathers bedroom it was still in the plastic frame bought in shkodra fifty years before it was an icon for him and his daughters never spoke of it as if the privilege of youth in blankenese in the villa up the deadend private road in hamburg had erased any interest in it each time he sang that song he thought of his father and gazed at the valued photograph and the link lived on but he had no time that evening to reflect on it timo rahman kissed the girls told alicia not that it was her business he would be late back the bear who would have died for him drove him into the city no no dont turn your back on me i want to know how did you twist him she was tony johnsons wife every senior officer at the national crime squad said she had had a better future than him would at least have made inspector and might have gone as high as commander but shed jacked it in and now worked in an antiques shop and said it had taken years off her getting out come on come on spit it out when he had come back last night she had been asleep and had still been asleep when he had gone to work that morning hed done the day then a crash conference had been called without notice in the evening on his specialist work area organizedimmigration crime he hadnt had the car with him and a points failure had held up the trains they were in bed and he was desperate for sleep no way he could treat her as need to know if she hadnt packed it in hed have been calling her maam by now she knew everything he did about the life and times of malachy kitchen he told her what hed said in the parking area you never had a mate who fell through a roof and did his spine he shrugged youve never told me youd been to stoke mandeville hospital have you he shook his head you invented the whole bloody thing right he nodded is he up for it theyre vicious little creatures what is it theyre called yes right scumbags and you told me the high fly boys theyll be fine for a start can he do the business he kissed her reached over and switched off the light on her side then swung himself away from her all right i havent seen millie and you have but this is heavy stuff i only hope youre comfortable with i t the high fly boys ruled that corner of the estate their territory was blocks eight nine ten and eleven the rough track boys had different ground over towards the old kent road and the young walworth boys had the blocks on the west side of the amersham the high fly boys kept to their own patch which had fair pickings and if there were no sales they could smash in a car window for its radio or run keys down its side then demand cash for its future protection or break any sheet of glass that was not reinforced with mesh or jostle a mother with her pram the police never caught them no one on the estate ever dared to inform on them they ran free they pushed wraps of brown they bought from the amershams main dealer sold on to the vagrants took their share and strutted the streets alleys and walkways of the part of the estate that was theirs their uniform shoplifted or gained by threats from a store manager who didnt need hassle was a sleek leisure suit adidas or nike trainers that were top of the range gold chains and they talked a code patois that coppers couldnt crack each in the high fly boys had his own tag danny morriss was cisco he was mixed race from a onenight stand between a white american usaf technician and his west indian mother he led the high fly boys he rode a mountain bike stolen if there was war he had access to a pistol hired by the twentyfour hours if it was normal he carried a switchblade knife he had no fear of what police or the courts could do to him he could barely read but knew the telephone number of a solicitor and understood enough arithmetic to work out his cut from what he sold he knew by heart all of the regulations governing stopandsearch by police officers all of the custody legislation a probation officer had once told him he was arrogant and in denial of your unacceptable behaviour and he had spat in the mans face he was eighteen years old and had no comprehension of the next weeks horizon he took a pitch each evening near the door of the pensioners association and waited for instructions from the dealer on the nights trading already there his bike against the wall was leroy gates leroys tag was younger cisco his ethnic mix was italian father whereabouts unknown and west indian mother he was sixteen could neither read nor write and stammered when stressed excluded from mainstream education at fourteen after four suspensions he was classified in a confidential socialservices report as effectively outside parental and institutional control and locked in a culture of despair he refuses to believe that worthwhile opportunities other than petty criminality are open to him his angelic face and sad eyes were hidden by a ski mask when he thieved he was the hard one of the gang last to the corner by the pensioners association doorway shuttered and locked was wilbur sansom aged fifteen with the tag younger younger cisco in the identifying style of the gangs roaming the estate it was probable from the colour of his skin and the structure of his face bones that he was of north african and arabic origin it was not known at a few weeks old he had been dumped in a telephone box in deptford then fostered for the courts and in the past for school registers he had the family name of the proxy parents sansom his first name had been allocated to him by a nurse at the hospital he had been brought to from the telephone box he was a disappointment to teachers fosterparents police and social workers younger younger cisco he would not answer to anything else could read well and write with a strong hand a child psychiatrist had rated him as having above average intelligence he was slight in build and seemingly unthreatening so the sansoms had given him a mobile phone for his fourteenth birthday so that he would feel more secure when he was crossing the estate to and from school or the youth club the rough track boys had beaten him more than was necessary to steal his phone it had been replaced by his fosterparents but within a week he had come home mouth bleeding without the second phone courtesy of the young walworth boys he had offered himself to ciscos gang for protection as a visible member of the high fly boys he was no longer a target for violence he never went to school was known to the police had collected four court cautions and was threatened next with an antisocial behaviour order he cared nothing with his gang he was safe his value to cisco and younger cisco was simple he could read the instructions written on cigarette paper by the dealer for pickups and dropoffs he was their eyes later as the night closed down on the amersham they would move to a black hole in a fence behind which block eights big rubbish containers were stored and shadowy figures would flit towards them the vagrants they despised clutching money and ready to buy everyone who wanted wraps and craved brown knew where to find them for the three teenagers it was a night the same as any other and cold rain spattered the shoulders of their leisure suits as they waited for the early buyers it was like the first steps on an icecovered pond malachy laid out in front of him what he had bought rope from the hardware shop on walworth road and a penknife to cut it parcelbinding tape from the stationers in the sidestreet off the market and a plastic toy from a stall he also had the clothes from the binliner that had been under the bed he checked the purchases and the clothing as he had before it might have been kit and weapons for an exercise on salisbury plain the northumbrian moors or a patrol in a sprawling iraqi village he went through each stage of the plan that had fastened in his mind he could rely on what he had seen done he had been at the depot for recruits a week short of the end of fiftysix days basic training before he had left home his father had told him youre pig stupid to have gone this route i wash my hands of you all i can say is remember that a lion pride rejects a weak cub drop short of your platoons standards and the rest of them will be merciless the private soldier turns into a ruthless thug when punished collectively for the failure of one of their number but its your choice hed gone no letters from the retired brigadier and none written to him or to malachys mother one recruit was useless should have gone for premature voluntary release but hadnt quit that recruit had been half dragged and half carried in full kit on the halfmile road run he had been coveredfor when he had lost his beret his final act had been the making of his barrackroom bed wrinkles in the hospital corners of the blanket an officer doing the inspection with the platoon sergeant had commented on it snidely after escorting the officer out of the barracks room the sergeant had come back and gone nose to nose with that recruit and had bollocked him with a spittledense volley of obscenities then barked the punishment the sergeant had been shown up in front of the officer and had gone for the topheavy punishment collective the platoon was confined to barracks for five days with extra duties and doubled inspections malachy had stood at the back not spoken not intervened and had not taken part when the platoon took its revenge on that recruit in flat thirteen on block nine of the amersham he remembered the revenge of the platoon it was what he would replicate but he did not know whether it was for millie johnsons bruised face and broken arm or for himself when he had checked each item he would take with him for the third or fourth time the rope had been cut into lengths and the plastic toy was out of its packaging malachy stripped off the clothes that had been bought for him at the charity shop the trousers in the binliner stank as did the shirt and socks he dressed in the vagrants clothes he had worn in the underpass at elephant and castle when he had begged drunk and slept he put on his head the rolledup woollen hat that had been pulled down over his face with eye slits and a mouth hole on the nights when it was cold enough for a pond to freeze last out of the sack were the old shoes and he slipped them on he locked the door behind him and went off along the walkway paused for a moment at the top of the stairs ground his nails into his palms as if that would strengthen him and joined the nights shadows moving on the amersham chapter four on another morning the sirens would have woken malachy dawn was breaking over the estate he slept until full daylight there was no reason for him to rouse himself get up and wash decide whether to shave with the blunt blade and dress in the charityshop clothes he had not been asleep when the sirens started vague and distant at first then clearer as they came closer he had not slept because he had waited for the sirens had lain in his bed ears keen through the long hours of darkness when the sirens approached coming up the old kent road then swinging into the amersham he could have pushed himself off the bed gone to the window and looked out over the plaza towards the flat roof of block eleven but he did not he knew what the ambulancemen the fire brigade and the police would find it had rained in the night but with the dawn came a low sunshine that spilled through the window he had not drawn the curtains if he had slipped off the bed and looked out on to the far side of the plaza the suns weak light would have fastened on his work he had no need to see it the clothes from his work were now back in the binliner with his shoes the penknife the remaining tape on the roll and the plastic toy he did not know yet whether he felt satisfaction at what he had done he rubbed his cheek and could feel the thin scratches from fingernails that had penetrated the woollen hat there was a bruise on his right shin where one had kicked him but it was only with a trainer and the bruise was little more than an irritant nothing in comparison to those on the face of millie johnson he rolled over turned his face to the wall and his eyes were locked shut others would come to stand and gawp but malachy had no need to a crowd gathered on the worn grass beside the kids swings and roundabouts in the plaza that morning dawn would be late for the ministry it was too good to miss her supervisor always said that a watch could be set on dawns punctuality at work even when she had had the flu she had been there with the mop and bucket and the vacuum cleaner not that early morning she positioned herself at the edge of the crowd did not reckon to use her bony elbows to force a way to the front at the back she was closer to the parked fire engines the two ambulances the police cars and wagon it was the best show she had seen in many years on the estate better than any of the christmas cabarets at the pensioners association or at the annual parties for the tenants association two of them had been hoisted up on to the flat roof of block eleven and one still hung suspended from the rope where she was dawn could hear the conversations among the firemen the ambulance teams and police officers and it was good listening a fireman said to his senior who had just reached the plaza never known anything like it chief not on the amersham i suppose its a feud between the lowlifes what the army would call blue on blue done a proper job though theyre all taped up ankles together and wrists behind their backs and theyve gags in their mouths then rope was tied round the ankles and they were hung out over the edge of the roof with the rope fastened to the blocks communal tv aerial been there half the night and they couldnt shout because of the gags in their mouths and they wouldnt have wriggled around would they bloody sure i wouldnt not with more than a sixtyfoot drop under me and my life depending on whether the ropes knot held id have done what they did stayed damn still the word is that theyre the kingpins of the local horror story call themselves the high fly boys tell you what chief they were that they were high and they were flying except for the rope must have been there for hours and nobody saw them till the light came up what im getting theyre right nasty scallys theyre the gang that push the classa stuff round the estate last night if youd asked me id have said and sworn on it that they were frightened of nothing different story now dont quote me chief but this callouts been a real pleasure in front of dawn the crowd parted few of the residents who lived in the flats overlooking the plaza dared to look direct into the faces of the two youths who were escorted by the ambulance crew and police officers through the opening that the residents made dawn recognized leroy gates and wilbur sansom everybody on that part of the amersham knew them they sold the vagrants bought it went through her mind fast because they sold and the vagrants bought her best friend the closest was in hospital with an operation scheduled for that evening the swelling would be down enough to pin or plate a broken arm and her face was a bright mass of bruises the thought of leroy gates and wilbur sansom swinging upside down through half the night and no help coming was sufficient to bring a smile to dawns face the first time she had allowed herself that little luxury since the call had come and she had rushed out no night buses to tramp all the way to the hospital by the river she did what none of the others in the split crowd did she fastened her eye on them but they didnt meet her gaze they shivered if the ambulance crew had not held them up by the arms they would have collapsed she spat in front of them had never done anything as crude in her life before they came past her and she looked away from them and up towards the roof of block eleven the third was being pulled up by firemen towards the angled edge of the flat roof she heard what was said an ambulance girl spoke to her boss first signs are and its extraordinary theres not a mark on them they were traumatized when the fire guys lifted them up on to the roof but we did quick checks on their bodies and we didnt find anything they werent beaten nothing like that they cant speak in a state of terror ive been here before when theres been war between the high fly boys and the rough track boys and theres been blood not this time i hope theyve put them on plastic because theyve wet themselves and shat themselves god do they stink my opinion they should go to hospital for a checkover maybe stay for a days observation but its not medical help they need theyre in shock i doubt anything in their charming little lives has been like this dont know how id be if id been hung out to dry like a bloody piece of washing makes you think doesnt it and wondering whether the rope would hold different isnt it not that im complaining but its not what usually happens when these dysfunctional creatures scrap just different the last group came through the crowd and headed for the cluster of vehicles dawn saw danny morris his face was pale grey and she could see where tears had streamed from his eyes and had run up by the bridge of his nose and over his forehead he was carried his nike suit had been pure white but the crotch was stained and the fabric over his buttocks she rejoiced the barricades on doors such as millie had the fear of old people about going out into the night the need to clasp at a handbag and try to keep it safe from being snatched were because of the likes of danny morris if it had been the day before if she had seen him and the others walking on the pavement towards her she would have backed away into a recess and hoped she wasnt noticed she did not look into his eyes but with purpose stared at the groin stain and hoped he would see it was a pity if it was what the fireman had called blue on blue it would have been better if those on the amersham had set aside their fear and struck back not possible if the rough track boys had done this there was still cause to rejoice behind danny morris a policewoman carried the plastic evidence bags small ones contained wraps the larger ones lengths of rope and cut sections of heavy masking tape dawn saw that danny morris who was hardly capable of walking and whose arms were held was handcuffed a policeman briefed his sergeant its bizarre and it leaves me confused doesnt seem right for us to put this down to the other gangs any sort of fight and there would be blood mayhem noise chaos none of that not a word not a call and not a sound somehow somebody got them up on the roof having broken down the entry door up there trussed them like bloody chickens fastened the ropes to the tv aerial stanchion lowered them over the edge and walked away thats not the rough track boys or the young walworth boys they havent the wit for it for them it would have been knives and perhaps a shooter if there was that much aggravation between them its sort of vigilante stuff but weve never had that all the time ive been on the amersham there arent the sort of people here whore up for i t i just dont understand looking on the bright side and theres reason for that they each had a wrap and i guarantee itll be a wrap of heroin in their pocket at the least we can do them for possession of a classa drug if the sun shines on us we can probably add intention to trade they were so scared that little rat morris he clung to my legs when we got him up and safe like i was his guardian angel its made my day only one cloud if the high fly boys are out of business lost too much face and theres a hole then more scumbagsll be lining up to fill it still someone did the business and did it well if you know what i mean the ambulances drove away then the fire engines and the police numbers scaled down as the crowd thinned dawn glanced down at her watch and started to run she needed to be lucky and get a bus quick on the walworth road as she puffed out of the estate she thought of the excuses to be concocted for her supervisor and what she would tell millie later she would be at the hospital straight after work be there when they took millie down to theatre and be in the ward for when she came back from the operation she ran well happy they should have gone at midnight but the assault had been delayed till five in the morning then more delay it was now past eight and polly saw ludvik stride along the pavement towards her he was grinning hand lifted thumb raised about damn time too behind him at the end of the alley the storm squad backs flat against the wall edged towards the outer door big men black overalls helmeted and enough fire power in their fists to start a war the first postponement had been about the other occupants on the staircase leading to the topfloor apartment under the roof should they be moved to safety and how much noise would that make how much warning would it give there had been a debate and at two in the morning as she had shivered under her coat a minister had come to add his opinion and justin braithwaite her station chief had pitched up to add his pennyworth but by five oclock it had been agreed that the other occupants would be left to their beauty sleep then the second postponement did they need a probe audio or visual drilled up from the floor underneath into the apartment and how much noise would that make and how would they get into that apartment without waking the dead throughout the building with his second pennyworth braithwaite had been succinct for fucks sake just get on with it then there had been interference on the radio links between the storm squad and their control braithwaite had gone back to his bed a second minister had come and there was the question of what would happen to the building historic part of the citys heritage dating back to the fifteenthcentury rule of wenceslas the fourth when the topfloor apartment was stormed they had waited for more firetenders to reach kostecna then other occupants had started to leave for work and had had to be grabbed and silenced at gunpoint more arguments now they were going polly wilkins had once spent a day with what frederick gaunt irreverently called the hereford gun club she had been with three other recent service incomers to the special forces on the edge of a country market town there she had stood under an old clock tower and read the inscription we are the pilgrims master we shall go always a little further it may be beyond that last blue mountain buried with snow across that angry or glimmering sea shed thought it naff and selfindulgent until shed watched a training session in their killing room she had been deafened and almost frightened to death by the explosions and ricocheting rounds the smoke and the shouting and shed crept back to london in awe of the pace and ruthlessness of the simulated attack now men from the prague police were going into a killing room doing it for real she wondered how good they were from hereford she remembered overwhelming power and speed were these men young czechs good enough time to find out ludvik strode close to her she recalled the last signal from gaunt good on you wilco from this distant end we anticipate the capture of a fullblown coordinator we are all ears gaunt she had always been wilco to frederick gaunt his little joke old raf slang for will comply was wilco it was a name that indicated his admiration for her polly wilkins did as she was asked and more had the dedication other women at vauxhall bridge cross thought it patronizing she did not and wore the name like a badge with pride ludvik said we are going now as your mr braithwaite remarked for fucks sake just get on with it we are at last to get on with it perhaps it will be spectacular you have a seat in the best row of the theatre and please ludvik shut up it was not meant to wound his enthusiasm but polly wilkins thought it almost obscene that a storm gun against gun body against body faith against commitment should be treated as theatre by those who would not be a part of it in the killing room at hereford as they had come in she had sensed naked terror and had realized the acute danger created by the assault the squad was out of her sight had disappeared through the outer door she imagined them creeping softfooted up the worn stone steps of the staircase behind her beyond the police cordon the fire engines revved their engines and made ready and the ambulances had the doors open and the attack started from the upper window under the old roof tiles where the dishcloth still hung came the sound of battering fast desperate blows the strike against the apartment doors lock then the shooting at first one weapon recognizable by its sharp clatter on automatic then answering gunshots a scream shouting competed with the firing she knew instinctively that it had already failed half a minute after the first blows on the door high in the building with a sledgehammer polly wilkins knew it was screwed by now if the storm squad had succeeded there should have been the thunderclap of the flash grenades in the room and the curl of the immobilizing gas swirling from the window she thought that the bodyguard and the man reckoned by gaunt to be a coordinator had been ready for them and waiting more volleys of shots but not the flash grenades and not the gas canisters ludvik said i think they will be inside very soon accept it her voice was cold theyre not inside because of the bloody heritage you waited too long it failed you cannot call it failure which is insulting you cannot yet call it failure they are closed in they have nowhere to go she said as if tiredness swept over her what my boss would say dead theyre hunks of meat alive theyre an intelligence dream we wanted to talk to them he bridled i suppose you will report we are incompetent i will report that the heritage of the old city dictated more fire engines were ordered up that you had many fire engines but no explosives to blow the door off they are inside that is what is important he faced her intense trapped i tell you polly i believe you give these people too great an admiration they will shoot and they will think when they have thought of their position they will surrender they are going nowhere give an enemy too much importance and he will dominate you she blinked as the pain of exhaustion caught her she looked up the alley two casualties were brought out the one with the face wound had rich red blood dribbling from the mouth in his balaclava and she could hear the choke in his throat the other was carried by two colleagues and his hands were across his lower stomach down from the bottom edge of his bulletproof vest and he howled as they struggled to run with him she felt small alone so inadequate and ludvik alerted by the beat of the boots and the howl watched with her polly said quietly i dont give them too much importance they went back to a cafe behind the cordon he crawled across the floor towards the halfopen window it was slow going and the pain came in rivers it was a big effort for him to crawl and a bigger one for him to locate the grenades pin and work his finger into it he gasped dragged out the pin then propped himself up on an elbow and tossed it through the window for a moment it seemed to bounce on the sill and he wondered if it would roll back and drop down beside him but it did not far below he heard it bounce mens yells panic and the explosion muhammad iyad bought time not much time left to him but time for the man he protected the door was barricaded with the cooker and the refrigerator and with the mattresses from the beds all wedged between the door and the wall opposite by the table chairs and the wardrobe from the bedroom if they came close on the landing above the staircase he fired sprays of bullets on automatic above the barricade then slithered back to a corner where the answering shots could not find him he was down now to his last grenade and to his last three magazines of bullets he lay in a pool of his own blood it was smeared across the carpet from each time he had manoeuvred himself to the firing position it came from a chest wound and from his shattered knee to kill the pain he had only his faith in god and the image of his wife and the thought that the man would use well the time given him it was an hour more than an hour since they had last approached the door when he had expended a whole magazine from the machine pistol and a handful of minutes since he had thrown a fourth grenade through the slit of the open window of course he would die in the little room on the top floor in a city far from his home and the family he loved he had no fear of death the only uncertainty in the mind of muhammad iyad was that he had not given the man the time that was needed before they had come in the night before he had heaved the barricade into place he had cleaned the apartment with water and soap he had scrubbed down every surface where the mans fingers might have rested plates he had eaten off and cups or glasses he had drunk from the bedding in which he had slept the clothes from the mans bag his toothbrush razor and spare trainer shoes were piled in a loose heap in the rooms centre they were there because muhammad iyad was one of the few in the organization who understood the power of the enemy the skill of their fingerprint experts and the quality of their ability to examine for microscopic particles of dna were known to him no trace of his man was to remain when the ability to fight not the will for it had seeped from muhammad iyads body there were new sounds beyond the barricade scraping noises as rats might make and he thought they chipped away stones from the dividing wall under the roof tiles and sought to come at him from above he knew about the grenades with the thunder noise that deafened and the flash that blinded and about the gas that choked too long if he waited for them to come waited too long and he was unable to light the fire but every second he delayed each minute every hour he bought gave the man more time they were closer more urgent in their work muhammad iyad hoped that prayers would be said for him he trusted that in his village in the faraway mountains of yemen men would speak well of him there was a story of the dying moments of the great prince saladin who had defeated the crusaders on the hill of kurnhattin he had been told the story as a child by the imam of the village when saladin lay dying he called for his standardbearer and ordered him to ride round the limits of the city of damascus with a tornoff rag from saladins shroud on the tip of the standardbearers spear and to shout out that saladin had gone with no more of his possessions to his grave than his shroud it was fitting to be so humble and muhammad iyad hoped to ape the great prince nothing would go to his unmarked grave the body buried in the dead of night but his faith in god his love for his family and his sense of duty to his brothers and friends he fired an angled burst into the ceiling towards where the scraping had been and heard the rats squirm back an oath was muffled by the stonework and the ceilings plaster cascaded down to whiten him and make a film over the blood in which he lay like the snow of the afghan mountains he reloaded tossed away the empty magazine and called instructions as if he was ordering another man where to be and when to fire he felt the weakness growing knew that god and paradise beckoned if he delayed if the weakness overwhelmed him the dna would not be destroyed he took the last grenade from the black bag and the last magazines and a box of matches he laid the grenade on the whitened floor put the magazines on top of the heap of bedding and clothes then made a little burrowed space at their base he tore up scraps of paper from the bag the coded instructions for each move forward in the journey he struck the first match and the paper lit then he struck a second match lit the paper better and a third and blew lightly on the fire blood from the chest wound was at his lips when he saw the flames climb and spread muhammad iyad pulled the pin from the grenade and slid it under his stomach his gut held down the lever if he moved or was moved the lever would fly free and seven seconds later the grenade would detonate the smoke gathered in the room and the wind from the open window fanned the fire when the bedding and clothing under the magazine caught and the heat reached furnace point the bullets would explode and career round the room and into the walls and the ceiling which would win more minutes if he shifted away from the fire the grenade would explode he did not think he could have done more to win the man time to get clear and resume the journey to the north german coastline he had something that day to tell his wife the wind came in low off the sea and caught the wires that divided the gardens of the properties in westdorf the homes the few that were occupied all year and the many that were opened and aired only when the tourist season started were now packed close together when oskar and gertrud had come to the island of baltrum in their flight from his familys past it had been a perfect refuge now every handkerchief of open ground in westdorf and in the twin community of ostdorf was packed solid with buildings he the complainant each time there was a whisper of new foundations going in was now overlooked each summer and swamped by visitors he hated them if oskar had not been so old and the arthritis in his knees had been less acute he told himself he would have moved to the neighbouring island of langeoog or even to the more deserted spiekeroog but it was a fantasy gertrud was at ostdorf and he would never leave her oskar netzer lived in an old house in the heart of westdorf homes on the island did not have names but were identified by numbers the lower the number the older the house a hundred years before his would have been the home of a fisherman its number was a but around him and prying into his life were and all were empty locked and shuttered and would stay that way till easter week he loathed easter when the hordes returned no one visited oskar at house number a no guests were invited in anyone who called could state their business at the door even if the rain lashed on them in the years since gertruds death not a single person had seen the inside of his living room or gone up the stairs and witnessed the state of the bedroom or been led into the kitchen for a welcoming mug of coffee the house was enveloped with grime his living room was littered table chairs and floor with planning applications for development he rotated the sheets on his bed every three or four weeks and hung out the dirty ones in summer or winter to be washed by the rain the winds took away their smell in the kitchen pots plates and pans were encrusted with fat it was and his neighbours were loud in their complaints when they arrived for their summer vacations from bremen or hamburg cologne or dusseldorf a pigsty their opinions did not concern him and the filth of his home had little effect on his health the resident doctor on the island had opined that oskar netzer was not mentally unstable merely eccentric the secret of his past the shame he carried through blood was known only to him and had been shared only with gertrud who was dead now in a month there would be a mass of wild flowers that he could pick from his overgrown garden lawn which was never mown and take to the cemetery that day there were daffodils for cutting the wind snatched at his overalls and heavy coat ripped at his old frislanders cap and rifled against his face he left his front door flapping open a councillor came out of the supermarket oskar had opposed the building of the second supermarket had succeeded in delaying it for two years before permission was given behind the supermarket were the high floodlights of the public tennis courts oskar had fought them and their building had been postponed for twentyeight months until his objections were overruled to the mainland side of the tennis courts was the monstrosity of the fitness studio his greatest defeat but for every failure there had been successes a block of holiday apartments permission reluctantly refused by the council an allweather football pitch and eight new homes and now the extension to the pasta and pizza outlet the councillor with his trolley was in front of him what a charming sight the dutiful widower with flowers a devoted man for whom a stranger might feel sympathy your way the island would be concreted from north to south oskar growled from east to west but the stranger would be ignorant the stranger would not have known of the poison an old fool can spurt i do whats right for baltrum flatulent arrogance cant keep your nose out can you have to interfere the island survives on the money it makes in the season and only a senile idiot fails to see that fact step aside when ive finished the councillor spat back all of us in a competitive world strive for the future of the island each year thousands of euros which could be better spent on our community are wasted by the required legal investigations to your objections you one man bleed us dry prying and interfering herr netzer is all you are good for i say this and i am not proud of it she is better where she is than listening to the drivel you manufacture would you have made money from the extension to the pasta and pizza place i offer you the future one day you will interfere once too often pry into a hole find a wasps nest and be stung who then will help you i go my own way i know what is right the trolley was pushed out of his path the wind fluttered the councillors hair the short spat had no effect on oskar he thought that the price he paid for his vigilance was the rudeness of those who did not comprehend his concern for the island of baltrum he would not change he would fight until death took him as it had taken gertrud he strode away and his fist was tight on the stems of the daffodils to his right was the grass strip for light aircraft to land he had opposed it and said that the noise of the planes would disturb the islands wildlife further to his right was the little lake that was fed only by rainwater and the field converted to a childrens play area he had opposed that and said it was too adjacent to the westheller the marshland a summer haven for wading birds before he reached ostdorf the smaller of the two villages at the western end of the island a horsedrawn cart had veered by him because he would not give way all building work was done in autumn winter and spring and the materials were brought in by the ferry then loaded on to horsedrawn carts to be taken to the site this one was to change a twobedroom house into a fivebedroom eyesore the extra rooms for visitors and that fight too after a year of conflict he had lost he came to the cemetery at the limit of ostdorfs development the flowerbeds in the garden of house number a which she had tended were overgrown and beyond recognition but the daffodils she had planted still flourished for him to pick the garden in front of her grave was meticulously tended not a weed in the sandy soil he bent awkwardly lowered himself to kneel and laid the flowers in front of the stone they had a cleanness and purity about them which should have been the islands virtues on baltrum gertrud dead five years had been the only soul who knew of his past and the torture it had brought him she had sat beside him and his mother in the hamburg lawyers office when his uncles will was read and when the letter of confession with a dying mans shake in the handwriting had been produced first the letter had been read in the lawyers clipped tone its second reading had been in his mothers halting shocked voice the confession had driven him from his work as a construction foreman in the blohm amp voss shipyard he had resigned the day after the visit to the lawyers room in the humid summer of he had sold their property a threeroom apartment in hamburgrothenburgsort cheaply for speed they had gone to baltrum bought the house and he had believed himself safe from the intrusion of the outside world as a child oskar netzer had come through the feuersturm bombing in august as an adult he should have been stronger when confronted with the letter of confession he had not it had made of him the selfcentred recluse kneeling in front of the weathered stone he was alone with her the only company other than the beloved eider ducks that he sought i showed them my sweetheart that they could not ignore me they loathe me but i do not care i thought they would burst blood vessels now coming here i am accosted by a councillor you will remember him schulz with the face of a goat he accuses me of interference prying putting my nose where it has no business the idiot thinks he offends me i am proud of his description more important my sweetheart is that the eider are back the rain came on harder soaking his shoulders and the back of the coat and dribbling on his face it crushed the blooms of the daffodils and ran on to the stone in truth not much more than interference prying and putting his nose into other persons business remained in the life of oskar netzer it was his spine the bear drove timo rahman away from the house in blankenese as they approached the electrically operated gates timo lowered the window extended his arm and waved he looked back and for a moment glimpsed the wan face of alicia in an upstairs window but she did not wave to him they pulled out into a quiet street and he had the window up again to neighbours there was little remarkable about the albanian who had come to live among them in blankenese a speckgurtel district of hamburg blankenese was one of the affluent baconbelt areas of the city where the wellfed had their homes those neighbours knew little of the man who kept himself to himself whose wife they rarely saw whose children were taken by car to school and driven home his name was not in the newspapers he did not entertain locally and offers of drinks or summer barbecues were always politely refused we are already committed on that evening weekend lunchtime and so are unable to accept your kind invitation it was the way of the pate that the least should be known about him he had come far in his life from the village north of shkodra in the albanian mountains close to the border with montenegro a vw passat had been parked on the main road backed into a driveway so that its occupants could see up the deadend street and respond easily to whichever way his car turned on the main road north towards the blankenese station for the sbahn line or south and the elbchaussee timo leaned across the bears shoulder and peered into the mirror a woman was driving the passat with a man as her frontseat passenger sometimes the surveillance on him was covert and needed his instinct and the bears to spot sometimes the police of the organisierte kriminalitat section put a car on his tail in the full knowledge that it would be instantly identified it was a gesture covert or obvious and one to be ignored lesser men than timo rahman were in the maximumsecurity wing of the gaol at fuhlsbuttel other than to visit a blood relation eleven years back he had never been there and such visits were now inappropriate and beneath his stature he did not remark on the passat two cars back in the traffic behind them neither did the bear it was the assumption of timo rahman that every remark he made in his bedroom his kitchen his car at a business meeting was overheard by audio devices he had been told that the police of the organisierte kriminalitat boasted to favoured politicians that the equipment available to them was the best in europe nothing that incriminated him ever passed his lips and those he dealt with were schooled at the same desk he discussed with the bear as the vw passat followed them the weather forecast for that day in northern germany as any of his neighbours would have inside the speed limit the bear drove down elbchaussee set back from the wide road which wound down from the high ground above the river were the great mansions where the elite of the citys commerce and banking had made their homes with views across the estuary to the airbus factory he could have lived there could have moved alicia and the girls into an elbchaussee home but it would have drawn attention to him timo lived in blankenese without the views among the chief executives and principal department heads and did not draw comment but his financial empire always moving on a steady path to greater legitimacy based on stocks and bonds property holdings and aircraft leasings could have bought him the best fewer than a dozen men and the woman whose face had been at the upper window of his home could have brought down the empire of the pate could have consigned timo rahman to the fuhlsbuttel gaol by their testimony he had no fear of them alicia watched by her aunt in all her waking hours at the villa was incapable of action the bear could have sent him to the prison they called santafu but the idea was ludicrous the net of loyalty around timo of which the bear was part was the same in hamburg as it was in the mountains of albania it was based on the centuriesold diktats laid out in the canun of lek dukagjen was based on the besa which was a mans word of honour and violation created an inevitable hakmarrje the blood feud as his father had in albania timo rahman sat at the head of a clan a fis in hamburg he had brought with him the disciplines of the canun from the village north of shkodra to the richest of german cities and with his baggage had been the impenetrable strength of the fis the route the bear took him that day was past the old fish market where he had been shot by a russian in the right side of his upper chest it was when the russians had come refugees into the city sensed the wealth of the pickings narcotics weapons girls and sought to muscle aside the power in place some of the russian groups had been persuaded at gunpoint to go elsewhere some had laughed at the advice and had fought for territory timos way had sent the message five times russians dead packed like herrings into ice boxes then dumped in the boots of cars which were pushed off the quay of the fish market car park into the waters of the elbe the man who had shot him spitting through his gag struggling to break the rope on his elbows had gone into the boot of his mercedes and he timo had slammed down the lid all the way to the quays edge there had been kicking inside the b o o t and he had helped to push the car over the edge he had had no more difficulties with russians three or four of the men who had helped him in those days twelve years before could have put him with their testimony into a cell at the santafu but they were all the gjak blood relations who would not have contemplated betrayal the passat remained behind them and took the same turn away from the fish market political friends men bought with money told him of the director of the unit that dealt with what they designated organized crime the pinnacle of the directors police career would be the conviction of timo rahman but he would never reach it the bear headed for the reeperbahn it was where timo had begun where he had been knifed he took the narrow cut through and they were held up behind a tourist bus that paused for photographs of the street with the high wall at its end and the gap through which only pedestrians could go to the brothels at the police station high and brickbuilt on the corner of the reeperbahn where the detectives had always failed to link him to ownership and immoral earnings the bear swung right and into the wide street young fresh from albania he had dismissed the germans who ran the reeperbahn fought them and overwhelmed them three or four of those who had been at his side in that little war of guns and knives all albanians from the northern mountains could have sworn evidence and imprisoned him but they were miqs relatives by marriage and would have died rather than be accused of treachery against him now increasingly he was clean his business activities were distant from the wars on which he had built his empire the bear brought him to schauenburgstrasse and the premises of one of the oldest and most respected legal companies in hamburg a fellow guest but arriving by a different doorway off the street would be a city politician against whom no stigma of corruption existed in a private room over lunch there would be discussion on the development funds necessary for the building of highquality offices on one of the few bombsites remaining from the feuersturm minor investment and major profit in return for development permission being nodded through planning neither the politician nor the lawyer who would chair the discussion knew of the canun or of the fis had little comprehension of the reach of a blood feud and the vicious reprisals that could be brought down on them and their families but they understood the threat of public disgrace that an appearance in court would bring them and those they loved and they would not have lasted a sentence of imprisonment in the fuhlsbuttel gaol he was safe from them for timo rahman the meeting was routine a matter of greater complexity was nagging in his mind as he took the lift to the upper floor where the lawyer practised hospitality that matter the rewards for which were great and the challenge huge would take him to the western coastline it excited him because the ground to be covered and the cargo to be delivered were new to him and the risk to his security was devastating he shook the lawyers hand and was ushered inside what nagged at him was his feeling of certainty that the man he must rely on was a foreigner with no understanding of the loyalties of timos people the grandson of his fathers comrade in war ricky capel the coded name timo had given him spoken with contempt was mouseboy rubbish day and from the window sharon capel matriarch certainly of number eight and probably of all bevin close saw the bin lorry edge into the top of the culdesac her own wheelie was outside her front gate on the pavement but her daughterinlaw next door received better treatment because the boys came down the side of that house to collect her wheelie then put it back by the kitchen door joanne had that small luxury because nothing that concerned her husband ricky was too much trouble for the binboys sharon had lost track of time if she had realized how late it was in the morning she would not have been dusting in the front room she kept the house spotlessly clean because there was little else for her to do it hadnt always been that way she had been in mens underwear at british home stores for most of rickys childhood and spent evenings washing up in a cafe all the years that mikey was away doing bird and his share of what had not been retrieved by the old bill was running down mikey had been in brixton wandsworth and pentonville too long and too often and when he was out she had kept up the jobs because the big one that he was going to retire on always fucked up mikey had been between release and rearrest on a day when the bin lorry had come into bevin close that same day ricky had been a month past his twelfth birthday and from that day his sisters therese and rachel had detested him small wonder that therese now lived in australia and didnt write and rachel was in canada and didnt ring they should have beaten him that day made a line and queued up to thrash the little sod but none of them had he had stood by the door with his fists clenched and no one had dared face him down when the bin lorry had come along bevin close it was the day she had realized the nature of her son the cat was a coalblack neutered torn and the family called it soot it was worshipped by the girls and however many bloody years mikey had been inside it always greeted him when he came out like he was soots favourite the cat was old and could be caught short that morning wheeliebin day soot had been shut inside little rickys room probably an open window downstairs had slammed the door ricky had gone to his room and found that it had crapped right in the middle of his bed hed brought the cat down holding it helpless by the neck and before any of them could intervene he had wrung the cats neck then smiled like it was nothing and taken it outside the front where the wheelie was waiting for the bin lorry he had lifted the lid dropped the cat inside then gone straight back upstairs brought down his bedding and dumped that in the wheelie too hed come back in had stood by the door and had dared them his grandad and his nan his mum dad and sisters to do something if he had screamed abuse at them they would have done something not like that calm as anything a little smile at the side of his mouth and no creases on his face his eyes christ his eyes had been so bloody cold that theyd terrified her not just her mikey who had been a quality getaway driver for wages snatches and percy who had been a oneman crime wave in burglary after his demob all of them frightened by a boy of twelve because of what was in his eyes she went on with the dusting and cleaning because of the money her son gave mikey she didnt have to work didnt have to do anything but keep the house clean and cook his favourite meals and she doubted he even remembered killing the cat that day there was a harsher atmosphere on the amersham malachy sensed it not a new dawn but more a day clouded with uncertainty he walked old ladies did not linger to gossip with friends as they would usually have done during the daylight hours kids were not on the soccer spaces young mothers stampeded with their prams and the vagrants had disappeared as if they were fearful of taking the blame for what had happened he went right round the perimeter of the area that had been until the early hours of that morning the territory of the high fly boys he passed doorways of flats that had been deserted since theyd been torched in disputes past windows that were boarded up because residents had fled and along the walkways until he reached the steel barricades erected by police to prevent the pushers having free run he walked by the empty shopfronts and the closeddown daycare centre ivanhoe manners had told him months before that more than fifty million pounds for the new deal for the community programme had been swallowed by the estate he could see no evidence of its value he strode past the neverused garage with parking bay fear of the unknown blanketed the estate and it was because of him he did his circuit and when he came back to the main entrance of the stairwell of block nine he stopped turned and leaned against the concrete had he concern for the estate did he care about millie johnson was he now selfobsessed no answers the estate was in shock because the order of its life was altered millie johnson waiting for the anaesthetist wouldnt have cared not a damn just selfcentred crap to make him malachy kitchen feel better think he was taking a worthwhile step on the ladder nothing achieved nothing changed for the better as selfcentred as selfindulgent as when he had been asked to screen suspects from a lift operation and he had remarked to the battalions adjutant be happy to if your jocks havent beaten them all half insensible hadnt told the adjutant or cherie who shared the portakabin with him of the email that had come in that morning not from roz he hadnt heard from her for three weeks the email was from major arnold decent brian arnold who might have qualified for the title of kindest old guy at chicksands hoped he was well hoped his work was interesting hoped hed fitted in hoped he would note theres a lot of bicycling these days round alamein drive one cycle is most popular cheers and good wishes from all of us deskbound warriors brian it meant in code that roz was the base bicycle the chicksands honeypot was his home halfway down the lefthand side of alamein drive so selfcentred that he had snapped the sarcasm at the adjutant and so selfindulgent that his mind had been a country away from the village street when the ambush had been sprung and the rpg round had come in close chapter five feverishly malachy polished back from his walk the door locked and bolted behind him he had gone to his bed knelt and taken the shoes from the black sack they were his most valuable possession his mother had said t know its all sand and donkey poo down in basra dear but therell be times when you need to be smart your father found that in aden when he was a sprog subaltern and you were just a star in my eye you should never be short of a good pair of shoes i always say that a mans character is judged by his shoes roz hadnt gone with him to devon for that last lunch before hed flown from lyneham to iraq she wouldnt have gone if elephants had been dragging her not after his father had refused to attend his sons wedding to a girl who wasnt suitable over sherry before lunch his mother had produced the giftwrapped parcel with a ribbon round it when hed opened the box the shoes had gleamed at him and theyd fitted to perfection hed gone back with them that night to alamein drive and had not shown them to roz but hed worn them on the flight down and all the days that he was in brigade before his transfer to the scottishbased battalion and hed worn them when they had flown him out roz had hovered above him in the bedroom at the quarters he had packed a rucksack and a suitcase everything he would need except the helmet the flakjacket and the browning mm which would be issued to him the next evening when he landed the evening sun had lit the bed she had stood over him while he had transferred the neat piles of clothing into the rucksack and the case and had not helped him he had sensed the attack was coming and had not known what would trigger it the shoes had the strings of the sack were fastened the photograph of her that he loved most he had taken it at the colosseum in rome the light bright on her hair and on the walls behind her happiness on her face in a silver frame that her parents had given them went into the suitcase and he zipped it shut he had laid out the starched uniform he would wear on the aircraft and then he had gone to the wardrobe and taken out the box and the shoes the attack had gone through sarcasm to anger then on to a sneer when she had seen his mothers note and the crosses for kisses oh thats nice only the best good enough what did they cost two fifty where did you find two fifty to spend on a pair of shoes isnt there anything here that needs two hundred and fifty quid spending on it sorry sorry a present from mum how touching be sure to send her a postcard from sunny basra and tell her youre wearing mummys shoes and keeping them nice and shiny her father had retired as a warrant officer instructor at the royal military academy his father had retired with the rank of brigadier hed thought it didnt matter and had been wrong he polished hard as hard as he had worked on the boots issued him for basic training before his father had pulled strings and opened the gates of sandhurst for him malachy sweated as he rubbed the cloth over the toes and was frenzied at his work when he had left chicksands when he had tried to find work as a civilian he had worn those shoes his mother had never seen them on him his mother and father had declined to meet him and he had worn the shoes when he had taken the train to london when he had laid out his money on the counter of the offlicence opposite marylebone station and had bought the two fourpacks of special brew then found a bench and had started for the first time to drink away the demons midnight with nowhere to go and hed ended up with the derelicts without a blanket and without cardboard and hed seen the eyes covet his shoes he never took them off if he had taken them off that night or in the nights of the weeks that followed they would have gone in the hostel he had slept with them under his pillow his watch had gone a twentyfirst birthday present from a godfather and his wallet and his money from begging which had been in a cheap little purse on a bootlace round his neck with his tags but his shoes had stayed on his feet now it was as if malachy tried to polish away the scars on the shoes of his life with ferocity he burnished the toecaps they shone he could see his face in the brogue patterns more polish he gripped the left shoe and worked the cloth over it he heard the knock at his door and dawns voice called to him he turned the lock and drew down the bolt she did not look at his face but stared at the shoe she said distantly eyes never off the shoe i am going to the hospital i want to be there when they take millie to theatre and then i will stay till she is awake again it will be late when i come back i am going to have to walk from walworth road from the bus would you please meet me from the bus i would like that of course i will there is a cafe by the bus stop can we say at eleven oclock yes am i silly to be frightened of walking in the amersham that late even after what happened to the boys i dont think so ill be at the cafe by the bus stop at eleven oclock the siege was over the firemens tenders blocked kostecna and a lacework of hoses ran down the alley that was too narrow for them to pass ladders were thrown up against the buildings walls and water dripped wisps of smoke filtered up between the tiles where hours before there had been flames and billowing black clouds no more gunfire from under the roof and the last grenade explosion was a distant memory it had a finality about it hard for polly wilkins to recall the excitement of being in the different vans that had kept the street entrance under surveillance and the frustration of being held back while the storm squad had gone in and the emotion of seeing the bloodied casualties brought out she was at the alleys entrance where it joined the street and from there she could smell the charred roof timbers on which the hoses played every five minutes sometimes less she demanded of ludvik when she would be permitted to climb the stairs and see the scene for herself each time she was offered only a shrug of course ludvik did not know what had been dramatic in its unpredictability now had a dreary certainty polly understood why her station chief braithwaite had gone back to his office and had stayed there she shivered as the evenings cold settled on her not that it mattered but that night there might be one of the years final frosts the last time she had phoned braithwaite to complain about the slowness of the fire crews and the further delays in her getting up the stairs to see where they had made their stand he had said to her with annoying plausibility you can put a kettle on the stove turn on the gas and light it but shouting at the kettle wont make it boil faster she detested that sort of banal logic all around her she heard the cursed protests of residents whose apartments were unaffected by the fire but who were still prevented from returning to their homes they seemed unable unwilling to comprehend the scale of the threat that had settled among them in the topfloor apartment bombs killing mayhem catastrophe the face of alqaeda two men of alqaeda were dead not an arm or a hand or fist of the organization little more than the tip of a fingernail she swore aloud and ludvik turned sharply to look at her polly wouldnt explain so few did dominic had not understood he was foreign and commonwealth office had a future and had bought her an engagement ring with a double diamond twist the wedding had been talked of vaguely for some time next year and theyd lived together at his battersea flat not her wandsworth pad he had been posted to buenos aires youll like it there darling fascinating culture you dont want to hang around that place where they kicked you what about him chucking in the fco and coming out to prague youre not serious darling are you what throw up my career was the work of the secret intelligence service of less importance than tramping a cocktail circuit in argentina two months after shed arrived in prague and a month after hed bedded down in buenos aires the email had come dont think this is going to work sorry about that but you made the bed and youll have to lie on it please send the ring at your convenience to my parents and theyll know what to do with it no hard feelings but better to cut and run i wish you well dominic the end of the great affair of polly wilkinss life because he didnt understand only frederick gaunt understood alqaeda and what it could do the importance of a coordinator dominated her life left no room for love damn it she waited with ludvik to be called forward and wondered how it had been for the two men in the topfloor apartment during the last moments of their lives flush against the road bright as a temple of light was the gaol wall they cruised down artillery lane ricky capel did not know how many hundreds of men were held in hmp wormwood scrubs truth was he knew little about the prison he knew about hmp brixton about pentonville and wandsworth because as a kid with his sisters his mother had dragged him to them and in through the big gates to see his father what he could remember was that he had screamed and fought and she had held his arm vicelike and each time he had seen his father brought through a far door into the visits area with the screws pressed round him he had gone quiet and buried his head in his mothers shoulder he had never looked into his fathers face had never spoken out of the big gates each time he had run like the wind to the bus stop and not looked back at the walls but he didnt know wormwood scrubs because his father had never done time there he thought his grandfather had but that was before he was born go right ricky said from the back seat his cousin davey drove and his cousin benji was beside him his cousin charlie was next to ricky in the back they turned into ducane road davey was a harder enforcer than ricky didnt care a fuck about the blood he drew and the pain he inflicted benji was a clearer thinker than ricky scratched at an idea till there was a plan to execute it charlie had more comprehension of money and how to move it than ricky how to wash and rinse and scrub it clean but the decisiontaking was rickys and he brought together their differing talents when ricky the youngest of them by five clear years said what would happen there was no disagreement his leadership was accepted the gaol brilliant under the high arclights fascinated ricky he had never been in prison few secrets existed between ricky and the cousins but his fear of prison was one of them it was not something he would confide to them to joanne his parents or his grandfather he kept the secret close but it lurked in his mind as he peered up at the height of the walls only the top floor of the nearest wing was visible lights behind small barred windows some of which had washing draped outside inside the car even with the window down and straining to listen he heard nothing however many hundreds of men were there and staff and however many barred gates there were to slam shut no sounds came from the place go right again theres cameras on us benji murmured i said go right again sure thing ricky davey eased the wheel took them into wulfstan street and past the quarters for prison staff a curl of contempt licked at the side of rickys mouth two screws were walking on the pavement anoraks over their uniform shirts each carrying a plastic supermarket bag with the possessions they took home from their shift then right again isnt this the place benji what you were talking about braybrook street spot on ricky tell me about it like you did they left behind the northwest corner of the prisons perimeter and davey slowed to a crawl behind them were the walls the lights the wire and hundreds of men ricky twisted a last time to see then to the right was a great open mass of darkness football pitches open parkland and the floodlights of a running stadium on the left behind a line of parked cars were semidetached homes like the one where ricky lived with joanne and wayne its braybrook street late sixties sixtysix or seven theres three guys in a car and theyve got shooters and theyre parked up and killing time before a jobs ready a police car three blokes in it comes by and doesnt like them sitting there theyre going to do a check on the vehicle like it will be if we dont keep moving go on benji it was as if ricky were an addict needed the fix of hearing the story again now that he was here a gawper in the shadows between the streets lights and half hidden by the parked cars one of them in the vehicles roberts harry roberts the first copper leans through the window and starts with his questions roberts shoots him then gets out shoots the second copper in the street i think thats the story and the third ones shot in the police wheels two of thems gone but roberts is still inside or was last time i read about him thirtysomething years hes done mad wasnt he it was just after theyd finished with the rope a few months earlier and theyd all have hanged roberts didnt get hanged but hes done thirtyeight years and ok ok i heard you ricky didnt need the story any more wasnt smart was it in unison the cousins nodded agreement right lets get on back whats the business they drove away from the gaol charlie said the big new growth area is behind that wall and behind that wire classa stuff is what they want when theyre banged up they want brown and they want coke and i reckon its es as well what i hear eight out of ten who go down are showing traces of classa stuff when they have the check on arrival thats a heavy market which is not tapped into theres no organization for regular supply and that presents an opportunity too good to miss out on the key thing is regular and theres no exploitation of the market yet theres useful money to be had and its where we should be ricky sniggered what youd call a captive market the cousins all laughed always did at rickys humour how do we get it in benji said three ways ive identified first quite simply you chuck it over the wall the price is going down the street price is depressed because of supply and demand supplys terrific and you get some joker with a good arm and he lobs the packets over and you accept the screwsll find two out of every three but if you time it for exercise hours the chance is that youll win with thirtythree and a third per cent tennis balls are good split open stuff inside then taped up and theyre fine for chucking they do that up in manchester ive heard second you use visitors do all the orifices know what i mean if there were proper detailed searches on visits thered be uproar a mutiny and not half the people would get inside to see the people but thats getting harder because there are more dogs and more scanners that sniff the classa stuff its also dispersal of effort to get good quantities in you have to use too many mules whore swallowing and stuffing and clogging up the visitors toilets third you find a screw with a problem debt sick kiddie girlfriend who likes the good life one screw for one gaol and he goes in once a week and he has one distributor on the inside the screws not going to turn himself in and the distributor doesnt have to know where its coming from so theres a cutout how do you get the payback davey said thats the distributors problem whichever way you go ricky its for him to organize every taker he sells to has to make the arrangements for payment outside and the distributors responsible for getting the cash together if hes messing you ricky then hes walking a fine line bad things can happen to him inside and bad things can happen to his family outside and he knows that he had the outline for the enterprise from his cousins his decision none of them would have presumed to tell him what that decision should be they were in the lateevening traffic on the harrow road heading for londons central streets well set up the scrubs first and if that works well go for wandsworth im not touching pentonville or brixton well create a weekly guaranteed supply to one distributor we find a screw or a workshopssupervisor guy to take it in thats how its going to be davey grunted assent good thinking ricky charlie said a little irritant anxiety broke in ricky capel would they ever tell him he was wrong then a mirthless chuckle came into his throat and a smile cracked the smoothness of his face he was never wrong his father had been not ricky and his grandfather had made enough mistakes to get himself inside more than he was out davey would drive them across london and theyd pick up the old man whod have had a gut full and bring him home in a corner far from the bar percy capel sat with his cronies the british legion its members former servicemen was home from home he was a legend there and he bathed in the glory of the story which was enhanced by his refusal to talk detail inside the legion building tucked away from the bar to which he seldom went for drinks but allowed others to fill his glass it was well known that he had been behind enemy lines in the second world war for months and should have had a medal for it at those november ceremonies in front of rainswept memorials as the retired squadron leader their chairman intoned his address he and the others present at awkward attention wore the medals given them percy capel should have had the military medal for his service in albania major anstruther had been given the military cross what they all knew in the legion bar was that percy had been flown back to alexandria and the medal citation had gone up to the gods for ratification and that percy had then been nicked by the redcaps for stealing the petty cash out of a staff officers bedroom while the bugger slept there the way he told it percy had the cash off the dressingtable and was on his way out when the bedroom rug had gone walkabout under his weight slid on the polished marble floor and hed gone arse over tit and wrecked his ankle hed scarpered down a drainpipe and been lifted while he was limping back to barracks two years in the glasshouse at shepton mallet after repatriation in close arrest when he told that story and the refills of his glass came thick and fast oh dont mind if i do laughter bellowed the length and width of the bar but he never talked for a pint or a laugh about albania some tried and failed his reply was always the same saw things done there my friend that would make your hair standnot things for talking of in company could have talked about the major the greatest man hed ever known major hugo anstruther who was lined up to inherit thousands of highland acres and a titled wife had taught percy capel his batman handyman and donkeyminder everything a man needed to know in the arts of safeblowing and burglary and everything a man did not need to know except in albania about how to slit a sentrys throat silently and plant explosives on a bridge that would be detonated under a convoy sending men screaming to death on the flight out after the huns surrender major anstruther had said to him i think percy youd be wise to forget most of what you learned with me or at best youll spend most of the rest of your life locked up and at worst youll go to the gallows hed seen the death notice for the major nine years ago in a newspaper that night hed gone on the overnight sleeper to fort william taken a bus then walked four miles and reached a little stone church as they were lifting the majors coffin from the hearse hed stood at the back anstruther had had the full works medals on the coffin piper to play him out estate workers in their best clothes and enough children and grandchildren to fill a charabanc nobody had spoken to percy theyd just walked by him like he was a dog turd rain coming down heavy and him in his one suit that hed wear next at winifreds funeral and then at his own when theyd all left just the gravedigger left to smack his spade into the lumps of sodden clay and fill the pit hed gone close the gravedigger had been young and a selfrolled fag hung on his lip percy drenched had said that he had fought with the major in albania wheres that water streaming down his face and through his suit jacket percy had said he and the major had been comrades in arms when was that hed walked back four miles had waited two hours for a bus and caught the night sleeper to london he had a week in bed with the shivers from his soaking they didnt need to know in the legion bar about major anstruther and the gang in the cave led by mehmet rahman percy capel didnt buy drinks could have done he had his war pension and his oldage pension and he lived for free with his son and daughterinlaw and wanted for nothing and he had the hundred a week in cash that ricky gave him ricky knew about albania and mehmet rahman and had traded on his grandfathers war percy hated his grandson but still took his money he was in full flight i was doing this job a real big property down in esher thats a bit off my beat but id read in the paper who these folk were and im upstairs and pocketing the stuff and a bloody dog sounding like a wolf is up and roaring at the closed door im doing a doublefast runner down the drainpipe when ricky stood at the far end of the bar hand up finger beckoning sorry guys got to go my round next time doesnt like to be kept waiting he shuffled towards the door leaving the laughter stifled and his drink unfinished the talk at home over the years about major hugo anstruther and mehmet rahman the little case of mementoes under his bed had launched the little piece of vermin he was responsible in part for the empire of his grandson god it weighed on him coming ricky good of you to collect me everyone danced to ricky just as percy capel did harry who was sharon capels brother danced any way that ricky wanted him to dance by dancing he kept the dream alive he was in the wheelhouse and rocked gently in the skippers seat as the anneliese royal swayed at its mooring ropes she was ready to sail except for the ice before dawn they would be gone in an hour billy and young paul would drive up to the quay the ice would be loaded they would slip the ropes and be gone into the night billy had monitored the forecast and told him that for this week weather conditions were predicted as good not the week after he read and he dreamed and the dream was his sole escape from ricky capel the dream was of finding a brixhambuilt trawler a boat from the south devon yards of eighty years ago it might be up a creek in the southwest or tied up and forgotten on the hamble or left to rot on the mudflats outside a port in scotland or on the isle of man if after all those years of inactivity because the diesel engine had taken over from sail power by the late s which had dictated the dumping of the old trawler fleet he could discover a trawler with a sound hull and a good keel harrys dream would be launched in his retirement free of ricky capel he would potter on the carcass of the boat and hope that before his death he would have resurrected it placed in it a new mast scrubbed the decks and varnished them till they shone and could put to sea move across the water at a crisp seven or eight knots in a southwesterly with the full red sails that were the colour of devon earth and be in heaven he had an hour to read before they brought the ice on board but dreams needed paying for without rickys money the dream would die the book reminiscences and anecdotes of life on the old powered trawlers was faded frayed and had stains on the pages from fingers that had dripped with the fluid of fish stomachs when he finished a favourite passage he locked away the book and waited for the pickups headlights to spear across the quay they would fish for five days without having to navigate towards a marker buoy off cuxhaven or the rock outcrop of helgoland to collect a waterproof package then come back and moor in harbour during the length of the forecast storm and maybe go to the west and home finally she had been permitted inside past midnight and polly had climbed the stone staircase and had allowed ludviks hand to remain on her arm as she stepped over the debris left by the firemen a mass of floodlights used by the police and men of the bis played over the interior the rain came through the ceiling where the fire had destroyed the roof and pattered on her head from the doorway four ladders were laid out over the exposed floor beams because the planks had gone two had been placed so that they gave access to either side of the charred heap that had been left untouched by the fire crew she shuddered the smell of the burning which had been doused by the hoses then damped by the rain caught in her nose but overriding it was a stronger stench sweet and sickly she had never been close up to it before but instinctively she knew it quite deliberately not brooking argument she pushed ludvik aside then sharply tapped the shoulder of a man in front of her and gestured for him to move out of her path he shifted and the lights dazzled her through her steelrimmed unfashionable spectacles she shoved her hair out of her face and hitched her skirt high over her knees if her tights laddered that was of no importance she slipped plastic gloves over her hands she had authority because the bis the successor to the former communist regimes stb had been trained in modern counterintelligence techniques by agencies from the united kingdom she knelt on the ladder to the left of the heap steeled herself then reached for a further rung and began to edge out over the open beams she was slight but the ladder creaked under her weight and the cold snatched at her bared legs she came closer to the source of the stench and called over her shoulder has anything here been touched or moved ludvik answered her only by the fire not by us the lights stayed on the heap and the stench drew her forward she reached out towards the growing clarity of the shapes nearest to her was the machine pistol scorched and lying among burned bedding at the fort above the coast outside portsmouth she had done weapons training with the bland instructors who thought all recruits were idiots polly had been one of the few who had listened she lifted the barrel held it pointing to the rainclouds between the beams and passed it behind her careful that the trigger did not snag it was taken she found five blackened magazines and knew from their weight that their bullets had been exhausted as her hands groped closer to the largest unrecognizable shape in the pile a sharp wounding little memory came back to her she had been driving with dominic to scotland for their first week away after they had met they had been near the border and had stopped to picnic but a cloud had come dark over them from longtown made by the funeral pyre of the animals slaughtered to contain the epidemic of footandmouth they had hurried on but the stench had stayed in the car even with all the windows open dominic was gone but not the memory of the stench she held a hand there was a gasp behind her then nervous titters the lights were on the gloves she wore and the black bones of a hand in hers the clothing was gone and much of the flesh she thought she might vomit she put down the hand detached from the wrist because the muscle had burned she felt the shape of the arm then the torso and her fingers flickered up to the skull a jawbone an open mouth eye sockets it seemed to her that she learned more from the touch than from the glare of the lights on the face they had called him muhammad iyad she wondered how it had been for him in the final spasms of his life his mouth wide with agony had his faith in god sustained him or the love of his woman or had he died in terror cursing those he served her head bobbed and she shook the thoughts from her mind her fingers dismantled the heap and found nothing more right polly said briskly to the men behind her thats one of them wheres the other a murmur of voices behind her then ludviks hangdog response they have found only one cadaver you had the building sealed you told me only one body was found it was as if she were a child and a present in gaudy wrapping was offered her and when she reached for it the present was snatched away the prize was gone she turned and started to crawl back along the ladder with the time differential between prague and london it would now be pm at vauxhall bridge cross and gaunt would be waiting with the certainties of night following day and spring following winter she knew gaunt would be at his desk with his shoes up on it and waiting for her signal polly wilkins swore obscenely and came off the ladder frederick gaunt read the latest epistle from the wheyfaced creature who had written the report now heavily circulated on the services future the intray left for him by gloria was empty its contents either gone to the shredder or dumped on her desk in the outer office for filing he had done his emails through the evening nothing remained for him to read except the report the secret intelligence service in confidential which made his lips curl in irritation it was crap in five years the service would understand customer and partner requirements what was the service a division of the bloody london underground he was old school and regarded jargonmongers with contempt maybe he should have gone when the knife hacked through the team responsible for the weaponsofmassdestruction analysis could have gone then on full pension as a sweetener and joined the happy ranks of the whitehall discards could have busied himself with his great love of roman archaeology set out his stall in a tidy guesthouse like the one at bradfordonavon and been within walking distance of the excavation spent his days chipping with a light hammer digging with a hand trowel brushing at the mud and stone letting out little whoops of pleasure as the villa gave up its secrets walking away he had realized long ago took courage perhaps more courage than flowed in frederick gaunts veins no wife shed gone with that hairyfaced beggar to a smallholding in herefordshire to live like a balkan peasant no children their mother had poisoned their minds against him and contact was lost no friends an officer in the service was adept at avoiding commitment to people outside his tunnel of work no prizes to bask in the war went on different enemies but the same endless threat when he left he would be one more of the old farts who was unable under the strictures of the official secrets act to say boldly from a bar stool do you know who i used to be he would be another senile bore with roman artefacts for company and a guesthouse for home he stayed on and endured the crap of the jargonmongers and he waited and he forced the pages of the secret intelligence service confidential into the teeth of the shredder and around him the building was hushed he did not know whether wilco would come through on a secure phone line or use the encrypted teleprinter he would not nag her polly wilco wilkins was the best girl hed ever supervised and the most loyal and the most unlucky in the twin fallout of the wmd analysis and love it would have been an unspeakable crime to pester her for news he knew that the storm squad had gone in had been halted in its assault that fire had ravaged the building and nothing more all of it real he doubted that the author of the secret intelligence service confidential the purveyor of crap had the smallest comprehension of real service life mens lives on the line bodytobody fighting dying in combat as duty for their country or for their faith real life he drank the final splash of coffee and grimaced he could see a barge progress west to east down the thames and past parliament he was wondering if its driver was heavy on understanding customer and partner requirements when the teleprinter against the wall behind him began its shrill chatter he read gaunt bloody disaster one repeat one body on premises body is badly burned but i believe forensics will identify muhammad lyad your coord slipped the net early and mi bought him a start of up to hours so no identification of coord and all internal dna traces obliterated by fire my estimate will be chasing loose ends in the morning the bastard is that bis promised me the area had been secured you told me once quote lifes unfair always has been and always will be end quote right now i believe you love wilco he had said that to her when she had poured out to him on the phone that dominic in buenos aires had ditched her a wry sad smile crossed gaunts face it seemed to matter more to her than losing her fiance that a potential coordinator of alqaeda had been mislaid was loose in europe with a full days time bought him he signalled her wilco if life were easy everybody would be doing it sleep tight gaunt he closed down his desk switched off the light and left darkness behind him frederick gaunt bowed by disappointment went along the silent corridors down in the elevator across the hall where he failed to notice the greetings of night security and home to the loneliness of his flat he felt himself to be in a maze of uncertainty and did not know where his path would lead or who would walk with him in similar ignorance but frederick gaunt was not a quitter and the loss of the trace on the coordinator would bring him to his desk early and back to the trail he whistled to himself as he walked across the bridge january taking charge that was the talent of hamish mcqueen as the companys senior sergeant he ran bravo what the hell happened corp what sort of shambles was that the sections corporal told him a patrol routine an ambush not routine but handled actually we did well sarge really well we had three incoming fire positions and we did good neutralizing on them and we have at least one confirmed kill everything was brilliant we did good hard target did it at speed didnt give the hostiles anything to hit they took punishment and they broke off did you stop the ambulance we stopped the ambulance one dead and one likely to corpse both males no women or kids which means the best fire control im not criticizing the response which id consider entirely appropriate thats not the shambles whats the story with him in front of mcqueen the corporal seemed to duck his head away evasive as if he did not want to answer mcqueen gestured thumb raised to his right where the officer sat on one of the plasticseated chairs outside the operations room where men from the bunker took a softdrink break or a smoke he was staring forward and his shoulders seemed to tremble across the yard the crews of the warriors the quickreaction team had been stood down and mcqueen saw that men from the patrol were at the centre of little knots pouring out their tale and that all eyes were on the officer im struggling sarge well struggle a bit bloody harder what am i going to report to the major no ones going to bite you whats the story t was up forward i was trying to handle a bloody firefight say what youve got to say we did the hardtarget bit at speed then doubled round the back of the mosque and didnt stop till we were by the school that was when we realized he wasnt with us mcqueen pressed without mercy spill it you realized then that mr kitchen was not with you weve got your radio call on that its logged what did you do doubled back went back the way wed come you know where we found him you got his helmet and his flakjacket not his personal weapon i am not criticizing you because theres no cause for that id say you did bloody well youve got to understand there was a right panic here that is serious panic im moving on who was closest to him baz was baz says he lost him when we were doing the hardtarget stuff how do you rate that boy good kid a bit lippy but a good kid their chief guy baz dropped him and with him down the rest quit we were in shit till baz slotted their main man he did well mcqueens gaze raked from the officer still sitting and still alone like he had some plague affliction across the yard from where the private soldier baz stood at the heart of a cluster and was holding forth hamish mcqueen had been with this scottish regiment for eighteen years and when the vacancy opened up he stood the best chance of any of the company sergeants to get the nod and promotion to regimental sergeant major better than most he recognized a minefield as if he walked among trip wires and pressure plates he considered where he stood now and its implications for the sergeant there had been enough soft talk are you telling me corporal that mr kitchen did a runner he was with us then he wasnt with us cant say different the corporal said evasively we found his helmet and his flakjacket dumped didnt find his weapon there was kids following and jeering at him but they werent a threat for fucks sake corp did he do a runner what else can you see a mark on him i cant what we reckon yes he ran thats what we reckon yellow bastard feckin quit on us you talking baz talking he saw the section corporal suck in a deep deep breath all of us talking theres not a mark on him and his helmets gone and his flakjacket and his gat wheres he going back to bravo its all of us bloody talking but you never saw him turn and run tell me for christs sake i was in a firefight then trying to do extraction you tell me sarge what else fits far as i know first incoming and hes gone thats the rpg and it was way high the corporal blurted its not my faidt im not to blame if hes a yellow bastard a rupert who couldnt hack it leave it there corp go get yourself and your boys a brew ill take it on he turned away and strode towards the sandbagged operations room as he took the few steps his webbing clanking across his chest hamish mcqueen reflected that his report in the bunker would be the hardest he had ever made to his company commander too damn right he passed the man who still sat on the chair and whose gaze was void of expression for a company sergeant major who had ambitions to take on the role of regimental sergeant major it was high risk to denounce an officer for running from combat he would play it straight take the white line down the middle of the road and report what he had been told others higher up the chain could play god but not hamish mcqueen he would relay only what had been said to him he didnt look down at the man as he passed him he could think of no greater disgrace for a man than to be labelled a coward who had done a runner under fire but hurried inside the bunker deciding on what shirt what trousers and giving a last shine to his shoes had eaten into the minutes of the schedule that malachy had set himself the shirt was not ironed but it was the best that had come from the charity shop and the collar was not frayed the trousers were not pressed but had only been worn once since their wash in the launderette clean socks on and the shined shoes then malachy stood in front of the little bathroom mirror smoothed his hair into shape and used a finger to etch out a parting the shoes set him off he looked better than he had since ivanhoe manners had brought him to the amersham it was twelve minutes to eleven and beyond the windows thick darkness blanketed the estate he would have to run down the stairs sprint through the plazas and jog the length of the streets coming into walworth road hed cut it fine but he would be there for eleven oclock at the bus stop he thought he had enough money to spare buying rope packaging tape the plastic toy and the multiblade penknife had eaten into his fortnights benefit money he had the drawer open and counted out what he could spare enough for a port or a sherry for dawn and a coke for himself there would be a pub in the road open till late he slotted the drawer shut slipped the pound coins into his pocket and started for the door suddenly he was late he unfastened the lock and reached for the bolt the telephone rang he had the bolt down and the door open and the bell cut after its triple ring then the silence clamoured behind him to get to the bus stop as he had promised malachy kitchen would now have to push himself his breathing came hard and his finger rested on the light switch by the door breaking a promise or keeping a promise you do what you think is right and maybe thatll make a ladder for you to escort an old lady from the bus stop after a hospital visit back through the dark shadows of the estate the minute had gone the phone rang again to let her meander alone clutching her bag through the alleyways of the amersham and into the blackened stairwell where a smashed light had not been replaced the quiet fell round him after the third ring chapter six ill bet you were begging for the call praying for it the voice and the words spoken in the shadows of the night were crystal clear in malachys mind he walked out of the stairwell street entrance of block nine and headed for the exit road from the amersham you had a taste for it didnt you all down to me i knew youd come dont give me that stuff about i done my bit youve done precious little of damn all and without me thats how itll stay you hearing me the sun was over the highest tower block four and little cloud puffs scudded around its brilliance but down on the street he was sheltered from the wind in the dark in the parking bay the wind had funnelled between the pillars peeled off the car and buffeted him he had heard if you think youve done my bit go and look at her im telling you very frankly because i nearly trust you we push paper round desks but we alter nothing enough thats us to get little newspaper headlines and god arent we great stories on local tv but were not affecting the trade its the trade that put millie where she is you know what happened up north a few months ago ill tell you a big city with police costing millions a year had to admit it was so swamped with class a that it had lost control of crime in its area thats direct what they said lost control not bogota not palermo not bloody kiev or chicago but a city you can take a train to barely surfaced in our papers and tv because it was a badnews story who wants bad news but its where we are you live in this sink christ i couldnt and you see whats not on tv and in the papers the sun had brought the babymothers out no thin gold fingerrings just prams to push and toddlers to traipse towards the play places or the swings and slides that werent broken twice since he had lived on the amersham malachy had seen children who could barely run not understand happily carry syringes picked up from the gutter back to the babymothers once he had seen a little boy done up in his best party clothes kneel in the mud with a syringe and fly it over his head like it was a rocket up north that time they got round to admitting what we all know were losing not that you ever will but if you came into my place where i push my poxy bits of paper around youd see that only the arseholes and the career wonks find anything to cheer about when we do get ourselves wound up and head off to do the good things were tripping over the european court of human bleeding rights and were flat on our bloody faces im telling you this because i reckon you understand malachy kitchen about losing youre a loser bigtime but you came running when you were called he came out past the last of the big blocks and walked a street towards the corner shop that ivanhoe manners had pointed out to him there had been he knew it because millie johnson had told him over tea two more armed robberies since the twelve the social worker had spoken of and the southwark news had quoted the asian shopkeeper as calling himself a sitting duck with no insurance company prepared to quote for him he couldnt quit because there was no buyer idiot enough to take it on guns under his chin clubs in front of his face cctv and the panic button useless my estimate of you is that youre sick spewing it up with losing so ive got plans for you you did well three kids out of the picture you did what we cannot over the line of course sufficient to get you banged up and a charge sheet as long as half your arm you should look at me as a visiting angel who pitched up to help you get your life back and if you make it ill be on the sidelines cheering you you got a long long road you wont be coming to me with ive done my bit will you you wont disappoint me will you that would really upset me because whichever way you look at it im helping you malachy cut through the green street market sidled past the stalls heavy with fruit and vegetables thin clothing and tackybright toys another plastic pistol was in the place where his had come from good enough for a tenyearold in daylight and good enough to scare the shit out of three gang youths at night he glanced at his watch and quickened his stride he saw ahead of him the traffic on walworth road and the bus stop think of it as a pyramid thats what all the clever buggers at the home office do right down at the bottom are the vagrants the addicts who have to buy and have to thieve and have to ambush millie johnson theyre dross not worth the sweat next up from them are the pushers the high fly boys and you wrecked them which was well done and got you on the ladder keep climbing read this name memorize this address the dealer feeds the pushers he is at the next level of the pyramid if i wanted to crank it up i could say that he has millie johnsons blood under his dirty little fingernails got it in your memory good ill have the paper back look after yourself malachy because no one else will and a dealer fights dirtier than kids do he crossed then and looked up walworth road three buses came in crocodile formation towards him they stopped disgorged passengers and pulled away he would wait till she came more minutes and more buses he idled he knew what time she left work and what time she would get the ride from whitehall she came off the bus dawn the cleaning lady who was his neighbour and who was the friend of millie johnson walked right past him she saw him recognized him and anger twitched at her mouth she ignored him he had a cavalcade of excuses to offer her gone to sleep dozed off and a litany of apologies to make for leaving her last night to come into the estate alone but the excuses and apologies went unsaid as she crossed the road he watched the pride in her walk she was not dependent on a man whose promise did not count he followed her but did not run to catch her he hung back when she stopped in the market and bought fruit which he knew she would later take to the hospital he had a good life well organized jason penney a month past his twentyeighth birthday lived in a groundfloor flat the onebedroom unit had been allocated by housing to a pensioner and was suitable for a disabled person legally penney was disabled and to prove it he had a doctors certificate stating his severe kneeligament injuries which had cost him in cash from a ghanaian medic and entitled him to benefit but the disability money was chickenfeed to his other earnings illegally he had inserted himself his partner his baby and his dog into the pensioners home as a base of operations it was ideal he sold classa narcotics on the amersham what the customer wanted the customer had but only class a he shunned cannabis and the derivatives as too bulky to handle and with insufficient profit margins he dealt in heroin cocaine powder crack cocaine whatever the market demanded he could get mdma tablets made from a base of amphetamine ketamine cb and ephedrine or methylamphetamine where the market took him he followed a bad week gave him clear a thousand pounds a good week two thousand but in a worst week if he was arrested and nailed down with evidence he faced seven years in prison the money he made and the risk of going to gaol led penney towards a life of exceptional caution the caution dictated where he lived his livein partner aggie had had his baby aggie had located the pensioner and later together and over three weeks they had watched the block and the pensioners door for suitability that was eight months back she had befriended the old man a halfreformed alcoholic in his early seventies meeting him getting him into conversation at first later dropping off sixpacks youre my friend arent you no problem later getting inside close to him on the sofa cuddling him touching him up infatuating him later shopping for him dont thank me its for nothing anything i can do to help later moving in with the baby just while i sort myself out and im ever so grateful later jason penneys at the door with his dog and his bag hes ever so nice you wont know hes here and the dogs lovely well all be company for you in a month aggie had given penney what he most wanted he had safe premises among the pensioners units that were about at the bottom of police priority taskings for surveillance penney his partner and the baby had taken the pensioners bedroom the dog had the hall the old man spent his days in the kitchen and slept on the frontroom sofa with receding memories of the cuddles and the affection and how was the old beggar going to get rid of them no way changes were made to the flat discreetly and unnoticeable from the outside steel sheeting covered the inside of the front and back doors new locks bolts and chains were fitted a trellis of bars reinforced the windows the pensioners home in which he stayed with an everopen can from a sixpack had become the fortress of the amershams premier dealer the final touch penney had hired a welding torch for twentyfour hours gone out on a wet november night and worked the flame over the manhole cover in the street in front of the flat where the sewage went through if they were serious first thing the filth did when they raided was get the manhole cover up outside and slot a plastic sack over the pipe outlet into the main system first thing a dealer did when the sledgehammers hit the door was flush what was in the house down the toilet jason penney reckoned himself ahead of the game aggie collected for him from the supplier anything up to a full kilo of brown or white up to a thousand tablets was brought back to the estate by the palefaced unremarkable girl with her baby aggie moved the brown the white and the tablets in the pram under the baby with shit and piss in the nappy that hid the dull scent of heroin cocaine or mdma from the house to the stash place that was a hollowedout cavern behind a loose concrete block in a playarea corner where the lights did not reach jason penney with perfect security around him was a king on the amersham the men and women in housing burdened by workloads and short staffing had no interest in investigating areas from which no complaints came the pensioners neighbours similarly elderly and cowed who would have seen penneys shaven head his muscled tattooed body and his rottweiler were not daft they would not call any police hotline even if it claimed confidential response he was irritable that day hed snapped at aggie and bawled out the pensioner had raised his fist to the dog so that it had backed off and crept to its corner a little tremor of worry itched in him he dealt with danny morris leroy gates and wilbur sansom had done ever since hed set up in business on the estate had found them good and reliable he knew what had happened to them he believed he felt the pulsebeat of the amersham but he could not have said who had left them suspended from a flat roof for most of a night he kept her in an apartment at chelsea harbour it had a small balcony that looked down on the river a small living room a small kitchen and a small bathroom a big tv with video and dvd and a big bed that fitted tightly into the small bedroom she grunted hard the apartment across london from bevin close with the girl in residence was the greatest luxury in ricky capels life it was leased in her name two years and renewable but the girl was more complicated she had been bought for cash then the money had been paid back and she was a gift maria twenty years old from romania was smart clever and longlegged and had worked out of a brothel in kings cross the thong suspenders and little lacy brassiere that she always wore when he arrived the highheeled shoes and the silk robe were scattered in a trail between the front door of the apartment and the bed maria was high luxury to ricky capel and high risk the times he was able to get away from the cousins and from bevin close were luxury because then he thought he breathed freedom he tried to come to chelsea harbour once a week but if his life was complex and business burdened him it was once a fortnight which made for expensive luxury with the lease her spending money and her presents it was liberation when he shed his family free of joanne who did sex only when she reckoned she had to and was always bleating on about the thinness of the wall between their room and waynes and refused straightup to do anything beyond basic the girl maria rode him on the bed and his hands reached up for the hang of her breasts and she grunted louder as he pushed up into her and her head was back like it was ecstasy for her her fingernails long and painted silver to match her lip gloss caught in his chest hair and scratched at his skin he let out sharp stifled squeals and her grunts came faster but high risk for ricky capel to have set up his girl at chelsea harbour opened little cracks in the defence wall built round his wealth and enterprises he had met her in the hours after his first meeting with enver who hummed round kings cross in a flash ferrari spider charlie had identified the business opportunity albanians ran girls into the country but they hadnt the cover customs and immigration had peeled eyes for albanians driving white vans into dover folkestone or harwich they were losing too many and too much cash and they were operating on foreign territory it was charlies proposition ricky should get himself up alongside the albanians and take over the crossborder crosschannel runs he had access to the drivers and to the lorries they brought back from the long overland european hauls he would be paid up front by the albanians for the transport and take a cut from the brothel earnings where the new girls would work the way charlie told it it was pretty straight and benji had suggested approaching enver hed heard that albanians stuck by their word were professional made good partners theyd done the meeting had shaken hands on a deal and then there had been food in the club the girl had stood at the back and her eyes had never been off him christ hed wanted her like hed never wanted anything bought her hadnt he bought her for cash peeled it out of his pocket and told enver that thered be no more bloody customers for her and hed collect her when hed got premises in a careful life it was the wildest thing that ricky capel had ever done bought a tart out of a brothel off an albanian the way she grunted on him the whole of that building at chelsea harbour through concrete floors and concrete walls would have heard her bloody bloody god marvellous and he clung to her breasts in his third or fourth meeting with enver long after hed taken delivery of her ricky had told him sort of casual that his grandfather had been in albania in the war what was his grandfathers name and where had his grandfather been percy capel up in the north and hed struggled to pronounce the place name with a major anstruther next time theyd met him and enver ricky had been given an envelope in it was what hed paid for the girl enver had giggled and told him why the money had come back envers uncle was in hamburg germany the uncles father was mehmet rahman who had fought with major hugo anstruther and flight sergeant percy capel against the fascists in the mountains north of shkodra small world small bloody world she was coming crouched over him bellowing like he was the best shag shed ever had he did not rate the risk she represented the albanians from that distant link between a grandfather and the father of an uncle were his partners well not real partners because he controlled it all he called the tune ricky did he was never backed into a corner he bought off them and used harrys trawler to bring in the packages he used his network of knowledge for haulage companies to help them get the girls from belarus ukraine bulgaria and romania into the country he hired them his cousin benji called them the merks the mercenaries for heavy punishment if a man showed him disrespect he had no cause to sweat on the arrangement he had not lost control never would and the money rolled in for charlie to wash rinse scrub clean she came then him ricky sagged on the bed and she rolled off him she peeled off the condom and went to make him tea always tea never alcohol he lay back and gasped she was his best his most precious secret mikey capel always watched little wayne rickys boy play football for the undernine team of the junior school st marys he was on the touchline in the park area there were no trees to break the force of the wind and he was huddled among the young mums and other grandparents in a midweek afternoon there were few fathers he was at ease liked the gossip among the men of his own age and a quiet flirt with the mothers he enjoyed those afternoons little wayne wasnt good only useful and he was hidden away by the teacher in charge on the left side of midfield where the kids shortcomings in talent had least effect on the sides efforts little wayne was always picked by the teacher because his father ricky had provided the teams shirts knicks and socks the same colours as charlton athletic who used the valley down the road maybe useful was putting it strong but it was fun for mikey to watch him he knew that afternoon where ricky was and with whom why he wasnt on the touchline actually the game against brendon road junior was absorbing enough for him not to notice the powerfully built man perhaps five years older than himself with an erect bearing sidle to his shoulder the noise around him had reached fever pitch the ball was with a little black kid might have been the smallest on the pitch but tricky like a bloody eel and he was wriggling down his teams right touchline and the st marys left side and was coming right up against the faded white markings of the penalty box the black kid had skill go on wayne fix him mikey yelled through his cupped hands the little black kid the ball seeming stuck to his toe danced round little wayne dont let him wayne block him oh jesus the ball was gone and the kid nearly gone when little wayne shoved out his right boot most expensive that adidas made for that age group hooked it round the kids trailing leg and tripped him oh christ the brendon road mums and grandfathers howled for blood redcard blood and the whistle shrieked oh bloody hell but the referee didnt send him off he merely wagged his finger at the sourfaced child a rich welsh accent rang in mikeys ear i suppose his dads bought the referee chip off the old block that one vicious little sod proud of him mikey i expect you are he swung recognition came its mr marchant isnt it and thats ricky capels brat right that is my grandson i thought he tried to play the ball and and was just a bit late in the tackle about half an hour bloody late like father like son i always reckon you can tell them those that are going to be scum theres no call for that talk mr marchant but there was no fight in mikeys voice his mind clattered through the arithmetic of it would have been nineteen years since he had last seen gethin marchant detective sergeant flying squad a straightup guy and civilized never one to make a show the squad had come for mikey half six in the morning and the afternoon before theyd done this factory payroll and all gone wrong because a delivery lorry had blocked in the getaway wheels and theyd done a run with nothing mr marchant had led the arrest team nothing fancy and the door hadnt been sledgehammered off its hinges before sharon had opened up even given him time to get out of his pyjamas and dressed and allowed him to kiss sharon in the hall so that the neighbours wouldnt have too much to tittle over and ricky had come out of his bedroom and down the stairs like a bloody cyclone and thrown himself at the arresting coppers barefoot but hed kicked at shins and kneed balls and then hed jumped up more than his full height and headbutted a constable hard enough to split the mans lip flailing with his fists it had taken three of them and his mum to subdue the thirteenyearold ricky and the girls at the top of the stairs had been weeping their bloody eyes o u t proper upsetting it had been wheres ricky now doing his scum bit the welshness lilted but there was contempt in the hard voice of the retired detective sergeant god id hate to think id fathered that sort of creature and that there was another coming along same vein what encourages me itll all end in tears because it always does sorry sorry nice to have met up with you again mikey got to go mikey saw gethin marchant scurry as best he could at his age on to the pitch the little black kid was down in tears and the foul had ended his afternoons football when the game restarted while the detective sergeant held the little bundle of the boy on his shoulder on the far touchline the brendon road kids scored and then the referee blew his whistle for full time little wayne came to him we was bloody robbed we you were shit mikey the grandfather snapped back next time your father can watch you it wont be me no ricky wouldnt be there to watch little wayne because ricky was screwing on those afternoons when st marys had matches he had a good mate been inside with him and shared a cell with him who now drove a minicab for a company at the bottom end of the kings road they drank together some tuesday nights the minicab driver had been waiting for a fare at chelsea harbour when hed seen ricky with his bottleblonde tart her big boobs and long legs mikey had never cheated on sharon he remembered looking down at little wayne what the retired detective had said he grabbed the sulking childs hand come on lets go home what had been said which he believed itll all end in tears because it always does he strode away across the grass and the mud dragging the kid behind him whats the priority the question came from a line manager who lived his working life in a complex surrounded by thousands of yards of fencing and razor wire protected by armed guards built on moorland in north yorkshire west of scarborough on the coast and north of malton at menwith hill officially an outpost of the british listening spies at cheltenham the national security agency headquarters at fort meade in maryland called an american tune the majority of the budget for the intercept databases on this windscarred remote ground of bracken and heather was in dollars he who pays the piper calls the tune at menwith hill great white golfball shapes rise above the moorland sometimes glittering in sunshine and sometimes misted by low cloud the balls protect the scanning dishes that suck in millions of phone communications every day then computers operating at speeds of nanoseconds interpret what has been swallowed into the stomach of the beast hundreds of nsa personnel have made this corner of the united kingdom into a little piece of the midwest of america american needs in the war on terror dictate how the computer time is allocated british technicians must accept the reality however unwelcome of being the subordinate partner so the line manager demanded clarification of the priority level of the request from london im sure youll appreciate mr gaunt that matters related to pakistan egypt yemen and the saudi kingdom take most of our time and thats all linked as you know well to us requirements prague isnt high no if you were to tell me that by monitoring all satphone and mobile links out of prague to wherever in europe i would be meeting a categoryfour priority level you know life and death mr gaunt then i might be able to play with a bit of machineswitching might and id have to know mr gaunt in what language wed be most likely dealing and what the trigger words are i think that if i had your assurance and id need a backup signal of authorization that this was categoryfour minimum then i might might be able to help are you there mr gaunt albanian language thats not easy oh might be arabic or a chechen dialect oh no trigger words all i can say mr gaunt is that ill do my best say three or four days yes mr gaunt and were pushed at this end too the screen gave polly a blackandwhite image of the interior of the cell ludvik at her shoulder asked her remotely do you not approve not for me to have an opinion she murmured i just have to hope that what youre doing is effective whether i like it or not is irrelevant yes old matters of ethics and morality took a back seat in the new war she saw a bucket lifted and the water from it was thrown so that it splashed on to the face and head of the man she knew to be a cafe owner from the east of the old city out by the florenc bus station the water ran down his cheeks and chest and blood sluiced off the injuries inflicted on him she thought momentarily that this was a return to days long gone when stalins purges had filled these same basement cells and before that as gestapo interrogators had gone to work to extract the names of the assassins of reichsprotector heydrich it is necessary you did not hear me say it was not polly said softly the cells dark little cubicles with high barred windows of dirty glass that looked out at boot level on to the interior square of the police barracks were where communist and nazi torturers had been they could similarly have justified the pain and brutality of what they did now it was the turn of the democrats to use that cell and to beat slap and kick deprive a man of sleep make him scream in agony and to hide behind the wall of it is necessary as the water dripped to the floor the mans head lifted and his bruised face focused again on the ceiling the work resumed shortarm closedfist punches to the face booted kicks to the kidneys and when the cafe owners head dropped again his grey hair was caught and held up so that the target remained accessible there was no high horse on which polly wilkins could have sat and played indifference over the last two years men and women from the service had trooped in and out of interrogation rooms at bagram in afghanistan at guantanamo bay and at holding camps in iraq her people her colleagues no bleat from the service then about ethics and morality of course her hands and their hands stayed clean because they let surrogates do it and could then claim ignorance and others were shipped in the name of the war on terror to cell blocks in damascus or cairo and transcripts were sent back with no bloodstains on them that drove forward investigations what has he said so far nothing of importance perhaps thats because you have hit his face so often that he cannot talk any more she said drily do you think he might talk better if you hit his face less often do you want information or do you want your conscience to be comfortable oh for fucks sake she turned away from the screen if her mother and father both teachers in an insignificant country town in wiltshire both thrilled that their daughter worked for the defence of the realm had known what their daughter watched on a tv screen they might have vomited but far from home it was the reality of what she did she looked back at the screen then blinked and peered harder at it if they had not held the cafe owners grey hair his head would have fallen on to his soaked chest but they did and his hands rose briefly and feebly to protect his face fingers over his eyes and mouth before they were ripped away and another punch landed can you zoom in no it is a fixed lens i want to go in there because we do not understand the skill of interrogation do we need another lesson from sis the sarcasm hit her why just put me in there dear friend because by your own admission you have learned nothing good enough she was taken down a flight of stoneflagged steps and along a corridor where men lounged on hard chairs read newspapers without interest smoked and stripped her with their eyes down more stairs and into the basement she walked boldly and with purpose wanted only confirmation of what she had seen in black and white on the screen the door was opened for her bright light speared from a lamp into the cafe owners face the men turned from their work and stared at her the head was permitted to fall she went close to the chair on which he was propped then knelt in front of him her body masked what she did she took the cafe owners hands the mans fingers clawed at hers as if he believed she was his salvation his release she was not there for kindness she examined the hands quickly then let them drop on to his lap which was wet with water and urine she stood turned her back on him and walked out of the cell into the corridor what was that for no reply from polly wilkins as she swept by ludvik she went out into the inner square of the building where communists and fascists had been and felt herself dirtied she thought of the shower she would take endless and soapy and drove away of the many companies owned by timo rahman all doing legitimate business one shipped furniture to hamburg from a factory at ostrava in the extreme east of the czech republic the tables and chairs sideboards chests and wardrobes would be inexpensive in germany and timo had identified a good market for those made from beech wood the companys offices warehouse and showroom were in the hammerbrook district the message was brought from hammerbrook by a young albanian boy a good clean intelligent worker who was the son of a second cousin of timo because the boy was gjak a blood relation he had been entrusted with the message by the companys manager who was from the miqs a relative by marriage nothing had been written down and the message was in the boys memory the telex from the factory at ostrava was now in slivers having passed through the companys shredder that evening timo was the guest at a restaurant of a rathaus functionary who dealt with the provision of care homes for the elderly an area he had decided was promising for expansion the citys government near bankrupt and bumping along on empty needed private capital for investment in the homes to fulfil an election promise late in the meal the bear came to timos shoulder and whispered in his ear apologies were made timo slipped from the table out of the restaurant and on to the pavement where the boy waited timo saw the boys nervousness and confusion he had heard of him but had never met him his job in the office was a reward for the cousins loyalty he smiled with warmth and hugged the boy to reassure him then the message was stammered out against the noise of passing traffic and the music that spilled from a discotheque this is what i am to say from the shipping section of home furnishing regret cargo load has not been forwarded our local agent is indisposed also half of the cargo is damaged and cannot be sent and the remainder which comprises the more valued items is missing we await further information that is all the telex was signed by the director at ostrava i apologize for disturbing you on such a minor matter but that is what i was instructed to do if he felt a frisson of anxiety timo gave no sign of it he asked quietly would you repeat the message he was told it again the boy was hugged and sent away into the night timo murmured to the bear that he would need ten minutes to extract himself from the functionarys table then they would drive an hour later he stood in a car park far out to the west of the city beyond his home at blankenese and stared down at the quiet dark flow of the elbes estuary he watched a freighter coming downriver and pondered whenever a difficulty obstructed him timo came to that viewpoint near the village of hetlingen and the bear stayed in the car it was where he scratched his mind for solutions when problems reached crisis point it was indeed a difficulty the coded message gave him the extent of it the local agent the cafe owner was a unit leader a kryetar of a clan a fis to which timo was allied and indisposed was the cover word for arrested a half of the cargo was damaged and could not be sent the lesser man of the two was dead the second half of the cargo the part that contained the more valued items was missing the man he had been paid handsomely to move on from hamburg was in flight he did not know what evidence had been found what the interrogation of the kryetar would throw up what link could be made between himself and the fugitive he seemed to see as he stood in the darkness and watched the river traffic the walls and roof of the maximumsecurity wing at the fuhlsbuttel gaol the extent of the difficulty he would never have acknowledged that crisis had hit him was that for once timo rahman did not know how to protect himself more rain in the late afternoon came with the wind that battered the island he would not intervene oskar netzer could see a frightening beauty in the shape and lines of the circling marsh harrier the killer he knew all of the harriers on baltrum of the three pairs who nested and bred there two had gone south for winter migration and were not yet back but one had stayed he watched the male bird hunting an hour ago he had seen the hen hover over a reed bed with lichen in her talons for nestbuilding against the darkened clouds the harriers upper body feathers and wings made an almost black silhouette earlier it had shouted its keeyoo cry but now it was silent dangerous and beautiful in the lee of a dune of low scrub sheltered by the base of the viewing platform of weathered timber he watched the killer quarter the marshland and knew that when its patience was exhausted it would come over the sand the bushes and the little stagnant lake oskar could recognize the beauty of the harrier which was the enemy of those he loved sitting there with a little rain splattering his back the swirl of the wind in his hair and the cold on his face he could recall the birds of beauty that had come high over him when he had been a child and terrified by the havoc they had brought the fortresses during the day silver specks in front of their vapour trails the lancasters and halifax bombers at night sometimes caught in the cones of searchlights had cruised elegantly over the city and had made the feuersturm below them they had taken the lives of his father and more than forty thousand other citizens of hamburg he knew about beauty and about death flying high for a target he had no right to intervene in the ways of nature but the pain was in him the harrier in front of him had a wingspan of a metre he knew it would come to kill and feed the wind strength changed it swung and slackened the reeds beyond the little lake where the eiders gathered were no longer bent and flailing so fast the fate of a duck one among them was sealed but he would not intervene earlier the wind had blown the harrier away from the lake with its green weed covering the bird of course could cope with wind speeds to storm level but now it would be easier for it to circle select and dive it was a lottery as to which of the gentle eider ducks would be chosen it had been the same lottery that had killed his father when the wall of a blazing building had collapsed and other men on the hose had survived he spat but not noisily enough to disturb the quiet around the lessening whistle of the wind and the rain it was their island it was home as much for the marsh harriers as for his eiders as the bombs had when he was a child the bird plummeted one moment peace the next the chaos of panic he heard the kokkokkok shriek of a male eider and half of its brilliant white winter plumage was buried under the killers weight the struggle was brief the harrier began to rip at the chest feathers where white became black they floated up in the lighter wind and red flesh was exposed oskar was aware then as the harrier feasted of little calls of excitement he looked up there were six of them three couples they were festooned with binoculars and cameras with jutting lenses and wore heavy waterproof clothing they seemed to oskar to rejoice in the images their cameras trapped and when they were satiated on photography they replaced cameras at their eyes with the binoculars and magnified their view of the slaughter then they were bored and moved on the marsh harrier was a third of the weight of its kill it could not lift the carcass of a male eider and fly with it to where the hen built the nest in the reeds it would fill its crop then fly to its partner and regurgitate her food the male eider ravished was left in the mud among a snowfield of feathers he pushed himself up it was oskar netzers habit to follow visitors who came into the territory of baltrums wildlife haven he could stalk as well and as silently as the hunting harrier he skirted the lake where already the surviving birds returned and clattered into the water he took the path that the photographers had he did not look ahead at their receding backs but kept his eyes on the ground beaten down by their walking boots he followed to find fault and purge his anger grim satisfaction settled at his mouth he bent and picked up the cellophane wrapping of a boiled sweet that rested on the most recent indent in the mud of a walking boot and a scrap of the shiny paper that had been around a chocolate bar then three discarded matches further along the path he retrieved the squashed filter tip he quickened his stride when he reached them they were sitting on the crest of a dune and overlooked the sea channel between baltrum and langeoog islands they had a thermos open and drank coffee from plastic beakers when he came towards them they looked away from the white crest waves and smiled a welcome at him through the rain he attacked oskar opened his palm and allowed to drop close to their feet what he had picked up a sweet wrapper a piece of chocolate paper matches and a filter tip you come here where you are not wanted and you desecrate the place go away and take your rubbish with you they stared at him in growing amazement go home scatter your filth on your own ground their faces flushed he thought was pleased by it that he had destroyed their pleasure in photographing and watching the marsh harrier rip apart the duck he turned and strode away behind him a chorus of voices erupted which he ignored what a fucking idiot no just some sad fool must live here the isolations turned his mind wrong not the isolation has to be something more and something deeper probably his whole life is seeing whats different each morning i doubt a flea moves here without him knowing the fool he heard the laughter but kept walking he felt better for the spat he believed it his selfappointed duty to keep the paradise of baltrum pure he went back to the lake where he could watch the eiders the harrier fed would not kill again for three or four days but the carcass was there to be seen and to hurt him from the shadows of the fenced hedge that surrounded the sheds where the amershams maintenance staff kept their tools malachy watched the groundfloor door of the pensioners units he learned the rhythms of the dealers evening and night he was tucked away hidden and hunched down with his back pressed into the thickness of the hedge old thoughts and old lessons stirred in him at chicksands he had been a student in surveillance classes the instructors hardened and bland from time in the province had tried to drill into him and others from the corps what they had practised during months in south armaghs hedgerows and west belfasts ghetto streets sheep because theyre so bloody curious and dogs always the worst because they have that damn gene of suspicion were to be avoided an itch could do for a man because it made movement and movement in a lieup sangar was discovery ora fly up the nose the classes had run for a month two hours every thursday afternoon for four weeks and theyd seemed so inappropriate to malachy as he prepared for his posting to the military attaches office at the embassy in rome he dug deep to remember more of what he had been told on those thursdays when his mind was clouded with the statistics of the italian armed forces and nato strengths if its a oneman lieup and it has to be sometimes youll feel isolated keep your head clear start feeling bloody sorry for yourself and youll show out stay focused everything you see in front of you is relevant the chief instructor had said at the end of the last thursday hed been packing away his clipboard of notes when a young sergeant had raised her hand diffidently excuse me ive just one question shed said what do you do if a dogs right up against you a mean dog the chief instructor had grinned i tell you theres not a dog i cant handle get through to them and theyre all soft as brushes act like youve the right to be there if you show fear the dogll recognize it and youre screwed you want to be on your hands and knees and offering love tender loving care any dogll fall for it and dont ever forget that a dog that lives in a home is always put out at night for a sniff round and a crap last thing the dogs going to be out and free to run when i was based at bessbrook mill and we were doing a lieup near a farm at newtown hamilton there was this big hound a massive bugger and malachy had slipped away had felt the need for more time on his italian files there were no sheep on the amersham no flies in the darknes dog s to get up his nostrils but he had seen the it had come out with the woman an hour earlier shed pushed the pram onehanded and had hung on the short leash with the other it had strained and pulled her and its head had been high as it sniffed the air shed been gone twenty minutes in the direction of the kids play area a television was on in the pensioners unit living room and the brightness flicked at the curtains and lit the bars after shed come back the man the target had brought a plastic bag out through the door and dumped it in the wheelie on the pavement he thought of all those who had made the demons they cavorted in his mind soldiers officers medics and roz the retired brigadier who was his father and the prim tall woman who was his mother the little man who had owned the estate agents had called up the last of the demons he wondered crouched in the darkness whether any of them considered what had happened to him often rarely or never and whether he was a source of amusement or was forgotten with him malachy had the stickybacked binding tape rope a length of cloth the plastic toy and half a packet of digestive biscuits a minibus came to the edge of the estate the road beside the pensioners block he watched three youths jumped down from the side door he had seen them each face lined with terror as they had been hoisted up then lowered jerkily over the rim of the flat roof they would have blinked at the view birds eye of the spinning pavement below freed on police bail malachy assumed there was division among them sullen argument as they stopped close to the groundfloor door where they would have gone before but this was another night after unpredicted change the door opened the dealers voice came sharp to malachy i heard your bloody voices dont come here no more get the message youre dead history piss off malachy felt nothing as if the demons had cauterized emotion no sympathy for them and no anger he saw them drift away and one gave a finger to the closing door youths joined them they were jostled pushed and one fell then they ran he had no concern for their future he had gone feral did not recognize it and none who had known him would have he wore the vagrants clothes damp and stinking and the lustre of the shoes was gone with smeared mud from toe to heel it was past midnight malachy ached with stiffness as he huddled into the hedges shadows a chain was loosened a bolt drawn a lock turned light flooded the pavement the dog off the leash bounded out crossed the road and came to the grass in front of the hedge he saw the man stand in the doorway and there was the flash of a cigarette lighter the dog came to the hedge cocked its leg if you show fear the dogll recognize it and youre screwed he saw the smoke across the road rise from the mans mouth he cooed softly so gently and in his hand were biscuits there was a moment when the hackles on its neck were up and the growl was deep in its throat then the docked tail swung wagged and against his hand was the warm wet slobber of the mouth he gave it love tender loving care he stroked the jowl fur of the dog and murmured at its ear the snarled shout came across the road and the grass come on where are you just get on with it you little fucker hurry up do i have to come and get you chapter seven the sirens had sounded across the estate and there had been a single shot from a lowvelocity weapon muffled and distant then malachy had slept he was curled on the livingroom floor his breathing regular no dreams to toss him on the carpet he was a fallen statue if he had dreamed it would have been of old cloughie sixthform history the romantic who broke up the thirty years war or the industrial revolution or the rise of parliament with unconnected poetry sometimes tennyson more frequently keats or shelley hunched as if broken by exhaustion he lay without a cushion at his head if old cloughie had been with him on level three block nine his surrogate parent would have found the relevant passage near them on the sand half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor well those passions read which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things and would have recited in his falsetto tone shrill with excitement but he did not dream the images were gone lost under the shifting sand he slept deep he was naked the vagrants clothing was back in the binliner under the bed in the next room with what remained of the tape the rope and the plastic toy when he had come back he had eaten the few biscuits left in the packet and had put the wrapping into the rubbish can then he had begun to clean the shoes like a fanatic fighting off tiredness he had wiped off the mud that had camouflaged their shine smeared on the polish and rubbed till they glowed in the dull light only that selfgiven task had kept him awake he needed to hear the sirens they were proof that what he had done was not mere imagination they had come finally before dawn when the wind had pushed back the curtains and first light had seeped inside he had heard the shot and had not known what weapon had fired it malachy slept far from him as if briefly he escaped their reach were the voices that accused then maybe a door slammed on the walkway maybe a car below screamed when the gears failed to mesh maybe the dream was never far enough away he twisted and jerked on to his stomach he woke rubbed his eyes felt the cold of the air on his body hands on his ears as if that would shut out the voices that dinned in his mind his body shook god he cried out what do i have to do what january wheres that wretched man now outside sir sat on a chair bloody hell its all i need on a chair sir in the sunshine the major commanding bravo company paced his operations bunker made a little trail of bare concrete where the dust was kicked aside frustration not the iraqi heat flushed his face you know sergeant mcqueen what ive got on my plate a whole load of shit excuse my vulgarity sir piled up and bloody high with it whats he saying nothing sir far as ive heard not said a word and lost his weapon could say dumped his weapon sir the section retrieved his helmet and his jacket which he apparently abandoned in the street no explanations not that ive heard sir around the major were his secondincommand his signals corporal the platoon commander of the section involved in the patrol and his batman who had brought him a mealreadytoeat supper that he had not touched he did not know when he would get a mouthful down him sergeant mcqueen was by the sandbagged doorway and looking past him the major could see one of the chairs legs and one of the wretchs shins and boots none of the men in the bunker would offer help or be asked to i cant go on the net on this no sir it wouldnt be wise better to put down on paper what you know personal to the colonel not clever to broadcast it on the radio you to the colonel where do i find the time to do that respectfully sir you have to find it right now i havent the time no sir t am trying to organize a lift and i have an o group in an hour and the chance of getting in at dawn fast and out faster is receding by the bloody minute i am waiting to hear back from the village elders who are complaining about the sections response to a fullscale ambush christ what are we supposed to do chuck toffees at them when were taking live rounds xray is reporting barricades going up round the market and theyre gathering for the funeral and and a highvelocity weapon is missing and ive got an officer im told is a coward thats what the men are saying sir a coward its about as bad as it gets the men with him sir theyre using choicer language ill hear it again warts and all makes no difference that hes an officer wrong does make a difference because he is not an eighteenyearold jock first time away from his mum with eight weeks basic behind him and never out of the uk before hes a bloody officer experienced supposed to lead from the front tell it to me and dont stop if i throw up he was told the story for a second time he recognized the canniness of sergeant mcqueen no opinion of his own offered as he listened the major cursed the interruption to his planned lift he saw the interpreter a former policeman not trusted a bloody inch hovering at the door and gestured irritably for his secondincommand to field him he thought his section had done well the corporal had shown fine leadership and the jock who was the marksman had performed in the best traditions of the regiment in his grandfathers war the wretch on the chair outside the bunker would have been tied up to a post blindfolded given a lit cigarette and shot in his fathers war there would have been a stamp on the file lmf dismissal and disgrace for lack of moral fibre and a job digging field latrines the secondincommand handed him a scrawled note the elders would be at bravos main gate in two hours after the o group briefing then he might get down some of his bloody mealreadytoeat if the flies had left any so thats it sir according to what the section members have said do you want me to bring him in sir i do not theyre all good men sir think ive heard enough he broke the pacing in his own war somewhere buried in a filing cabinet was a paper he had never bothered to read it was titled battleshock might as well have been bullshit he felt no guilt that the paper was unread he could not have imagined that one of his own men his jocks would ever be labelled a coward whats to happen sir put him somewhere in isolation where he cant infect anyone else he can be shipped down to battalion in the morning with prisoners weve ivasted enough time on him they can sort him out down there the majors voice softened as if puzzlement caught him itll run with him for the rest of his life wont it i dont know how youd ever get shot of it being called a coward cant imagine theres any way back he paused right the world moves on without him ill do the o group myself ill find him somewhere to sleep sir sergeant mcqueen said impassive its not your worry sir what his future is or isnt and what he does with it or doesnt her knee nudged the bucket spilling it the water flushed out over the floor and the suds went with the flow the tiled floor of the first storey of the ministry was momentarily awash dawns stockings were soaked as were the hem of her skirt and her dull green regulation apron the bucket on its side rolled crazily and noisily away from her her supervisor came running dawn should have had a look of humble apology on her face should have ducked her head in shame at her clumsiness she had been late to work that morning and in less than twenty minutes the first of the gentlemen and ladies who occupied the ministrys offices would be pouring through the main door to be confronted by a danger zone of slippery tiles she laughed and saw a frown pucker her supervisors forehead the response was icy perhaps youd care dawn to share the joke with me she pushed herself up took her weight on the mops handle grimaced righted the bucket then began to swab the river and shepherd the suds towards her she didnt care about the frown and the scowl she had been with the ministry earlymorning cleaning team longer than any of the other women had a reputation for reliability but that morning she had been late to work then tipped over her bucket she laughed again and the echo rang down the corridors off the landing are you well dawn do you need to go and lie down her laughter infectious wiped the frown and warmed the chilliness of her supervisor the young woman squatted beside her well youd better tell me she lowered herself laughter shaking her body and sat on the top step i was late miss correct dawn you were late i was late miss because i just seen the best thing ever an audience had gathered the rest of the cleaning women brought by dawns laughter youd better tell us dawn or the placell be a tip one more convulsion then she launched the amersham is tough the amersham is a hard place i know i have been there twelve years the amersham is the toughest and the hardest druggies thieves muggers weve all of them but what we dont have is police officers maybe the amersham is nogo for them my friend next door she is in the hospital and they have pinned her arm because the druggies thieved off her there is no law on the amersham two days ago three boys of a gang that pushes drugs were attacked and hung upside down from a roof which was good but today

untouchable everybody is frightened of him jason penney we all know his name the police who we never see are alone in not knowing his name i dont know where he lives but we know his name dont speak it i am afraid if i say it but know the name this morning i came out of my block to go to the bus i am not going to be late and i hear the sirens the amersham now is filled with police i follow the sirens i see jason penney it is very funny miss jason penney is tied to a lamp post tied at his ankles with tape and his arms are behind him and round the lamp post and the wrists are tied he has this cloth in his mouth and cannot shout and there is more tape over his eyes it is better miss more funny also tied to the lamp post with rope is his dog the dog is a brute the dog strains to attack the policemen who want to come close to free jason penney the dog does not understand it will not allow them to be near none of the police will approach the dog they are on their radios he has been there all night with his dog and his woman will not telephone the police because he deals heroin and cocaine and the neighbours all old people will not telephone because that involves them he wants to be freed jason penney does because he has been there all night and he needs to pee but the dog keeps the police back he has to piss its all down his leg steaming i promise you can see the steam because the morning is cold everybody there watching is laughing at jason penney nobody before nobody would laugh at him we are all laughing the police bring an officer with a gun it is the amersham not baghdad because of the dog they have a gun and the dog will have to be shot i would not have complained but this woman pushed to the front she works at the dogs home at battersea i clean the offices here she cleans the pens there she said the dog must not be shot must be put to sleep tranquillized dawn thats the word tranquillized yes miss put to sleep everyone now is shouting at the police that the dog must not be killed we wait some more jason penney he cannot wait he pisses again in his trouser another man comes and he shoots at the dog with a dart but that is not enough the dog is too powerful for one dart another is used then we have to stay back until the dog is asleep only when it is snoring like a man with beer do the police go forward what i then heard because jason penney is finished cannot make fear any more and we have laughed at him a woman who knows took the police to a place in the childrens play area where the drugs are stored and the police took them it is what i heard what i know the police cut the wrist binding and put handcuffs on him he will never come back nor will his woman and his baby we are rid of them i have to say dawn that vigilantism can be ugly and is dangerous no miss you do not live on the amersham you do not know how rare it is for us to laugh i promise you miss if you had seen the steam on his trouser leg then you would have laughed however wrong it was i am happy she squeezed the last of the water off her mop and it dripped back into the bucket and from the high windows above the landing the sunlight glistened on the tiles i think it will be dry miss when the gentlemen and the ladies come the trawler rode the light swell made seven knots and pulled the net behind it on the north seas bed the speed harry made with the anneliese royal was enough to keep the mouth of the net open the radar had shown him that fish were there but he could not know till the net was retrieved what he would find in the cod end the pouch where the catch was trapped billy was out at the stern watching for the drag on the tackle that would tell them they had snagged an obstruction he had the boy paul with him in the wheelhouse and he talked of what he loved all done by sail by men who knew the sea and had the skills handed down to them a hundred years ago those men were lucky to make a wage of twenty shillings a week a pound of our money a week brixham men were the finest in all england could handle the deep hull and the long keel in any weather brilliant men and they fought fought so bad when they muscled in on the newlyn fishing port that there were pitched battle riots there and the royal navy sent a destroyer to make peace in imagine it a destroyer with fourinch guns sent to break the fighting now look ive every device science can make to take me where im going and show me where the fish are a hundred years back under sail with a sloop rig they had only their experience to guide them no radar no gps they were fishing right round the waters of the uk channel north sea atlantic irish sea the western approaches and the skippers knew where they were from a lead line because there were no charts theyd smear tallow thats grease from sheep fat on the lead at the end of the line and the length of line out would tell the skipper the depth and when the line came in there were scraps of the sea bed stuck in the tallow and theyd recognize it they could taste the bottom from the tallow and know where they were they was brilliant men and the sea was filled with fish like they were shoulder to shoulder belly to back they were the best harry sat in his swing chair and sipped the coffee the boy had brought him and the boy lounged back against the chart table he thought the boy was interested he heard the clump of boots and saw billy at the open wheelhouse door it was brixham men in who sailed right up the channel right out into the north sea and they were going for the dogger bank between tynemouth and the danish coast and they found the silver pits just south of the bank no lie in one haul of the trawl one boat brought in two thousand and forty pairs of flatfish sole they were pioneers wonderful men and were crap right dad billy chuckled any chance of some work getting done the boy followed his father away back to the stern soon the trawl would be over and the diesels would turn the capstans to drag the nets in and they would spill the catch down into the fish room no bloody way would there be pairs of sole not even if the whole of lowestofts fleet was out but it was harrys dream that he would find an old boat and work it back to seaworthiness and if he were blessed the boy would help him sail her if ricky capel freed him if he were ever freer than the catch struggling and thrashing in the cod end of the trawl the morning sunlight splashed through the windscreen ricky sat in the front passenger seat and was driven over tower bridge into the city of london he looked away from his cousins and down on the riverboats on the column of barges being towed downstream and the pleasurecraft with tourists on the open deck thered come a time ricky reckoned when the cousins outgrew their usefulness to him like old shoes old socks too holed and too worn what then that was his problem he did not know in the future for another day right now they headed for the narrow streets of the city charlie reckoned the city might be a step too far but acknowledged the marketplace there benji had identified the hole then had seemed to back off and shelve his enthusiasm davey hadnt an opinion on it three guys had gone down in the crown court in south london twelve years nine years and eight years dumb ricky had said bloody mad charlie had murmured that the assets recovery agency was now looking for the profits the trio had made from a trade of seven million a year turnover and that was big bread and benji had stated the obvious cocaine in the city was good money and there was a vacuum in the marketplace fucking idiots ricky had called them fucking idiots to flash their money daveys job the car had been swept that morning for bugs was in a secure garage each night it was an ordinary saloon that attracted no attention inside the car they could talk turning in his seat smiling the baby grin at benji ricky asked you going to fight me on it youll do whats best ricky its off our territory what im saying go on say it we dont have people here its not our place big bucks whats your take on it charlie the wankers want cocaine cant sit in front of their little screens and press the tits without it we know that we know also that theyre megarich cant spend it fast enough but unless theyre dosed up they dont perform and get ditched against that weve no organization up here we dont know people we dont know the suppliers and we dont know the dealers we dont know who to trust its just to have a look ricky said softly and still smiled but his eyes played the menace theyd recognize just to get a feel he rarely came into the city he would have needed charlie to tell him how many millions he had invested after laundering in bonds shares and trusts that were handled behind the monument in cheapside leadenhall street or cornhill his face was pressed against the window he watched the ones charlie called the wankers young men striding the pavements or loitering outside for a cigarette or carrying sandwiches and coffee beakers from the fastfood counters some of them a few dosed up on snorted cocaine might have taken responsibility for seeing those bonds shares trusts grow other than the apartment in chelsea harbour he had no use for the money charlie washed for him to spend it was to flash it to flash it was to be a fucking idiot to be a fucking idiot was to go down in a crown court for a dozen years what was it for it bothered him late at night joannes back to him looking at the bloody ceiling hearing the goddamn clock chime downstairs it turned in his mind what was it for he was the clever boy whod never been lifted never pushed himself up the snouts of the crime squad or the criminal intelligence service lived like a bloody virgin with his legs crossed in bevin close he didnt do yachts down in the south of france didnt do private jets to the mediterranean didnt do big charity bashes with celebrities and camera flashlights and didnt do time every move he made was weighed each place he spoke his mind was swept for bugs no mates to be with like his grandfather had had or like mikey with his friends from inside percy had never had power neither had mikey ricky had power they went past banks the old buildings used by the traders the new towers for the insurance people the wine bars they filled during the lunch hour and for bingedrinking after work the sandwich outlets at which they snatched their lunch the subways they poured from in the mornings and dived into in the evenings for an hour they drove davey let the traffic hold them was not impatient when they were blocked by delivery vans the cousins all kept their peace ricky swallowed the sights absorbed them he thought and it frustrated him but he did not share it that risk ruled him just a local boy and happy to do a patch of south london no flair no balls safe and comfortable around him there was a market bigger than anything hed ever gone for of cocaine addiction and the market was holed because three fucking idiots had gone down dont try to run till youve learned to walk charlie always said they were up by aldgate and turning into jewry street davey had taken him on two full city circuits ricky said ive seen enough god what a bloody awful place this is how itll be start at the bottom and test it id say a sandwich bar put a new man better a new woman into a sandwich bar just one of those holes in the wall and sell out of it dont touch any of the dealers or the suppliers who are already there set up from scratch a new man or a new woman who is a cutout get some kid from the north wherever someone whos not known or doesnt know us to act as courier take the stuff in and bring the cash out wrap it round with cutouts let it run for a year then maybe its another sandwich bar theres a hole to be filled and were going to fill it you ok guys benji said quietly one thing ricky what about the scrubs what about gaol delivery the scrubs or the city i mean you can only take on so much new stuff which comes first both of them they both come first they all nodded with enthusiasm spot on ricky benji said polly ducked her head to the policeman that gesture and she was a master of it humble and requiring help always opened doors for her ludvik was supposed to have phoned ahead had promised he would and she had told him with true sincerity creasing her face that all she wanted was a few minutes poking time around the cafe you know ludvik only to get a sense of where were at i wouldnt want to waste your time and im better on my own for a moment the policeman hesitated if the phone call had been made it probably had not the officer guarding the cafes front door had not been warned to expect her her ducked head a glimpse of her knee below her skirt her smile and the flash of her diplomatic card were sufficient for him to stand aside excellent she had dreaded delay a radio transmission to a senior officer a senior officer speaking to a lord high panjandrum and her left to kick her heels the czechs of the bis could share with her but she would not reciprocate the cafes door was splintered at the lock where it had been battered open if she had been delayed explanations would have been demanded of her and she had no intention of offering them she went inside and pointedly pulled the door shut behind her she wanted no witnesses in that basement cell where the cafes owner had been beaten where nothing of value had been recorded on the interrogation tape only polly wilkins had registered the spots of white paint on the mans hands had it not been for the blackandwhite images of his crumpled body and bruised knuckles she might not have seen them in the cell when shed held the hands the spots had been more indistinct but they were there chaos in the cafe bar every table turned over most of the chairs broken a carpet of smashed cups plates and glasses and the chrome coffee machines split open she thought it pure vandalism and unnecessary stupid if a forensics team had followed inside the men who had broken down the door they would have found nothing everything contaminated she looked around her pictures of mountains hung askew on the walls or had been ripped off their hooks and lay smashed on the floor posters for last years rock concerts in albania were shredded photographs of a football team survived behind the bar counter she noted them it was all about detail not about the most that could be broken ripped smashed shredded her flat shoes crunched glass and china as she went through the cafe bar to the back every door of the ovens left open every pot and every pan dropped every cupboard searched through and the contents scattered when she cabled gaunt when she had something to signal him there would be one tetchy paragraph about the need for a new item on the courses for the bis search procedures and good housekeeping the walls in the kitchen were lime green but dumped out from under the sink was a small tin of paint white she moved on she had seen from the street before she had used her littlegirllost eyeflutter on the policeman that there was a side door beside the cafe entrance with two bells above the cafe were three floors simple to deduce the floor immediately above was part of the cafes premises the two top floors were separate she climbed the stairs difficult because the carpet had been pulled from its nails there was a living room a bathroom and a bedroom more devastation from the landing she glanced briefly into the living room but the walls were pink yellowpainted walls in the bedroom of no interest to her the bathroom had white walls a picture of the sequence played in her mind a dishcloth hung out above an alley behind kostecna a man comes perhaps the cafe owner himself and notes it inside the cafe time racing a frantic effort to hide evidence a stash point is made filled hidden she roved over the toilet the stained old basin the shower cubicle with the collapsed screen then saw the fractured mirror and the smear of new paint at its side she put her fingers behind the weakened fastenings of the mirror and heaved it came away and plaster spattered from the screw holes the paint behind the mirror should have been greywhite but it was pristine not so good not so smart everybody told her when they bent her ear that the albanian crime gangs were the most sophisticated in europe but not with a paintbrush she ran her fingers over the white patch felt its slight tackiness and could smell it she could not see a join that at least was clever she made a fist with her hand and hit the patch hard with the heel her hand came back and she yelped with pain downstairs in the kitchen she found a hammer back in the bathroom polly swung her arm back and belted the whitened patch where the mirror had been hit it again and again paint cracked a wood screen splintered a brick was loosened with the hammers claw she prised it out she grinned she was carnarvon in the pharaohs tomb she slipped on plastic gloves from her shoulder bag and made ready a clutch of plastic bags she reached inside first she extracted the money euros and dollars maybe five thousand in alldenomination notes and put them into the first bag then she lifted out four passports one from argentina and one from lebanon one from syria and one from canada she flipped the pages of the visa and immigration stamps syria and argentina were a pair lebanon and canada matched them she could follow the trail of two men saudi jordanian syrian and turkish stamps in two passports bulgarian romanian and hungarian in the argentine and canadian documents no czech visas she would have bet on it that one passport was charred and unrecognizable in the debris of the topfloor apartment and that another was in the inner pocket of the man who had slipped through the cordons net she flipped back the pages in those from syria and argentina she found the photograph easy to match from the files sent by gaunt of muhammad iyad dead because of a present to his wife she stared at the photograph in the passports of argentina and canada and whooped in excitement they went into another bag last out was a cheap stationers notepad bound with a wire coil the writing she knew it but could not read it was in albanian tosk page after page of scribbled accounts notes and phone numbers but before the blank pages shreds of paper were lodged in the coil as if the last sheet used had been torn out the notepad went into a third plastic bag she put all the bags at the bottom of her shoulder bag then covered them with the makeup sack she never used her spectacle case her mobile her headscarf and finally her purse she replaced the mirror used her thumbnail swore when she broke it to tighten the screws and cover the hole shed hammered then kicked the debris on the floor to the far side of the bathroom she thought of gaunt poor old gaunt who had had his share of slings and arrows who had had to tramp up to the top floor and tell the weasel the add that a storm assault had failed to net the prize she would have him singing she went down the stairs steadying herself on the rail so she did not slip on the uprooted carpet left the hammer in tire kitchen she emerged into the light but the policeman looked away from her evasively ludvik leaped out of a car parked on the far side of the street he hurried to her what was your business there like i told you just to get a sense of where were at thats all did you find anything of course not your people had searched with impressive rigour innocence no sarcasm did she want a lift no she thanked him trust nobody gaunt had told her when shed gone to work for him not your best girlfriend polly not the man you sleep with not your mother only trust yourself the savaging of the wmd team gaunts fall and her shuffled out of sight others drifting to shamed retirement had shown her the truth of it she went back on the metro to her office in the embassy clinging to the strap of her bag gaunt had said on the phone im not fucking about dennis dont have time to im the opposition and im trying to hurt us whos the man thats most important to me who above all others do i protect i think i know but i want confirmation there were three police at the first checkpoint a handsome woman her figure set off by her uniform fair hair protruding from under the back of her hat looked at his offered id then checked for his name on her list and ticked it flamboyantly the other two police were dour with heckler amp koch rifles slung from straps across their flakjackets gaunt did not queue with the riffraff but drove to the head of the next line was again scrutinized was again passed through there were more guns on the approach road more on the perimeter fencing and on top of the building ahead he saw the dark uniforms and jutted shapes of marksmens rifles dennis had said he would be at the magistrates court that morning if gaunt wanted advice counselling maybe a shoulder to snivel on this was where he had to come behind the court building were the high walls of hmp belmarsh gaunt had never been here before far out to the east of london the drive had taken him an hour and he was late and irritable but he needed the answer the prison and the magistrates court were set on the flat reclaimed land of plumstead marshes it would take more than sunshine he thought to brighten the place more checks and inside the buildings hallway he had to pass through a metal detector empty his pockets on to a tray and put his briefcase through the scanner he and dennis had been at officer training school together then done time as junior cavalry officers a unit of lancers before they reached the rank of major both had been washed up having failed to make the promotion grades and both had gone the civilian route the difference was that gaunt had taken a position in the secret intelligence service while dennis had entered the security service in gaunts mob denniss crowd was regarded as junior second best not that he would show it that morning whatever the provocation having produced his id for the fourth time he was issued with a clipon card then led by a clerk to the canteen dennis was there good to see you freddie been so long tell you the truth i was quite surprised to get your call you know we hear things id assumed what with the springclean in your lot the wmd people that youd have had the chop so you managed to avoid the cull well done just need a spot of your wisdom never believe what you hear dennis im alive and still beavering the little woman is she well i think so last i heard she was he could have made a reference to denniss obvious weight increase could have suggested he might consider going to a consultant about the lump on the left side of the nose could have asked about the recent leapfrog advancement of younger officers over the man opposite him he did not its good of you to make space for me youre looking a bit peaky freddie pressure of work his smile was affable youre busy im busy i have a question for you who is a jewel who in an aq operation is the man who must be protected youll understand of course if im sparse with detail who gets a bodyguard who is worth dying for to buy time for escape in our neck of the woods not yet sorry cant expand on that in europe and hes on the move come on dennis stood left a tip on the table that was barely decent and led him to a guarded door at the far end of a corridor they were passed through and gaunt was eyed with suspicion more guns more flakjackets down a staircase flanked with whitetiled walls then into the cell block a food trolley was wheeled noisily in front of the doors and plates of meat congealed sauce and rice were pushed on to the shelf space set in each door in turn gaunt saw hands come to the shelves and take away the plates then the flaps fell theyre having early lunch some damned delay in the paperwork so they wont be up till afternoon i worked on it and thats why you had to flog yourself down here there are eight of them on remand take a look for yourself gaunt did there was a spyhole in each cell door the interiors were brightly lit some ate picky and choosy some had put the plate down beside them on the thin plasticcoated mattress and stared blankly at the food but did not touch it one wept silently one sobbed noisily and his shoulders shook gaunt estimated their ages at between eighteen and midtwenties they were all asian he assumed they were of pakistani ethnic origin above his jeans one wore an arsenal football top and anothers tshirt advertised suzuki motorcycles trainers were common to them all he remembered now on the far side of the canteen from where dennis had sat the families in the dress of rawalpindi peshawar or karachi and the lawyers huddled with them at the seventh cell door when the guard stepped aside to allow him to get to the spyhole he saw a youth who was different not by his clothes but by his face all the others had seemed broken and bowed down whether they cried or whether they stifled their misery this was a boy not yet a man whose attention lay in the computing magazine he read who had an alertness the others lacked he checked the eighth door halfway down the block dennis leaned comfortably against a tiled wall seen enough i suppose so theyre the haul from operation angurvadel not my idea of a moniker by the way down to a bright spark on the aq desk who did scandinavian studies at lancaster its a sword in norse mythology that burns bright in war and goes dull in peace antiterrorist and the branch had a terrible problem with it and most of us anyway alqaeda and the warriors frithiofs sword came together we hauled them in theyre footsoldiers from east london west london luton and bedford look at them do they seem threatening to you of course they dont some would label them the enemy within i tell you freddie they were all out of their depth we had taps on them through their mobiles we had their homes bugged we had them under surveillance for weeks before the arrests actually they were quite harmless there was chatter among them that was enough to get us interested they did not have detonators or commercial or military explosive but the chatter was sufficient to spell out their intention we have lines into most of the mosques where the hot airs shouted put simply they never had a chance and theyll probably get ten years each for being naive gullible and subject to the indoctrination of a recruiter still with me so theyre not jewels none of them has been near an aq training camp in afghanistan or yemen nearest theyve been to the sharp end is watching videos of atrocities and fire fights in chechnya saudi and iraq that doesnt mean they wouldnt have been prepared to detonate a bomb in the centre of london or at cribbs causeway or at glasgow airport and go up with it no lack of courage just a lack of expertise which is whats holding them back and why we are still most of the time winning what are they short of please freddie patience what they have in common they were all born in the uk they all come from respectable families none of them has a police record we pick them up because when they get faith in a large dose theyve headed for a mosque and an imam who is talking jihad they read a manual that details the methodology of blessed strikes but thats not sufficient what if there are footsoldiers who dont go to a radical mosque and we dont pick up because theyre not close to a firebrand imam what if theyre directed by a man who understands the acquisition of explosives detonators who understands our capability of electronic surveillance and how we can make mobile phones dance to our tune then were in trouble thats the nightmare that gets me to my desk before half seven and i dont leave that desk before ten in the evening a group of footsoldiers weve never heard of a recruiter we havent identified and theyre controlled by a man whose safety is worth dying for who is that man dont you know freddie id have assumed you did the cell block seemed to close round him he could smell the food the toilets the sweat of the guards in their protective vests the corridor lights shone down dully on denniss face suddenly gaunt was cold and bile rose in his throat he choked it out that would be a coordinator if you knew why did you bother to trek over here he comes in organizes at a level of quality then is well gone before the blessed strike they accounted for all of the madrid train crowd except the coordinator the coordinator is your jewel freddie if a coordinator had had his hands on that lot dennis waved expansively towards the cell doors they wouldnt be here and wed have been shafted good and proper thank you halfway up the stairs going towards clean air and clean light he turned and caught gaunts sleeve if you get the whisper that your mans coming near youll tell me wont you give me chapter on it and verse or its explosion time and fucking catastrophe you will if i get the whisper if outside gaunt sat in his car for a full ten minutes his hands shook and he waited for them to calm nothing in his life cold war warrior iraq war warrior organizedcrime war warrior had prepared him for what he had seen young men who were pitiful in defeat and slumped in cells and for what he had heard he thought of dennis pompous and pointscoring hurrying to thames house each morning before the throb of the capital city beat on the masses and the nightmare that engulfed him he drove away through the blocks and past the guns the image of the coordinator free and running loose stayed with him all the way to his desk and the hideous problem if the prague trail went cold where to bloody look for him the policeman watched timo rahman with the closeness of a hunting fox he was johan konig it was the start of the second week of his attachment to the organized crime division he had come from berlin seconded as assistant deputy commander on bogus credentials he sat in on the meeting probably his presence in the offices of the special investigation unit of the revenue and the deception used to put him there violated rahmans human rights he was fortyseven short and barrelchested and his hair had thinned inside the close circle of men and women in berlin with whom he had worked konig had achieved a reputation as a detective of stubborn persistence what had brought him from berlin to hamburg was this target a true prize rahman had not spoken since the meeting had begun on his side of the wide shiny table the albanian was flanked by three accountants who talked for him konig was at the end of a line of four revenue men carafes of water and glasses not used stood in front of each team with bundles of files the meeting had been called so the notification to rahmans accountants had stated to discuss routine general matters each question from the revenue men was directed to rahman personally and each answer came back from whichever accountant covered that particular issue the man fascinated konig who spoke fluent albanian he had been on the anticorruption team of the international police task force sent to pristina in kosovo he had learned there of the ruthless qualities of kosovar albanians their endemic criminality cruelty secretiveness and power his transfer from berlin to a city where he was unknown was for the express purpose of bringing the pate before the courts and convicting him konig was intrigued by his targets bearing for the first halfhour of the meeting he had thought rahmans demeanour was almost of indifference indifference few men when their investments property portfolios and interest on deposits ran to millions of euros a year and they were examined by a revenue team working only on special investigations displayed indifference the mans skill impressed him too the file konig had read stated that rahman spoke good german and read it well but each time a question was asked him in that language he gave no sign of understanding that was clever he looked blankly at his accountants left them to answer formidable rahman as konig knew it dominated the sex narcotics and humantrafficking trades in the city he controlled them he was the leader of the wealthiest fis in western europe he had the power to kill corrupt and intimidate yet he appeared to be a humble businessman with no ambition other than through his accountants to pay his dues in taxes konig thought it the performance of a master the revenue men on his side of the table did not know konigs position he had been introduced to them as an investigator from berlins tax unit he was there for experience they had been told on an exchange visit he had no need to intervene was as quiet as the target he watched always if it were possible konig wanted to see a target close up to watch his hand movements and see if his fingers fidgeted sense whether he was nervous and note if sweat came to his neck did the tongue flick over his lips to moisten them did he shift in the chair was he too friendly and agreeable or too hostile to gaze into the eyes the meeting would soon be over konig had not looked long into the eyes had not dared to there were russian gangs in berlin polish mafiya the cold little bastards from vietnam who ran the cigarette trade pimps from all over eastern europe and albanians he would have looked into any of the eyes confronting him across an interview table in the interrogation block and not been fazed an experienced police officer twentynine years of service behind him a spell at wiesbaden with intelligence and time in new york on secondment he had never before failed to look deep into the eyes of a target something in the eyes of timo rahman and he could not have explained it unsettled him he would have thought himself without fear he found that each time rahman glanced along the length of the table and at the men opposite him he looked away never before his mind had drifted sunlight made zebra stripes on the table from the blinds sharp lines formed patterns on rahmans face the man scratched his head then looked down at his watch indifference johan konig understood preoccupation wants to be somewhere else handling another situation extraordinary timo rahman with his accountants was having his wealth dissected by a body of the revenue endowed with sanctions and his mind was elsewhere what could be more important than the business at the table every minute he had sat in the room now seemed to konig to be justified a weightier problem exercised the pate from problems came mistakes the policeman felt his confidence surge he looked into the eyes chilled bright the eyes met his he did not look away he held the albanians glance that was a victory the meeting broke up the revenue men at the door shook hands with the accountants in turn and with timo rahman konig stayed at the table a problem he could learn about a mistake he could exploit as the door closed on them he tilted back his chair to gaze at the ceiling and wondered what or who would explain it as malachy finished his meal a meat pie boiled potatoes and beans then wiped the plate with bread he heard them coming along the walkway there was a deathly hush on the amersham that day and the sounds drifted to him clearly wheels squeaking a heavy footstep shuffled shoes approached then passed his door and stopped he gulped the last of the bread and listened keys turned and there was the scrape of the barricade gate opening a big voice familiar home now millie where you should be dawnll get you to bed and then you rest the next door shut and the gate clanged to a moment of quiet then a rap on his own door heh malachy you there you there man he pulled down the bolt and turned the key the great bulk of ivanhoe manners filled the doorway i was by here seemed right to call on you i do driving for the hospital when i have the time you know a day off brought millie johnson home and her friend shes in a wheelchair for the moment but shes strong in spirit her guts they should be an example to those who lock themselves away he stared keenly at malachy are you going to leave me standing here malachy stood aside whatever you want i want to see how you are are you standing on your own feet or are you leaning or are you on the floor im managing malachy said softly are you ready to move on i dont know you got work you looking for work malachy shook his head then hung it theres work out there for those who look for it with work you could pay a proper rent and free up the unit eight months here right ive a queue that needs units you tell me malachy whats happening on the amersham what gives he saw the social worker gaze around him he would not notice anything different from the day he had been brought here same table same chairs same tv and settee same carpet would not know that through a door and under the bed in the bag with the vagrants clothes were the last of the tape and the rope and a plastic toy but ivanhoe manners missed little you done well on the shoes thats good polishing theyre the right shoes to wear if you go for a job they show purpose like youre climbing back i asked what gives on the amersham police dont know and we dont know malachy shrugged like he avoided events beyond his bolted and locked front door im asking malachy three of the high fly boys strung upside down off a roof and their authority finished thats happening a classa dealer roped to a post thats happening i have this gigantic and massive confusion man help me i dont think i can you please yourself i dont support what happened to the boys or the dealer no sympathy for it from me a gesture but its the way to anarchy where did the spark for it come from nothing for me to say that would help you the big man went back to the door opened it and his smile beamed white teeth at malachy get on the road man you done your time here get walking in those fancy shoes you need your life back and sitting like a cat in a cage wont do it for you do it soon each day youre here whatever was in your past thats a wasted day im offering advice and its meant kindly you should feed off that little womans courage get living again thank you for calling by ill go when im ready he closed the door after the social worker locked it and pushed up the bolt chapter eight the train rattled across country on a slow stopping line in a few days the clocks would go forward and the evenings would stay brighter dusk hovered over the carriages and the track and weak pinpricks of light marked remote homes set among the grey of the fields hedges and woodlands it was a complicated journey for malachy the longest he had made since coming to london one leg from the amersham estate to victoria by bus the next on a fast train south to redhill and the last on the line that stopped everywhere at marlpit hill penshurst paddock wood mardon and headcorn his journey was nearly complete the carriages were filled with schoolchildren their bags and noise with shop workers and shoppers with the first of the office commuters to get away from their desks he wore the old clothes and his shoes were caked with mud from a litterstrewn garden in the play area he stood in the rocking space between two of the carriages he smelt and knew it his woollen hat was low on his head and the collar of his coat was turned up to mask his face as passengers passed him to board the train or get off it they hurried by because of the smell that came from the plastic bag gripped in his fist he never put the bag down but kept it tight against his leg malachy knew that at every station there were cameras and that cameras were now routinely fitted inside train compartments an old world returned to him he recalled lectures from long ago care ruled him and he had regained a longlost cunning his ticket expensive but not wasted money was for folkestone far beyond his destination it would act as a confusion if his route was traced the clatter of the train soothed him and the map given him and memorized then destroyed was loose in his mind in a few minutes as dusk fell he would reach the stop they had chosen there had been money with the map without it he would not have been able to buy the ticket and fill the canister in the bag that smelt the train had begun to slow and a remote voice announced the approach of the next station pluckley now the lights set back among bare trees and behind cut hedges shone more fiercely in his mind with the map was the quiet rasp of the voice from the darkened interior of the car from a face he could not see youve done better than i thought you would a hell of a sight better nothing more is asked of you all i can do is tell you whats at the next stage upwards of the pyramid you hit the bottom level the pushers but theyre just lowlife scum above them is the dealer and you took him out and he wont be back but hes only a vile little creature its your decision who feeds the dealer so that he can sell to the pushers you may say and youve the right to that you went far enough trouble is what im thinking all youve done is disrupt temporarily the trade on the amersham and that may not be enough to help you where you want to be up the ladder right you want to be able to look in a mirror see your face and not cringe in disgust am i there are the dealer and the pushers sufficient to get you as high up the ladder as you need to be if the mirrors showing you your face but like i say its your decision you can walk away or you can ask the question and ill answer it the train jerked slowed some more shook as the brakes were applied began to crawl he pulled the wool hat lower and lifted the collarflaps higher kids shoppers and commuters gathered around him but he turned away his face as their lips curled in disgust at the smell i thought you would you were right to ask the question well done its an easy one to answer it would put you right up the ladder high up it if thats where you want to be me i cant do it i work at a desk im ringfenced with regulations im going through the motions like the people round me and the people above me yes we look busy were good at that we pump out the spin about the success of what we do get it into glossy brochures and when i go home at night i can honestly say to myself total honesty that i have achieved less than nothing theyre cleverer than us sharper and smarter when my pensions ticking over nicely building why should i care i saw millie got me my aunt my blood and i saw her you are on her doorstep and you are there and you are available the train lurched to a stop others pushed past him and hurried off down the gloomy platform with the wool hat down and the collar up malachy followed them if a camera found and tracked him he offered it little for identification a dealer needs a supplier thats the stage up the pyramid a supplier way over the level of the amersham hes big big and ugly he lives fat and well you knock over a supplier and that will send a shockwave not an earthquake but a real good tremor shakes the room swings the light moves the furniture brings the plaster down that gets noticed i never met you here people will swear on a bible that i was never late at night in a parking bay on the amersham we never talked you are on your own and i will disown you your word against mine the word of a man labelled a coward against the word of a police officer with twentysix years service and not a blemish on his record sorry about that but its worth the reminder how you do it is your business hes the supplier malachy came out of the station and down a street then left the high lights and the memory of the map brought him to darkness and on to lanes hemmed in by hedges his lustreless shoes splashed in puddles he stepped out occasionally cars swept by him accelerating and spraying him as if he had no right to be there the plastic bag weighed down by the canister thumped against his thigh he remembered everything said to him of him and overheard what it had done to him and what had been taken from him he saw in front of him clearer than the trees hedges and homes up long curving gravel drives the ladder and the steps on it he walked for nearly an hour before the twinkling lights of a remote building set back from the lane confirmed the map and showed him the suppliers home come on girls hurry up for gods sake youre beautiful enough already move it please laughter rang through the panelled hall and spilled from two of the bedrooms up the wide sweep of the stairs he needed laughter had been short of it that day george wright needed laughter and a good party to get him past the aggravation of the morning the scumbag penney off the amersham up in southeast london was a broken stick taken out humiliated on his patch and now in a police cell the scumbag had just taken delivery and not paid up should have paid up that morning with fifteen thousand in used notes all about cashflow the cashflow of a dozen dealers after george wright had taken his cut was needed to pay the importer it was all tight money in and money out and when the money coming in was short thered be a problem with the money o u t and that was what was owed to the little bastard with the baby face ricky capel he had a good coat armani hitched on his shoulder and the tie of friends of kent county cricket club loose at his throat and he was waiting for his girls the party was at fortescues place there would be people there from all the villages between hothfield and bethersden fortescue always threw the best parties live music caterers in from royal tunbridge wells and a cabaret turn down from london and the cream came from the villages commerce and the professions it was the mark of george wrights acceptance into the community as a respected and admired businessman that he always received the embossed invitation to fortescues spring thrash and the autumn one he had a reputation for success fortescue and the others who sent invitations to the wright family believed he dealt in quality cars bread and butter so they believed was in the mercedes topoftherange models or bmws and also in ferraris lamborghinis and morgans with no waiting time for delivery the privateclinic consultants legal senior partners farmers with a thousand acres of prime land the chief executive officers and their wives would have gone puce and needed resuscitation if they had known that their neighbour friend and sometimes guest dealt in the classa drugs they whinged about at parties his trade and the source of his wealth were well hidden tucked away under the floorboards of his office off the living room god would they never come hurry up girls do me a favour shift it george wright sweated not on the delayed appearance of his girls but on the problem of cashflow if a dealer defaulted he took no exercise was plump to the border of obesity sweat pooled at the back of his neck and on his balding forehead he needed the party needed it bad the thought of ricky capel made him sweat even if the shortfall was only fifteen thousand less his own cut last year a dealer in croydon had done a runner after taking delivery and not paid up george wright had gone to his bank in the centre of ashford drawn the necessary cash out of his deposit account and used it to make up what he owed hed told ricky capel of his problem glad you did that georgie ricky had said grinning snake eyes flashing wouldnt want you whatever the reason to see me short wouldnt want that who was it turned you over a week later he had read in the evening paper and found it hard to hold the page steady that the dealers body had been located in ashdown forest the police were quoted as saying he had been tortured then garotted with cheese wire he hadnt seen ricky capel since communication was by mobile phone pay as you go with number changes every two weeks and dropoffs and pickups wouldnt want you whatever the reason to see me short hadnt forgotten that they came down the stairs melanie in a little black dress and hannah in an offtheshoulder scarlet number both a picture melanie knew what he did knew but did not ask details hannah was wrapped up in her pony and her gymkhana rosettes didnt know and thought money grew on the orchards trees he was on a treadmill from which there was no exit point everything he owned came from supplying classa narcotics the house a mocktudor pile with mocktudor panelling worth a million at least maybe one point two and no mortgage on it was from heroin and cocaine the landscaped gardens the paddock and the stable block for the pony were from heroin and cocaine the friendship of the neighbours and party hosts was from a social position based on heroin and cocaine without it he had nothing would be back to doortodoor insuranceselling where he had been before brown powder and white powder had intruded into his life and hed snatched at it youre both a bloody treat fantastic there was no sharp step off the treadmill he knew too much about too many if he grassed he had the certainty that no gaol was safe for him and no safety for melanie and hannah he helped his wife and daughter into their coats shrugged into his jacket and paused in front of the mirror to lift his tie he collected his keys his own vehicle was a scarletbodied vintage jaguar his girls followed him out to it and closed the door mock old timbers behind them he drove away left lights blazing behind him he went down the tarmacadam drive past the postandrail fencing of the paddock flicked the sensor that opened the outer iron gates and turned into the lane their chatter was vivid around him who would be there what the cabaret turn would be what theyd eat the foreboding fled him in his compartmentalized life george wright could usually slip without effort from the world of supplying heroin and cocaine sold to him by ricky capel into that of one more successful and legitimate businessman resident in the kent countryside melanie was saying what shed heard it was supposed to be a secret worth taking to the grave about the identity and the act of the cabaret from london hannah shrieked watch out daddy hadnt seen the man he swerved to the right side of the lane then corrected only a glimpse a man a dosser vagrant or tinker stood blinded by the jaguars lights pressed himself into the hedge and averted his face he was clutching a plastic bag they were past him he swung his head looked back into the darkness beyond the glow of his taillights saw nothing bloody hell never seen him before where does he think hes going you did the alarm of course i did his wife answered relax george were going to a party forgotten that it was another halfmile down the road to the partys fairylights and the thud of music they had done an hour at the fortescues house of drinks nibbles and conversations yelled to be heard above the fourman stripedwaistcoatandbowlerhat jazz band when his host loomed at george wrights side you see that see what didnt you hear them hear what god george are you deaf or pissed two fire engines going up the lane like bats out of hell whats up past you only the gutheridges place but thats two miles then the blakes market garden then the cottages but if they were going to any of them id have thought coming from ashford theyd have used the tenterden road know what i mean george wright broke away ran up the stairs headed for the side bedroom where the fortescues boy giles slept when he was home from school he blundered through a room filled with books hifi equipment hockey sticks and tennis racquets and dragged aside the curtains he pressed his face against the mullion lead and the glass real not mock like the windows of his home and saw the glow in the sky and sparks climbing like they were fireworks and fancied he could make out through the screen of trees what seemed to be the licking tongues of flames he sank to his knees and the sweat ran to his stomach bulge and he seemed to hear laughter like ricky capels that billowed up the stairs with the music dont mind my asking ricky wheres your necklace round my throat where else would it be not that one not your mums the one i gave you why arent you wearing it his hand went up to his throat he felt the thin chain sharons present to him for his twentyfirst and touched the crucifix that hung from it dont know he said dont rightly know somewhere she was paring her fingernails had her head down as she sat in the easy chair and the tv prattled with a game show worked hard with the file did it with the same intensity with which she cleaned the house you said you liked it whyve you taken it off cost ever so much ricky had said he liked the heavy gold chain from a bond street store he had not taken it off it had cost a little more than three thousand pounds and that was with the discount for cash his money its somewhere of course its somewhere she must have been satisfied with her fingers she kicked off her slippers and started on the toenails scraping at them like it mattered have you lost it dont tell me youve lost it did you he had not known that he wasnt wearing it she had bought it for him last christmas and he had worn it every day every night since then i dont know where it is you have lost it maybe i have maybe i havent you got to know whether you lost it or not you got to know whether you didnt like it and took it off i dont there was a snarl in his voice but with her head bent over her toenails she would not have seen it well have you looked for it yes where have you looked for it i didnt know it wasnt on oh thats great i buy you a necklace big money you say you like it you promise me you do you lose it and you dont even know her voice had a chisel rasp seemed like the beat of a dripping tap had that rhythm and persistence ill look for it i hope you will right foot done she started on the toes of the left id say that looking for it is the first thing you should do that necklace ricky was supposed to be important i said id look for it all right where where are you going to look for it i dont know if i bloody knew it wouldnt be lost no call for you to swear at me ricky i just gave it you i didnt lose it he had been so tired that evening what hed wanted was to be quiet at home shed cooked him a good spaghetti with meat sauce and had not burdened him with talk he needed that evening to think through the implications of the instructions hed given to the cousins both of them they both come first getting stuff into the gaols and into the city two priorities to run together maybe benji should run the gaols and maybe charlie should aim himself at the city and the tossers there maybe he should bring in enver rahman and get his people to handle the distribution to a prison employee whoever benji could bend to carry the stuff inside and maybe his people could sit in a sandwich bar in the city and trade stuff there all to be worked out all to be turned over in his mind not the loss of a necklace ill find it she turned to him didnt often see it but there was a stubbornness in her eye you should whats a better time to start than now im thinking thinking about where you lost it changed the sheets this morning its not there did you take it off and pocket it no youd remember what about the car daveys car ring him tell him to look in the car for it no his mind raced why not its too late he tried to recall when he had last noticed the necklace too late its not ten oclock what else has that idle ape got to do hes my cousin and im not ringing him he thought he knew ill ring him you bloody wont it had bounced on his chest as he heaved himself up into her on the big bed in the chelsea harbour apartment and her nipples had snagged the chain i care about that present even if you dont watch me joanne was up going for the hall and the telephone he surged after her ricky caught her in the doorway for a fraction of time he felt himself threatened she had the steel nail file still in her fist with a shortarm punched blow he hit the side of her face had never done it before he saw the shock in her eyes arid mouth then the flush colouring her cheek he could not speak if she had cried out if she had fought him and tried to slash his own face with the pointed file he would have taken her in his arms and kissed her told her he loved her made excuses pressure problems things he was sweating on she did not he saw contempt quietly as if it mattered to her that she did not wake wayne she went up the stairs the marriage had been thought by their families to forge an alliance she lay on her back dressed in the spare room and stared up at the ceiling her cheek tingling from the blow she had known him from school she was taller than him then and taller than him now they were thrown together at school because the smyth and the capel breadwinners were away seemed natural for them to be close because their fathers were in brixton the fathers shared a cell in wandsworth the fathers were on the same landing in pentonville the fathers had been in adjacent cells her father was a snatch man his a driver while the fathers tramped the exercise yard together the children were in a school playground lying in the darkness joanne felt her cheek and her teeth nothing broken but there would be a bruise big and rich in the morning the first boy she had kissed had been ricky capel tongues in mouths and him with smoother face skin than hers the first boy she had had sex with had been ricky capel her showing him what to do in her bed when their mothers were gone visiting they had left school together not a qualification between them the only ones in their year who were not encouraged by the teachers to make something of themselves she hadnt gone out with him when hed been on the streets for thieving but hed talked about it with her and shed told him where he was wrong and where he was right and hed listened natural that theyd be married they were inseparable soulmates his mother and her mother would have liked a church and a white dress theyd done a register office and then a reception down at the british legion i dont want nothing flash ricky had said i dont want nothing that draws attention just the smyths and the capels and the cousins the alliance her father had hankered after had not happened ricky had said her family were crap couldnt keep their mouths shut were losers she had moved into bevin close next door to his mum and dad and his grandfather she was distanced now from her own clan did not confide in them would not tell them that he had hit her face no tears only the anger she heard him pace below she would not go down the stairs and tell him that the loss of a bloody necklace mattered not a damn to her and she knew he would not come after her she had been told by sharon about the cat had been told by mikey about the arrest and the kicking of the detectives nothing surprised her now she was a woman of intuition and intelligence might spend her days under the eye of her motherinlaw keeping a house clean cooking meals and not complaining if they were wasted because ricky was not back when hed said he would be looking after her child but she knew the weakness of her husband her own father had explained it years back hell go away hazard of the job hell be put inside nobody stays out not for ever you got to put up with it girl like your mum did like his actually itll be the making of him a man whos not done bird isnt rounded off terrible pressure there is on any man the longer he stays out once youve done it realized you can handle it well then its a cake walk she had watched the swell of his irritation like that pressure built because he had not been inside they didnt talk about life any more he didnt bounce ideas at her tell her what he was thinking planning they had nothing his grandfather liked to come next door old percy did old percy was the only one in the capel family that joanne now had time for made her laugh used to tell his stories and shed end up fit to bust with her sides in pain from the laughter how hed screwed up how hed cocked up but two years back old percy had told a different story no weeping no sentiment but told with a cold rancour that didnt sit easily on a grandfathers shoulders winnie had died in and shed gone to the funeral not married yet to ricky but regarded as family a bloody awful day cold and wet and a hell of a turnout for her two years back on the anniversary old percy had called by hed have been driven that morning by mikey to the cemetery and would have laid some flowers and had a quiet moment mikey had brought him back and old percy must have made some excuse and come to see her first he had talked about the girls who had fled abroad perhaps shed encouraged him to talk reckoned it was a therapy for him no smiles that day no laughter only the story that had chilled her he had done big bird had done a war and could tell a story she had not known that a story could be so heavy with bitterness brought from a grave youre the best thing that ever happened to him love not that he has the brain to know it dont know how you live with him my winnie couldnt stand the sight of him reckoned the girls were right to get out but she missed them you heard about the cat yes we were all frightened of him what he might do my winnie was in hospital and sinking ricky and i went to see her ricky was all smarms all comforting you could see it in her face she loathed him he went out to the car park for a fag or maybe to do a deal on his mobile she hadnt much strength left she said to me we should have drowned him at birth thats what we should have done percy drowned the little bugger drowned last thing she ever said she turned away she coughed she was gone all that hate in her when she moved on not right is it to hate when youre dying you watch him love told the story once and shed shut it away had tried to obliterate i t but ricky had hit her he could yell he could scream but it wouldnt be her hand that reached out to save him lying alone in the darkness in the quiet of bevin close she wondered what who could drown him you all right polly fine im ok just fine she did not look up she was bent over her desk and light cascaded down in a cone from the lamp and fell on the cheap little notepad with the wire coil binding it the photographs have gone and your prelim report well received so it bloody well ought to have been cant the rest wait till the morning if not can i get you a sandwich some coffee the girls in the office long gone home had told her often enough that she allowed justin braithwaite station chief prague to load work on her as if she were a packmule because she did not confide entertain them with the soapopera of her life they knew so little after being dumped by email from buenos aires work kept polly wilkins sane she realized her rudeness sorry im grateful you called by nothing thanks i want to go on hitting it just checking freddies at the other end of the line sleeping in you can handle it i can handle it a yawn creased her face and she giggled ill pack in when its done goodnight polly he was gone closing her door softly behind him she glanced at her watch and grimaced hadnt realized it was deep in the small hours that the embassy had emptied and the city slept she heard him move away through the outer office and there was the bang of the grille gate closing on the rooms used by what consular trade and political called the dirty raincoat crowd at first responding to the email she had joined everything within a week she had signed up to artappreciation courses walking weekends and claycourt tennis lessons within two weeks nursing a bruised brain blisters and elbow ache she had gone into justin braithwaites office spilled out the story of her broken relationship had brushed away his offered sympathy and pleaded for work work was salvation what she respected most about her station chief he had not offered a homily on the effect of tiredness on the quality of performance nor would he take personal credit for what she had achieved inside the smashed ineptly searched cafe how many in london among those who had savaged the desk would not have claimed a medal and citation for what she had found precious bloody few it was an old work technique after dumping the passports with the blownup photographs on justin braithwaites desk and after writing up her report for encoding and dispatch and leaving it with him she had gone on a search of every cupboard drawer and storage box in their offices and in the secure section of the basement they used she had been among old cobwebs spiders territory and had finally retrieved the graphite powder the notebook of course should have gone in a pouch to london a courier should have been sent pellmell from heathrow to collect it bag it chain it to his wrist and fly it back for the boffins to handle not polly wilkinss way freddie gaunt would back her and justin braithwaite had not overruled her if she had not been hurt the way she had belted bounced off the walls like she was a rag doll she would not have had that streak bloodyminded awkwardness her signature she yawned again and felt the ache in her shoulders a maxim of the service was find fix strike exploit she thought if she could stay awake she would have the means to exploit the technique using graphite powder fine and black was what they taught at the fort down on the south coast recruits on the induction course computer literate grinned and patronized the instructor when he lectured on the use of graphite powder and told stories of how it had been used by old men long retired from the service or the soviet enemy or the east germans she had a double page of the prague post spread across her desk on it was the first blank page of the notebook where top sheets had been torn out difficult for her in exhaustion to keep her hands steady but she lifted the sachet of powder and tilted its neck then let the grains cascade down god what a bloody mess she lifted the open notebook hands shaking shook it and let the powder run on the page up down and across then she spilled the mess on to the newspaper she saw the writing could make out the faint outline of the digits she copied what she read in a wavering hand a man had died that another might be given time to flee a man was tortured and stayed silent that anothers flight might be hidden she saw them both charred skull bruised and bloodied features she had respect for them she would undo them make the death and pain wasted that was her work done better because of respect polly studied the numbers then her mind glazed and the sheet of newspaper careered up at her and the powder was in her nose eyes and mouth she slept at the desk and the graphite a weapon of the longpast war smeared her cheeks a hand shook his shoulder gaunt woke startled his arm was thrown out from the blanket and scalding tea slopped on to his chest his eyes opened over him trying to steady the mug was gloria apologies if i frightened you mr gaunt god what time is it two minutes after six oclock mr gaunt she was always so precise what made her so valued he reached up took the tea from her and gulped now that he was awake she switched on the light its brightness bathed him he had slept only in his singlet and pants she gazed at him with rather frank interest he couldnt see why he was skeletally thin his facial features were drawn tight over his bones and his legs and arms were like fencing posts but his shoulders were strong perhaps her interest in his white body on which the sun was never permitted to shine came from the absence of a man in her life he would not have cared to list in priority the three features of her existence gloria as he knew it had her job her selfappointed role of caring for frederick gaunt and a spaniel with the name c hung on a disc from its collar gaunt might come first or last and did not ask the tea cleansed his mind he shivered new regulations demanded money be saved of course it should be without money saved there would not be the resources to pay for bloody pamphlets on glossy paper the goddam secret intelligence service in the central heating came on at seven no longer at five he held his spindly arms across his chest not for modesty but for warmth whats in wilcos signal and her passports nothing after that then the stern schoolmaam reminder everybody has to sleep mr gaunt not just you he drank the last of the tea then waved the mug towards his desk i think id like those pictures up so as we get under the blighters skin off the bed he padded to the door retrieved his suit trousers from the hanger and slipped into them from his desk cupboard he took clean socks an ironed and folded shirt a towel and his washbag gloria the blessed woman always made sure he had a change of clothes he collapsed the bed the blanket inside it and took it to the little annexe off the office then he was off his waistcoat jacket and tie on his arm shoes in his hand to wash shave and ready himself for the day with a cooked breakfast in the canteen far below he saw the river traffic from the window and behind the capital citys waterway were the great buildings of prestige and government any of them could be a target if the coordinator came this way from the door gaunt glanced back she had already sellotaped the blownup picture a size from the argentina passport to the wall and was tearing off strips to fasten up the photograph lifted from the canada passport strictly forbidden to cover office walls with posters and images interfered with the master plan of the contract interior designer the faces one bearded and one cleanshaven with heavyframed spectacles stared back at him seeming to threaten him again gaunt shivered but not with cold he traipsed off down the corridor to the solace of the shower and war drums sounded in his ears the light came slowly under heavy cloud and he waited the man did not go to the florenc coach station for longdistance travel or the principal rail terminus the mazarykovo nadrazi where the international trains left from he was at a stop for a local bus that would take him only as far as the edge of prague his intention was to move away from the city in short stuttered steps not to use the coach station or any of the rail termini that he assumed would be watched he had slept rough in the mala strana parkland had not dared since his flight to find a bed in a hostel most of each day he had sat in the shadowed pews of st thomas church or st nicholas church or the church of our lady below the chain but for part of each of those days he had tramped the streets to learn the flight had taken him up through the hatch above the apartments kitchen and for a moment there he had reached down and grasped the hand of iyad their fists locking together he had seen into the eyes of the bodyguard and had known that time would be bought for him an hour half a day a day and a night he would not waste the time he had crawled slowly over the common wall between the buildings scraping himself into the small space between masonry and roof tiles and gone at snails pace over the rafters and had heard tvs radios and voices below him and over another buildings wall and across more rafters the last had been the hardest there he had had to scratch out the mortar centuries old that held the walls stones remove them silently pray to his god that he did not make a disturbance he had lifted a hatch had found himself above a staircase had dropped down replaced the hatch gone down the steps and out into the night air a policeman had shouted at him language not understood gestures clear the alley was evacuated residents should be gone why was he so late his god had walked with him a woman came behind him and held a pet a lapdog in her arms and the policeman was distracted the man thought she had slipped back in to retrieve her dog he had drifted into the darkness an artisan with his work bag on his shoulder and his head protected against the rain by a cap broke open a chocolate bar ate two squares and gave one to the man they smiled at each other they were the only two persons waiting for the first suburban bus he had gone to the cafe near the coach station he had seen the vans parked had stood among the watching crowd and heard the smashing destruction of the search he had seen the cafe owner led away cowed and handcuffed the crowds stayed to witness the show but the man had sidled away he had been alone in a strange city with only a tourist street map a passport and the name of the contact he must reach he had thought the vigilance once the apartment had been stormed and once iyads defence was ended would be greatest in the first hours he did not know if they had his face or the identity of the passport against his chest the chocolate made his stomach growl with hunger but the bus came in the early thin light and the man travelled on through empty streets past concrete tower blocks and by old factories resumed his journey to the north and the coast when the torments came worst when he could not sleep oskar netzer would give up the fight he sat on the sandbank the first beat of the low sun on his back and watched the strand across the channel between baltrum and the greater island of norderney for the dawning of those days when he was persecuted by memories he dressed in the gloom of his house kicked his feet into his boots and searched for salvation the torments that afflicted him had killed her his gertrud as surely as if he had bent over her while she slept and smothered her with a pillow she was dead buried in the cemetery at ostdorf because of him as if by his hand the water in the channel rippled and dazzled and sunbeams danced on the waves on the strand beyond uncovered and wide because the tide was out lay an old wreck whose hull was rusty dark and had sunk into the windblown sand near it were the seals bulls and cows who had not yet produced pups after his love of the eider ducks oskar revered most the seals phoca vitulina great gentle creatures the island still slept and the visitors had not yet come and watching the seals at dawn gave him slight respite from the agonies of the past the words written on the sheet of paper by his uncle rolf stayed with him as clear as they had been on the day he had heard them read in the lawyers office and the pain he had run from had not escaped the deposition of rolf hegner the story of my guilt for which i expect to burn in hell those who have given me undeserved love should know the truth of me in joined the schutzstaffel because of the problem of fallen arches in my feet i was not sent to a combat unit but was posted to the concentration camp at neuengamme i worked there as a driver i took prisoners many of them foreign resistance fighters from france holland and scandinavia to work on building projects outside the camp and to dig from the clay pits for the lining of canals after the firestorm raids of the british and americans on hamburg i drove prisoners to the city for clearance and for the excavation of the mass graves for citizens at ohlsdorf cemetery at neuengamme medical experiments were carried out on russian prisoners and on jewish children who were inoculated with live tubercle bacilli on april when the british military forces were near to neuengamme i received orders to prepare two lorries to drive to hamburg that day was the fuhrers birthday late at night the twenty children with two dutch persons who cared for them and two french doctors who knew of the experiments and twentyfour russians were brought out of their quarters and loaded on the lorries pedersen drove the lorry with the children dreimann brought the ropes speck guarded the children i drove the lorry that transported the russians we went in convoy with high camp officials in cars to the school at bullenhuser damm in the rothenburgsort district the jewish children were taken inside then down into the cellars where there was a hook embedded in the ceiling while the russians the dutch and the french doctors were kept in the yard the children were hanged one at a time in the cellar after being given injections of morphine while they waited their turn in an outer corridor trzebinski the camp medical chief supervised the executions the noose was put round the childrens necks by frahm who then pulled on their legs after all the children were dead their bodies were brought back to the lorries but the russians dutch and french were taken inside and hanged or shot before morning all the bodies had been cremated at neuengamme we were the only witnesses who lived after they had made investigations the british authorities tried trzebinski and thurman who had commanded the prisoner compound and pauly who had been commandant at neuengamme they were executed by hanging at hameln many others myself among them were not prosecuted but were left free to follow our lives in the aftermath of war i see the children today as i write i see them every day i see them every night we did not stay to clear up the schools cellar where the children had been until they were called forward we left behind clothes shoes toys a little carved wood car was on the floor i acknowledge that i have shamed my family by my actions on the night of april and have contaminated the blood strain of my relatives rolf hegner he watched the seals roll on the sandspit and heave their bulk towards the water they basked they dived and had innocence he had sat beside the bed in the clinic had held his uncles hand and comforted him he had believed him to be a good man his own innocence had gone inside the lawyers office a week afterwards he and gertrud had fled the city where the school was and he had set up home on the island hoping to distance himself from the torments his family his blood his guilt which lit a fierce fury in him how long have you been here a harsh voice rang in alicias ear it was her aunt her housekeeper and minder the refuge for timo rahmans wife was the summerhouse among the tall oaks at the back of the house when selfesteem fled her when she lay on her back and he slept beside her snoring through his open mouth when the isolation of her life seemed to crush her she came to the summerhouse he never did everything inside the main house had been changed after he had purchased it new kitchen new decoration new carpets and curtains new furniture all in the style that he believed was suitable outside the flowerbeds had been uprooted then turfed over an ornamental garden would require continuous attention would need maintenance from strangers or would become a wilderness only the summerhouse was hers built of old untreated timbers and planking nearly waterproof it was set against the fence and the hedge and the security wire on stanchions the alarm sensors and was masked by trees from the rear windows of the house it was hers because he had no interest in it he never sat relaxed he never idled and the clock was an enemy to him the dawn light was behind her aunt silhouetting her stout peasant hips and shoulders i could not sleep alicia said feebly all areas of her life had been arranged the marriage in the mountains of albania had been arranged by her father and his father the timing of her two daughters conception had been arranged by timo and a gynaecologist in the city the fitting out of her home in blankenese had been arranged by timo and her aunt the schools for the girls had been arranged by timo and a lawyer who lived four streets away her clothes were chosen by her aunt and the food for the family meals everything arranged everything chosen she was decorative expected to stay attractive and keep her waist narrow but she was not required to make any contribution to her husbands life beyond the hedge the fence and the wire were the gardens of german women smart chic professionals whose names she barely knew whose lives she could hardly imagine whose language she did not speak only in the summerhouse could she find peace the aunt had travelled with her from albania but the womans loyalty was first to timo rahman you could catch a chill out here i needed the air alicia said limply you want for nothing there is nothing i want the aunt bored on you have the love of your husband and your children i do you have a home to be in and a bed yes and a husband you should please the aunt leered what she knew of sex how to please and where her hands should go had been taught her by the aunt a demonstration with the womans coarse hands guiding her fingers over the body flab but what she had learned had been used to conceive the daughters then to try for a son when the boychild had not come as if it were understood between them timo no longer pulled her over and hoisted up her nightdress he had no other woman she knew that she thought he had no more interest in fucking her doing what dogs did in the village high up in the mountains or goats or sheep he had no need of her she had love of a sort and children and a home and emptiness she pushed herself up from the cushions on the bench and followed her aunt back to the house the cold fanned her skin and thin sunlight fell on her malachy stepped off the train he had walked through the night and believed he had defeated the cameras instead of taking a train from pluckley or ashford he had gone north to wye hammering out the miles on country lanes he had taken the first service of the morning wool hat still down and collar still up that meandered off towards canterbury he had walked out of the station there as if that was his destination had headed for a car park had pocketed his hat and folded his coat then kept it under his arm unrecognizable when he had gone back to the ticket office the london train staggered into the city all that told of his nights work was the faint smell of petrol on his sweater and the scorch in his trousers where the first flames had lashed back through the broken window of the living room he stepped out of the carriage and was carried on by the wave of the london workforce that hit the platform he felt no elation no excitement no pride but knew he climbed the ladder if the garage had not been empty if the house had not been silent and all windows closed if the stable with the restless pony had not been well distanced from the house would he still have broken the window and splashed the contents of the canister inside against curtains down on to carpets and lit the coil of paper i dont have to answer that malachy murmured to himself i take what i find chapter nine voices from the darkness of the parking bay his and the one from the masked mouth inside the car you did well you dont have to do more you dont know what i have to do youve been as far as you can go wrong you cannot understand i know about you read it in files i have the picture of it wrong paper doesnt tell it three strikes all well done its enough wrong doesnt purge it the next step is too far malachy its what im telling you too bloody far wrong nothings too far if youve been where i have walk away youve done all that was asked of you and some forget it the darkness of the parking bay swamped him and around him was the new quiet of the amersham in the afternoon he had heard the same voice now muffled by a face covering then by a thin adjoining wall he had unlocked his door closed it after him gone fast down the steps and waited at the bottom of the stairwell hed heard faint and far above him you look after yourself millie you take care ill see you he had waited the heavy shoes had clipped down the steps and when the detective had stepped off the last malachy had stood in front of him call me please call me malachy had said and the detective had walked by him no response on his face as if nothing had been said he had gone to his car and had not looked back and malachy had climbed the steps put the bolt back turned the key and waited three rings late in the night then silence then three more rings pealing in the room what is the next level the next level pal would put you way out of your depth for sure youd sink i sank once at the next level they kill last one was dumped over a cliff went down into the sea but he didnt drown was dead already tortured and then dead late on his payments only this isnt being late on a credit agreement for a livingroom suite and getting a rap from the finance company the repossession order is a sentence of death every bone in his body was broken and that was before he went over the cliff scrub it out of your head when i sank i hadnt the courage to end it they took everything from me any selfrespect and id have put myself away they didnt leave me anything i helped you malachy dont look for more a dealer feeds the pushers a supplier feeds a dealer whos next up the ladder we know who the corpse over the cliff defaulted on know who killed him having tortured him i know my inspector knows my superintendent knows who feeds

do with millie johnson its for myself please from deep in the car there was a long hissed sigh a ballpoint clicked he heard the scribbled writing a sheet was torn off a pad through the open top of the window a gloved hand passed the scrap of paper he took it a thin torchbeam shone on the scrap he read a name and an address then the gloved hand snatched back the paper and the torchbeam was cut replaced by the flash of a cigarette lighter and a little guttering flame its big boys league the importer sells to the supplier malachy you watch yourself dont do anything if you havent looked it over good and proper take time thank you was it that bad what was done to you it was bad january when the sun was up past eight dogsy limped to the lorry fran his friend who was going to ride shotgun reached down from the back to give him a hand up dogsy milked the moment all his weight on his right boot and none on his bandaged left foot and let out a little groan not stifled as he came on board he settled at the tail end of the bench opposite fran inside the lorry under the canvas it would get to be rotten hot on the journey but by the tailgate there would be air he stretched out his left foot fran made a play of kicking it and dogsy gave him a finger the dust swirled and the convoy moved off from bravo it was because of personal hygiene that dogsy had a seat on the lorry and a bandaged left foot the previous night the stink of his boots had caused enough aggravation for them to be chucked out of the room where section of salamanca platoon slept in the morning when theyd dressed for the lift operation hed gone in his socks cursing to retrieve them and had stepped on a feckin scorpion little bugger had a bloody great sting in its tail dogsy had missed the lift the corporal medic had bandaged him and he had the ride back to battalion and a lookover from the medical officer they had armour warriors in front and behind for fire power no chopper available the lorry whined for power and the personnel carrier behind them gave a sort of comfort it was a feckin awful road back to battalion a sniper alley and rpgmissile alley a buriedbombattheendofacontrolwire alley but the heat feckin awful calmed him it was the smell worse than his feckin boots would have been he looked inside the lorry you know what fran one of thems shat himself which one he looked up the line of men five of them on the bench opposite beyond fran each had his ankles roped to the bench stanchions wrists manacled behind them and each was blindfolded with sticking tape how would dogsy decide which of them had fouled himself he leaned forward so that he could check the men on his bench four more men with ropes manacles and tape blindfolds and another at the lorrys bulkhead up against the drivers cab without restraints was an officer hey fran is that him he whispered what you say dogsy you got to shout what he did is that the rupert he yelled thats him the rupert that baz said was feckinyellow bottled out thats him dogsy how could a guy do that fran an officer couldnt hack it the section had a good fight used up juice like no tomorrow did slots but the rupert didnt stay around to see it whatll they do to him god knows who cares i dont you shouldnt he stared up the swaying length of the lorry they had been shouting questions yelling answers the officers head shook against the bulkhead and he did not seem to feel pain as if he was in deep sleep and his body moved with the lorrys lurch when the wheels hit potholes poor bastard not that to fran dogsy would have uttered sympathy for the man called a coward he looked away back at the nose of the following warrior k polly did lunch with ludvik she had booked the table at the restaurant over the vltava from the embassy it would not come cheap but would be on expenses authorized by justin braithwaite i want to take you out and show you my thanks up close and personal for the cooperation and professionalism at kostecna shed said when shed rung him and like an afterthought oh by the by something thats been hanging around on my desk for weeks im sure its not important but ive a phone number i need to know whose it is what they do got a pencil shed let him order grilled carp and salad after local soup and fine beer shed waited made smalltalk rolled her eyes at him and played at being fascinated by what he said during the salad hed let his knee nudge her thigh when shed struggled to fillet the carp he had leaned across the table head close hands near hers to work the flesh expertly off the bone too much looking earnestly into the eyes around which shed smeared the makeup thought he was in with a chance didnt he thought the afternoon might end up at his apartment or hers hadnt he then coffee strong it was what she had done with dominic end up at his flat when shed had a day off and the foreign and commonwealth wouldnt miss him and theyd taken a bottle with them to bed but that was all long gone she left it late then slid in the question that number any luck first she was told what she knew wasnt bloody stupid the number was at ostrava near the polish border oh did you find whose it was the office dumped me with it last month she was given a name she had her pencil out of her bag and scribbled what she was told on the back of a tornopen envelope which she thought was an indication of the matters minimal importance gaunts favourite mantra was about trust dont his second favourite was about sharing intelligence with an ally never if it can be avoided if it could not be avoided it should be economical in the extreme he reached across the table almost shyly but far enough for his fingertips to brush against her hand holding the envelope she smiled in what she thought was a warm caring way then shrugged dont know why the office wanted i t god some of the work i get loaded with is dross anyway what does he do in ostrava the man with that telephone number ran a factory producing furniture for export to germany and was a subsidiary of a larger conglomerate riveting stuff youd have thought in this day and age that my people had better things to do with their time whose conglomerate the furniture factory was a small part of the empire owned by timo rahman never heard of him a multimillionaire from hamburg an albanian ok ok we dont have to overwhelm my people thatll do for them ill get a commendation for it tell me is carp better grilled like ours or fried or just put in the oven what would your mother do she paid insisted the bill would just about wipe away justin braithwaites entertainment allowance for the week short rations thered be in the services annexe on the pavement his hand touched hers then slipped into the crook of her arm that was really nice and well do it again polly said id have loved to spend the afternoon in a couple of churches with you to guide me but thats for another day must get back see you soon i hope gloria have you ever been to hamburg he shouted twice mr gaunt just the twice i liked it rather a civilized city he had his hands together as if in prayer fingers under his nostrils and thumbs against his mouth gloria would have come to the door behind him would be leaning against the jamb she would allow his thought processes without interruption to stutter out as if that were part of her duties perhaps civilized yes quality prostitutes quality bankers quality scenic views bravo hamburg but its where it all started isnt it while we were faffing over baghdad pushed by those bloody politicians the eye was off the ball our eye the german eye and the american eye saddams legacy dont you know gloria was to be the fox that led the trail away from the den where the vixen was and the bloody cubs quite apposite mr gaunt she said drily but she would never be impertinent you should use that allusion in a report eye off the ball and not seeing the supreme target in hamburg it wasnt just you mr gaunt there was an aq desk everybodys eye off the ball while we were wetting ourselves waiting for the next download of satellite imagery from some godforsaken heap of sand in iraq the threat was incubated in hamburg what was the name of that wretched place harburg across the elbe river and the name of that wretched street marienstrasse mr gaunt and the spores are still in the bloody pavements of your civilized city its where they were where that horrendous plot was hatched nineeleven where war was declared the ultimate attack and we knew nothing now little wilco sends her signal a man resists torture and his interrogators were well trained to protect a notepad on which a telephone number was written im getting there gloria the telephone number is that of a factory that exports furniture to where to bloody civilized hamburg hamburg again do you not think mr gaunt that you should rest for an hour or two god and wouldnt it be easy if we had some proper equipment to turn on them a squadron of tanks a battery of artillery a brigade of paratroops i can deploy against them then im laughing but this is a city that is civilized hamburg is where they plot plan then launch from once a month i go to a lecture where an academic tells me i have to get into the mind of an enemy how i am whiteskinned middleaged middleclass a little englander i have no chance should i make more coffee no bloody chance he waved at the pictures she had sellotaped to the wall half my age without possessions with faith without conscience with the ability to justify strapping bloody martyrs belts round footsoldiers stomachs only a fool suggests i can understand him youre digging this weekend that will be good for you so wise gloria always so wise you filed it remember the commentary from moskovskly komsomolets at the time of that obscenity of the school siege why are they always ahead of us why are they winning because they are at war and we are just at work it is time to realize that we too are at war i believe i quote correctly dont you think mr gaunt you ought to have another coffee id like thank you a gallon of coffee he intoned they are at war and we are just at work and id like some tanks on hamburgs streets at a minor customs post north of the czech town of liberec and south of the polish town of zgorzelec two officials slept and one staggered sleepily from the hut as the old saloon car headlights bright approached because of the telex from prague received at the hut two days before the solitary customs man gestured with his hand for the car to slow it stopped under a high light he motioned to the driver to wind down his window and the rock music blasted out what his own kids played there were five inside two girls and three youths the telex had said that arabs should be checked but had listed no name nor had a photograph been faxed to the post he asked for the passports two of the boys flaxenhaired languidly offered him their papers polish the girls one redhead and the other with a mauve streak had czech documentation the fifth passport was from the back of the car a man early thirties maybe older and maybe younger was sandwiched between the girls and gave him the german passport he shone his torch into the interior let the beam light on darker skin he held the opened pages under the high light german citizenship date of birth place of birth listed as colombo in sri lanka not an arab sourly he gave the passport back through the window somebodys daughters from liberec jablonec or ceska lipa out for the night without modesty but no doubt with condoms with polish boys and an asian could have been his girls these were new freedoms he stamped back to the hut it had not said on the telex that an arab might have hitched a lift joined a car filled with youngsters to cross the frontier the customs official had no reason to be suspicious of the german passportholder crushed between the girls in the back of the car nor did he have reason to suspect that when the car reached zgorzelec and parked at the back of the discotheque hall the man would sidle into the night away from the booming noise and head for the railway station he poured himself some soup from his flask and returned to his magazine you have to believe it father he will come the bear had said it to him what did the television say timo asked him tell me again a siege in the old quarter of prague a man of the russian mafiya finally killed by the police lies of course but not a lie that one was killed one only the television said the lies were that he was russian a member of the mafiya father they would lie on that if one was dead which of them would it be not the principal father he will come the great paw of the bear had settled on timos shoulder and had squeezed reassurance call enver he should send the mouseboy here he sat now with alicia in the gymnasium of the school in blankenese sensing her nervousness he could acknowledge that through all the hours since he had met the young man from the warehouse in the hammerbrook district regret cargo load has not been forwarded he had given her little attention his mind clouded by the import of what he had been told if he had not had the confidence of the bear to stiffen him timo would not have been at the school that evening for good work in year nine and year seven imitation parchment scrolls were to be presented to the best students his girls were among them they with the rest of the favoured students of their classes were at the front he and alicia sat with the comfort and wealth of the elite of blankeneses community she had worried about what she should wear what jewellery she should display what cosmetics what shoes were suitable before the bear had spoken to him he had ignored her concerns afterwards he had gone through the wardrobes of dresses with her had unlocked the safe with her jewellery and chosen for her and the shoes and he had pointed to the lipstick she should use timo rahman was the pate of hamburg but he needed a man of brutish strength and limited intellect to soften nagging anxiety their younger girl stepped forward climbed the steps to the stage had her hand shaken was given the scroll and timo jagged a glance sideways and saw love for her daughter light alicias eyes but the woman the wife of the pate of the city did not know whether she should clap whether she should cheer they were peasants of the mountains he did what no other father whose son or daughter had gone forward had done timo stood his arms were above his head and his hands thundered together in applause he pulled alicia to her feet at that moment he cared not a fuck what other parents the best of blankenese thought of them last summer with alicia the girls the bear and alicias aunt he had flown to tirana and then they had travelled in a fleet of mercedes limousines along the rutted broken roads to the north guarded by the guns of his clan on the fourth day of the vacation at the villa he had built above shkodra he had sent the women and girls to visit alicias family in their village watched only by the bear he had negotiated with those men who had travelled to meet him matters of mutual cooperation intense men they had stared around them with naked disapproval at the lavish trappings of the villa had demanded prayer breaks but had come with proposals they had talked of transportation and safe addresses the movement of weapons and the production of international travel documents areas where he was strong and they were weak or where he was weak and they were stronger they had left driven away by his people before the return of the women and girls four days later when his wife her aunt and his daughters had travelled to see the site of his newest villa where the foundations were already dug the men had returned the talk had been of money what he would be paid and what would be demanded of him at the end of that second day timo rahman had shaken their hands and seen the fire in their eyes by the shaking of hands he had pledged his word with the strength of the canun written down centuries before by lek dukagjeni and their guarantee was on the word of their faith he had gone into a world that was a clouded sky to him right or wrong with sense or idiocy and he had made the deal now a man came the bear promised him his elder girl went up the steps he stood again pulled alicia up they were peasants from the mountains he had come to hamburg with holes in his shoes tears in the knees of his trousers and money to sustain him for a week alicia wriggled free of his grip and sat her face flushed red with embarrassment he saw the sneers the little titters of amusement his enthusiasm made and clapped harder a dosser stood under the streetlight at the junction of bevin close and the main road a woollen cap pulled down on his forehead and his coat collar up only a little of his face was visible to davey orangecoloured from the light but what he could see of it was unshaven the light caught his eyes flashed on them the dosser stared up the length of bevin close and his attention seemed to be far down it where the culdesac opened out and gave room for vehicles to turn to the semidetached houses where ricky lived davey was careful which was what ricky paid him to be he had been in the garage alongside his house to check the alarm on the car then to satisfy himself that the sensors covering the garage interior were blinking red and alive he was paid well to be careful of rickys security when davey turned from the garage the dosser still stood there then the man moved a little frown of surprise flicked at daveys forehead no longer at the junction of the main road and the culdesac the dosser now walked in a slow rolling stride down the pavement on the opposite side to his garage and came into bevin close didnt stop didnt look around him went on as if he knew where to go davey heard the shout from inside his meal was on the table he called back that he would be a moment not long he was now on the step and there was the scent of cooked food from the kitchen but he hesitated the voice bit behind him come on davey or itll be cold be a second just a second he saw the dosser stop in front of a door and peer past the gate and up the little pathway as if he looked for a number then briskly head on he was supposed to know of everything that moved on bevin close it was his work to maintain a constant watch for crime squad surveillance and the criminal intelligence services bugs he knew every delivery van that called regularly and the faces of relations who came often to visit there had never before been a dosser in the culdesac if it had not been for his blood link to ricky capel davey would have been smalltime perhaps a thief and dreaming of one big payout job perhaps a minicab driver doing eighty hours a week one day and he had no idea of how far away it was he would be able to buy an apartment or a little villa on the spanish coast with a patio and a pool or one day if he was not always careful he would be in the central criminal court hearing a judge slag him off and send him down the dosser had slowed was outside number eight rickys place and seemed to stare inside joanne god he didnt know why never pulled the curtains after dark you coming or not just a moment he went out through his own gate and started to stride to the corner junction he looked both ways raked over what was parked there and saw nothing that alarmed him then he swung back and headed down bevin close he recognized all the cars parked on the kerb either side of those numbers that did not have garages the figure of the dosser was lit by the brightness spilling out from the window he was confused could admit it benji and charlie had the brains did the thinking but they all depended on daveys nose for danger a dosser had no call to be in the culdesac if the dosser was some fancy caper from the crime squad or the criminal intelligence service he would have backup in a van or a car close by and there was no vehicle that fitted on the main road or in bevin close so what the hell was he doing there the shout carried in the evening to him you please yourself its in the oven im starting he yelled not over his shoulder but ahead hey you whats the game what do you want the dosser didnt turn if hed been crime squad or intelligence he would now challenged be lifting his arm or ducking his head sideways and speaking urgently into his wrist microphone or the one on his collar but the dosser just stared ahead at the window where the curtains werent drawn hey im talking to you what you doing no movement no motion davey started to run he could see the torn dank clothes of the dosser he was panting didnt do much running hed used to box in peckham super middleweight but that was way back no call for him to run once hed joined up with ricky capel he came up behind the dosser and the smells of the man were in his nose but he hadnt turned like it didnt matter that davey had come down fast the length of the close and had yelled at him that he was rickys man his enforcer was known through lewisham peckham camberwell and catford in a pub he was bought drinks in the betting shop he was allowed without fuss to the queues front in the street people moved out of his way davey was never ignored he had stature as ricky capels minder he came up behind the dosser dont you bloody listen i was speaking to you whats your business the shoulders sagging stayed in his face davey was a shortfuse man the nearest place where dossers hung out where they begged or slept or drank was the underpass at elephant and castle but that was up past rotherhithe and over the old kent road not here he grabbed the shoulder no resistance the stink seemed to billow over him davey boiled he had the mans coat in his fist and swung his body round to face him there was no fight in the man but no fear davey was used to fear inflicting it used to men cowering from him cringing away who are you what you doing not a quiver from the lips davey did not know whether it was dumb insolence or dumb stupidity if the dosser had shown the fear then he might have frogmarched him up the length of bevin close and kicked his arse back on to the main roads pavement and watched him go then gone inside to get the supper out of the oven the eyes stared back into his was the man mental one of those care in the community people didnt seem that way to davey no madness in the eyes he was not sure if the eyes laughed at him they were bright and big and close the dossers hand reached up not to strike but to release daveys grip on the shoulder like it shouldnt have been there the hand tried to prise the shoulder free and the weight of the dossers body was against him as if the man had done the business that had brought him to bevin close and was now ready to leave no bloody way there was another rattle of questions in his throat waste of time asking them he used a knee into the groin hard the dosser was going down and davey was shouting couldnt hear himself as he put in the southpaw short hook to the chin the dosser was down davey readied himself for the kick to the head what we got here davey boy his breath coming in spurts he looked up ricky leaned casually on the closed front gate had a good shirt on as if he was dressing to go out and had been interrupted the shape like a rag bundle and like the men under the cardboard at the underpass by elephant and castle lay in front of him some bloody vagrant scum ricky outside your house looking at it ive asked him what he was doing who he was why didnt get an answer didnt get nothing i belted him ricky did you i dont reckon hes crime squad just some loony that needed teaching you reckon teaching respect maybe you havent taught him well enough there was that quietness in rickys voice it marked times when davey knew better than to speak further he came through the gate and looked down at the dosser the eyes in the head on the pavement were unwavering and steady if he had been on the ground and rickys shoes had come close davey would have wrapped his arms round his head and curled up the better to protect himself it was what men did when they were to be kicked hed seen it too many times to remember the head jerked back from the impact of rickys shoe the cry was urgent dont be a bloody fool ricky mikey was out of his house stumbling like he was halfcut towards them and put himself between ricky and the man on the ground then turned on his son and pushed him away what do you want the bloody police down here ricky said theres no call for the police dad didnt you see he fell over probably pissed up he fell over and hit his head you werent looking dad you got to know what youre talking about when you call your son a bloody fool isnt that right dad if you say so ricky i say so dad get rid of him davey we dont want people like that in our close im surprised you let him get this far davey shivered always did when criticized by ricky capel it was big of mikey and not usual to stand against his son and call him a bloody fool davey wouldnt have done it wouldnt ever he pulled the dosser up by the shoulders of his overcoat then dragged and half carried him away up the length of bevin close it was only when he reached the junction with the main road stood the dosser up and pushed him towards the line of steelshuttered shopfronts that davey realized what the smells were above the stink of the clothes was the stench of petrol one more thing he didnt understand he saw the man shamble away lean on a lamp post and grip it for support then move on davey went to rescue his meal from the oven still damp from the shower he was as sleek as the ferrari spider towards which he walked as a regular visitor he received an obligatory ducked bow of respect from the doorman who watched over entry and exit at the block the mouseboy as his uncle called him might come once a week to chelsea harbour or once in two weeks but enver rahman came three times a week it was the great laugh between him and maria that the besotted mouseboy had no idea that she was serviced three times more often minimum by him there was a slight weight in his jacket pocket and he carried the videocassette in his hand she did not grunt did not fake it for enver there was always a tip peeled from his wallet of a twentypound note for the doorman gratefully received by now the note would have been slipped into an inner pocket enver was late for the meeting it did not concern him he strode into the evening air and saw people back away from the ferrari always it attracted attention which he liked of course as the nephew of timo rahman enver was expected to succeed he had he owned nine brothels spread through north haringey soho and the area behind kings cross railway station they were for the ordinary girls with flat chests gross hips or dirty complexions they were paid a hundred pounds an hour by clients and were given five for themselves special girls booked by telephone from hall porters desks were driven by envers people to the better hotels and they were paid two hundred pounds an hour nonnegotiable and were allowed five to slide into their purses his girls from bulgaria ukraine poland and lithuania worked seven days a week and the money cascaded into his lap if the girls broke the rules enver had men to beat them beat them so they were unable to work unpresentable for a week he drove across the city it was his habit never to exceed the speed limit never to crash a red light never to overtake across a double white line never to give a policeman racked with envy the chance to wave down the ferrari spider more for fun and less for cash enver oversaw and took the major cut from kidnapping most he liked what they called the bomb burst an albanian in brent colindale or green lanes would have opened up a small business a plumber a carpenter a bespoke shirtmaker taken into a car his mobile phone would be lifted from his pocket the bomb burst was to ring every stored number and demand a hundred pounds within an hour from each number and let them hear the screams of the man the bomb burst could make a thousand pounds in an hour it was fun entertainment for enver as was the second way snatch a man as he came home at the end of his days work back to brent colindale or green lanes drive him the rest of the way and keep him in the car as the door was banged at his home let his family see him in the car and his terror a thousand pounds to be collected in an hour or two thousand or the man would be taken to epping forest and killed they always paid it amused him to see the panic on the faces of others useful also the bomb bursts and the lifts were a way for him to evaluate the determination of potential recruits albanians and kosovar albanians without money picked out from the lines of immigrants at lunar house were desperate to prove themselves reliable from kidnaps he could choose them find the ones with skill more money spilled into his lap and victims like the girls in the brothels would never talk to the police he travelled along the embankment then took a bridge over the river the money from his lap went out of the country in suitcases and in vehicle hideaways to be driven home to albania where he already had a villa decently smaller near to the older one built by his uncle more money went to bureaudechange outlets for changing into highvalue euro notes more went into the casino in which he had an interest for laundering and into three albanian cafes of which he was partowner he paid tax from the casino and the cafes and made the money legitimate a little was paid to ricky capel at extortionate rates to reward him for brokering the transport that brought in new girls he thought the mouseboy rated him as a fool for paying too much and with the money as a bonus was the constant offer of muscle to enforce capels own dealings he allowed himself to be rated as a fool because that was what his uncle timo rahman had ordered he had rung that evening on his mobile from marias bed and asked for the meeting the videocassette was locked in the glove compartment he hooted long enough for a barman to come out of the pub he said his ferrari spider was to be watched enver walked into the pub and slipped the slight weight from his pocket into the palm of his hand the mouseboy and the mouseboys wife were sitting at a far table away from the drinkers it amused him to see her plump pasty if she had been his she would have worked in a brothel and not been one of the special girls for businessmen in hotels the mouseboy looked down at his watch and the frown slashed his forehead then noticed envers arrival he was an hour late the mouseboy half stood and the woman turned to face him enver saw the bruise on her cheek and the cake of cosmetics over it he apologized as if he were just a humble immigrant from albania in the presence of a man of stature i am grateful you could meet me ricky you were lucky i was free im not often free and again i regret my lateness unavoidable business he thought the bruise on her cheek had come from a hard blow so what is it that couldnt wait i mean im out with joanne i had a call from timo from my uncle so timo rahman requests your company in hamburg to discuss a matter of mutual interest when within two days or three that is what my uncle requests i dont think i can do that ive a heavy diary maybe in a week or two he leaned forward the wife watched him she would have known that enver rahman associate of her husband ran brothels in north haringey soho and behind kings cross she would have realized that he had noted the bruise on her face she watched him and he thought she loathed him enver took the mouseboys hand opened it laid it against his own palm the hand snapped shut on the gold chain it had been on the bed the clasp had broken open while the girl had grunted and faked maybe i can rework my diary ive never been to germany i will book the tickets and i will accompany you the day after tomorrow ricky capels fist was clenched tight yes i can do that it will be good to meet your uncle my uncle will hope that he has not inconvenienced your diary ricky he will be most grateful to you my apologies mrs capel for disturbing the enjoyment of your evening i will ring you ricky with the flight he gave a last subservient smile that of a lesser man and worked his way out through the tables and past the drinkers outside he tipped the barman another of his twentypound notes for watching the car and drove away late near to midnight the anneliese royal docked a poor catch hardly enough in the fish room boxed in ice to pay for the engines diesel and little enough for his son and for the boys wage for himself there would be no money skilfully harry nudged the beam trawler alongside the floodlit quay beyond the harbour the bars of the eastcoast port town were chucking out when his boat was unloaded and he walked towards the gate if he met other skippers he would be asked how his catch had gone for an answer he would shrug and shake his head if the anneliese royal had been bought with a bank loan or a mortgage had not been given to him he would have gone to the wall with what the catch paid him he would have been another swamped by the quotas the lack of fish the cost of diesel and the wages bill but ricky capel had given him the trawler and often enough there were packages to be hooked up from buoys off the german and dutch coasts and harry rogers survived as a fraud the ropes were made fast and the boy had started to put the few boxes on the conveyorbelt harry said to billy cant see any point hanging about this dump not with the weather turning no sense being here i fancy home going down west till the storms are blown out you been in a war chief im fine thank you i dont wish to interfere but you dont look all right chief very fine never been better have you been robbed there was and malachy recognized it genuine concern in her voice it was an effort for him but he turned to the woman driver took the change and the ticket that she dropped into the tray through the glass that protected her he saw the way she squinted at him he grimaced which hurt his chin i dont have anything to steal you should get them washed those cuts she engaged the gears right now get yourself a seat on the night bus we go like the wind he clung to the pole steadied himself as she pulled away from the stop then lurched for the nearest seat he heard her voice behind him him what done that to you did he get pain not yet she giggled raucously then accelerated and malachy slumped down the bus raced through empty streets took him home to the amersham bruised and bloodied he felt the first welling of respect for himself after so long like he had climbed a ladder or scaled the terraced wall of the pyramid he was too tired too battered to know how ricky capel would get pain but he promised it chapter ten he sat on the floor round him were the sheets of paper torn off his notepad and on the sheets were pencil lines and he did it as he had been taught the lines on the paper were maps as he remembered them of the main road and the junction the length of bevin close and the street behind it where the gardens shared the common fence with those of the culdesac and of the house number eight he searched deep in his memory for exact recall of everything he had seen under the streetlights he heard the tap on the wall the house had surprised him he had expected that lewishams roads would open without warning into a closed suburb of high walls high gates with mansions set behind them the equivalent of the suppliers place in the country what he had found its ordinariness had wrecked his concentration he had spent too long down the culdesac after going into its mouth it was clever having a place so unremarkable which could only be reached by going into the mouth and down the throat of bevin close the tap came louder on the wall behind him and its persistence grew that very ordinariness helped him over london over the country there were threebedroomed semidetached homes all built to a common design he knew it by heart as an officer he had had one his rank at chicksands was assigned homes of that status in alamein drive into a hall with a living room off it then another door opposite the staircase into a dining room a kitchen at the end of the hall up the stairs and four doors to two double bedrooms a single and a bathroom a garden at the back in alamein drive roz had kept the second double bedroom empty and ready for the onceayear visit of her parents and he had used the single bedroom as an office bolthole when he had been dragged along by the hair and the shoulder of his overcoat in bevin close he had seen a woman at the window of number eight she had hung on to a child as if to prevent him coming out and joining in the beating and kicking the tapping was firmer more demanding the man from next door had shouted dont be a bloody fool ricky he had been called dad at the cost of a cut lip welts on his face and a knee in the testicles malachy reckoned he had learned much fair exchange he knew the design of the house knew that family lived alongside it knew that the entrance to the close was watched he tidied the pages of his maps he locked the door behind him and stood for a moment on the walkway then heard the distorted sound of the tapping and rang the bell beside the grille gate malachy followed millie johnson into her flat she walked unsteadily ahead of him leaning hard on the medical stick but she waved him away when he went to take her arm she was smaller than when he had last seen her smaller than she had been in the hospital bed when shed had the fierce bruising and the tubes in her she sat in her chair and her small eyes pierced him she was pale frail and the arm in which the pin had been put was held in a sling would she like tea yes she would did she have biscuits she did dawn had shopped for her he went into the kitchen boiled the kettle made the tea and did a tray of cups and saucers milk sugar and a plate of digestives the woman had changed his life he paused in the kitchen with the tray the widow of the bus driver had changed his life utterly by going alone to an evening of bingo for pensioners without her hurry up i cant abide stewed tea it needs to be fresh out of the pot of course millie he carried the tray to her she watched hawkeyed as he dripped in the milk put a spoon and a half of sugar in her cup and poured the tea hed get no praise for his care he laid a biscuit on her saucer and waited she sipped the tea nibbled the biscuit and irritably brushed crumbs from her lap he broke the quiet youre looking well millie very good she challenged her gaze beading at him what have you been doing with yourself not much she mimicked him oh not much whats with your face walked into a lamp post try again must have been dreaming didnt see the door do better tripped on a pavingstone fell in the gutter is that the best you can do something like that you think dawn doesnt talk to me dawn talks who did it did what millie he saw the shrewdness of the old eyes if he shifted in the chair they followed him if he ducked his head they lifted if he threw it back they were with him they were aged but the eyes were keen bless you for what youve done millie ive done nothing still the eyes tracked him you lie there in the bed in the hospital people come you dont want them they fuss over you all you do is hope they will go and leave you when theyve left you then you can hate im not good with words malachy you hate because of what was done to you but you are helpless you see them they have contempt for you because you are old you cannot fight them you hold on to the bag all that is left for you you cannot stand you are down there is nothing in your purse but they have your bag you hate them and those who sent them a priest came to me a simpering fool what did i feel i told him i felt hate i had his lecture we are all gods children my dear hate belittles us we must learn to forgive couldnt wait to see the back of him i hated them what i wanted in that bed seeing their faces was that they be hurt you shouldnt talk because it will tire you rubbish dawn told me whats happened on the amersham it made me laugh i did not say it to dawn but i knew it after the laughter in the quiet i realized it i am attacked and then these things happen i had not given myself such importance thank you i dont think millie ill be here much longer malachy said and his voice was a whisper thank you for what you did the eyes misting struck at his please kiss me he came off his chair knelt by her and kissed millie johnsons forehead he owed her so much more than she could have known then he stood poured her a second cup of tea and left her tony got a moment tony johnson detective sergeant had a moment had an hour had all day yes guv how can i help his chief inspector was eleven years younger than tony was on a fasttrack career path and was part of the new world guv was old where tony came from he saw the man wince yes w e l l do you do enver rahman is he one of yours one of mine like having shit on your heel tell me hes twentyseven runs tarts has a fair part of vice in north london and the west end tied down hes scum but clever with it lives in the kings cross area nothing permanent pride and joy is a ferrari spider i suppose that would be worth dousing in paintstripper he saw the detective inspectors mouth pucker with annoyance no bloody sense of humour never was for any of them that had been on the command course he brings in girls from eastern europe and he gets muscle from lunar house his goons would hang about the queues at the immigration centre and look for the likely ones has he been arrested no and frankly weve never been close to it the girls are taught that were all corrupt that if they come to us the first thing well do is shop them to their pimps and to enver rahman theyre more frightened of us than of their own and lets say that one was prepared to shop him on a vice charge whats to happen to her are we coming up with a witnessprotection package for life because thats what shell need we are not if she goes home to ukraine shes vulnerable to a knife slash or worse and her father and mother if she stays here and were not doing twentyfourseven guard which we wont be she wouldnt know where to hide thats why were not close to locking him away and he has connections what weve heard his uncle is the godfather of hamburg a sparrow doesnt fart in hamburg without his uncles permission am i of help to you guv an airline ticket heathrowhamburg return but open dated was bought this morning for ricky capel choice lying was an art form for tony johnson dont think i know that name ricky capel no capels on the computer trigger stuff for organized crime his name came up from the airline booking runs drugs in southeast london interesting thing is that two tickets were bought same destination one for capel and the other in the name of enver rahman is capel lowlife guv would think himself bigger than he is vain little swine but its interesting that he should travel to the city where enver rahman has an uncle bigtime the uncle you say about as big as they get guv its what i heard are we going to send be wonderful wouldnt it with our resources the way they are no chance thanks for your time tony no problem guv he went on pushing paper moving pages on his screen it would be hours before he could slip away into the dusk and find a callbox i hear what you say mr kitchen and will do my best to oblige first things first youve given me no proof of identity i regret that a rent book from a london boroughs housing department is not sufficient not that im suggesting anything but i assume they can be bought for the price of a moderate lunch no mr kitchen im afraid ill require something more reliable as senior partner in the company as a solicitor of thirty years experience he took few shortcuts none on that morning the man had been on the doorstep of their offices when he had arrived eight thirty and the man had actually been sitting on the bottom step with his feet trailing on to the pavement everything about him except his shoes was shabby hed sensed trouble had decided to handle the mans business himself had also sensed a matter of intriguing interest which seldom came into his office in bedford my problem mr kitchen is that the solicitor who handled your affairs is now in south africa and his secretary who met you is now married and has moved away so please further proof of identity is needed on his screen were copies of terse communications he had telephoned down to the basement archive and there was indeed a box there in the name of captain malachy kitchen army intelligence corps of alamein drive at chicksands he had suggested a call be made to the base but there had been a violent shake of the head opposite him his firm did wills and conveyancing for many of the officers there this man hardly seemed one of them old clothes on his back new scars and bruises on his face only the shoes showed a military mans care when is it you were last a visitor here he was told a month more than two years back but not an exact date to match against the screens correspondence im sorry mr kitchen but that is too vague anything else the man sat straighter pulled down the zip of his anorak pushed away the neck of his pullover opened the upper buttons of his shirt and reached down the twin tags came out in his hand held by an aged leather bootlace they were held up for him to examine he craned forward read wrote down the religion blood group and number and when the tag with the number was turned he could see the name they were returned to their restingplace against the mans chest the smell was stifled once the anorak was zipped again thatll do nicely mr kitchen ill have the box sent up ten minutes later the senior partner escorted his client to the main door wished him well and watched him walk away for a man so obviously facing acute difficulties in his life there was a quite cheerful roll in his gait back at his desk he cast a quick glance at the box a will still there a buildingsociety savings book still there a marriage certificate still there only the passport had been taken he wondered what the client had run from and where he was going now with his passport he had not liked to ask but if he had he doubted that he would have been answered they turned into the drive past the broken gates and davey braked charlie thought that the gates electronically controlled would have been flattened by the first fire appliance to reach the house all of them in the car charlie realized and it was as true of himself as the others were strung up tight like a bow string pulled back davey had reckoned they shouldnt be there not so soon ricky had rubbished him in the car benji had tried to raise the journey to hamburg where it would lead and why he was called for ricky had shut him down himself charlie was concerned about the cashflow implications of the fire ricky had said he should wait and watch ricky wore the big gold chain at his throat that joanne had given him and charlie knew it had been lost and that joanne had been belted for asking about it ricky fingered it obsessively not a bundle of laughs between them as they had driven down from london and into the countryside not even enough laughs to wrap in a handkerchief they went past a fence and a horse that had been grazing saw the car and seemed to scream and run then they turned a corner in the drive and the house was in front of them bloody hell charlie murmured a little gasp ricky and davey lived in the semidetached houses of bevin close benji was in a brick terrace by loampit vale charlies place was detached joined to his neighbour by their garages nearer to ladywell road they had four houses that were typical of lewisham in southeast london this had been a big pile had been a wooden stable block but the wind must have been coming from behind it and it hadnt caught a double garage with the doors up was untouched in front of the building was a mountain of debris some of which charlie could make out as furniture some of which was too charred for recognition he could make out easy chairs where the material had burned off to leave the wood and springs a tabletop without legs wardrobe doors frames without pictures the shell of a tv and the front door but most of the heap had no shape and parked beside the burned mess like it was the only place to park was a scarlet vintage jaguar beside him in the back he heard ricky hiss through his teeth the roof in the central part of the house was off some of the beams were in place others had gone a few sagged all the windows were out like black tooth gaps in a mouth it was desolation and quiet all of them peered forward through the windscreen sort of made charlie shudder everything at bloody peace except for the wrecked house like it had been a target picked out and chosen his father had been a builder odd jobs a bit of roofing a bit of plumbing a bit of whatever when he wasnt doing scams with old folks benefit books and charlie had helped him out before hed joined up with ricky he didnt know much about building but he could see that this pile was beyond repair it would be a bulldozer job a site to be cleared not just scaffolding and work for a year george wright had been done over done proper he saw the other car by the side of what had been the house and there was a man in a suit and george he nudged ricky and pointed they stayed put sat in their car the man had a clipboard and a pencil at that distance the sound of the voices did not travel didnt need to the man from the insurance was with george and he had a dour look he finished scribbling on his clipboard and shrugged like he was only explaining the reality of the situation confronting him george was shaking and animated he gripped the mans sleeve dropped it and had his hands at his head like that was despair all bastards werent they insurance men then george had his head up gazed at the trees and the bloody crows black sods sat there and honked at the show and the man hadnt shaken georges hand or had anything good to say and was going for his car george was left in a pair of suit trousers and a shirt that had been white before it was stained by the fires smoke alone with the crows the car came towards them but davey didnt shift off the drive and it had to go on to the lawn where the first cut had just been done and the lines were good and straight and it left the tyre treads didnt matter bigger problems for george than his grass they went forward ricky said we sort this out and now then theres no misunderstandings he seemed not to see them as they came out of the car and not to hear them as they stamped on the tarmacadam past the mountain and the open doorway the kitchen windows that had been smashed and came to the corner of the house behind him were apple trees but the gale from the fire had singed the blossom off them ricky was ahead with davey trailing him by a couple of paces and benji and charlie hung back because this was not about to be their style of business sorry to see this george ricky said briskly whatd you do leave the chipper on christ charlie thought his man could play cold george wright had spun on his heel on his face end of tether edge of control what the fuck do you want thats not nice george i come down all polite like a friend all sympathy didnt come down for abuse came to find out what the situation was you got a difficulty with that the situation right the situation is that the insurance wasnt jacked up in the last five years and its way under got that my melanie shes gone to her mother shes broke down and hannahs with her and worse i had a load of stuff in the house and the safe went like an oven the stuffs cooked got that so thank you for your bloody consideration but i am fucked so please drive back where you came from have you got that that is not helpful george what is bloody helpful id like to hear it charlie could hear the softness of rickys voice and could hear the rising crescendo of george wrights anger davey behind ricky had his hands together behind his back where they always were when he minded ricky but his fists were whiteknuckled clenched i tell you whats helpful george you had from me stuff on trust i give to you and you supply and then you pay me now you tell me that the stuff is burned and i ask myself how is george going to pay me what he owes me about a hundred grand yes charlies the one with the head for figures maybe a bit over a hundred thousand thats owed me what would be helpful is knowing when youre going to pay me today tomorrow or by the end of the week whistle for it ricky not helpful i got nothing left whistle down your arse for it rickys voice was ever softer his chuckle ever more shrill youre a joker george you do a good turn george i got nothing left thats funny george no buildingsociety book no deposit account a little place down on the algarve that you can raise a mortgage on very funny george by the end of the week and thats really generous what you say george fuck offs what i say ricky moved sideways charlie recognized the manoeuvre davey now had a clear sight of george wright charlie knew what would happen had seen it before ricky said you know how it is george if im too generous then word of it gets round people who owe me money hear im a soft touch i get promises for payment next month or next year because its said that ricky capels easy to blow over cant pay this month because the missus has a headache might be cant pay next month because the familys going on holiday could be cant pay this year because the price on the streets down or if the word gets round cant pay ever because the chipper caught fire george i wont have that word get round but thats your problem what i said get lost get off my property i got nothing charlie knew where it was going and could not argue with the reason for it maybe there was a little gesture against his thigh from ricky or maybe davey just read him if ever the authority of ricky capel was challenged successfully then he was dead in the water and not only ricky all of them all gone if the word went out that ricky was the soft touch charlie didnt do violence or benji but davey did davey closed on george wright he lost sight of the fat little man with the bald head and the sweat on it lost the sight of him behind daveys shoulders george wright was felled davey stood over him and the heavy steeltoecapped shoe pressed down on a sprawledout shin ricky said problem with a place like this george the problem with all the muck around planks furniture beams everything is that you could fall over you could fall over and break your leg be easy of course if you said after youd broken your leg that you hadnt tripped up on the muck if you said different then youd have to wonder where youd hide and where your melanie and your hannah would hide come to think of i t im very generous by the end of the week fuck off a blur of movement almost too fast for charlie to follow the shoe went up he saw the flash of the steel on the toecap it stamped down on the suit trousers halfway up the shin the scream ripped at charlie but ricky didnt flinch the foot and ankle below the shin were bent at an idiot angle from the knee ricky was walking away and davey followed him it was two months since charlie had eaten a meal with george wright in a little bistro in blackheath and the guy had been good company it was a week since benji had done the last dropoff to george wright he hadnt spoken up for him and benji beside him had not not yet you will be bastard ricky capel you will be your turn see if it isnt coming you know fuck all of nothing but you will when its your turn what do you thinks happening you got any idea big man you know everything wait till its your turn and see what you know i want to be there watch it when its your turn come on guys ricky said he was walking past charlie standing and rooted charlie caught rickys arm held him george wright from the ground yelled want to hear it then want to bloody funny ricky capel about a chip fire i was a target it was petrol petrol through the window the target was me three kids on the amersham estate were found hung upside down off a roof did you hear that fucking didnt did you you know nothing they pushed next its the dealer the dealer sold to the kids on the amersham he was tied up to a lamp post and now hes gone you dont know where the amersham is too low for you ricky capel i sold to that dealer its a line me to the dealer the dealer to the pusher kids i had petrol chucked in my home does the line go the other way think about it ricky bloody capel look over your shoulder ricky pulled himself clear of charlie mad isnt he crazy man hell come up with it hell pay the big smile breezed on his face may have to go on sticks to the bank but hell pay it was a joke between charlie and benji that davey was plank thick he could always see when something major exercised daveys brain nothing of a flywheel like a slow set of cogs turning without oil to help always frowned always blinked always seemed to rub the side of his face hard before spewing it davey said couldnt think of it ricky what the stink was the dosser down the close outside your house the dosser that was there and his stink ricky was at the car what you trying to say davey blurted it the stink it was petrol on his coat he had the stink of petrol forget it ricky said and dropped into the car charlie didnt and he hardly listened as they drove through the kent countryside back towards lewisham and ricky retold stories of his grandfathers war fought alongside the father of timo rahman whom he was flying to meet the next day in hamburg i want to move her there i really urge you to sanction polly wilkins going to hamburg as a matter of urgency the assistant deputy director sat so gaunt paced if the add had stood gaunt would have taken a chair contrariness was a trusted weapon his stride across the carpeted office was fast intended to create an atmosphere of crisis to wrongfoot the man was his aim the supine beggar would buckle he knew it i cant say im happy its whats necessary and fenwick in berlin he wont be happy im up to speed and polly wilkins is its his territory thats what fenwick will say gaunt rapped his response rather than satisfying fenwicks turf aspirations it would be better to put in place under my control an officer who has the feel of him no name but two faces last thing before coming to the assistant deputy director on high he had sat in his desk chair and had tilted it back and made the request of gloria that she describe the faces she was expert at the task and he believed he saw better into a mans soul when his eyes were closed and he listened as she portrayed him the quarry so much better so much greater insight than when he stared at a twodimensional photograph she had said the hair is thick dark and worn long but it is not unkempt and is caredfor in the centre the hair curls back and i dont believe that is accidental more of a style there is a high forehead clean and without the skin cracks of anxiety that pushes up on either side where the hair recedes the forehead is that of an intelligent man not of a brute the eyes are big they are open they do not evade there are rings under them but that is from tiredness more than rings almost bags i like the eyes they persuade but do not threaten they have a confidence yes you would trust the eyes the nose is prominent straight and without blemishes it is not the nose of a fighting man has not been broken fractured or lost alignment i discard the moustache and the beard they are from the passports used for the first stage of his journey not from the second stage if they have been shaven off he cannot have regrown that degree of facial hair the mouth with or without a beard and moustache is distinctive distinctive because it is unique to him two aspects his smile well start with that few men smile for a passport picture he does in each case it is a good smile one of honesty i like his smile and i warm to him open and frank showing no deviousness the second aspect is the teeth the teeth are dreadful but clean the upper bite comes down over the lower teeth and is overfilled and prominent big incisors that are packed too close so they bulge i venture he never met an orthodontist sorry mr gaunt his ears are not flappers but are close back against his hair those of my dog when it is listening keen and alert he is not bigboned and from the set of him i would hazard that he is slightly built if i had to pick on one point id say that most of our guests given wall space have a deeprooted suspicion of the camera but this man is not frightened of it put another way theres nothing in the face that demonstrates the stresses of anxiety he had heard gloria out then had buttoned his waistcoat lifted his tie shrugged into his jacket and taken the elevator up to where the gods rested you promised me the moon last time all bottled up in prague and did not deliver because of czech in competence hamburg would be different enough to override fen wicks irritation i think so think is that all you have for me to bite on i believe so that we are this far forward is due to polly wilkinss efforts she deserves the chance he stopped gazed without mercy into the assistant deputy directors face then resumed pacing after what was done to her she most emphatically deserves the chance sanctioned a good decision not a time to hang about gaunt had what he had come for he was heading for the door anxious to be away before riders were attached he heard the bleat at his back hes dangerous isnt he our man whos on the run dangerous yes exceptionally so murderous little bastard the mischief caught him as he went into the outer office gaunt said perhaps but rather a nice face dont you know she packed dont i get told where youre going ronnie was watching from the door it was her apartment and polly was the guest imposed on the girl from the visa section polly would not have said that she was going to hamburg but could have said she was going to germany and left it vague she did not answer but went on folding blouses and skirts laying them over the shoes at the bottom and her smalls didnt really have an idea of what she needed whether the spring came warm up there or whether it would be perishing cold the sharing arrangement had been intended as temporary while a onebedroom apartment for herself was redecorated but then a refurbishment budget had gone dry and time had slipped on it wasnt satisfactory for an officer in the service however junior to share but having her own room was good enough and shed given up nagging the man at the embassy who allocated premises she was precious little use to ronnie a lonely woman too early at work and too late back to offer company well how long are you going to be away she didnt know how long she would be away and didnt answer just went on filling the case she could share the apartment but not her life the bridling voice whipped her dont mind me im not important im not needtoknow you have a good time wherever ill say this you look like the cat that found the cream you just come back when its finished whenever a last pair of jeans and a sweater went in no photographs in leather frames nothing personal the cat that found the cream probably not very fair to show it because there was little enough cream in ronnies existence in the visa section while she was packing the bag polly had thought she walked tall for the first time since the collapse of the unit in london two years work there hard and slogging study satellite photos of every corner of iraqs deserts pored over defectors statements gutted analysed each word weighed businessmen from every corner of that wretched region who travelled to baghdad had been met in hotel bars had money shoved at them and been pestered for descriptions of factories and chemical plants phone calls and emails intercepted and transcribed all to answer the great question were there in iraq programmes for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction papers written in service tradition it was taught capability intent threat had iraq the capability or the intent to justify the wolf cry of realistic threat caution expressed caveats and hesitations papers returned with redink scratchings obliterating the cautions that were embedded in the services work practices papers resubmitted with honesty seeping out from them caveats and hesitations removed what they wrote by service tradition was supposed to exude provenance but provenance had died and the team scattered to the winds she assumed cursed themselves now for bending at the knee for allowing valued practices cit to be steamrollered and crushed she could remember the day when politicians jutting their chins had spoken of irrefutable proof of the wmd programmes as justification for the tanks rolling in the sands she had stood behind frederick gaunts shoulder had watched the television and heard his silence and had known it would burst so quiet when it had done but a violence in his words she had never heard before they wanted the fucking war we gave them the fucking war and our reward will be to be fucked by them the inquest then the cull of the casualties of failure to find the weapons polly wilkins had been categorized as nba by the investigators no blame attached and sent to prague but the message had been clear to her all of the unit was contaminated by that failure she was scarred by the inquest poisoned by the failure she checked her bag for her passport ticket and euros she heaved it off the bed grimaced and went to call a taxi for the airport because she was the chosen one elation gripped her in the city of dresden on their first visit to germany an elderly american couple waited for one of a line of public telephones in the square to come free that afternoon they had toured the opera house and the kreuzkirche then crossed the augustusbrucke to trawl the galleries of old masters works in the zwinger houses next they would visit the hofkirche in the theaterplatz they needed a telephone to ring their hotel to confirm a booking for the morning car and driver to travel out of the city to the pillnitz palace and take them later to meissen where they would buy porcelain for shipment to chicago they stood dwight and janet behind a young man he had dialled and now he waited for an answer always the difficulty at such a time which phone to target which caller would take the least time they had chosen to stand behind this young man slight and with bowed shoulders he spoke they could not hear him but even if he had raised his voice they would have been too polite to listen and anyway their knowledge of german was scant she had her thumb to keep the guidebook open at the page for the hofkirche and together they matched the view of its towering spire across the theaterplatz with the photograph in front of them the man hooked the phone back turned smiled politely and gestured that the booth was now available such a charminglooking young man her husband would not have done it dwight had the shyness that age brought but janet was bolder would he please show them how to operate the payphone she gave him their hotelroom card with the number they needed and coins he did it for them waited until the call was connected with reception then passed the receiver to her and he was gone it made them both feel good as they crossed the theaterplatz to have met a young man so considerate where do you think dwight that guy was from couldnt say could have been from anywhere the office worker was brought by the bear to timo rahman in the life of the pate no deals were too small none was unworthy of his attention he had come from the yard where he owned the fleet of haulage lorries that carried loads across europe legal and contraband and had arrived at a site on the elbe side of st pauli where the old building had been flattened bulldozers worked there and shifted aside the mess of concrete wire and rubble he had a share thirtythree and a third per cent in the hotel to be built on what was now a hole dust swirled round him and he wore an orange hard hat jauntily he would move on from there to the fruit vegetable and flower market at the hauptbahnhof where money was paid him for the right to set up a stall the haulage business brought him tens of thousands of euros a year the hotel would earn him millions on completion the stalls were only worth hundreds attention to details whether big or small was the cornerstone of timo rahmans life he stood with an architect and the site manager and watched the crawling machines eat at the debris and he saw the bear bring the boy the boy a cousins son would have owned only one suit and one pair of shoes fit for an office worker and he walked with great care through the dust clouds and maybe his shoes would be scratched and certainly his suit trousers would be saturated with the floating dirt timo rahman broke away from the site manager and the architect the boy reached him stood in his presence and the nerves showed timo rahman stared out at the bulldozers it was not for him to show anxiety or any great interest in a messenger who was only the son of a cousin the demand for news of the lost cargo had screamed at him in the night had been with him in the days his casualness was expert as he made the boy wait then turned to him again it is you what matter of home furnishing is there for my interest the boy stuttered could not be heard speak up boy shout the boy sucked the dust and air into his throat coughed then shouted my manager in the shipping section ordered me to report to you he has received a telephone message concerning a cargo from ostrava in the czech republic i know where my factory is and you have no reason to fear me he instructs me to tell you that a part of cargo load is en route to hamburg the time of delivery to the warehouse is uncertain but it will be within two days thank you for bringing such a small matter to my attention sometimes you are in the showroom and sometimes in the office and you should be a credit to the company you serve i think your suit is damaged by coming to this place replace it he took a note from his wallet of sufficient value to purchase a clerks suit and a pair of shoes in any clothing shop on the steindamm folded it carefully and slipped it to the boy his generosity would be remembered rather than the message haltingly delivered he told the boy with firmness that he should be careful when going back across the site and dismissed him long ago timo rahman who was the pate of hamburg had learned that a wall of fear protected him but that kindness generated absolute loyalty among his people he turned to the bear he comes he has evaded them already he has proven himself to be a man of quality if it were known that i assisted him then the wrath anger and fury of the world is turned against me why do i do these things they would spit in my eye and break my bones if it were known what help i shall give why i am a little man i am a peasant from the mountains of albania i am sneered at but not to my face those who know of my origins despise me the time will come my time he thought the bear understood not a word that he said but the mans head nodded vigorous agreement he rejoined the architect and the site manager wiped the dust from his forehead listened to them studied their plans and a quarter of an hour later was on his way to the hauptbahnhof to talk with the traders at their stalls he thought little of the hotel that would sit where there was now a hole what filled his mind was the image of a seashore where a boat would come and the enormity of what would follow the ferry carried oskar netzer back to paradise one day in every two months he took the boat to the mainland to nessmersiel and from there a bus brought him to norden in the town he shopped as a pensioner he travelled free on the ferry and what he bought in norden was cheaper than in the islands supermarkets the tide was far out and the mudflats crept to the limits of the channel used by the ferry he stood on the back deck and watched the mainland shore all he hated diminish the wind came hard off the mud from the northwest they had travelled together he and gertrud on that same ferryboat five years before she could have gone by ambulance to the hospital in norden oskar had refused that he had taken her they had stood together her leaning on his arm for support and the blanket round her to keep the chill from her where he stood now where he always stood on the boat and a week later he had brought her back and when the crane had lowered the coffin on to the quay at baltrum the crew had taken off their caps in respect for her and he had held the horses bridle that pulled the cart carrying her to the cemetery at ostdorf sometimes and that day he did he wept as he stood alone at the back of the ferry his jaw quivered and his cheeks were wet with tears when the ferry swung to starboard for the approach to the islands harbour he saw the seals on their sandspit close to the wreck it pleased him lightened the blackness of the mood that sat on him each time he took the ferry beyond the seals and the wreck out in the north sea was a darkening skyline that merged into the horizon no goodbyes no farewells he switched off the lights and locked the door malachy dropped the keys of flat thirteen level three block nine into the hatch beside the barricaded door of the housing offices its use for him was finished and he was gone from the amersham into the night chapter eleven music blared from high loudspeakers pounded at malachy kitchen he stepped from the train that had brought him from cologne the hauptbahnhof of hamburg echoed with beethoven something of it lifted him and he stepped out along the platform carried by the swell of passengers as if a little of his purpose was regained he knew what he would attempt to achieve in that city but not why the amersham was behind him and after ten hours of travel from waterloo international to brussels from brussels to cologne from cologne to hamburg the estate had already faded in his mind he no longer felt its pulsebeat he stepped on to the escalator and was carried up to the concourse he heard announcements in a mass of languages the arrivals and departures of trains from and to all of europe his stride was bolder than at any time since he had come down the tail ramp exhausted and sweating in the heats blast off the hercules aircraft that had done the corkscrew descent on to the runway at basra but the road had been long so damn long into what was unknown it was as if he clutched at the pride so that he should not lose hold of it the concourse was scrubbed clean and high above it like a cathedrals arched roof was the great shape of glass and iron he held tight in his hand the black plastic sack containing all the clothes he owned that were not on his back and among the smells of the quick food stalls was the whiff of the petrol still embedded in the heavy coat he saw police with guns and unarmed men in uniform with the flash of the bahnwacht on their sleeves he crossed the concourse and saw nothing that threatened him he walked to the exit for taxis and in front of him were stalls of cleaned vegetables piled fruit and cheerful flowers above them the wind tickled the multicolours of the awnings at the tourist kiosk malachy asked in halting german learned at chicksands for a tourist map of the city and was told where he could find a cheap room near to the hauptbahnhof the smartly dressed girl behind the kiosk counter curled her lip in disdain at his appearance and drew a line on the map down a street that was where the inexpensive rooms were for politeness he said its a fine station and i enjoyed the music the music is not for your enjoyment she responded curtly i dont understand why then is it played psychologists told us to narcotics addicts hate classical music broadcast loud its why they are not here the music makes the station free of them we have in hamburg a big drugs problem and you should be careful in the city most careful where accommodation is inexpensive we are cursed by immigrants and the crime levels they bring most particularly the albanians enjoy your visit he went out into a brittle midday sunlight the wind trapped his hair and scoured his face beyond the stalls when he reached the edge of the big wide square that burst with traffic he paused opened the map and took his bearings he had come to destroy a man but did not know how and would have been hard put to articulate why except that breaking the man was the only road sign posted to him as a way back for his pride after he had crossed the square and had started out down a wide street he understood why the woman in the tourist kiosk had curled her lip when he had insisted on a cheap room so little money had been given him that he must husband it she had sent him to where rooms were inexpensive on the steindamm he passed shops that sold sex videos and sex gear and by cafes where algerians moroccans tunisians or afghans lounged on plastic chairs and by doorways where hookers young and old heavyhipped and skeletal thin waited smoked and eyed him he saw the sign for rooms to rent he stopped a woman african stared at him her chest bulged in a haltertop and her thighs were bare below the short tight skirt she sucked at her cigarette then blew the smoke at him but the wind snatched it away he smiled but shook his head the recruits in basic training had talked sex talked sex described sex gloried in sex had sat around the tv while the videos played sex had boasted sex malachy kitchens first sex had been with a girl from a farm in a barn on the edge of the devon village where his parents had moved to second sex had been with a corporals wife and hed washed for a week afterwards had scrubbed himself and prayed there wouldnt be a rash to show for it third sex had been with a girl at the end of a ball at the royal military academy he hadnt known her name had been halfcut and it had been under a tree across the grass from the old building fourth sex had been with roz he gestured he hoped politely to the prostitute from africa that he wanted to pass by her and she moved aside with reluctance he went inside and there was a man at the counter small wiry with plastered hair and he asked in the correct german as taught him for a room for one hour or for two hours he shook his head for a halfday he said he wanted a room to stay in and sleep in alone for how many nights malachy was about to say that he did not know but that seemed inadequate for three nights he was given a price no haggling no dispute the key was handed to him and then as an afterthought a residents book was opened on the counter and a pen pushed forward he thought of giving the name ricky capel and the address bevin close he shook his head heaved the black plastic sack on to his shoulder and started to climb the stairs on the first landing in one of the rooms that would have been hired for an hour or two he heard a beds springs whine on the second landing a man came by him still pulling up his zip he was wondering how long it would be before the african girl took a client to the first or second floor he went on up the room allocated to malachy was bare but for a bed a basin and a faded print of a mountain scene he crossed a worn rug over linoleum and dropped his sack he was there because of what had been said to him and said of him none of it yet wiped january is it a crisis thats what im asking way outside my loop of experience what i can tell you hes not a mark on him ive got a gunshot wound a pi category and a roadtraffic accident casualty and a jock with a scorpion sting where in that does kitchen figure for gods sakefergal said im the adjutant youre the mo you want my judgement pretty far down propping up the heap id say from what they said at bravo maybe a bit lower than propping it up the medical officer was bent over the trolley the gunshot victim was dosed with morphine it was an ugly wound but a challenge for him he had to stabilize the man before he could be shipped out by helicopter not much else he could do what struck him as he probed to get the worst of the detritus from the wound fragments of the bullet fragments of the camouflage trouser material was the consummate bravery of the young guy not a whimper not a scream not a shout trust in his watering eyes a damn good soldier and alongside him flat out on the second trolley and waiting patiently for his turn was the casualty from the roadtraffic accident oh god and there was the i corps captain who stood remote from them in the doorway and had not spoken since fergal had brought him to the aid post whats the latest on that bloody chopper or are the blue jobs on a day off the adjutant peered over his shoulder you wouldnt think so much stuff could get in there extraordinary they had a dust storm back at brigade but the raf are up now the choppers eta is just down from thirty minutes is that going to be time enough the medical officer growled have to be wont it for both of them as a captain the mo had the qualifications of a generalduties doctor he had trained at medical school in london and had then thought that any future was better than an innercity practice so hed joined the army and been posted to the scottish regiment the work gave him swagger and was not demanding back in the uk at the regiments barracks he spent his time patching up injuries from training and sports in iraq his duties varied between extremes from gunshot wounds to the complicated childbirth problems of local women he was accepted his skills were admired from sunray down to the youngest soldier and he revelled in it with minute tweezers he lifted clear threads of cotton cloth matted in the blood he stood to his full height not much more i can do theres a surgical team on the chopper the adjutant said he asked his orderly to cover the gunshot wound then peeled off the gloves and went to the basin disinfectant soap and water he sluiced his hands together and when he looked up he saw the man mai kitchen still in the doorway still silent he turned to fergal whats the story about him varnished or unvarnished plain bloody truth will be good enough the adjutant hesitated its all hearsay of course dont fuck me about whats being said he dried his hands with vigour and went to the second trolley the roadtraffic accident he was worried now this patient might be a more serious casualty than the gunshot wound he boomed spit it out while he worked the medical officer listened its pretty unpleasant here goes he went on patrol yesterday familiarization with the ground before a lift this morning he was in place to assist with interrogation and screening of prisoners the patrol was hit two or three rifle positions and an rpg was fired he was somewhere near the back of the stick when it started what im hearing from bravos people is that kitchen did a runner you are joking what just flipped out and left them there and then not there gone the corporal thinks hes been hit goes back puts the whole section at risk but jocks dont leave a man whos down and retraces the ground covered in the ambush site hes nowhere to be found hits the panic button then they find his helmet in the street and his flakjacket bravos gearing up for a major searchandrescue operation loading the warriors the full works then hes found hes walking back to bravo but without his weapon two questions natural enough what happened wheres his weapon no answer not a word out of him up at bravo they say hes yellow christ almighty you serious personally i couldnt stand him so does he classify as a medical case well he doesnt get to slide under white sheets if thats what you mean i dont call him a patient this is a patient his fingers moved with extreme gentleness over the ribcage of the casualty he yearned to hear the thudding of an approaching helicopters rotors sandwiched long ago into courses on the treatment of gunshot wounds shrapnel injuries and debridement infection caused by clothing fibres and lead particles there had been a bare hour on the recognition of what the lecturer had called battle shock the medical officer had been with commanders and secondsincommand and none had taken seriously what they were told he looked up maybe anger caught him maybe the growing pallor on the casualtys face frightened him maybe the helicopter would be delayed too long he shouted at the man in the doorway dont just bloody stand there like a spare part move yourself do something theres a mop orderly give him a mop and bucket give him a broom to sweep with clean the place when the time came when the two jocks on their trolleys were wheeled out from the aid post the man kitchen still with mechanical movements swabbed the floor with the mop and squeezed it out into the bucket later the medical officer walked briskly back with the adjutant his pistol bouncing against his thigh and said im not taking responsibility for him sunrayll have to see him hes not mine yellows not a colour i fancy kitchens nothing to do with me benji met charlie and together they sipped coffee so hes up and away ricky is did he tell you benji what for told me big surprise nothing you happy benji with nothing i tell you why its nothing because he doesnt know nothing he didnt tell me why he was going to hamburg because he didnt know im straight with you he got

announcement for mr enver rahman and he has not come he is not here he sagged he gazed at the tall leggy woman behind the desk who wore the hotels uniform its logo sewn over a shallow breast nothing that had happened was what he had expected no answers when he had pumped on the flight as to what business he would be doing with timo rahman questions brushed aside like he was a kid and talking too much and would find out when elders betters decided no chauffeur at the airport to meet them but enver had gone to avis who had held a car for them no explanations as they had driven into the city the hotel was a tower of glass and concrete not in the city centre and theyd come past gardens to get there the sort of hotel that did conferences twentysix floors of it hed checked in enver had said that he had phone calls to make and theyd meet up later had to do the arrangements no suite for him no flowers no bowl of fruit just an ordinary room hed kicked his shoes off and lain on the bed because the one easy chair was dead hard and hed flicked the zapper and the channels were all german except one that was american news who gave a fuck for american news not ricky capel and hed waited and waited some more had waited for the phone to ring and it had not maybe hed dozed off on the bed then hed woken had worked the phone buttons and called down had asked to be connected to the room of enver rahman and a dumb cow had told him there was no gentleman of that name resident in the hotel and shed checked and shed repeated it it was like hed been dumped hed just assumed that enver was booking in after hed gone to the elevator it wasnt respect the disrespect was on the plane was a hire car was a hotel that was shit was him being abandoned and enver bugging out what wound up ricky capel tightest was disrespect he believed nothing nobody he strode away from the desk went to the swing doors pushed them open violently didnt care that they battered into the back of a man manoeuvring his bags inside and walked out into the forecourt he could see where enver had parked the green vw passat that had been his lift from the airport there was a bmw series black where the passat had been he strode back inside and anger pounded in his head all disrespect there was a family now at the desk in tracksuits that sort of hotel short breaks cut rate for bloody families he pushed past them and imposed himself in front of her he demanded that she look for any message left him she left the desk and walked elegantly away but slowly he reckoned that deliberate like she thought he was shit he turned and saw the faces of the family kids and adults all staring sourly at him like they thought the same of him as she did she returned a folded sheet of notepaper between her fingers he snatched it no smile on her face but she pissed on him you can read german mr capel he felt the blood run in his face would you like me to translate for you mr capel he nodded it says ricky you will be collected later have a good stay in hamburg enver that is all whats it mean later he was ricky capel he was big he ran an area of southeast london he was he blurted what does that mean the skinny bitch said i think mr capel it means that you will be collected later he stood on a great dyke and gazed out at the sea the bear had stayed in the car on the road on the land side of the barrier built to hold back flood tides timo rahman knew about the life throb of cities and the demands of men for the titillation of the shows provided by his clubs and the requirement of the young for heroin cocaine and pills which he sold but he knew nothing of the coast and its wildness the tang of the salt was in his nose and the wind ripped at his hair and tugged his coat tight against his chest and flapped it away from his legs and there was the spit of rain in it he stared out over the white crests of the waves and watched seabirds ride on them in the shelter of inlets he had looked at the motoringbook map in the car had searched for a place on the coast where there were fewest roads had seen the line of islands and had made his decision it would be here that the man would be brought then shipped to the island and taken on board the trawler because he had no knowledge of the sea it seemed to timo rahman to be a simple matter if he braced himself against the winds power held his hand across his forehead to divert the rain and squinted he could make out the faint line that was the islands shore facing him it was remote isolated always timo rahman went with the instinct that his gut gave him from his car before they had driven along the road behind the dyke he had watched the ferry go with fewer passengers on it than he had fingers on his hands he had seen what he needed to see he turned away beyond the road and the mercedes a solitary tractor ploughed a field of dark earth and further back shielded by trees was a farm with brick outbuildings and on that horizon inland were the towering wind turbines that turned briskly mud splattered his trousers at the ankles and smeared his shoes as he went down the dykes slope and reached the bear he asked if there had been a call but the bear shook his head timo rahman said quietly he will come i have no doubt of it and it is from here that we will send him on malachy left them his key and went out into the afternoon light time to kill till darkness he cut down towards the hafen city of modernbuilt apartments on reclaimed land then left behind the two big church spires like markers for him and found the pavement that led him west along the elbe he would walk the whole way walking was best for soaking up the atmosphere of a city never visited before time spent walking his mentor at chicksands had said was never time wasted he had no plan only the determination that he would manufacture one when the evening came when he was in place he walked well with brisk purpose and his only stop was at the landungsbrucken where he parsimoniously pecked coins from his pocket and bought himself a burger and an icecream there was no weapon for selfdefence or attack in his pocket but he was without fear nothing worse could be done to him than had been he was home for lunch one night in every three weeks on his roster tony johnson did a thirtyhour shift worked through the night then came home for a meal and sleep he was dead beat you actually did that god i cant believe it he had no secrets from her while she cooked he had sat at the table with the coffee mug in his hands which shook and told her what he had done you bought his ticket you gave him money you sent him to hamburg i find it hard to credit he hung his head then lifted the mug both hands and slurped the coffee have you any idea of what youve done to him in his reply exhausted and rambling he tried to explain why he had done it it was hard for him to be rational coherent he spoke of the man and the files that the national criminal intelligence service computers had trawled up for him he told of the devastation to a mans selfrespect personal esteem a man on the floor who wanted to drag himself up and stand again but you gave him capels name you sent him after capel almighty god he could be killed killed and dumped killed and disappeared tony have you no conscience the struggle to describe the smile and the light in the eyes then slamming down the mug splashing the cloth on the table recalling the battering of the questions where to in hamburg to meet whom spilling out the answers that intelligence had produced and the name of timo rahman i know that name you could rot in hell tony his explanation yelled that he had lost control of the man it was what the man needed what the man demanded he was now only the vehicle for the journey his wife stood by the cooker and saucepans bubbled behind her her arms were folded tight across her chest and her face was set stern the question was inevitable your man malachy kitchen would he know when to back off where hes gone would he have the nous to recognize the impossible and step back no answer necessary but he shook his head she beat on the wall with her stick hammered at it behind millie johnson in her little kitchen the kettle whistled and beside the hob was the teapot with the bags in it and a plate on which she had placed biscuits the sort she thought he liked her impatience was curbed only when her bell rang she struggled from her chair used the stick to move towards the door and unlocked it on the far side of the barred gate was the social worker not him because she felt it there must have been like a murmur of it disappointment on her face twice that day and twice the day before she had beaten on the wall and hoped he would come only me millie ivanhoe manners said he pulled a face his teeth flashed and he shrugged second best am i did he go dropped the keys in no note nothing left the place clean like he was never there gone as if he was finished with us what i came to say you have new folk next door from tomorrow a mother and her daughter from sudan i thought you should know did he not say goodbye to you she said gruffly youd better go and make the tea and you can have a biscuit she slumped back in her chair she heard the rattle of the cups then the kettles whistle was cut and water poured ill let it stand a minute he called to her did you learn anything about him he didnt tell me told me nothing but hed been a soldier i tell you believe me he was a soldier nothing about where he was going she looked out of her window down over the plaza and up to the blocks and flat roofs of the amersham she felt frail and the pain was in her arm she felt aged and alone and she remembered what dawn had said to her about the high fly boys and about the dealer at the lamp post his kiss was on her forehead she said tartly i have one and a half sugars going to do what soldiers do i imagine find somewhere to go and fight he played chess victory was assured because frederick gaunt competed against himself the train thrashed north at speed and the roll of the carriage on the track bumped his knees against those of the man opposite other passengers beavered over work files or peered at the screens of their laptops but gaunt had his chess and the man who obstructed his leg room and had joined the train at rugby had his newspaper after each move gaunt rotated the pocket set he could not have brought work files or a laptop with him in these times it was damn near a capital offence to lose either on public transport there was a grunt across the table but gaunt was not sure if it had been obscenity or blasphemy he pondered the moves of the little plastic figures on his board and thought of the futility with which he wasted his journey time did it matter if a blue bishop was lost or a red knight perhaps perhaps it mattered greatly perhaps it mattered more than his mind could articulate he studied the positioning of his kings and queens bishops and knights the pawns was wilco a pawn most certainly the minder who had died in prague burned had been a pawn was timo rahman a knight was the coordinator who had escaped them a bishop was the city where he lived worked the queen that must be protected he began to move the pieces pawns were lost removed a knight fell a bishop moved against a queen not a bloody game quite deliberately he kicked out his leg and his toecap caught the ankle of the man opposite he smiled sweetly when he played against himself he always won but it was not a bloody game when polly wilkins the pawn was on the board and not a bloody game if the queen could not be protected by the bishops move he was quiet hunched and his eyes did not leave the board and the plastic pieces he felt cold as if he were intimidated she was not the only pawn the bishop too had them and would sacrifice them the sleepers he did not know the codename that had been given him he worked in the fast friar food outlet in the conurbation of hounslow to the west of london it was nineteen months since he had last been to the mosque then he had been told what he should study and that he should not return there for worship neither did he know that his true name and the address of the fast friar where he scrubbed the cooking surfaces and cleaned out the frying vats were spoken of in caves in the mountain landscapes of the tribal areas of pakistan and in safehouses in a town of eastern yemen and that they were in the mind of a man who travelled ever closer he was a few days short of his twentyfirst birthday he lived with his parents and two sisters a bus ride from the fast friar and nineteen months before he had as instructed taken down from his bedroom wall the posters celebrating the jihad in iraq and pictures of mujahidin fighters in chechnya he was on no list as he would have been had he continued to attend the mosque of potential activists compiled by the security service or the special branch or the antiterrorist unit of scotland yard in nineteen months he had not seen the imam who had recruited him but he harboured in the depths of his mind the promise made and the instruction given him his family secondgeneration immigrants from karachi had no access to his mind the promise made him was that one day at a time not known a man would come to him would seek him out would use him the instruction given him was that he should spend every waking hour when he was not at the fast friar down the a road at heathrow airport he had gained because of his dedication a near encyclopedic knowledge of the perimeters and their wire defences the patterns of the patrols and dead ground on the flight paths for landings and takeoffs and his friends who worked inside never realized they were gutted for information he did not go to the mosque did not worship with his family but his concept of faith burned bright in him and what he would do for his god a man would come one day to his home or to the fast friar and would lead him to the side beyond the earshot of his family or his employer and would quote from the book and give good news to those who believe and do good deeds and he would answer that they will have gardens in which rivers flow it would happen and everything he knew of the airport would be told the door to eternal paradise would be opened to receive him polly listened had little choice as she climbed the stairs and followed the woman youll enjoy it here of course you will such a lovely building so impressive dates back a hundred and sixty years were so fortunate to be here but im being frank after all the downsizing we five brits and im not counting the locally employed staff we rather rattle around here its so good to have a visitor and an excuse to open a bit more up she was at a harvestehuder weg the seat of the british consulate in hamburg the taxi had dropped her outside a white stuccofronted building that was indeed magnificent opulent the woman escorted her to the top floor where there would be a door reinforced with steel plate and behind it a room available to the service a shipping magnate built it then sold it on to a chilean family who were in the saltpetre trade but they went under in the great stock exchange crash of twentynine in everything inside was auctioned off quite extraordinary among the items under the hammer were three hundred pairs of antlers and would you believe four and a half thousand bottles of wine of best vintage going back nearly forty years then it was headquarters for an ss gruppenftihrer very convenient because kaufmann who was top nazi for the city was just a few doors down where the americans are now it missed all the bombing a providential wind blew the pathfinder marker flares away from this district the annexe was built by concentrationcamp inmates from neuengamme anyway we came got our feet under the table and have been here ever since were very lucky she knew she was escorted by a junior member of staff because the consulgeneral would not want to be within spitting distance of an officer from the service her own ambassador down in prague if they met in a corridor always found papers to put his head into or a window to look out of for fear of contamination they were at the door and the woman gave her the keys polly unlocked it a darkened room and a musty smell confronted her like a mausoleum she saw a table an armchair and a straight chair a rack of communications equipment and the familiar red telephone that would give secure speech contact to london to gaunt and a campbed with blankets folded on it there was a shower in one corner a small partitioned unit beside it with access to a lavatory and a small cooker over a fridge on the other side of the shower she could make herself at home she thought maybe take a holiday on harvestehuder weg t hope youll be all right just sing out if theres anything you need we usually gather for sherry with the cg at about five on fridays in the salon what was the ballroom if youre still here youd be very welcome polly said that she had just a few bits and bobs to sort out and didnt know how long that would take whether she would be finished by friday or not alone the door shut behind her she rang the number of the organizedcrime section of the hamburg police her starting point and wondered if he was here yet in the city the man she was tasked to hunt for it is sami he heard the silence then a gasp then a hiss of shock then something clattered in his ear as if she had dropped a cup or a plate that she carried then the silence the first time he had rung from the hauptbahnhof the phone had not been picked up he had walked for many hours first doing great circles round the square in front of the station ever increasing then taken the sbahn through the docks area and over the river he had left it at the wilhelmsburg stop there he had rung again and the coin had dropped when the phone was answered and the crisp voice had answered yes this is else who is that he had given the name she would know from five years before he imagined her standing with the phone at her ear eyes wide mouth gaping we should meet a pause of many seconds then a choke then i dont know i f the voice each cadence the same as he had known it faded she was in his adolescent and adult life the only woman he had loved in all the years since he had been in hamburg he had remembered the telephone number of the apartment high in the concrete block at first when he had left the memory of her had been in his mind each day and each night but the years had tripped on and the memory had slipped to once a week but was always there of course if a recruit given to him to mould to the state of grace readied to wear a martyrs belt had made such a contact with old life and old love he would have castigated him rejected him and exorcized him from what he planned but she was else borchardt and he had come back to her city she was his weakness no everything is possible we should meet where are you i dont think i am close i will come he put down the phone the wind thrashed around him cigarette packets empty and discarded scattered in front of its force he thought the wind came over the flat lands from bremerhaven and buxtehude to the west or from luneburg to the south when it reached the blocks of wilhelmsburg the concrete towers it eddied in their shelter or was funnelled between them he had many names his given name at birth in the egyptian city of alexandria was but the first to those he served he was abu khaled on the passports he had used on his journey each carried a different name for the german documentation shown at the crossing between liberec and zgorzelec with his place of birth listed as colombo in sri lanka he was mahela zoysa in hamburg eighteen months as a student he was sami to his lecturers his friends and his lover she was sharp in his mind five years after he had slipped from her bed gone into a dawn and left her asleep everything of her face and body was clear to him it was where they had lived he passed an arcade of shops with nameplates in arabic or turkish characters and from them they had bought their food he stopped to watch the football game on a dirt surface enclosed with mesh wire where he had played and she had watched him he walked on ahead was the statue made from weatherdarkened bronze the figure showed a diving keeper what he did on the dirt surface behind the wire horizontal but with a groping arm and a ball that hugged the fingertips nothing had changed in wilhelmsburg in the five years since he had gone she would not have changed he came to the doorway the blocks were where the city put immigrants and students and those without work far from its wealth distanced from its prosperity by the elbe river she had said i dont know i f on the phone and had said i dont think he could not believe that else borchardts love for him was lost but he hesitated in front of the bank of names and bells and he scanned the list but did not find her name within perhaps two minutes a child elbowed past him and rang a bell and there was the click of the closed door being unlatched he followed the child inside she was on the twelfth floor of fourteen he took the stairs at each landing as the breath spurted in his lungs the certainty that had brought him to wilhelmsburg diminished a fraction of confidence at each flight but he pressed on when he came to the door on the twelfth floor when his finger hovered over the bell button he saw that the name typed on paper in the slot beside it was not borchardt it was five years since he had closed that door on his back quietly so that she should not wake he killed the doubts pressed the button kept his finger on it and heard the bell ring out she stood in front of him he saw no welcome but fear she was heavier than the image of her he had carried in his mind thicker at the hips and her waist sagged on the belt of her jeans there were lines at her mouth and eyes where there had been none and she wore lipstick that before she had despised her hair hung loose and was not kept tight against her scalp by the scarlet bandanna of protest she had always worn he had thought climbing the stairs that she would gasp then melt then hold out her arms to grasp him as she had always done but the arms were across her chest and folded tight over her blouse not the tshirt of guevaras face that she had worn each and every day past her shoulder an electric fire burned and in front of it was a rack on which a babys clothes dried he looked above the fire and saw the print of a watercolour view popular of the castle at heidelberg and the same print had been in a corridor off the entrance to the college where he had been enrolled and where she had studied to be a teacher and which all of them had regarded with derision five years back there had been in that place above the fire a poster to commemorate the sacrifices of the palestinian people everything he saw he thought was betrayal there was a chest beside the fire a framed photograph was on the chest in the photograph she stood with her baby and a uniformed man caucasian white was beside her an arm round her shoulder she said we have been married for three years he is from krakow but now he has citizenship he is a good man and a good father it was a long time ago sami what does he do the question had an innocence he is on the bahnwacht sometimes he works at the hauptbahnhof sometimes on the ubahn sometimes at the dammtor in two years he hopes to join the citys police it is his ambition it was too long ago sami we change it was the old life we were young everything is changed you went i cried for a week i thought you would come back i promised myself that you would come back then the planes hit the towers and everything changed his voice was a whisper did you ever speak of it of who we knew no whom we met no but i changed my life and hid what had been she looked into his face did you change sami move on or do you still belong to the struggle have you left them or are you a part of them he should not have come and he knew it it played in his mind the man from krakow returned in the evening from his work shift pulled off his tie loosened his uniform tunic waited for food to be set before him had his baby sit on his knee and asked if she had had a good day and he had ambition to be a policeman how better to achieve ambition she would tell him that a man from her past had arrived at the door without warning and who he was and who his associates had been at the college and he would telephone to the police or the bfv and ambition would be realized for an immigrant from krakow and he knew also that his weakness must be covered the baby had begun to cry and she turned to go to it he stepped inside the room and reached out she recoiled when his fingers found her neck he remembered the softness of the skin where his fingers had played patterns then she had snuggled closer to him had slipped undone the belt of her jeans and lifted up the tshirt with the face of guevara he tightened his fingers and no scream came from her throat just a choke he pressed harder when she no longer struggled when she was limp and he supported her weight he dragged her into the bedroom he left her on the bed beside the cot where the baby cried at the door before he quietly carefully closed it as he had five years before he paused and used the back of his hand to smear away the wetness from his face he had trekked up the long hill of the elbchaussee had left the river behind him malachy came to blankenese and by the station he found a board with a street map nothing written down everything remembered he searched for the name and found a side turning that was scarcely visible on the map but the dusk had not yet come and he walked in the opposite direction towards parkland away from the side turning sat on a bench and waited for darkness chapter twelve hours had passed the rain had come on heavier then eased but the wind was fierce the rain had penetrated the material of his heavy coat and the wind pushed the damp deeper but in the park where he sat on the bench and shivered and the cold caught at his bones night had fallen malachy stood up then stepped out why that there was no clear reason for the actions he had taken merely a higher step on the ladder seemed of small importance to him he had little conception of what it would mean to his life if he teetered on the top rung but he did not believe he could escape it a kaleidoscope of images sped in his mind the faces of those who had been kind generous to him old cloughie at school adam barnett war studies tutor at the military academy brian arnold his guide into intelligence at chicksands all would now have rooted for him then he heard the sneers jibes cruelty of those who had denied him best foot forward malachy and fast before courage was lost he left the park and walked up into the village of blankenese there would have been communities like this one in surrey berkshire and cheshire he passed the dimlit windows of shops for antique furniture imported clothes and food and restaurants with candles at the tables and laughter rows of parked mercedes and bmw highperformance cars he went through the village and thought that prosperity oozed from it and comfort he reached across a low newly painted white wicket fence and grabbed a handful of earth from a hoed bed then bent and smeared it on his shoes he pulled his wool hat lower on his forehead and lifted the collar of his overcoat higher he paused at a crossroads took bearings from the signs then headed on he was hungry thirsty chilled but the combination made his senses keen alert he saw the camera the stanchion to hold it was on a high streetlight on the main road inland from the village branches from a tree wove a trellis of obstructions round the post at a level lower than the camera and the light its position surprised him not right for monitoring traffic in a road leading out of a village centre a hundred metres past the light the camera was the side road leading off to the right he went towards the camera under it and its lens would only have caught the dark mass of his coat and hat not registered his face opposite the side road was a narrow entrance into a garden a hedge had been clipped around the doorway which was recessed in the beech leaves that the winter had not stripped he was in shadow when he crouched on the step and he tucked his dirtstained shoes under himself a man or woman with a dog would have been beside him before he was noticed he could see up the side road and there were distant lights behind trees and hedges above fences and walls he settled he did not know yet which was timo rahmans home he did not know where timo rahman would meet ricky capel where else to be what else to do he could not have gone to every hotel in hamburg stood at the reception desks and asked if ricky capel importer of narcotics to the united kingdom stayed there this was the only place to begin his vigil cars sped along the main road but their lights did not find him he was protected by the hedge and the shadows the cold racked him he huddled it happened very quickly as his head was clouded with thoughts all useless a car coming down the main road big headlights powering in front of it a car coming up the road and braking hard indicators winking for a turn to the right the mercedes was stationary and the approaching lights speared through its windscreen he saw the face the smooth skin that was almost juvenile the face had been above him the headlights of the oncoming car lit the eyes the mercedes swung into the side road malachy watched the track of its lights then saw it turn in and lost it he pushed himself up his hips and knees ached then walked forward the gates closed behind the car ricky looked around him the security lights showed him the house their beams spilling out on to lawns and beds of shrub it was a big pad impressive but not a mansion not like some of the places they had passed on the drive here the driver had not spoken a word that ricky had understood at the reception desk the skinny bitch who had rung up to his room and called him down had led him to the swing doors pointed to the parking area and the mercedes and told him it had been sent to collect him half a day and half an evening he had been stuck in his bloody hotel room and at the end of it there was no timo rahman to meet him personally and to apologize that he had been left for nine hours to kick his heels just a driver he couldnt understand who had gripped his hand shaken it and half crushed his fist he was not one to hang about first hed find out where the little shitface was where enver who had dumped him had gone and why second hed get the business done whatever third hed ask for the arrangements to be made for his flight home in the morning he waited in the car for the driver to open the door for him and waited the bastard didnt he was at the front door beckoning him to follow like he was dirt his temper was high and the blood pounded in him as it had all through the hours in the hotel room disrespect was shown him the front door was open he saw a short squat little beggar slacks and an opennecked shirt in the hall he had never met timo rahman but instinctively knew him all the deals with the hamburg end for the shipment of packages had been handled by enver the nephew all the loads of immigrants brought in on the lorries hed brokered had been dealt with by enver he felt uncertain rare for him and alone awkward because he wore a suit and a tie the man in the hall timo rahman flexed his hands in front of his groin then slid them behind his back ricky had the message and didnt like it he chucked the car door open climbed out slammed it shut stamped across the gravel and came to the step he looked into timo rahmans eyes ricky wasnt tall but he was taller than the man ricky backed off from no one but he saw the eyes the hall lights shone in them ricky wiped from his mind what he was going to say about the shitface enver his shoulders were grasped he smelt the lotion he was kissed on each cheek and the lips cold as bloody death brushed his skin in accented english you are welcome ricky capel good to be here mr rahman and your journey was satisfactory no problems mr rahman i am grateful you were able to find time in your busy life to visit me a pleasure mr rahman the eyes never left rickys years back when he was a kid and when mikey wasnt away they had gone as a family with the girls to the zoo up in london and theyd taken in the reptile house and there had been snakes most of them curled up and asleep but a cobra had had its head up had hissed and shown its fangs at the glass and its eyes had watched them he couldnt hold timo rahmans gaze and he was looking down at the carpet and saw that his feet shuffled like he had nerves his arm was gripped at the elbow i want to show you something that is precious to me ricky anything mr rahman he was led across the hall and up a wide staircase at the landing he heard tvs playing behind two closed doors a door into a bedroom was opened for him on through the bedroom into a dressing room where a wall was lined with a wardrobe he didnt understand look ricky capel the pudgy finger pointed it was the picture his grandfather had blackandwhite the same different frame plastic and cheap but the same handwriting scrawled across it a mountain background a cave with a narrow entrance five men tooled up and standing in a line a fire with a cooking tin on it and three men sitting crosslegged with the smoke blowing against them there was his grandfather and the tall guy whose funeral his grandfather had trekked north to attend and the one that his grandfather called mehmet we got that he said my father your grandfather and major anstruther comrades hes dead anstruther is grandfather went to his funeral we got that same picture comrades ricky capel they fought together fought for each other each of them would have died that the others would live joined by blood all men of value heroes fighters brothers so ricky capel your family and mine are bound together in loyalty to them we do business yes in the mountains in the snow of winter they lay together to give warmth that one of them should not freeze in combat they gave covering fire that one of them should not be a target your grandfather and my father they bound our families in loyalty it is more than business their blood ran together as does ours it was a quiet gentle voice and ricky had to strain to hear it he looked mesmerized at the photograph sharon his mum said the picture spooked her mikey his dad dismissed it as sad but said old men needed a memory to hang on to percy his grandfather never talked about the war and what hed done lost up there in those bloody mountains i suppose so yes they were men of honour whatever the one asked the other would give they lived together they killed together i see what you mean mr rahman do you have ricky capel your grandfathers loyalty i hope so i he checked himself of course i do he was led from the dressing room from the bedroom and down the stairs into a dining room of heavy gloomy furniture wouldnt have entertained any of it where two places were laid wasnt offered a drink was told they would eat and then work at their business the night had closed on him and the storm had grown oskar netzer reckoned it now at force eight and worsening he had laboured into the dusk only when the drill bit had nicked the finger steadying the screw and drawn blood had he decided he could no longer continue strengthening the viewing platform it was not for visitors that he sought to repair it but for himself a part of paradise for this old and troubled man was to be on its deck and gaze down at the small waterscape and see the eiders it would be bad that night but the forecasts for the next week that were pinned up by the harbour told of worse to come as he blundered back along the sand path through the dunes and the scrub he prided himself that he knew every step of the way from the viewing platform to the cemetery at ostdorf where the nearest streetlights were when he reached them he stood in their pool leaned on the closed gate and told gertrud what he had been doing and how he had let the drills bit cut into his finger he thought he heard her voice you are an old fool oskar nothing but an old fool then he went on home and the wind sang in the wires and he thought of what he would eat for his meal and of his book that he would read afterwards but the meal and the book soon slipped because he worried more about the fierceness of the storm gathering out in the north sea the worst of the gales were always in the days and nights before easter he passed the harbour brightly lit and saw the baltrum ferry moored and every boat the islanders owned seemed to be corralled in the shelter of the groyne finding safety from the sea and a new worry surged would the wind take tiles off his roof so much to worry about so little peace you people are wrong freddie about as mistaken as it is possible to be he was not the first and most certainly would not be the last gaunt had taken the train north to this provincial university to hear heresies and listen to unpalatable opinions osama has been made by you and the agency into an icon it was a grievous error at your doors to have done so the man across the formicatopped table from him was of around his age but that was the only similarity between them gaunt was groomed wore his threepiece suit with a quiet tie and had a polkadot handkerchief sprouting from the breast pocket his shoes were highly polished and hed burnished them in the last minutes of the journey with the cloth from his briefcase the professor wore scratched sandals over loud socks shapeless cord trousers held up by sagging braces a check shirt frayed at wrists and collar topped with a stained selfknotted bowtie his white hair sprang from the sides of his scalp and made a halo round his head first you set him on a pedestal and gave him an undeserved value then you compounded the fault by failing to topple him you lifted osama to a position where he became the equal to the heads of government of your coalition i have told your colleagues so many times of that error and their response has been to wring their hands and whine that it is the demand of their masters you should have stood up been counted refused to travel on that road as chair of islamic studies at the university the professor had a rightful place of merit in academic circles but to the service he was more valuable living working outside the bubble of the service at vauxhall bridge cross and the whitehall ministries across the river he offered opinions that grated with the normal welloiled meshings of governments gears at a time of crisis it was predictable that frederick gaunt would have used up precious hours and gone north so you believe a man is coming perhaps with a destination of the united kingdom you show me a photograph he looks pleasant enough you have gauged his importance by the fact that another was prepared to give his life and meet death in agonizing circumstances a life sacrificed that a more valued person whom you believe to be of the rank of coordinator should have time to make good his escape you ask me to penetrate the coordinators mind first forget osama bin laden who i venture is irrelevant now other than as a carved painted totem they sat in the far corner of the canteen in the students union building they ate gaunt picked at a stale salad of tomato chives and lettuce and had a bottle of gassy water the professor had had a mountain of chips with wrinkled sausages floating on a brown sauce lake and drank from a can of chardonnay a few minutes before when a pair of girls had come close with their trays gaunt had imperiously waved them away we live in a topdown society decisions are made at the top and passed down but the top demands that authority is guarded most jealously it is impossible for osama to ape that act i assume he is in a cave on the snowline of a mountain worrying more about his rheumatism and kidney problems than the progress of your coordinator in that cave with four or five men as company and security he would probably not know the name of the coordinator would not have met him would not know the target in europe or in the united kingdom that your man will strike against there can hardly be a courier column beating a trail through the mountains to the cave i dont see the tracks used by wild goats being tramped flat by men with messages in their minds or taped between the cheeks of their arses every satellite the agency can launch has lenses aimed at that trifling mountain range there are operations in the detailed stages of planning on every continent of our earth if osama did topdown he would need a highway for the couriers and the cameras would find them heavy bombs would fall on the cliff face wherever it is and seal the mouth of the cave leaving him to death by suffocation i said he was the icon you have made no more than that an inspiration an example but not a decisiontaker you have created that inspiration and that example and you pay for it in the dedication it has created for the new men a flashed glance gaunt looked at the face of his watch in his mind was the time of the evenings last train to london the new men want only from osama that inspiration and example not just for themselves but more importantly for their footsoldiers they need those who will wear the martyrs belts those who yearn for entry to paradise the new men are already hardened and they have learned from the stupidities of the first generation of osamas supporters your coordinator freddie will use a telephone of any sort only with extreme caution he will not carry a laptop with plans localities biographies stored in the hard disk lessons have been learned the new men are more careful therefore more deadly must you leave so soon gaunt pushed back his chair and stood he asked his first question since the professor had launched his monologue the new man where is his weakness the last chip was swallowed and a belch stifled with the dregs of the chardonnay he is human however much he attempts to suppress weakness it must in time manifest itself i suggest you quarter the field of arrogance a man who lives such a life will have supreme selfconfidence if confidence tips to arrogance you have weakness whether you identify the arrogance and can exploit it well that is your profession i venture the suggestion that you consult with colleagues in cairo that pleasant face has to me the mark of egyptian nationality merely a suggestion and humbly given a thought to travel with freddie you like to call it the war on terror but your mentality is still that of a policeman gathering evidence to arrest convict imprison too ponderous too cumbersome and he will skip round you victory in war comes from the destruction of your enemy eradicate from your mind the due process of law kill him gaunt strode away at the far distant double doors of the canteen he turned to wave a final farewell but the professor was bent over his plate working a finger round it gaunt ran down corridors and out into the night and hurried to the car park where his taxi waited he had learned from his long journey north that he had cause to be afraid of the havoc a new man bred in hate could achieve he saw the face that smiled from passport photographs but could not travel into the depths of those eyes nothing had altered everything was as he remembered it when he had been sami student of mechanical engineering lover of else borchardt friend of heroes he had taken the sbahn on from wilhelmsburg route s which terminated at neugraben as far as the stop for harburg rathaus he had walked past the rathaus through the shopping area and past the new building that housed the social club for muslim men who were far from their ethnic homes he had paused outside the police station where posters requested information on missing women and required help in murder investigations he had noted one that showed photographs of three men he did not know who were identified as hunted terrorists when he had been here with muhammad said and ramzi he had walked past the police station every day and officers coming to their cars had ignored him had never secondglanced any of them another narrow street to cross and he reached marienstrasse still he would be within the view of any officer or detective who stood in the police station and looked out through its wide plateglass windows it was as if he came back to where carrying the name of sami he had been born again the cafe was on the corner he had drunk coffee there with muhammad who had flown into the north tower and with ziad whose aircraft had crashed in the fields of pennsylvania and with marwan who had piloted the jetliner against the south tower and with said who was the logistics man and provided passports and money and with ramzi all were dead or in the hands of the americans except said who was hunted in the mountains of pakistan when he had had the name sami all of them had drunk coffee with him in the cafe on the corner and there they had talked about the nothingness of football about their courses at the college in harburg and then they had gone up the street where the women had cooked for them he walked that pavement the darkness fell around him but he moved sharply between the light pools thrown down on him it was as if he made a pilgrims journey being there strengthened him on the opposite side of the street was number fiftyfour curtains were not drawn to mask the groundfloor room he saw two young men in the room of the age to be students as he had been but they had blond hair and one was crouched over a computer screen the other stood in the centre of the room as if without purpose and smoked a cigarette else had been there with him when she had talked love to him and had promised that she would embrace islam when she had gone to the tutorials for women at the alquds mosque and had given up the tshirt of guevara for a headscarf she had been in that room with him of course the plan for the taking of aircraft had not been spoken of in his presence or in hers but he had been in that room when wills were witnessed and he had seen the tickets for the flights to the united states he went on up marienstrasses gentle incline the laughter of that room rang in him and he seemed to regain the sense of brotherhood before he had known else borchardt and had lived in her apartment in the tower block at wilhelmsburg he had slept on the floor of number fiftyfour and he had known he was with great men with the finest he thought it fuelled his courage being here out in the back kitchen of the apartment standing with his back to the window that overlooked the yard heydar had told the student sami in a voice pitched so low that he had strained to hear him that he should be a warrior of jihad and glory in his work he had been dismissed from that kitchen sent away five years before without hugged farewells but with a ticket for sanaa in the yemen he had gone out through that door on to the pavement and had walked away he had gone back to wilhelmsburg had slept part of the night with the woman he loved and had not woken her had left her he had heard it said that heydar zammar with the pebble glasses the uncut beard and the voice of icy quietness was now in a syrian gaol and would have been tortured but had not broken if he had the name of sami sleeper of alqaeda would have been on the internet images of the americans mostwanted fugitives he remembered all of them he must be worthy of them he passed the cafe halfway up marienstrasse which they did not use then saw the window on the street beside him of the shop where shoes could be repaired marwan had been there with his most comfortable pair for new heels and the room at number fiftyfour had cascaded with laughter that he had the shoes repaired and did not buy new ones he would have worn those shoes with the new heels from that shop when he had taken the aircraft against the south tower the pilgrimage was done the smallest doubt was lost he thought himself ready to resume his journey to a destination where footsoldiers slept and waited for him he had no knowledge of the codename by which others so few of them identified him he lived in a students hall of residence in the east of the capital city and it was a fiveminute walk for him to go from his bedsit room to the minor college under the administrative umbrella of the university of london he was enrolled to study advanced computer sciences and if he finished his course with a halfrespectable degree he would be qualified for work in any of the myriad departments of the civil service where statistics were analysed i f he was twenty years old now approaching the end of his second year his parents and extended family lived in the west midlands were originally from the pakistani city of rawalpindi his father drove a taxi in dudley one of his brothers was unemployed and another was a waiter in a curry house to his father mother and brothers and to a network of aunts uncles nephews nieces and cousins he was an object of pride for having won a place to gain a university qualification his fathers one complaint concerning his son was the lapsing of his devotion to the faith as an eighteenyearold living at home he had regularly attended the local mosque in london he did not it was the one blot on his fathers enjoyment of his sons success instead of going to a mosque their student son when he was not at compulsory lectures or engaged in specific coursework in front of his screen roamed the trains and stations of the capitals underground system he knew the depths of stations knew the junctions where carriages packed tight with commuters passed each other knew the signalling cables locations knew where the main power wires were laid knew the times when platforms were most densely filled he was a wraithlike figure unseen and unnoticed who gained new knowledge from every journey he made the sole frustration in his life was the direct order made to him that he should not fill a hard disk or a threeandahalf inch floppy with what he learned everything was stored in his mind he did not know if he would finish his course before a man came and sought him out perhaps in the hall of residence perhaps as he walked to the college perhaps in the library or the corridors a man would come and would say those who have disbelieved and died in disbelief the earth full of gold would not be accepted from any of them if one offered it as a ransom and he would look into the eyes of the man and he would answer perhaps with a faltering voice they will have a painful punishment and they will have no helpers the words from the book were as crisp in his mind what would be said to him and what he would reply as any of the detail of the london underground network he had dedicated himself to his faith and knew the man would come there has been no liaison miss wilkins there has been no contact between your service and ours there has been no introduction from your consulate miss wilkins should i escort you from the premises i dont think that would help either of us she could play when she judged it right feminine and gamine littlegirllost was an act at which polly was adept also she did tough well there are procedures laid down and times when procedures should be bypassed she said brusquely she was dressed in the one black executive trouser suit she had travelled with the blouse under the jacket was buttoned at the throat she had brushed the styling out of her hair explain to me miss wilkins why i should ignore the liaison procedures for mutual advantage bizarre she thought it their conversation and sparring she spoke to him in fluent german and he replied to her in fluent english as if both put down a small marker of superiority from the moment she had been escorted into the office of assistant deputy commander johan konig she had known that begging favours would fail she had come to police headquarters by taxi with the confidence to send away the driver not ask him to wait for her in the eventuality of rejection at the desk late in the evening she had spoken with the bark of authority and had claimed an appointment with the senior official specializing in organized crime a name gained in her telephone call from harvestehuder weg he of course was long gone then to a junior sent down to the reception area she had played magician and uttered the name to which there would be a reaction timo rahman her skill was in avoiding obstruction she had been led to the third floor of the a wing of the building and had met konig what is the mutual advantage on offer to me that depends on the help given to me imagine a set of scales scales must be balanced miss wilkins if they are to perform satisfactorily you share with me on matters affecting timo rahman and i will share with you but miss wilkins i am a police officer and you are an intelligence agent in the matter of timo rahman i do not think our paths cross she sought to jolt him then your thinking is wrong his head jerked up and his eyes flashed away from the desk none of its surface was visible under the mass of files papers bank statements and photographs that littered it she liked him well enough he seemed to her so tired bagged eyes that wavered in their attention and slouched shoulders she understood the loneliness of the zealot his accent told her he was a berliner the strewn papers told her he was reading his way into the life of a target the clock on the wall showed a few minutes to ten oclock the end of a day the building quiet but for the skeleton night staff dedication had kept him as if he was handcuffed at his desk no photograph of a family was set in a frame on the desk the windowledge or bookcase or on the cavernous safe against a wall my intention is to put timo rahman the pate of hamburg through the courts and into the fuhlsbuttel gaol for so long that he is a senile invalid when released and to have sequestered from his investments sufficient monies to render him a pauper ill help you he believes himself an untouchable in this city then well touch him id like to read his files and id like to see his home what do we share we link him with human trafficking of whores yes but he distances himself from the basic dirt of involvement she threw her card the big play that gaunt always preached against except at a time of last resort no johan not tarts for the pavements but human trafficking in politicals we are into an area that will not be shared with your authorities only between ourselves mutual advantage timo rahman is on uncharted territory he is moving a political a grim dry response for this cooperation i could be hung up from a meat hook we will go miss wilkins to the suburb of blankenese because against all the laws of good sense i trust you the bear served her husband and his guest at the table alicia had cooked for them and had eaten in the kitchen with her girls and her aunt the girls were now upstairs in their rooms and the aunt had washed up the plates that the bear had brought out now the crockery was stacked clumsily in the rack on the drainingboard and the aunt sat by the stove in the kitchen to read an old magazine from home in her home alicia felt herself a prisoner with prisoners rights on the left side of her gaolhome was the family that owned outright the second largest holiday travel agency in the city on the right side the family had the controlling interest in a company selling building materials alicia knew the wives by sight occasionally spoke to them on tiptoe over the garden fence at the back and across the footpath that separated the properties and the wire and the sensors sometimes met them at the blankenese shops when she was with her aunt saw them at the school gate when she was driven by the bear to drop or collect the girls she had no link with the wives who were her neighbours she was shy and nervous of them from what little she knew of them they were smart sleek and careless with their wealth everything she was not she thought her aunt too engrossed in the old magazine to notice what she did alicia was stifled in the kitchen hurt by the thought of her neighbours wives who were a part of their husbands lives and she slipped towards the kitchen door by the door on a unit was a small television set not showing a noisy game show but the silent blackandwhite image of the drive where the bear had parked the mercedes above the set screwed to the wall was the console board of pressure buttons that each had a single red light bright and constant she pressed two buttons to nullify the beams covering the back garden she turned the door key she was halfway outside and the chill of the night was on her face the suffocation of the kitchens heat and her sense of rejection lessened when the voice grated behind her where are you going out she said to walk youll catch your death who would notice if she caught a chill that sent her to bed who would care she said meekly i will be a few minutes she closed the door after her alicia headed for her summerhouse her refuge she could never leave could never go home not one man or woman in her family back at the village in the mountains north of shkodra would welcome her or risk the inevitability of the blood feud the hakmarrje with the rahman clan she had no existence away from the house in blankenese and was as much a prisoner there as the women who worked on their backs in the brothels owned by her husband on the reeperbahn or the steindamm she skirted the light thrown on to the lawn from the diningroom window saw her husband and his guest standing but bent as if they studied papers and the bear with them she reached the summerhouse her place of safety settling among the cushions on the bench nestled in the darkness alicia shivered and clasped her arms round her for warmth an owl called broke the nights silence from where she sat alicia could see the men in the dining room he had found the path its entrypoint off the side road was some thirty yards along the thickgrowing hedge from the closed steelshuttered gates malachy groped down it in darkness and thought it an old rightofway track now used by dogwalkers he was sandwiched between the two fences he held out his hands and felt the rough wood of the planks on either side he came to the end of the rahman garden the property behind it had a security light on a high wall that flooded a lawn he stopped reached up and wrapped his fist over the top of the rahman fence above his head his hand grip tracked along the top of the fence till it reached the obstruction of a concrete post where he judged the fence to be strongest and most able to take his weight he breathed in deep into his chest he had no plan but felt calm malachy steadied himself he heaved himself up the fence rocked but held against the post he struggled but finally he had worked his knee on to the sharpness of the plank tops he saw the light that spilled from a groundfloor room on to the grass and more light that came through a blinds slats at the end of the house in a room on the first floor a child gazed out as she undressed in the groundfloor room his view of it broken by branches he saw the shapes of three men with their backs to him he balanced wavering on his perch as the wood gouged into his knees he found what he expected to find they ran from a hidden stanchion off the upper part of the post layers of barbed wire below the upper strand with the needlesharp points was a smooth length that was narrow but tautened a tumbler wire brian arnold had talked about them on a quiet afternoon at chicksands brian arnold liked to reminisce about old cold war days behind his back most of the young officers and sergeants would make mock yawns dab their hands over their mouths and offer any excuse to quit his presence malachy had not he had sucked in the anecdotes the innergerman border stretching from the baltic to the czech frontier six hundred miles of it had been fenced with barbed wire and with the tumbler strands that activated sirens if the fugitive usually a kid with a dream of the greener grass of capitalism had hiked from leipzig halle or dresden and had circumvented the tripwires minefields dogs and guards he reached the final fence with barbed wire to snag him and the tumblers to bring the border troops who shot to kill the way brian arnold told it from the memory of a young intelligence corps officer based at helmstedt the tumblers had cost young men their lives he crouched with the heels of his shoes on the top of the fence coiled himself swayed and prayed that he would not fall balanced kicked and launched as he fell his shoe brushed the top strand the barbed wire but did not snag his heavy coat billowed out when he was in free fall then he thudded down and the branches of a bush arrowed into him the breath was knocked out of him he stayed still for a full minute until his breathing softened his nose and face in earth and old leaves he moved forward on his stomach wove his way through the bushes away to his left was the dark silhouette of a summerhouse in front of him the house with the halflit lawn he assumed there would be security beams but there were woods at the back and he assumed also that foxes lived there and would roam to hunt and predatory cats security beams safe to bet on it would be set to catch the waist of a walking man to give foxes and cats free passage at a lower level malachy crawled from the shrub bed he went on his stomach hugging shadows pressing himself low as if he was a slug as a focus point malachy took halfway between the window with the slat blinds and the window from which light poured down on his stomach he could no longer see the men but as he came closer he heard low indistinct voices there was winterdead creeper maybe a clematis climbing by the window where the curtains were open and when hed reached the wall he edged towards it eased up off his stomach and on to his knees then stood and flattened himself against the brickwork he heard the voice he remembered i say so dad get rid of him davey then his ears had been ringing from the impact of the kick we dont want people like that in our close and im surprised you let him get this far the voice was a murmur to him whats it called baltrum a quiet growl marked the difference of a second voice it is called baltrum i think it suitable you got coordinates for it what the skipperll need yes are you cold ricky it is cold yes the curtains were snatched at and drawn across the window light died on the grass and the voices were lost but malachy had only the frail outline of a plan not thought through but made on the hoof no rope no binding tape no plastic toy and no canister he slid away past the slatted window was a lockup shed and he thought it would be where a lawnmower was kept shut away for the winter and where there would be fuel for it he reached the shed door and his fingers found a smooth hasp no rust or weakness on it and a heavy padlock there was the summerhouse oil rags would they be in a summerhouse no plan it was only reconnaissance he needed control control was calm there was the darkened summerhouse as a place for a lieup a sangar from which to watch the building for a moment hand on the padlock he had felt a winnow of disappointment but it was now wiped he crawled on his belly round the edge of the grass then came to the decking ledge in front of the summerhouse his chest his belly his groin and his knees went up two steps and his fingers found the opened door he was inside he could watch from here learn of the movement of the house the house the home of timo rahman who was the godfather of the city of hamburg was the last step of his journey he crawled on old dried wood and there were short pants of terror his movement across the floor made a rumbling creak on the boards and the pitch of the breathing grew more frantic he had been long enough in the darkness to see in the gloom the pants came from the outline of a body the head softened by a mass of hair a girl or a woman she was whispering to him but malachy did not understand the words if she screamed yes malachy yes what if she screamed if she brought the men from the house if she screamed and he had to jump at the wires strung from the stanchions what he had never in violence touched a woman if she screamed what price his journey what price his crusade the voice had gone replaced by a whimper of tears a hand caught malachys shoulder he went to tear it clear and realized in that moment that its grip did not threaten him he felt the hand a jewelled ring and a smooth ring it held his but not to restrain him the woman sobbed softly and he loosed his hand from hers he backed away scraping his body across the boards outside at the back of the summerhouse he chose his exit route he reckoned he could jump from the roof of the building could clear the wires that were linked to the stanchions no other way he clawed his way up then slithered on the sloped roof and old leaves cascaded down she did not scream a woman had wept had held his hand and malachys thoughts blurred too soon he jumped too soon because he should have allowed time to regain concentration he scrambled to gain leverage and his shoes kicked air but he was short of the fence and the barbs held him his fingers grappling caught the tumbler wire his body swung brian arnold had described it the fugitive on the wire the alarms screaming the guards coming and the scrape of an automatic rifle being cocked the wire held his coat and he felt panic so long since the last time but as bad he heard a door behind him snap open and the scream the aunt hitched her skirt shouted over her shoulder and ran the light on the console by the door winked angrily on red she thought her shout loud enough from the kitchen to be heard in the dining room that it would bring the bear lumbering but fast after her she knew every button on the console and charged towards the sector of the fencing where the wire had been tripped with a rolling stride from her stiffened old joints she crossed the lawn and as she came to the summerhouse she saw behind its low sloped roof the figure of a man struggling to free himself she yelled again to the bear she was a tough woman past sixty but muscled an upbringing in a mountain village bringing water from wells heaving stones to make fields walls walking to a distant road where a bus sometimes came enduring the harsh conditions of childbirth burying a husband had given her strength her years in blankenese watching over her niece had not dulled her determination she had no fear at the wire shoes flailed on a level with her head she reached up caught a shoe lost it then held the ankle for a moment she clung to it then it was torn away she caught the hem of the long coat the heel of a shoe banged against her forehead dazed her a toecap caught her mouth split her lip and she spat away the broken tooth cap she clung to the coat she heard the voice of the bear her fingers clawed into the coat and the man inside it writhed and then he was gone she had the coat which sagged down and swamped her it was a blanket on her head as she threw it off the aunt saw the body a sharp moment astride the fence and then he jumped she stamped in fury frustration the assistant deputy commander broke the fall and the breath squealed out of him polly grabbed the mans arm and pulled him up her grip loose from blood spilling out she heard konig cursing follow her up the path between the fences slithering stumbling they reached the side road the man she held started to struggle as if his own fall on to konig had first winded him but now he fought for his life not in time the arm she held at the elbow was dragged back and she heard the metallic click of handcuffs closing then the belt of a fist into the mans head they careered down the sidestreet and towards the lights of the main road konig gasped theres a firearm legally held in the house if were found were fucked no questions were dead dont you carry a weapon what use it in defence of a thief an intruder grow up child a thief an idiot they passed the gate and lights now shone down on the garden and the front of the house and she heard the confused yells behind the steel plates and the thickened hedge between them they pulled the man each holding one of his arms and he was limp his shoes scraped on the pavement what had happened coursed in polly wilkinss mind konig had parked his unmarked car at the main road he had pointed out to her the camera half hidden by branches on his orders in place for three days and had murmured wryly that it was for statistics of traffic analysis and in no way contravening the human rights of timo rahman byintrusion had explained that to go to an investigating judge for authorization would have risked involvement with a corrupt official they had been in front of the house walking briskly when they had heard the first shrill shout they had found the path between the fences and been drawn down it towards the yelling and screaming when the struggle was at the far side of the fence they had stopped he had come over clothes ripping had been on top of the fence outlined against the night then had dropped on to konig what she recalled most clearly of the man as she had lifted him was the smell of old stale dirt they reached the main road turned the corner and behind them heard the scrape of the gates opening doors zapped as they ran to the car they pitched the man on to the floor space between the seats and polly went in after him from the cars roof light she saw the mans face then konigs door slammed shut and they accelerated away she grinned not much of a return for all the drama johan your catch looks and stinks like a damn vagrant dazed and numbed as he had been once before malachy lay prone not in a gutter but on the carpet of a cars floor against his face holding down his head was the smooth warm stockinged ankle of the woman he did not know what havoc he had left behind him or what chaos lay ahead chapter thirteen my name is malachy david kitchen and my date of birth is we know your date of birth and my date of birth is the twentyfifth of may and your blood group is o positive and your religion is church of england i think we have covered that ground they had taken his wristwatch shoe laces and belt the german swung the dog tags in circles he sat hunched on the mattress rubber sheeting around thin foam on the concrete bench that was the cells bed the german was propped against the concrete slab the table beside the lavatory and the woman leaned against the closed door and held the passport lifted from his hip pocket my name is malachy david kitchen and my date of birth is the twentyfifth of may she said and your passport lists your occupation as government service the german said your military number is it is late i want my bed and you should tell me why you were at the house of timo rahman she yawned what government service requires a man with british military identification to be at the home of timo rahman my name is malachy david kitchen and my dob is the twentyfifth of may the tags swung faster their shapes blurred in front of him his passport was now closed held behind her back his scratches from the barbed wire were not cleaned and they made little stabs of pain on his palms and thighs he did not know their names because he had not been told them but he could assume the man was senior they had taken him fast out of the car and had dragged him up the steps of a monstrous glass and concrete building police had hurried out of the protected reception area and had shown acute deference to the man but had been waved away he had been taken down two flights of stairs along a corridor then pitched headlong into a cell they had followed him inside and the man had kicked the door shut behind him he had half fallen to the bed then had settled on the mattress the storm of questions had begun over and over again a repeated litany when had he come to germany what was his business in hamburg why had he broken into the grounds of the residence of timo rahman he had taken as his focus point the barred ceiling light its a simple enough question malachy she could not suppress another yawn come on dont mess with us not at a quarter past three why were you there the german had come close to him knelt in front of him and swung the tags what government service brings a british citizen to the home of the pate of organized crime in hamburg when that citizen has military identification but is dressed like a derelict and stinks of sleeping on the streets what my name is malachy kitchen my oh for christs sake dont you know how to help yourself her shoes thudded on the cell floor in theatrical exasperation date of birth is the twentyfifth of may you are in debt to us the german grated if we had not been there to help you they would have killed you killed you and dumped you where your body would never be found who sent you malachy who put you against timo rahman at the light on the ceiling a fly came close to the bulb for minutes it had circled the brightness and he had watched it his mentor at chicksands brian arnold used to talk if an audience could be found on resistance to interrogation and the stories were of time spent at gough barracks county armagh and the experts he spoke of were not the relays of questioners from special branch but the men from the bandit country of crossmaglen forkhill and newtown hamilton the best of the prisoners took a point on the ceiling a wall or the tiled cell floor and locked their eyes on it sometimes a hundred questions and not one answer hed learned well over coffee in brian arnolds room my name is malachy kitchen she said she was dead on her feet and my date of birth is the twentyfifth of may the german pushed himself up off the cell floor strode to the door swung it back and allowed the woman through it was heaved shut and the lock fastened why was he there why had he levered himself on to the top of the fence and jumped down clear of the wire at the home of timo rahman why had he climbed in desperation higher on the ladder images surged into his mind like a nightmare worse than the insults had been the cloying kindness the bloody syrup stuff the understanding january youve been very helpful mal most cooperative and i dont want you to think that your silence at most of the questions ive put to you in any way jeopardizes your position in the army your inability to answer is quite predictable and you show the wellknown symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder we are not in the stone age so we dont give elbow room to expressions such as cowardice or to lack of moral fibre we accept its taken us psychiatrists long enough to get there and weve walked a hard road that ptsd is a medical condition now and this is very important to your peace of mind there is only a remote possibility that you could face a courtmartial and a charge of desertion or dereliction of duty a slight and remote possibility but ill do my damnedest to see it doesnt happen my report will say this is as clear a case of ptsd as i have come across is there anything youd like to ask me in civilian life the psychiatrist worked for a health trust on the south coast of england but for more than thirty years he had been a member of the territorial army god alone knew now how his regular patients back home were surviving his sixmonth absence in the medical unit attached to the divisions headquarters outside basra he had the rank of colonel and headed the battleshock recovery team a small empire of a lieutenant who was less than half his age and two orderlies who typed and doubled as nurses in the sprawling hospital in the seaside town his caseload was overwhelming in iraq it was minimal when a general or a brigadier came to inspect the brt hed sometimes joke that he felt like travelling round the combat units and touting for trade but patients came infrequently nothing to ask me well thats not unusual youve had a hard time and probably suffered some pretty cruel cuts but thats because of soldiers ignorance of mental disturbance its all behind you my promise is that were going to get you right get you back on track youre not the first and you wont be the last but were going to deal with it you are not abnormal most importantly mal youre not a failure i emphasize it not an outcast or a pariah youve had an horrendous experience but with time and care and with the love of your family youre going to come through it im going to ask you to wait outside a few minutes while i draw up some papers that need your signature and when thats done ill call you back in i urge you to remember very clearly what ive said not a pariah or an outcast but a patient with posttraumatic stress syndrome not a failure he watched the captain stand and go a stilted step towards the door fascinating in the last month hed had an raf corporal who had been spooked by night guard duty on the airstrip perimeter and a lancecorporal chef from the catering corps who had been pressed into service for patrol and had frozen two months before him there had been a clerk from logistics who had sat on a portakabin roof and refused to come down claiming that local cleaners heavily vetted intended to kill him this fellow was the real thing what the textbooks described right lets get some notes down donald his duty orderly settled at the computer and the psychiatrist dictated a skeleton analysis from field reports the patient seems to have suffered initially from convertive collapse with consequent loss of limb movement brackets i do not believe we are dealing with a malingerer or a faker of symptoms close brackets this became dissociative collapse loss of contact with his environment and inability to relate to it take a paragraph donald what did you make of him id be going with what they said at bravo colonel sounds to me like he just flipped his bottle hardly a medical statement no hes most interesting because hes a classic case could even be a paper in it might get to be a lecture subject no names of course next paragraph from outside the family of the regiment he was serving with so beyond the buddy network probably worth checking poorly trained for being alongside an activeservice unit asked whether his home domestic relationship was satisfactory patient flushed and made no reply all three make ptsd a top starter im actually quite excited people back home would kill to get their hands on him were rather lucky boot him out wont they dont mind me saying it colonel but wheres he going to go wholl have him with this lot in his knapsack you softsoaped him sir but hes on the outside longterm getting science into your skull donald is a labour of sisyphus beg pardon he had to roll a stone up a hill homeric legend father of odysseus and each time he reached the top it rolled back down and he had to start again next paragraph patients silence during consultation is compatible with a current state of dissociative fugue brackets only basic selfcare maintained but refusal to acknowledge familiar locations and life structures close brackets what you have to understand donald is that cowardice is no longer a word in our lexicon in the modern environment ptsd explains everything the guys with him wont buy that colonel you dressing it up wont change it with respect to them hes just a coward no escape from that reputation being called a coward youd tax the patience of a saint donald mores the pity i wont have enough time with him going to damn well try though paragraph treatment of patient is handicapped by the delay in his movement from a forward area to my battleshock recovery team unit valuable time has been lost with consequent onset of acute stress reaction the capitals pie close capitals principle has been negated proximity immediacy expectancy cannot now apply in a more ideal world than provided by combat in iraq the patient should have talked his actions through with a qualified expert at the location within hours of it happening and should then have been assured he would be subject to fast recovery from a oneoff behavioural incident thats about it but the pie principle didnt happen sir did it it did not which is why colonel hes shafted hes labelled a coward and bigtime hell believe whats written on that label it was the moment when he realized the flimsy nature of the plywood walls and the lightweight door that divided his consulting room from the waiting area beyond he cursed softly and felt a little moment of shame perhaps donald you could get those consent forms out make some coffee then get him back in ricky had asked what you got a dozen passengers for the boat timo had said one no not the boat one boat what i asked was how many passengers is it carrying twelve one passenger they had been at the table now cleared by the bear and the map was unfolded to its full size and lay spread across the mats ricky had laughed in surprise what one passenger the boat comes all that way for one body i see nothing to laugh for the boat comes now for one passenger the purpose of the boats journey is not to fish it is to carry back across the sea the one passenger because he was bent over the table because his eyes were set on the island marked on the map ricky had not seen the piercing brightness of the eyes of timo rahman or the narrowed lips that signified his annoyance you know what it costs mr rahman to put that boat to sea a bloody fortune it costs a hand had slipped on to his shoulder and fingers had squeezed tighter into the flesh and the bones and the voice had been silkily smooth you bring the boat now ricky for one passenger not next month or next week but now that is very easy for you to understand yes and you will remember the many favours i have shown you yes yes mr rahman and the hand had loosened but had left behind it the pain of the pressure on the nerves and there had been the first shout from the kitchen and the chaos had followed ricky capel far from home had sat for close on two hours in the dining room had not spoken had not moved had not known what the fuck had happened he had heard the yelled commands and questions the staccato orders given down the telephone in a language he knew not a word of he had sat motionless with the map in front of him twice the bear had come through the dining room like ricky wasnt there with a luger pistol in his hand now from the kitchen among the savagery of voices a woman sobbed in the door was timo rahman he hurled a heavy coat across the room an overcoat brown and with a fleck in the material it hit the table and slithered half its length the coat was in front of ricky you know that coat not mine ricky giggled not from mischief or cheek but fear the voice was soft i asked ricky do you know that coat no no i dont the smell of the coat was under his nose and made the fear acute how could i timo rahmans arms were folded across his chest seemed to make him stronger more powerful looming behind him was the brute of the man who had driven him to the house who had served him at the table who was always close who still held the pistol rahman said a gentle singsong pitch from england ricky you come to my house as my guest at my house ricky you are given my hospitality we agree yes i agree i say to you ricky and you should believe me that never has a thief or an intruder come to my house since my family and i moved to blankenese any thief or intruder would prefer to attack the home of the police chief of hamburg than risk my anger and retribution you come and my house is attacked and this coat is left on my garden fence never seen it before mr rahman never on the coat faint but recognizable was the smell of petrol my housekeeper had hold of his coat but he slipped from it and went over the fence and you have never seen it before its what i said mr rahman and the label of the coat is from britain i think harris tweed is from britain and in the lining under a hole in the pocket in two pieces is a train ticket victoria to folkestone and they are in britain ricky what should i think dont know cant help you never saw that coat before honest his voice was shrill thats the truth as your grandfather would have told you ricky in albania we live by a code of besa it is the word of honour no albanian would dare to break it it is the guarantee of honesty can you imagine what would happen to a man whose guarantee of honesty and truthfulness is found to fail i think i can ricky said breathy yes and you do not know who wore the coat he seemed to see from the doorway of his home in bevin close the shortarm jab that dropped the man at daveys feet seemed to see the bundle of the man on the pavement made larger by the size and thickness of the brown overcoat seemed to hear davey some bloody vagrant scum ricky seemed to feel the recoil in his shoe when he had kicked the face above the overcoats upturned collar seemed to hear clear davey on his coat he had the stink of petrol seemed to see george wrights place burned and heard what george wright his leg fractured had yelled about kids on the amersham estate and a dealer and a line from bottom to top i want to be there watch it when its your turn he hadnt davey at his back and he hadnt benji and charlie at his shoulder had no one to tell him what sort of crazy idiot a mad dog went after pushers and a dealer a supplier and an importer and turned up at the place of an untouchable who ran a city if he had stood his legs would have been weak and his knees would have shaken anyone knew ricky capel knew what albanians would do to enforce a contract himself he had merks on hire from shitface enver with baseball bats to kill a man who was late with payment had seen them used on a man strapped to a chair i swear it i never seen that coat not on anyone first thing ill do the boat like you said ill get it over here with their second bottle of slovenian wine their favourite which they had carried off the ferry the couple from dusseldorf discussed their ill luck both had taken a week away from work to travel to their holiday home on the island of baltrum the man a chemist said the forecast is foul you have to book vacation days away of course it is chance but you are entitled to look for breaks in weather even before easter i spoke to jurgen at the shop and he says it is only storms that we can expect i tell you the day we go home it will change she the principal of a school for infants said you cant go on the roof clear the gutters and check the tiles in this wind you cannot paint the windowframes and the doors which need it in the rain i cannot air the bedding and the rugs its hopeless it had been the intention of the chemist and his teacher wife to open up their home and let the fresh air waft through it after its winter closure each spring it was necessary to add a fresh layer of paint to the outside woodwork she drank then grimaced have you seen him his face already sour from the prediction of the weather cracked in annoyance sadly he has survived the winter i have not seen him but have heard him he came back through the rain after dark the door slammed that is how i know he is there they tried hard both of them to ignore their neighbour who was one of the few twelvemonthsayear residents on the island it was four years since they had bought the perfect home to escape from the pressurecooker life of the city the first summer there they had brought with them their grandchildren two small lively kids who had kicked a football on their little patch of grass at the back and each time the ball had crossed the wire fence dividing their property from their neighbours garden there had been increasing rudeness when the chemist had asked permission to retrieve it the children had been reduced to tears and had not come during another summer he said i wonder what he does all those months when we are not here who he insults she said i think we are a recreation for him he is a man of misery he takes happiness from it death when it finds him will be a blessed relief for us they laughed grimly chiming a cackle together the second summer they had left a note on oskar netzers door inviting him to join them for a drink that evening he had come had filled their bijou furnished living room with the odour of a body long unwashed and they had shown him the architects plans drawn up in dusseldorf for an extension of a garden room topped by a third bedroom and a shower cubicle he had refused the drink then had refused to endorse the plan they had thought it commensurate with every environmental and aesthetic consideration he had rubbished the architects drawings through the rest of that summer the following winter and into the third summer their neighbour had fought the plan in baltrums rathaus committees its size its materials its concept last summer they had consigned the plan to the rubbish bin had given up on the project last year when they had been at their house if he came out into his garden they went inside they had nothing to say to him and he made no secret of his opinion that they were intruders and unwelcome but his death would come and their liberation he said i cannot imagine a life so detached from reality they say that even when his wife was alive he was no different she said that woman she must have suffered it is not possible she could have been the same you never see newspapers outside the house for the rubbish you never hear a radio there is no television he must know nothing of the world he inhabits would not know about the economy its down turn the unemployment would not care isolated here would not know about the war in iraq not know about the terrorists ignorance stubborn obstinate hatefilled ignorance so pathetic to be at the autumn of life and to realize deep in your heart that you will do nothing in your last days that is valuable nothing that is respected a memory for both of them when they had packed up the house at the end of the last summer and loaded the trolley to wheel it to the ferry had been the lowering and gloomladen face of oskar netzer behind a grimy window at home in duisseldorf each time they spoke of their neighbour anger grew and they had to stifle it or accept that he hurt their love of the island and their small home he poured the last of the wine from the second bottle into his wifes glass you are right my love he would reject any action that made him loved respected she drank then cackled in laughter and the drink spurted from her lips sorry sorry his ducks will love him the bloody ducks will mourn him when hes dead no one else the wind hit their windows and the rain ran on them and the curtains fluttered and next door to them unloved their neighbour slept you can take him please get him out of here dont know that i want him remove him miss wilkins if you say so she had sent her signal encrypted on the laptop coffee had kept her awake while shed typed she followed johan konig out of the side room and back into his office squeeze it from him why he was at the rahman house without your help if i hold him i have to charge him and put him before a court it is not a road i wish to follow understood he passed her the plastic bag then turned his back on her for a moment she looked around the bare room which she had decided displayed a mans aloneness and a life without emotion she fastened on the one item that showed humanity a photograph of a hippopotamus in a muddied river with a white bird on its back in her imagination she delved into konigs past perhaps a holiday in east africa with a wife or a partner and that was a favourite picture maybe the wife or partner had now left him or had died she reckoned it involved a sadness she betrayed herself her eyes lingered too long on it it is the better to understand them konig said what do you mean the better to understand them in berlin now in hamburg she said quietly i assumed it was something personal god no the better to understand the men who control organized crime to understand rahman the hippopotamus is the society in which we live and the bird is the godfather the egret the bird is not the enemy of the hippopotamus instead it fulfils a need of that great creature by picking off its back the parasites that will damage its skin it is a symbiotic relationship the hippopotamus provides sustenance for the bird the bird returns gratitude by cleaning the hippopotamuss back they need each other society wants drugs prostitutes and sex shows and the godfather gives it he does not leech the blood of society he merely provides a service that is demanded that is why the picture is there to remind me of reality what is the relationship between the bird the godfather and terror cells he pressed a small button on the leg of his desk again symbiosis the bird goes wherever there are parasites parasites are money the terror cells have money safehouses and conduits for weapons if there is benefit from cooperation you will find the egret there do not imagine miss wilkins that timo rahman steps back on the dictates of conscience or morality when there are parasites to feed off the picture tells me much she grimaced i suppose so take him she held the plastic bag yes i will a man stood in the outer door blinking in the bright light and she recognized him as the one who had brought the relays of coffee since they had emerged from the basement cell block may i offer you advice the power of timo rahman in this city stretches far wide he has a network of clan leaders who control the footsoldiers all of them will by now be out searching for an englishman who dared to violate sacred territory rahmans home keep him safe miss wilkins or he will be hurt severely and so will you if you are with him i warn you and you should listen to me thats a cheerful message to start the day the nightduty man led her away along the corridor they went down three floors in an elevator down more flights of stairs she realized then that none of the big battalions marched with her she had no weapon and no backup to call on the cell door was unlocked he lay on the bed she threw the plastic bag at his head and it cannoned into his face his eyes burst open come on she snapped my options were shifting you out or learning more about the hygiene habits of hippopotami chose you move yourself he looked up at her eyes glazed with bewilderment and shook himself from the bag he took the belt and slotted it into his trousers he laced his shoes put the watch on his wrist and hung the tags at his throat then she took him out into the last of the nights darkness his train had been delayed a points failure on the track south of lincoln and the taxi queue at the station had been endless by the time he returned to his office the bells behind big bens clock face were chiming midnight gaunt found the signal because it rambled and was strewn with typescript errors he thought his precious polly suffered acute exhaustion most of the others of her age who had desks scattered through the building popularly known as ceausescu towers but not wilco would have gone to their beds and then after toast and coffee have composed a report without errors of syntax punctuation spelling she had responded and he blessed her to her understanding of urgency the signal and he had read it four times before he unfolded the campbed and shook out the blankets was a masterclass in confusion yet there was clarity a clear enough link he believed now existed between a fugitive escaping from prague a coordinator and a considerable player in hamburgs community of organized crime a highvalue target the lights switched off his jacket and waistcoat shirt tie and suit trousers over the hanger on the back of the door his shoes neatly laid at its foot he stretched himself out on the bed and spread a blanket over him god was this not business that should be consigned to the young work tossed in his mind and in his hand gripped tight was the sheet of paper that described a man rescued from the security fence around that hvts property a name a date of birth a sixdigit service number a blood group an occupation of government service a tongue that stayed silent and a britishissued passport confusion because he did not know whether polly wilkins had blundered on something of importance or was distracted by an irrelevance and no way of telling not till dawn not before the banks of government computers in the outposts of the ministries across the thames sprang to life god was he not too old for all of it he saw them sometimes rarely more than often the men and women who had taken the retirement carriage clock or the decanter and glasses set and had handed in their swipecard ids for entry to the main doors of vauxhall bridge cross all had gone out at the end of a friday afternoon last day of the month bowed with tiredness and clutching their gift of appreciation every one of those whom he met on a pavement or by chance in a restaurant seemed reborn they were like those comelately christians oozing confidence and brimming health you know the bestkept secret inside that bloody place freddie theres a life outside never knew it till i got there outside havent ever felt better dont mind me freddie but you look a bit washed through when are you chucking it in freddie my only regret should have done it years back it frightened him alone on the bed with the quiet of the building hugging him that he should be gone from the place yesterdays man with work unfinished that bloody place was freddie gaunts home he was drifting towards a fitful sleep and the enemies he hunted were his lifeblood but he could not guess where they were could not identify them because they wore no damned uniform he did not know where his name was written down what alias was used and how many had access to it he travelled to work each day in his uncles transit van with his uncles logo on the side sitting with his tools and his uncles sons he was far from his immediate family his parents brothers and sisters lived in the port city of karachi where his father and brothers broke up the steel hulls of unwanted ships for scrap metal he had wanted more and his ambitions had led him to join his mothers brother in london ambition had not been fulfilled at the age of twentythree he was not a laboratory scientist not an engineer not a scholar but a plumbers mate the resentment had flourished sufficiently to take him to a mosque in south london where an imam talked at friday prayers about injustice there was the injustice that permitted white society to walk over the aspirations of muslim youth in his new homeland the injustice shown to worshippers of islam in saudi afghanistan chechnya and palestine he no longer harboured resentment two years ago less a month he had been asked to stay behind as the faithful had slipped away from the prayers and the imam had spoken to him in a hushed tone would he serve would he wait until he was called did he have the strength of his faith was patience a virtue of his he went now to a new mosque in the west of the city where an imam preached religion but did not speak of the war zones where muslim brothers fought for the privilege of martyrdom he was brighter at work did not complain about rising and dressing before the dawns light lifted over the capital each morning and each evening he crossed the city of london on his way to and from work some days the crowded transit van was stopped by the armed police officers at their roadblocks but their route was always the same and they had become known more often now they were waved through and drove away from the men with protective vests and machineguns without being quizzed and the vans contents searched the same applied at his place of work where he wore an identification tag hung from a neck chain and there also the security guards were familiar to them five days a week the van was parked in a designated bay deep in the basement of the great tower that was canary wharf in those two years he had learned by heart the hidden ducts that carried the airconditioning systems water supplies and sewage outlets in the building that dominated the skyline and could be seen from many miles away he thought it a symbol of the power that had denied him the opportunity to fulfil his ambitions each working day he saw the surge in and out of the many thousands who had blocked him and did not know of him one day he had been told a man would seek him out would speak to him god will say how many days did you stay on the earth he would answer and the words were always in his mind they will say we stayed a day or part of a day it no longer troubled him that his response from the book gave him the answer of the unbelievers on the day of judgement he had been promised that one day the man would come and he believed the promise his primary job was to drive the forklift vehicle that moved the flatpacks of selfassembly furniture from the lorries that came from the factory at ostrava in the czech republic his secondary job was to be first at the warehouse to unlock the side gates of the yard and the main building where the offices were flush on the street and in the evening he was the last to leave and fastened and checked the doors windows and main gate the forklift driver walked along the street briskly because he was late on his schedule and saw a man on the step outside the offices door hunched low and in the shadow few matters concerning the warehouse surprised the driver he worked for a company owned by timo rahman and knew a little of the complexities of his employers business he understood that in the affairs of timo rahman men came without warning and without introduction to the warehouse and that questions were not asked and explanations were not offered he passed the man and because the head was bowed did not see the face he went on to the corner turned into the narrow driveway that separated the warehouse and offices from the next premises he loosed the padlock on the yard gates cursorily he checked the vans then opened with the keys entrusted to him the back door of the offices because he had been delayed that morning by the police cordon and was behind with his routine he hurried to the toilets mens and womens his first task of each day was to wash them clean the hand basins and sluice the floors then he should have the bell at the office door pealed he left the toilets his mop and bucket and hurried past the unlit offices of administration sales and accounts and unbolted top and bottom the street door the man glanced over his shoulder scanned the street then pushed past him im late im sorry the man who had waited on the doorstep shrugged the forklift driver babbled i was delayed this morning it was many months since he had been late opening the yard and offices he thought the man had not slept that night his eyes were baggy and lines cut his face at the side of them the man leaned against the corridor wall and his shoulder was against a photograph of a diningroom table and chairs set after they had been assembled from a flatpack i could not leave home you know hamburg i suppose yes i live at wilhelmsburg police so many police there i have to prove my residence to the police before i can leave show my papers but there is a long queue ahead of me not in my block but the one next to it a woman was killed the head turned and tired eyes raked his face as an albanian he was trusted and sometimes timo rahman when he came to the warehouse would drop a hand on his shoulder and tighten it there then he glowed with pride he thought for what he did he was well paid but the wage given him allowed him to live only in a wilhelmsburg tower block the reaction of the man encouraged the forklift driver to go further with his explanation of lateness my wife knows everything she says the woman was murdered in her apartment by strangulation it is not her husband he was at work it is not a thief the people of the towers in wilhelmsburg they have nothing to steal my wife made coffee for the police when they came yesterday they said what they think she was killed most probably by a boyfriend she entertained in secrecy they will go back in her history because always there is a trace of a friend they told her they are confident that very soon they will have the identity of the friend it is good a man who kills a woman close to her baby he is a beast he is contemptible he apologized again for his lateness and asked what he could do did he have a number for the residence of timo rahman i have but i am instructed to call it only on matters of great importance he should ring the number what am i to say he felt a tremor of nervousness at the thought of ringing the residence of timo rahman before dawn would you not wait till the manager comes in less than two hours he should ring the number now he should say that a traveller has come a traveller yes the mans eyes were locked on him i will say to timo rahman that a traveller has come who is he his wife alicia mother of his children stared back dumbly at him what is his name the children the girls had come to the bedroom door had huddled there and had shaken in fear and he had dismissed them does he come often timo rahman did not believe that ricky capel the mouseboy would have dared lie to him nobody lied to him if ricky capel said he did not know the man who had broken into their garden then he was believed it was inconceivable that ricky capel in his power should lie to him you were in the summerhouse you give me no explanation why in the darkness you were in the summerhouse when he is seen the man is on the wire behind the summerhouse why was he there his wife alicia was on the bed curled shrivelled against the pillows she had pulled her knees close up to her chest and he could see her shins and thighs anger swarmed through him is my wife to whom i have given everything she could want a whore her arms were round her head and her body shook with her tears does my wife go to the summerhouse in the evening to be fucked do you lie on the cushions and open your legs wide to take him is that what my wife does she seemed to wait for him to strike her you are in the summerhouse and he is there what else should i think she flinched was back against the cushions could not escape further from him do you not understand the shame you have brought on me on my children there was a light knock on the door i will clean you the dirt on your skin will be taken off where his body was against your body i promise it i will clean you he left her outside the door timo rahman turned the key in the lock the bear was impassive as if he knew of no crisis gripping the family he had made his promise he would clean her he was told of the telephone message sent from the warehouse of his company that sold selfassembly furniture and as he strode away from the bedroom door he showed no sign of the hurt that wounded him deeper than a knife had more painfully than a bullet had he believed that his wife his childrens mother was a whore malachy saw the dawn come up shed said i am reliably told you are a man with a price on your head so to keep that pretty head on your shoulders you keep it down what youve seen already is good enough for me and should be for you play the silent wallflower in the corner if you want to but understand that right now computers are spilling out your life story when i come back with your biography i want you here no more silly buggers with explanations first light caught the beds of flowers with colours laid in tightset banks and above them were canopies of spring blossom she had clasped her hands together made a stirrup for his shoe taken his weight then heaved him up so that he could straddle the top of the fence separating the empty car park of the conference centre from the botanical garden and she had waved him off towards dense shrubs her questions in the car on the drive through the city had gone unanswered he had been shaken awake in the car a few minutes after he had given her the name and street where the hotel was then they had gone slowly down steindamm and had seen men hurry out through the doors carrying the clothes he had left there and the bag they had shouldered past two girls looking for the last trade of the night and one had had a mobile at his face he had not been able to answer the spray of questions because to have done so would mean reliving the pain of his disgrace he could not yet confront it the low point down in a gutter of slime and shit was deepset agony since he had taken the train to london months before he had not known a friendship tight enough for him to confide in a dog did not go after so hard a kicking back in search of love shed called after him as hed sloped towards deeper shadows did you hear me i want some talk out of you no more of wasting my bloody time hidden from the main path by the bushes he sat on a bench and the wind flaked blossom petals down on him they lingered on his hair face and shoulders he doubted he could fight her any more last thing as hed gone for cover shed yelled when im back ill have you stripped as bare as the day you were born believe it ill be getting more than your blood group religion and your damn number try me chapter fourteen its quite a read your life isnt it she gazed at him her mouth set the eyes behind the spectacles were big and seemed to bore into him malachy looked away from her and thats only the digest that ive been sent i suppose when the whole lot of it spews up it gets worse i dont look for sympathy he muttered wouldnt have thought where youre coming from there were too many barrowloads of pity can you talk about it im not a shrink dont know about couch therapy shed found him in a squaredoff sunken area on the edge of the japanese garden a feeble fountain trilled a spray down into a stonebanked pool and its drops mingled with the rain the blossom snow covered his shoulders and the cobbles round his feet and had begun to form a covering on her hair they were together on a bench and the wind was in the trees but they were protected from it by the high shrubs that encircled them he felt a sharp spasm of anger i dont go scavenging for a shoulder to cry on for a simple reason i dont give explanations for what happened for what i did i dont know what happened thats a good enough line in your boots id stick with it hear me again i dont know what happened everybody else does but not me they called you a coward she seemed to roll the word on her tongue as if it were strange to her not a word she had used before beyond her experience but she said it with a boldness coward like it was of no importance to her if he were hurt by the word my boss has dug it up seems there were other descriptions of you but all end up in the same locker coward were they correct in their assessment i dont know thats not just soap and water to wash it out its what im tagged with but i dont know why miss wilkins do you not just go and find something else to do her face which had been cold chilled further her voice had edge i am trying to make a decision that involves you do i spend time with you do i dump you and walk away my work is on a short fuse of opportunity and i am loath to waste the few opportunities available to me in semantic bloody sparring with you i work at vbx and malachy said i know whats at vauxhall bridge cross havent been there but people from the place came to us she flared learn please not to damn well interrupt me i am wet through tired and hungry and i am tasked for reasons that have sodall to do with you to investigate timo rahman godfather brothelowner and peopletrafficker what do i find i find on hour one a guy in dossers gear hanging on rahmans security fence with the dogs of hell trying to pull him off it and the dosser is a former brit officer whom i then learn has enough disgrace on his back to bury him this guy is now a fox no cover to run to with the hounds baying and bloody horns tooting whats extraordinary about the fox hes put his head over the wall and gone into the hounds kennelyard that is either deathwish stupidity or courage based on purpose are you going to help me make my decision if it were easy dont wriggle get honest for gods sake look at me her arm snaked out her wet hand snatched at his chin her fingers caught the flesh and her nails pressed on his jawbone she twisted his face towards hers he blinked but did not try to break her grip are you worth any of my time or not two sorts of bravery that i can think of physical blokes jumping out of aeroplanes running across open ground chucking hand grenades at pillboxes doing boys games stuff dont know but id reckon thats the easy bit try the next one moral standing against the flow not crossing to the other side of the road to avoid involvement being your own person going into timo rahmans garden is bravery but i dont know which do i stay or do i dump you i give you my word youll get no sympathy from me tell it like it was not all the crap about iraq and what you were called and how far you fell but what brought you here tell it straight he felt the grip on his chin and jawbone slacken her spectacles had misted and the blossom flakes obscured her penetrating gaze malachy began haltingly as if a great shyness enveloped him to tell a story of an old lady widow of a london transport bus driver who had gone to bingo alone but it was not for her it was for me it was to be able to stand and not back away confront and not flinch im not proud just get on with it she said he told her about a pyramid where the vagrants were at the base and about the high fly boys who were the next stratum up a manhunt fanned out across streets parks hotels churches clubs and pavement cafes to search for the owner of a brown fleck overcoat the target area was the city where a fortress had been built in the ninth century on the instructions of ludwig the pious son of charlemagne at the junction of the alster bille and elbe rivers an army of men was mobilized all of ethnic albanian origin and had the common factor of loyalty to the fis the clan headed by the absolute authority of timo rahman ignorant of history driven by obedience to timo rahman men were briefed by the kryetar the underbosses and were directed to smaller squares on the city map where they should seek a prey in charge of each crew of not more than ten men was a chef that morning the codes and disciplines of distant albanian villages settled on the streets of hamburg word passed to the smallest groups that a cheap hotel on the steindamm had yielded up the remnants of the fugitives clothes and a description taken from a terrified tunisian at his reception desk was given them the hauptbahnhof was watched and the passengers leaving on inter city express trains were checked men stood idly by the ticket machines at ubahn and sbahn stations they were at the checkin counters of the airport and at the terminus for longdistance buses it was as if a foreign virus spread in the veins of a great city among the hunting packs spread out across the length and breadth of hamburg from poppenbuttel in the north and to maschen in the south from eidelstadt in the west and mummelmannsberg in the east there was desperate enthusiasm for success to win the praise of the pate timo rahman and his gratitude a kryetar directed a chef to work his crew along the length of the park the planten und blumen that crew five of them who were all from a remote village close to the macedonian border made a line across the gardens with their chef on the central path they were house thieves skilled pickpockets and pimps and they made slow careful progress from the parks st pauli end they knew nothing of the heritage or history of the city around them prosperity wealth opportunity made a flame that attracted moths they were from the immigrant masses that had surged inside the city welcomed at first because they provided the menial labour force they had later become detested when they changed the nature and culture of hamburg only timo rahman the power and the untouch able had the authority to stage a search of such magnitude to cast a net of that width none knew why a man had so crossed the pate that hundreds hunted him the crew with their chef all dreaming of the reward of success moved through the park passed the great justice building where thieves pickpockets and pimps were sentenced and the walls of the remand gaol where they were held before conviction none looked at the court or the prison as the rain poured down on them they hunted a man you are joking ricky is this some sort of windup he swung his legs over the side and dropped down on to the pontoon i tell you where i am ricky i am inside a damn great harbour with a damn great sea wall protecting it and we are still being blown half out of the bloody water what youre saying ricky its not a starter he held the mobile to his face and used his other hand to steady himself against the boats side the pontoon shuddered under his boots the rest of them on the boat were inside the old wheelhouse scraping seventyyearold wood to make it ready for the first coat of varnish harry rogers alone on the pontoon where only an idiot would be shouted into the phone im down in the west theres no possibility of putting to sea because theres a depression settled in and going to be there for a week im working with mates on a restoration theres storms forecast all week not just down here the north seas as bad maybe worse its out of the question sorry and all that the wind bent in arcs the rigging his friends had already replaced on the beam trawler whose hull had been laid down in a yard across the harbour now gone and replaced by holiday apartments in he had not bought into the syndicate owning the boat because it was fully subscribed and his ambition was bigger one day he would have his own across the harbour spray burst over the sea wall against the pontoon the ropes holding the boat groaned in the swell i tell you this ricky for nothing no ones out not even the fish not here not in the approaches not in irish waters absolutely not in the north sea try listening to the forecast dont take my word listen to the bloody shipping forecast where are you dont you have a radio there oh youre in germany oh itll be no different there not on their north sea coast could be bloody worse frankly the rain spattered on his face it ran from his slicked hair and down his cheeks because he had been inside the wheelhouse when the phone had rung he had not had his waterproofs on but it was ricky on the phone and hed come running from the earshot of the other men im not being difficult ricky never have been and wont start now im telling it like it is steady of course i know what youve done for me steady on ricky listen i deal in facts well what you want and whats on the weather forecast just happen to be two different things im not being difficult when was i ever he had blustered his protests in the wind and in the rain out on the pontoon that lifted and fell under him harry rogers had known that in the end push coming to shove he would buckle he would bend as the rigging did in the wind youre not telling me whats so important no of course not best i can do ricky is to get up there tonight load up sail on the night tide youll give me the coordinates on the vhf have to be good enough wont it i dont know how long itll be no i am not giving you shit ricky youre looking at twofifty nautical miles and therell be waves over the top of us well make what speed we can no im not saying youre shouting ricky been good to talk as it always is yes and you too you look after yourself he heard the call cut the purr in his ear and put the phone into his pocket he slid back on to the old trawlers deck went into the wheelhouse and lied about something having come up that required his attention at home on the quay as he walked into the force of the weather he rang his son and found him in a supermarket endured the disbelief then called his grandson if you obstruct me and refuse permission for the cameras which you are entitled to do citing a violation of humanrights legislation then i make a promise to you the affairs of your company a travel agency yes will undergo a most detailed inspection from the revenue it would be the type of inspection that you would find both time consuming and expensive in your accountants fees and it is from my experience inevitable that irregularities in your financial affairs will be exposed or you can choose not to obstruct me but to welcome my technicians to your home and allow them to fit cameras johan konig sat in the back office of the travel agencys flagship premises back in berlin he had learned that the kaisers of the industrial and commercial world had a fear only of excessive attention from fiscal investigators nothing fazed them but the nightmare of tax people rooting in their affairs i am sure you are aware that the revenue are often clumsy in their dealings with businessmen to whom a reputation of probity is important carrying out computers and files when the front hall of a workplace is crowded with customers attracting inevitable attention on the pavement with the damage that creates is often their way i would much regret us going up that route he eyed the man sitting across the desk from him and playing with a pencil konig would sleep that night as he had for the previous week in a police hostel for single men in a month perhaps if time had permitted it he would hope to find two furnished rooms in a street well back from the lake in st georg the man spiralling his pencil over the desk lived in a mansion in blankenese and probably banked in a week what a policeman of konigs rank earned in a year he despised such men a warning ingratiating yourself with your neighbour might be tempting but it would not be wise if you were foolish enough to provide information to him concerning cameras and directional microphones that we put in place then and this is my second promise you will face imprisonment for probably seven years seven years in fuhlsbuttel gaol is a long time to reflect on a warning ignored you tell your family what you care to but the responsibility for secrecy is yours seven years the man who owned a prosperous travel agency nodded pathetic acquiescence he was told that a delivery van would bring the equipment and a time later in the day was fixed for it the business was done konig left the premises he could not quite identify the mistake made by timo rahman but he believed it existed when it had been identified it could be manipulated later back at headquarters a surveillance request would be drafted and would go to a magistrate and the necessary paragraph of justification would describe activities of a flasher a potential molester of women in a residential sidestreet in blankenese and it would go through on the nod it surprised him when he reached his office that there was no message for him reporting the progress of the british intelligence officer in unravelling the fugitives story what he did hear in fulsome detail was that every crew of albanian footsoldiers scoured the citys streets for a quarry she did not interrupt she sat close to him no longer smelt his clothes or his body i left him there he was all trussed up on the lamp post and there was no chance of him breaking the knots and hed the tape half a dozen times round his face he couldnt shout i put the toy gun back into my pocket picked up what was left of the rope and the tape and went home i didnt feel good felt sort of flat sort of empty in my mind id this picture of a ladder and i was two rungs up it and that was still nothing didnt feel id done anything knew it wasnt enough there was this guy dont even think about it because im not telling you and you wont learn about him from me he knew the way the pyramid was built above the pushers is the dealer up higher than the dealer is the supplier the dealer didnt give me what i needed thought i needed she could watch the main path through the garden from the bench in the sunken area through a gap in the surrounding bushes and through the light cloud of falling blossom she saw them i was told who supplied the estates dealer i went after him went with a canister of petrol i suppose in terms of conscience i could square it but not easily i didnt think i was an avenging angel couldnt have said that what i did was the redemption road the supplier was a target and i needed a bigger and better target than a dealer an older man swarthy and short was on the path and another walked on a thinly seeded space of grass to his right but the older man made gestures to his left as if he directed more men who were under his command two joggers went past the older man but he seemed not to notice them swarthy as if they were tanned from old exposure to the mediterranean sun and slight the same complexions and the same build as the men who had carried clothes from the hotel doorway on steindamm she had told malachy kitchen that a price was on his head the supplier had this house out in the country would have been worth near a million im not ashamed of what i did but i took no pleasure from it the family werent there i broke a window and spilled petrol inside she saw the older man use his arm and fingers to point into the shrub bed above the small cobbled garden with the pond where they were where they sat on the bench and she heard an answering cry but did not know the language i slopped the carpet and curtains with the stuff then i threw a match on to polly wilkins officer of the secret intelligence service a wellbroughtup girl whose mother had lectured her as a teenager never to be easy reached up two hands took his face in them felt the roughness of unshaven cheeks and gulped kiss me the petrol god it caught half burned my face and do it you bloody fool she hissed kiss me she could have laughed on his face was shock then bewilderment then a sort of naked terror he had no idea why she pulled him closer her lips on his face but he screwed his mouth away not for fun idiot do it like you mean it he softened maybe he had heard now a heavy breath spurt behind his shoulder maybe he had heard the snap of a dead twig under a shoe she did it like she meant it lips on lips she had her eyes almost closed as if passion gripped her and she saw a younger man hovering in the bushes and gazing down on her she thought he was coming closer she screwed her tongue between the teeth she growled at him use your bloody hands he did like she was precious might break his hands came up and caught her shoulders and he pulled her nearer him two rainsodden bodies entwined and his mouth was opened wider and her tongue could roam more fully god and the taste of his mouth was foul and his clothes stank polly wilkins had not tonguekissed a man since that pathetic creep dominic had flown to buenos aires had near forgotten how to the man standing above her with the bushes waist high around him watched and then there was a shout from where the main path would have been and the rustle of his feet as he moved away he might look back she kept her tongue in place and let the hands hold her shoulders when the voices were distant low she broke away and gasped dont get any bloody ideas the colour flooded his skin under the bristle growth on his cheeks no theyd have had you she said with emphasis as if the explanation was important she rattled on did you know how badly you stink no you wouldnt right where were we i fired the suppliers home perhaps a million pounds of it you said but i took no pleasure from it right right the laughter burst in polly didnt seem to me you took much pleasure from whats just happened im grateful to you dont please bloody thank me that i cannot take she stiffened touched her hair smoothed her skirt and eased away from him where were we yes we were into assault probably grievous bodily harm and weve just hit arson whats next malachy she could have bitten the tongue that had been far into his mouth he winced she thought she had wounded a man already hurt and down damage done she did not apologize what she knew of malachy kitchen had come in a terse onepage signal from gaunt that was bald and without humanity it would have been easier for her to sit as judge and jury on him if he had made a callow admission of guilt or had writhed behind a catalogue of mitigation he had said i dont know what happened everybody else does but not me shed thought he spoke the truth she had tapped into vulnerability and she felt ashamed of her laughter polly said quietly you burned down the home of a supplier but you were still short of satisfaction what had happened to you everything conspired to goad you forward as if malachy youre on a treadmill but they always go faster dont they treadmills so who is above the supplier i had a name given me ricky capel of bevin close thats southeast london he was the importer going there thats climbing higher she said bleakly higher than most would have going there got me a kicking she saw for the first time a smile rueful uncertain crack his cheeks and she listened and believed she could comprehend the burden of shame that had driven him she thought it past the time for laughter and for goading him he told the story of it with detachment as if another man had been kicked in the face and she could taste the stale scent of his mouth i really appreciate this mr rahman ricky capel babbled i gave my word to my grandfather to old percy that id come here hes never been himself but it was important to him that i came they were his friends could have been him if they hadnt shipped him out the squadron and sent him to egypt im grateful youve taken the time there was a shrug and a wallet was produced money was passed to him and ricky ducked his head in thanks he chose from the flowerseller at the gates two bunches of red roses each with a halfdozen blooms in the car he sat in the back seat and water ran from the roses stems on to his trouser leg he looked around him and saw the high mature trees of the cemetery and the banks of rhododendrons couldnt say when it had last happened to him and it was not a mood he liked but he felt moved by the great quiet of the place he had not been to a cemetery since his grandmother winifred had been buried and it had pissed with rain and his best suit had never been right afterwards and he hadnt cared about her death because the old woman had loathed him he thought this place lovely the bear stopped the car ricky climbed out but rahman waved for him to leave the flowers on the seat which confused him but he followed rahman they walked to a wide space among the trees where long grass made a cross with a square highwalled building at its heart there were no markers here of individual graves not like hed seen on tv each of the grassed lengths he reckoned was at least a hundred yards long whats this then rahman said sarcastic it is what the friends of your grandfather did ricky it is where german people are they died from the bombs when the raf made the firestorm the air burned prisoners from a concentration camp dug the pits and there are more than forty thousand souls buried here in one week more than forty thousand well nazis werent they i expect some ricky were children he grinned well going to be nazis werent they he gazed around him couldnt really comprehend it not forty thousand people killed burned up in one week at the car he was passed his roses and they walked across the aisle road and down a neat pathway then it was like he had seen on tv he faced rows of white stones set in careful lines bloody beautiful and clumps of flowers growing in little areas no weeds in front of each he had never been to a place like it and so quiet he said what the names were old percys friends and he took one sector and rahman another and the driver a third part and the stones were all so clean like theyd been there since last week and not the best part of sixty years it made him shiver thinking of it men in a plane and all that flak hitting it and the plane starting to dive out of control and not able to get out and coming down from three and a half miles up how long would that bloody take made him feel kind of weak all of them heroes werent they could he have hacked it yes sure certain he was ricky capel but the shiver and the weakness had come on bad and he was swaying on his feet the shout came rahman had found them the only ones of the crew who had been intact enough for identification two stones side by side a wirelessoperators grave and a bombaimers grave and theyd both been friends of his grandfather he never did photographs and had never owned a camera cameras and pictures to ricky were the crime squad and the criminal intelligence service if he went and it was rare to a wedding hed spend half the reception making bloody certain he was not in a photograph that no camera was aimed at him would have been nice to have a picture to take back to old percy though one of them had been twenty years old and one was nineteen and there were pansies and daffodils in front of the two stones he stood in front of them pulled in his stomach and straightened his spine and the rain fell on him rahman was on the phone which didnt help the dignity of it the uppers of his shoes were wet from the grass and his trousers clung to him a full minute he stood there and rahman came off one call then took another then doing it for his grandfather he laid the roses in front of each stone in remembrance of a wirelessoperator and a bombaimer dead in the first week of august stepped away and felt good for what hed done as they walked back to the car ricky said i expect mr rahman youre proud to be albanian and im proud to be british youll love your country mr rahman as i love mine mad isnt it you come to a place like this and youre proud daft isnt it how a place like this gets to you dont mind saying it i love my country no one in twentysix months had come to seek her out she lived in southeast central england in a town best known for its budgetcost airport and motormanufacturing industry luton with a population of her home was with her parents who had come two decades before to britain to escape the brutal ravages of political oppression in the libyan city of benghazi that she had been born a healthy vigorous baby had been by chance her father had often told her her mother had been two months pregnant with her when the thugs of the regimes secret police had come to their home and beaten each of her parents in turn on suspicion of handing out leaflets of protest at the godless rule of gaddafi blows from boots and batons had been used against her mothers belly her father once a teacher of philosophy at the university of benghazi worked in luton on a production line manufacturing windscreen wipers for vans and lorries through childhood and her teenage years she had harboured hate for any who rejected the true faith of islam she had been chosen at a mosque in the town her fervour had been recognized a video had been shown in a back room to a selected few of what the imam called the declaration of a martyr widow a chechen woman clothed in black and veiled had worn the belt holding the explosives the wiring and the trigger button and had made a statement to the camera of her happiness at gaining the chance to strike against the russian enemy who had murdered her young husband she had spoken not in a language understood in the mosques back room in a voice of calm love and resolve the film had continued with a distant street shot a slight small figure in black had approached a checkpoint of soldiers and when she reached them there had been the detonation fire smoke and chaos at that moment the woman in luton had stood before the video ended and cheered in exultation in admiration at the blessing of martyrdom now she never watched such videos and was never invited to the back room of the mosque she worked in a creche with children too young for school while their mothers stood in lines and manufactured pvc windows she was good with the children and her employers praised her dedication and she waited a man would come either to her home or to the creche one day he would say and he sends down hail from mountains in the sky and he strikes with it whomever he wills and turns it from whomever he wills she would answer the vivid flash of its lightning nearly blinds the sight his statement and hers were in the book five days a week she played with and amused small children and at the end of each day she was thanked by mothers for her kindness and devotion when he came she would slip away from the creche and would do what was asked of her what we cannot accept freddie is a further failure of course not the meeting between frederick gaunt and the assistant deputy director took a familiar choreography he paced as he talked and the add gilbert stayed awkwardly hunched at his desk quite simply put a new failure would be intolerable of course rain laced on the window and the desk light failed to lift the gloom it just cannot be countenanced freddie im on board bodies crammed in morgues mutilated victims stacked on corridor trolleys waiting for doctors the shock and trauma of blood on the pavements without reservation i accept that a major atrocity in our cities is not acceptable no argument he saw a splash of surprise on his superiors face then annoyance that the obvious drift of the argument had not been interpreted no no freddie take that as read he leaned forward and jabbed his finger for emphasis at the moving target gaunt striding i am talking dont you follow me about the effect of a new failure on us difficult times we live in it is as if we are under siege the reputation of the service is at stake there are corners of whitehall in which our efforts firstclass efforts are derided there are freddie enemies at large and they wait for one more cockup forgive me on the scale of iraq we are perpetually scrutinized surely freddie you see that if there were to be a new failure its we who would be the victims i dont exaggerate there would be another weeding out and we would face desperate times oh yes there was a shrill laugh from the desk you know freddie for a moment i didnt think you understood the true seriousness of the danger to the integrity dignity of the service forgive me have you all you need computer time at menwith too low on the priority list do i want a galleyload of young turks bustling around me no do i want berlin in on the act no do i want a full charabanc sent from london to sit on polly wilkins in whom i have complete faith no what i want is luck buckets of it that is hardly a satisfactory shopping list freddie very frankly are you up for this one was he wasnt he he wondered briefly whether selfishness and a personal pride in his ability caused him to reject the battalions of help on offer word of any sections success always eddied through the building crossed the needtoknow fences erected for internal security and the men and women responsible for secret triumphs achieved an heroic status and rank envy damned if he would pass up the chance damned if he would share gaunt said airily never been more confident gilbert its falling nicely into place but you promised me with the prague business you talked of a rat run that youd interrupt just a blip gaunt said he turned for the door then paused i anticipate we will finish this one in good shape in the corridor he found that sweat dribbled on his skin deer were culled by rifle shots foxes by poison and rats by gas birds of prey by the teeth of post traps he mopped his forehead with his breastpocket handkerchief and pondered it how would they cull old warriors who had failed to protect the services reputation dump them on the street and let them walk away up the albert embankment with the carriage clock or decanter or a presentation box of tools airbrush them out of history and sweep them to retirement god he needed luck sacks of it he led the way into the office block and down the corridor inside each room that he passed which had the door open administration sales accounts the staff snapped to their feet he went through the swing doors and into the warehouse trailing timo rahman was the bear far behind the bear ignored was the mouseboy his feet rapped across the concrete flooring as he went down the wide aisle between towers of cardboardwrapped flatpacks at the aisles far end was the door to a store room where mops buckets and the chemicals for cleaning toilets were kept he had wasted an hour at the ohlsdorf cemetery to humour the mouseboy and more minutes than he had anticipated had been taken up in the search for names on stones a little of his certainty was gone as he pushed open the storeroom door and the image of his wife danced before him as it had all the time in the cemetery and what she had done to him the man sat on the plastic seat of a chair he looked up there was a calmness about him a presence timo rahman saw it recognized it the man put his hand on the table on which lay a cleaned plate and halffull plastic waterbottle and pushed himself to his feet the face of a man short of confidence would have cracked timo knew with relief but this one did not the man bowed his head gravely not in deference but in a gesture of courtesy to an equal timo introduced himself murmured his name but was not given a response instead the man moved the halfpace forward and kissed his cheeks questions were asked softly without preamble when would he move on soon one day or two was the transport in place arriving about to start its journey was the transport secure as secure as was possible a lesson timo rahman had learned over many years was that conversation idle and unnecessary between men of stature was beneath dignity he said that bedding would be provided that the location provided safety and secrecy nothing more he left the man and the bear closed the door then he saw the mouseboys gaping eyes and his sleeve was pulled is that him no man snatched the sleeve of timo rahmans shirt his life was myriad compartments each sealed from the other each carried in his mind behind him the door had closed on a compartment and another replaced it the new compartment was his wife his home an intruder a lover for a flashed moment there was a blurred line between the compartments he squeezed hard on ricky capels hand held it in his tightening fist removed it from his sleeve then let it drop he thought then that the mouseboy was too stupid to recognize that anger it is were bringing the boat over for that one man he that man what is he an arab he is the passenger on your boat were talking big money he doesnt look big money i am paid to move him as you will be he started to walk away down the aisle of the warehouse and ahead of him were the swing doors to the corridor and the offices of administration sales and accounts again the fingers because the mouseboy was stupid held him at the wrist where the goldchain bracelet was what im asking mr rahman who is he you need to know nothing of him you have only to transport him for you mr rahman i move a gang of girls get them to enver or a lorry full of chinese kurds whatever but one arab a boat coming for one man thats different you will do what you are paid to do timo softened his voice the better to hide his anger it is not a difficulty ill tell you why its different hes a scumbag not a businessman not anything normal that i move for you whys he so important that were not taking him through dover or harwich whys he not going into heathrow or manchester whys he got a bloody boat coming just for him an arab dressed like a wreck i know why hes important it does not concern you ricky like a fly that flew at his ear the pitch was more shrill a packet no problem a packet and youve no problem with me money on the nail good dealing between us this mr rahman is out of order you saw those headstones this morning i saw them laid flowers for them its my country an arab cant go through an airport or a ferryport has to have a boat sent to bring him you think im a right fool mr rahman that scumbags a terrorist i dont want to know not about shifting a terrorist he pushed open the swing doors into the corridor it was the skill of timo rahman the core of his success as he believed it that problems were anticipated and fallback positions were in place he swung his arm like a friend round the mouseboys shoulders could have kicked him there half to death could have broken his neck with the heel of his hand said quietly i ask nothing of you ricky that you are not at ease with i do not pressure you but i listen to you we are comrades ricky as long as thats understood everything is understood they went out into the rain and all the time timo rahmans arm was like a friends round ricky capels shoulders he thought she had waited with patience for the story to run its course malachy ploughed on to its end i didnt have petrol didnt have a weapon didnt have a plan i was just driven forward i went right up to the house the yawn split her face and they were talking about a shipment drugs i suppose she stifled it but the yawns last heave muffled her voice i think im there im sorry malachy for what happened to you but its not my corner to stand in drugs movements they dont interest you i dont do drugs half a hundred agencies do but its not why im here theyre going to ship them out from an island its called baltrum dont know where it is ill find a map theyve a boat coming you go careful its the finish of the road for me i reckon there i can screw the man the importer and then im about through with it will you have gone far enough along the road dont know to be honest with you dont know whether it is he said weakly i think its all i have well ill be getting along she said brusquely and she stood and looked down at him if you reckon that buggering up one shipment of heroin or cocaine is the dogs bollocks ill not argue with you what does that add up to a tenth of one per cent of the capitals supply for a month about that you tell yourself that youve made a difference and get back to the real world malachy good luck she walked away he watched her as she slipped to the path and the heaviness of her sodden coat seemed to bow her she walked on the carpet of fallen blossom and through the puddles and the wind threw back her hair he thought the roughness of her last words was a veneer she too was fragile he sensed that at the last frustration had spilled through her she had given him most of a day had brought him out of a police cell had snatched him away from the home of timo rahman and her reward had been a mumbled location for a transfer of drugs peering after her on his feet he saw her as a diminishing figure under the prison wall at the boundary of the gardens yes as vulnerable as him and he felt her tongue and the warmth of her i dont do drugs her time with him had been wasted and before he finally lost sight of her her stride had lengthened and then she was gone he went to find a map that would tell him where the island was chapter fifteen he walked and could have dropped without the strength and tread of his shoes he would long ago have stopped and sunk down to a bench beside a pavement he had a sandwich in him sausage and chilli and the bulk of a map bulged his hip pocket he had gone east from the city behind him were the proud places of the city and its shamed corners the outer and inner alster lakes the rathaus the new city and the old city the warehouse quarter and the former docks where cranes now lifted building materials for apartment blocks over bridges and alongside canals and through satellite communities housed in high towers under autobahn routes using threatening pedestrian tunnels but at kirchsteinbek with the map unfolded and his finger tracing the route he turned south and he thought the danger of the city receded ahead of him now were scattered villages small towns and fields drainage channels excavated geometrically across them the map guided him bare poplar trees tops bent in the wind made aisles for him along straight roads he passed a modern gaol wall set back on his left and the light had gone down enough for the arclights to shine out brilliantly the map told him that soon he would swing his course to the west there was a memorial stone set in the grass short of the prison perimeter but his eyes were too exhausted and his attention too dulled for him to read its inscription in the growing darkness beyond the gaol a track led to low buildings and beside the road set among the poplars was the sign kz gedenkstatte neuengamme and below it was a second sign directing visitors to a museum and exhibition centre before the prison there had been traffic on the straight endless road but none after it the buildings what remained of a concentration camp seemed isolated malachy went faster struggled to lengthen his step and his shoes stamped out on the roads tarmac he wondered who came here and why were there still lessons for learning hallucinations delved in his mind did men in vertical striped pyjama suits which hung on fleshless bodies watch the tramp of a lone figure on the road did he smell the smoke that curled from a high brick chimney did he hear the trap of a gallows sprung and the rattle of shots if he could have run he would have he did not have it in his limbs to hurry and the sights and sounds of the fantasy played in him till he was far beyond the shadows of the place malachy kitchen lived ghosts had died there starved and died fallen from exhaustion at a work site and died had been dragged to a noose and had died or had been forced down to kneel in a grave pit and had died he saw no selfpity and heard no cry for mercy he lived far away behind his back was the evening glow of a city with orange light bouncing off low clouds where men searched for him at the end of the road was the elbe river and a bridge across it was a bus shelter where two elderly ladies waited they eyed him with acute suspicion the stubble was on his face his clothes hung wet on his body his breath came in pants and he sagged down on to a seat beside them they shifted from him as far as was possible and held their handbags tight in their gloved fists he thought of the young woman who to save him had kissed his mouth and he thought of the last young woman he had tried to kiss she had turned away from him flinched from him he asked them where the bus went they were in their best as if they had visited family or friends the bus went to seevetal was there a railway station at seevetal they showed no willingness to engage in conversation with the vagrant who shared their shelter there was a railway station there where did the trains go to from seevetal they sniffed in unison as if he disgusted them to hamburg rotenburg and bremen malachys head dropped the tiredness came in waves across him he thought of two young women one had turned her face from him one had kissed him and he dreamed the sharp jab of a bony elbow woke him and he walked behind them to board the bus in his mind was only pain and the sight of the one young woman his wife january for gods sake dont you understand anything no way was i going to traipse down to brize norton what did you think i was going to do hold up a bloody banner on the apron welcome home to my hero dont you know what youve done to me the doorbell rang he might at least have shown some fight but he played what they called him a gutless bastard and denied nothing just said each and every time that he didnt know what had happened in denial that was what her father had said on the phone when roz had called him an hour ago denying it because he couldnt face what hed done and her father had said he was right behind his girl for not meeting the aircraft in from basra the doorbell rang again as if this time a finger was on the button and staying there it was now eight days on the corpss calendar in the kitchen since it had happened whatever it was and six days since the gossip mill in alamein drive had produced the whisper hed come home the afternoon before like a rat running with a train warrant and a taxi from bedford station hed tried to kiss her when hed dumped his bag down no bloody chance explanations were what shed demanded but all shed had was the whimper that he didnt know what had happened like that was supposed to be enough for her the bloody bell kept ringing it had all been explained to her in the secretariat while hed been on the train and coming home resignation would be best and then a quiet departure no future the papers would be sent round god there were some hateful bitches in alamein drive so shed entertained a couple of guys what was the big deal just jerry and algy and maybe theyd stayed till late or was it early didnt half the bitches entertain a friend when the husband was away if hed fought roz could have believed him all that last evening she had followed him round the house and demanded to know if it were true was he her husband a gutless bastard doors slamming behind him hed retreated but shed followed through the kitchen the dining room the sitting room out into the garden where the whole bloody world of alamein drive would hear her yelled question but not the answer shed slept in her bed hed used the sittingroom sofa shed shopped that morning every curtain in alamein drive twitching as shed gone to the car and twitching again when shed come back and offloaded the plastic bags like it was she who had done it right bloody entertaining for me my husband called a coward i dont suppose you thought of that maybe if hed hit her it would have been better he was slumped at the kitchen table and he winced each time she attacked she spun she crossed the hall rozs dad retired sergeant a man who had spent the best part of his service in ditches in ireland knowing that if a farmers dog located him it was down to a browning mm automatic to stop him being bloody tortured then slotted by the provos her dad had said on the phone that her room was all shipshape at home for her that she should ditch the useless bastard the padre who doubled as the welfare officer and wanted everyone to call him luke was at the door she said curtly yes luke good to see you before you ask is it convenient no the old fart had papers in his hands shuffled them in his fingers brought these round and i wanted to know how he was she did it mockbrightly a little flutter in her voice hes fine nothing wrong with him quite himself why shouldnt he be sort of everyday thing isnt it being labelled as a runner a copout a coward hes in good shape im very sorry i doubt youre half as sorry as me hell have to go no choice but to resign his commission its not something you can come back from i wish it were marked with it yes it could be said mrs kitchen that a little too much revelry went on here in his absence frankly thats what i heard from major arnold he was quite distressed but thought he ought to tell me if mal had heard about them your visitors then that might account for a poor performance in a combat situation he would only have heard such lies luke if bloody nosy sods had passed them on is that right only over her dead body was the padre entering her home roz stood square in the doorway a woman nearly opposite had found a reason to visit her wheelie dustbin another woman down the drive had come out of her home with a brush and started sweeping her path be a bloody shame when their entertainment ended but shed be gone before the next day broke he was flushed and had a twitch at the side of his chin he rubbed a mole there with the hand holding the papers i have to say mrs kitchen that i was monumentally disappointed to hear of this i thought mai a firstclass officer but we are all subject to errors of judgement when assessing colleagues actually i appreciate your discomfort its not easy for any of us when a man falls short of expected standards wearing my welfare hat ive brought his resignation form which has already been countersigned by the colonel so hell need to do that theres an afo that i am formally delivering it requires this marriedquarter to be vacated within ninetythree days but better sooner rather than up to the deadline its a wretched shame mrs kitchen trouble is that you cannot go back on life and patch up mistakes it goes without saying that it would be better for all concerned if mai stayed away from the mess she snatched the papers from him ill tell him excuse me mrs kitchen what ive said to you has been oneonone not for repeating i wouldnt want wouldnt want to join the backs tabbers she spat at him savagely no theres enough of them already youd have to be in the queue dont lose sleep over it luke because youd be behind me in the line roz turned away the padres parting shot had a worried whine in it hell need a deal of love and some care he wont get that from me she kicked the door shut behind her he was standing three paces from her in the sittingroom doorway so he had learned what she thought of him so he had heard what was his future not her fault none of it was roz kitchens fault he took the papers from her not a word and scrawled his signature and she slumped buried her head and wept she heard the stamp of those damn great heavy shoes on the stairs then the sounds of him moving in the bedroom she heard him call for a taxi to be at the main gate in an hour she felt no love and doubted he would find it anywhere she had written her signal interminably long but everything that she had been told and had transmitted it then she had flopped on to the campbed polly wilkins slept dreamless she was curled on the top blanket and below her the sounds of the consulate and its business went unheard the phone woke her she started up did not know where she was darkness had gathered in the room the wind heaved at the tiles and the rain pounded against the one small window she groped towards the phone banged her shin on the desk edge and swore yes who is it polly she heard gaunts voice sharp in her ear yes me polly i sing your praises to that venal idiot aloft upstairs i said this morning i had complete faith in you he wanted berlin on the road to hamburg double damn fast i declined that offer were you asleep yes afraid i was would you say polly that i was always honest with you she sighed deep spit it out mr gaunt there was a pause she heard the silence on the line she wondered if he was tilted back in his chair if he had straightened his tie first and she waited to be punched id say polly that you fucked up a bit harsh i dont think so yes thats being honest in what way did i fuck up mr gaunt she asked control in her voice which suppressed her winded fury simple enough my dear put with greater politeness theres a boring old saying cant see the wood for the trees you heard a story an extraordinary one and then you rejected its relevance you were told about drugs importation and said to yourself thats off my bailiwick and discarded it you could not see in my humble opinion the wood for the trees your mans laudable but useless obsession with the narcotics trade is the trees but you missed a sight of the wood hear me a boat a remote shoreline a collection it was laid in your lap it was the information that i was confident enough youd find it was why i backed you she let the air seep from her lungs and hiss between her teeth yes mr gaunt i fucked up get there do i have the cavalry i rather think not better to keep it close oh yes whats he like the crusader rather sweet for a moment to the intimacy of the phone she giggled then cut it but damaged quite badly damaged she said with sincerity and capable have to be wouldnt he or he wouldnt have come this far he should be a bellwether to you a sheep that leads and others follow know what i mean that island polly is where you should be the phone purred in her ear the van in the driveway had a logo of an antenna on its side and below in printed paintwork the slogan better satellite tv reception throughout your residence two men carried boxes of equipment into the travel agents home he said to his wife i dont know what its for but they have me by the balls and if they twist it will hurt the rahmans are only new rich unimportant to us his wife said they stood in the hall their children dismissed to their bedrooms and watched the boxes taken past them up the stairs and left on the landing the two men came down again went outside and returned with a collapsible ladder and tools the loft hatch in the ceiling above the landing was opened and they manoeuvred the boxes through the gap he said they are from the organizedcrime unit they would make bad enemies the worst the rahmans are albanians we owe them nothing later one of the men came down went again to the van and returned with two galvanized buckets the travel agent asked him why they were needed he was told matteroffact that two roof tiles would be moved from one hole there would be a view for the camera lens down on to the back garden of the adjacent home from the other there would be a view of the drive at the nextdoor house and the front door under the porch when rain dripped down between the shifted tiles the buckets would catch it he noted and she did that neither man had wiped his feet on the inside mat and that the dirt from their shoes had made a track up the stair carpet he did not complain nor did she because they have me by the balls and if they twist it will hurt neither dared to protest at the mess tramped into their home she held his arm what would happen to us if rahman knew what we have agreed to i thought of him as a businessman who had done well but he is the target of the organizedcrime unit any man in the city who read daily the hamburger abendblatt was familiar with the blood vendettas and feuds of the albanians and the viciousness of their response when crossed i dont know what would happen to us he lied later the men came down the stairs with their empty boxes and their ladder and one said that if the equipment worked satisfactorily they would be back within two weeks to change the batteries the travel agents wife now found halting courage what about the buckets if it rained and the forecast said it would for the next several days who would empty the buckets when they were full and overflowed but the men shrugged in disinterest they went out into the evening and left their trail of dirt behind them there was the crunch of tyres on the drive the act of betrayal of a neighbour was marked by the roar of a vacuumcleaner on the carpets of the hall stairs and landing and above the replaced hatch in the roof two lenses beamed down on the rahman house the club on the reeperbahn across the wide street from the dour brickbuilt police station was sandwiched between an italian restaurant and a shop now closed that sold sex aids the club advertised itself in neon as providing a bar dancing girls and kino booths for single or multiple occupancy timo rahman had acquired the club nine years before the last conscious act of its previous owner a russian from the dnieper region had been to sign away the deeds in the belief that the transfer would save his life with the ink not dry on the paper he had been clubbed then dragged out and thrown into the boot of his own car it had been driven to the quayside by the fish market as the effect of the clubbing had worn off he had kicked frantically at the tomb he was in as the car had been manhandled forward and had toppled into the oiled water the club now provided some four per cent of the annual turnover of the rahman empire you will enjoy the show ricky he said he treated the mouseboy as an honoured guest the best table the best view of the girls on the stage the best service he was an attentive host as a cosmetic blonde danced and her implanted bosom bounced he explained the history of the reeperbahn street the quarter where rope was made for the docks and the rigging of sailpowered trading ships but the mouseboy was distant from him seemed not to hear him and fidgeted with the stem of his glass when the girl naked now finished her dance and stood fullfrontal to accept the applause he smiled with warmth i am told by enver that you have bars at home ricky in london but i think they are different from those in hamburg let me show you what we offer he had raised an eyebrow the merest gesture the manager hovered close to him and passed a padded envelope to the bear the speciality of the club ricky is in the kino booths explicit videos in his own tongue he murmured a question to his manager heard out the reply and turned again to the mouseboy many customers are satisfied sufficiently to return here perhaps each year the one i would like to show you is being watched by a party of factory workers from essen where they make toothpaste they are always satisfied and come each march we should see what they are enjoying he led ricky capel followed and a pace behind was the bear with the envelope they crossed the bar and he held back a curtain they were in a corridor lined by doorways in which were set small glass windows he heard the baying laughter as his guest would have of the factory workers from essen he took his guest to the far door of the corridor the source of the laughter timo rahman peered through the window in the door he saw a dozen men in jeans and casual shirts some balding and some greyhaired some standing and some hunched forward on chairs all of them as they rocked in laughter gazing at the wide screen on the far wall the good boy his best nephew enver had said the video was high quality and the sound here ricky look and enjoy because the bear was behind him pressed against him his guest was nudged forward pushed close enough for his nose and eyes to be against the glass where he stood timo could see the screen he saw ricky capel flush his eyes widen around them in the corridor was a cacophony of laughter from the booth and the ever louder grunting from the girl on the screen she rode her man the mans head rolled swayed and he seemed to cry out but the noise of his little yell was drowned by the girls grunts he saw the curse slip from ricky capels lips but soundless more of the factory workers from essen stood and now they clapped in the rhythm of the girls down thrusts and some bent with laughter grunted with her as she did the bears weight was against ricky capel and he could not have extricated himself from the viewing window had he tried to on the screen in a crescendo she thrust down and he thrust up and now the grunting overwhelmed the laughter and the clapping then they both sagged she rolled off him and there was a long collective gasp of disappointment from the audience like a moan she moved from the cameras view and the mouseboy was left on the bed and in the moment before his stiffness fled him he reached up a kid at a football game who has scored a goal and punched the air the factory workers beat their hands together above their heads as if they were on the terraces of a stadium and the screen went black timo led them back up the corridor but he paused at the curtain he took the envelope from the bear and held it in front of his guest he let him read the address the envelope was large enough to take a video cassette and he had written on it mrs joanne capel bevin close london se england beside him ricky capel panted and the colour had gone from his face as if he was about to vomit i think ricky we do not have a problem no mr rahman we dont i think ricky it is unnecessary for that envelope to go in the post yes mr rahman ill take him i think ricky that always i knew i could depend on you thats right mr rahman a small low voice with its character hacked from it they went back into the bar where another girl danced where timo took the envelope from the bear and used the strength of his hands to rip it to many pieces you sure about this dad not happy son but sure on it he turned the key kickstarted the diesel the planking of the wheelhouse of the anneliese royal throbbed with the motion and the roar was in harry rogerss ears billy watched him for a moment then turned and pushed young paul outside they had done better time up from the west than hed anticipated had hammered in the car up the motorway and there was without anything to spare enough of the previous tide to get them out of the eastcoast harbour he saw below him from the side window his son and grandson working with the ropes one on the quayside loosening them and one furling them on the deck annie had said on the step as he had left home that just once once in his life he should have told his nephew ricky capel where to jump off and shed said and meant it that shed break his back if anything happened to the boy paul which was bloody daft because if anything happened to the boy out in those seas they were sailing into then it was short odds it would happen to all of them the ropes were done and harry edged them away from the quay going in reverse he throttled up power and black smoke spewed behind when theyd climbed on board the assistant harbourmaster had braved the wind and rain and come down from the sanctuary he shared with the coastguard and customs people probably bored out of his mind because no other boat was putting to sea that night harry had blustered that mortgage repayments on the anneliese royal didnt wait on the weather and had parried him with bullshit about being in place when the storm blew itself out good hunting hed been told and the assistant harbourmaster had run for shelter they moved towards the end of the groyne where the light flashed he could see from the wheelhouse the big plateglass window and could make out the small shapes of the assistant harbourmaster the duty coastguard and the customs woman who was doing the night shift theyd all have had their binoculars up but harry didnt see that because the rain ran rivers on the wheelhouse ricky capel had called him again and had given him coordinates for the german coast but had sounded sort of distant and had said its not a hundred per cent harry it may not happen just as likely youll get a cancel from me a good chance of a cancel but you get moving dont tell the world where youre headed if its a cancel ill call you on the mobile and turn you back itll probably be that a cancel but the cancel call hadnt come the old boys eighty years before going to sea in a beam trawler under sail power and taking on a force nine or ten fiftyknot wind speed had had a saying grumble you may but go you must he thought of them weather hardened and of the boat that would be his one day which they had gone to sea in she passed the end of the groyne where a solitary lunatic watched his fishingrod and left the safety of the harbour waves slashed against the anneliese royal lifted and dropped her my chief waited for you mr gaunt but hes gone now has a dinner this evening with home office fat cats i dont reckon wild horses would have pulled him off that for my chief a dinner with them is like a call to the sepulchre he asked me to hang on and see you see how we can help so im what youve g o t sorry about that im grateful to you detective sergeant i hope i havent mucked up your evening you havent and please call me tony fine tony could we set some ground rules official secrets act no notes taken conversation that didnt happen you know the game i dont want the party line just want it straight the way it is and dont ask me why i requested this meeting the subject of my interest is ricky capel aged thirtyfour married to joanne one son lives at nine bevin close thats south london on the east side they were in a chief superintendents office with beech panelling pastel slat blinds and photographs from courses of sitting and standing participants there was a picture of the office resident in uniform and shaking the hand of the grinning prime minister among the photographs there were shields presented by texan jordanian and brazilian police forces and the room was scrupulously tidy gaunt wondered balefully if as a visitor he should have removed his shoes before entering what was a refreshing relief the detective sergeant had pushed aside the leathertipped blotter and the crystal inkstand and had planted his backside on the desk immaculate as always in his suit and waistcoat with his tie over the collar button gaunt could recognize a worker ant a damned tired one he liked such men im assuming there are a hundred places youd rather be than here and ill try not to waste your time what is the single most important thing about ricky capel that hes never been nicked hes a big player why has he never been arrested and charged cunning not educated intelligent but clever doesnt overreach himself as easy as that a guy whos never been nicked each year he gets to be more careful cuts down on the risk factor but you target him the detective sergeant snorted almost derision gaunt liked that near streak of contempt for his question it was not the right place for him to pace and intimidate so he leaned back in the visitors chair swung his feet on to the desk and rested them beside the baggy flop of the policemans jacket he thought it would show a welcome disrespect for the high and mighty whose office it was how does he walk round you because were in the quickfix world focus groups and thinktanks rule us and they say that targets must be met must be we have a slop of money coming in here at criminal intelligence and theres budgets for crime squad and the organizedcrime people at the yard best way to justify the cash is to get results achieve those bloody targets what you dont do and its my chiefs bible is think longterm resources are allocated at targets where results can be guaranteed then my chief can go down the home office take a dinner and spiel out the statistics of success to go after a clever cunning bastard ricky capel takes cash manpower commitment with no promise of getting the handcuffs on him hes doing very nicely its what hed tell you theres all sorts of wars being fought at the moment and i reckon were losing the lot of them my war peopletrafficking for vice and the importation of narcotics is going down the plughole and fast not that my chief would tell you but we got it wrong and were losing is that out of order i wouldnt say so tony he asked with effortless casualness well practised what business would take ricky capel to hamburg he saw the policemans eyes flash and the rhythm with which he slapped his heels against the front of his chiefs desk was cut youre well informed mr gaunt why would he be there you know about albanians gaunt said easily i cast an eye over matters albanian from time to time the big hookup is with timo rahman godfather of that city supplier of the heroin that capel brings in i dont know the route used but rahman is the source the link goes back a long way right back to capels grandfather i read that in the file the grandfather thats percy capel did time in the war in albania and worked with a gang led by rahmans father thats where youd find what the link is percys an old thief and lives next door to capel not that hed give you the time of day no i dont suppose he would he knew more and it gave him little pleasure than the policeman could have told him about a boat supposedly coming to an island off the frisian coast of germany but that would have meant sharing it was gaunts habit to leech blood a oneway trade he lifted his shoes off the table and glanced with slight ostentation at his watch as if he had consumed enough of the detectives time i much appreciate you staying on and meeting me what im saying to you mr gaunt is that capels supping with the devil but for both of them its a mistake hows that weve learned it the albanians suck a man dry when he thinks theyre just partners then move in and ditch him the other side capel isnt in rahmans league of skills and on anything big he would be the weak leg an interesting observation ill let you get on home been grand meeting you but the man was not finished and gushed i tell you mr gaunt it pisses me off that were losing that capel and his like are winning weve the courts and the legislation and the prisons but were not filling them i could take you to an estate not much more than a mile from here where theres addicts and pushers who sell to them and dealers where theres old ladies who live behind barricades and in fear i dont suppose thats in your remit mr gaunt old ladies getting their arm broken for whats in a purse it seared in gaunts mind he recalled the long signal sent him by polly wilkins that detailed hours spent in the planten und blumen garden and what a man had told her it fell into place a man had tried to claw back his life by climbing a pyramid he offered no sign of it and stood very helpful youve been tony a last chore for you please see if theres anything in the capel file that might equate with a rat run you know a roundthehouses shortcut as an importation route any trace to a b o a t oh if i ever wanted to go to that estate probably very close to where i work and meet a pensioner who was mugged for her purse who would i go to see and where a slip of paper was taken from the chiefs desk notepad and the accompanying silvercoated pencil inscribed to a valued colleague from the police academy toronto scribbled something gaunt pocketed it without reading what had been written he never showed enthusiasm for information given going down in the lift and out into the evening he realized that he had spent an hour with a policeman who was so embittered by defeat that he had pulled the marionette strings of a broken man and given the poor beggar purpose quite bizarre but life was ever thus he reflected a man with purpose in his step could always be found useful work he lay full length on a platform bench police had come to him a halfhour before and towered over him theyd had pistols handcuffs gas and batons on their belts but he had shown them his passport and his onward train ticket the man had grimaced contempt the woman had sniffed and they had left him a train came through pulling half a hundred malachys best guess wagons of chemicals he was awake had been since the police had checked him when the wagons had rumbled away into the night a silence fell round him and the stations life died he had reached rotenburg he must wait chilled and damp another hour for a night service that would take him via bremen oldenburg and emden to the coast off the coast was an island but he did not know what he would find there or if he would find anything he sat on his bed and a blanket shrouded his shoulders the nightmare had worked in the mind of oskar netzer if he lay on his bed he would sleep because of his age and his tiredness if he slept he dreamed and the nightmares chased relentlessly after him he saw men loosen the noose round a frail neck take down a childs corpse and put the noose on another the blanket gave him sparse warmth always at the last the picture in his mind was of his uncle rolf who had helped to drive the children their carers and guards their doctor and the ropes to the cellar where hooks were set in the ceiling because that blood ran in him he was part of the evil he had come to the island of baltrum with his wife to find peace but it escaped him the blood in his veins was contaminated he threw off the blanket and stood up heavily the joints of his legs as if he was cursed ached at the movement and he went to his living room respite if it were to be found would be in the bundles of planning applications that littered his table and the drawings of a proposed new sewage works only by fighting each change that came to the paradise baltrum could oskar netzer exorcize the guilt that ran in his blood he pored over applications and the proposal anything and any person who was new to the island and threatened it must be fought root and branch as lutherans had said three centuries before without compromise the light from a lowwattage bulb with no shade beamed down on him as he scanned typescripts and drawings and was saved from sleep he had many names discarded and in the morning he would have a new one in the morning he would be given the passport and documents for social security he had the name given him at birth anwar he had the names for a week or a month on the travel papers with which he crisscrossed international boundaries he had the name sami student of mechanical engineering and lover of else borchardt he had the name mahela zoysa on whose sinhalese identity he had come into germany and which in the morning he would give up he had the name in the organization of abu khaled but he was far from the company of colleagues for abu khaled a man had died in the topfloor rooms of an apartment that sacrifice had been made for him he preferred to sit on the linoleum with his back against a wall and a calendar above him that showed a faded picture of the fortress of gjirokastra in albania he shunned comfort preferred the floor to a chair or a mattress alone unwatched and delving into memories he would choose the floor to rest on the memories danced for him changed step as if a beat altered seemed to him to be on a loop and always returned to him as the boy anwar a child of the city of alexandria he had been born in that year as he knew now was when palestinians had assaulted the festival of the munich games and had not been prepared the planning had been inadequate a year later a month after his first birthday as he knew now egyptian troops had stormed the zionist defences on the canal but had lost and been humiliated he was anwar named in deference to the president whom his father supported he had been nine when patriots rich with faith had killed the great pharaoh anwar alsadat and later as a teenager and out on the breakwater beyond the yacht club and alone he had learned to be shamed by his name he should have enrolled at the university in but he had gone from his home in the night with a small bag and had left no note he had never since the night he had gone from his fathers house sought to make contact his father if not dead would now be in his seventysixth year his mother if not dead would be in her seventythird he did not know if they lived if they knew of the life of their youngest child nor did he know of the careers taken by his two brothers and his sister of their aspirations and ambitions he did not know if the family still occupied the house with the veranda at the front and the wide balcony beyond the bedrooms at the back whether there was still a yacht club for them to visit and the semiramis hotel for them to eat at did they still buy books at the alahram shop did they any of them have love for him did they curse him was his name ever mentioned in that house it was he accepted it weakness to hold memories in the morning he would take a new name and the next night or the night after he would travel on then he would find the young men and women whose names addresses and coded greetings were locked in his mind he waited and had never challenged the promise made to him that a man would come he worked in a shop selling sportswear and shoes each day from his home in the manchester suburb of wythenshawe he travelled on three buses to get to the trafford park retail complex he was twentytwo and his parents were from the old military city of peshawar in the north west frontier province of pakistan but they were now anglicized and his father worked in a local education authority office as a clerk his mother parttime on the counter of the local library both had expressed surprise when at the age of seventeen he had begun to attend friday prayers at a mosque close to the city centre but they had not prevented him a year and a half later abruptly he had abandoned the religious training then his parents had shown relief what gave them the greatest pleasure was that their one child had a job with corporate training and a smart outfit to wear at work it was where he had been told he should find employment and he had accepted dirt wages and long hours he had seen last christmas and last easter the masses pour into trafford park to saturation point more people than had been in the twin towers that the martyrs had flown against a man would come one day into the shop or would sit beside him on one of the three buses and say and let not the hatred of others make you avoid justice he would answer the man be just that is nearer to piety the words from the book were clear in his mind and always with him he waited for the man to come and served in the sports shop during the day and prayed each night in his room that he would be worthy of the trust placed in him malachy felt the train slow and as the rattle of the wheels died he heard the scream of sea birds he reached up unhitched the window blind let it fly clear and rubbed condensation off the glass he did not know whether he had reached almost the end of a journey or the start of one could not have said if this was where almost an old life ended and for him a new day started would not have been able to tell himself if this was the place almost that disgrace was finished and where he would now find the searchedfor quality of respect his face was pressed against the cleared window under the platform lights passengers dazed from the night journey coughed spat and hacked their throats clear then lugged down suitcases parcels and rucksacks the station was norden he could smell distantly sea air but by the time the train jolted away and picked up speed the rain falling from the darkness obscured the glass when he stretched up and looked down the length of the carriage he saw only emptiness he was alone through the mist now settled on the window he saw occasional frontporch lights an illuminated forecourt to a petrol station a car showroom some of the roads were lit like daylight and some were dark and the gulls cried louder as if greeting him the last stop of the trains route from munich on to cologne then to rotenburg bremen oldenburg and emden was the harbour at norddeich it was flat there exposed and the wind ripped at flags and came in battering gusts on to the side of the carriage the isolation he thought was precious to him and gave him strength he stepped down from the carriage ahead of him tied up was a ferry to his left a marina of yachts nestled behind a sea wall and to his right crowded close a fishing fleet he saw the wind the rain hit the ferrys superstructure and rock the masts of the pleasurecraft and the small trawlers he walked towards the ferry and the elements almost keeled him over he braced himself to advance he found a man in a precariously rocking hut who smoked an old pipe and had a coffee mug cupped in his hands as if for warmth was this the boat the ferry for the island of baltrum the man bored and cold shook his head where was the ferry that went to the island the man growled indistinct nessmersiel then sucked at his pipe and billowed smoke how could he reach nessmersiel for the ferry he should go by bus when and where did the bus go from first the man shrugged then he took his pipe from his mouth sipped from his mug and waved back in the direction the train had come malachy thanked the man for his kindness and wished him a good day in another world the old one he would have felt a spurt of anger at the slowness of the extraction of answers but the former life of malachy kitchen had ebbed he smiled he went out through the door where a length of string holding it open strained to breakingpoint where he had been what had happened to him had slowed his anger deadened it the wind scurried against his back as he walked past the deserted train away from the tethered fishing fleet and the rattle of rigging on the yachts in the marina rain bit at his shoulders and hips and at the back of his legs he walked well and the pains aches and itches were behind him he was alone as he would have wanted to be and his journey was nearly done or was nearly started chapter sixteen the bus parked beside the gangplank the dawn had come and the rain had eased but not the gale the bus for which he had waited nearly two hours had brought malachy and three others along a straight road behind the seadefence dyke then at the village of nessmersiel the bus had swung to the north and the last stretch of the route had been on a road flanked by neat darkened homes the driver had broken clear of the village and brought them to the harbour where a squat ferry waited she stood a little step aside from the gangway and had a packed rucksack high on her shoulders she had two small stubs tickets in her hand and held them out we get two for the price of one she said i didnt ask you to come he said flatly our people always like it when field people go cheapskate i didnt say you asked me next week getting ready for the season the full fare starts i dont want you with me dont sulk you look grim enough without that and i dont want your concern her eyes sparked well im here and you should get used to it malachy took a ticket from her and went up the gangway he heard her heavy shoes tramp up after him the other passengers from the bus on boarding bolted from the open deck and went inside a doorway that advertised a cafeteria service exhausted obstinacy led him to a part of the open deck where the rain slanted in hard and the wind he slumped down on a plasticcoated bench that puddled water she followed him and tried to wriggle the rucksack off her back he made no move to help her but then she gasped in frustration and he reached to take the weight of it thats better well done join the human race i was fine on my own he said the rain made a film on her hair but when she twisted her head to face him and dumped the rucksack down the wind caught and tousled it broke the film and droplets sparkled she sat beside him she wore strong laceup shoes and a long waxed coat that she hitched round her knees but out on the deck her ankles took the rain she snatched off her spectacles blinked then rummaged in a pocket for a handkerchief and wiped furiously at the lenses she grinned you display malachy a quite staggering degree of selfimportance id like to give that a kick im not with you to watch your back get yourself thumped and see if i care now get a load of this parallel lines run along adjacent to each other not often but sometimes they move together and merge then geometry or whatever pushes the lines apart again so that theyre no longer joined but are parallel pretty simple eh maybe everybody gets a chance to wave goodbye and maybe they dont but for a few hours or at most a couple of days the lines go together then nothings permanent i brought us some kit what for dont go sour again malachy it spoils you the eyes danced and the mouth quivered he felt the ludicrousness of the sulk shed identified she dived her hands into the rucksacks neck she showed him dry socks and clean union jack boxer shorts rolled up allweather trousers and a rainproof top a battery razor a plastic bag with a toothbrush and paste and a shirt crumpled by the weight on it she laid them on his lap as the boats engine shuddered beneath them a man came out waited for them to find their ticket stubs punched them and hurried for cover she showed him then put back in the rucksack a miniature radio transmitter with earphones a thermos and a collapsible primus stove big binoculars and last a sleepingbag that was rolled tightly she dug deeper and swore with vigour a pistol fell from the sleepingbag and clattered on the deck planks he jerked down fast reaction as if the tiredness was gone and snatched it up while it still rolled by his shoes if you didnt know theyre quite dangerous things its not my area couldnt hit a front door at three yards astonished confused but wary is that for me take it think of it as insurance do you know what it is he held it carefully his finger way clear of the trigger then sucked in a breath looked over his shoulder and saw that the deck was clear the boat moved away from the quay as he had been taught malachy took out the magazine cleared the breech and depressed the safety button then pressed on the trigger felt its resistance and heard the click of the harmless mechanism he gazed at it at brigade and battalion he had worn a pistol at his webbing belt on the patrol he had carried and had lost an assault rifle it came at him the memory of running hunched with the file of soldiers like a knife thrust he said its a ninemillimetre pmm selfloading pistol updated from the makarov twelveround magazine around four hundred and twenty metres per second muzzle velocity its dont wave it around just put the bloody thing in your pocket he did he thought it weighed in his pocket two or three times more than the plastic toy he had carried in the amersham he gazed at her and she seemed amused she let the tip of her tongue jut between her teeth and he thought she brought danger with her what is the need for insurance not the place to start youve done the secrets act stuff believe in it i have i think i do in spite of forget the mawkish bit thats history well start with the convergence of parallel lines its not original did it at university the rightwing christian democrats and the leftwing italian communists were edging towards a coalition government its nearly forty years ago two parallel lines of political opinion but coming together and ultimately merging the originator was aldo moro a cd bigwig didnt do him much good because extremists from the brigate rosse kidnapped and shot him you and i malachy are parallel lines but for convenience weve linked up what i like about you you dont interrupt perhaps youre too bloody cold to bother she told him sketchily about a man who had sent his wife a gold chain to mark his love about a coordinator who had been bought time in an apartment under the roofs about a czech furniture factory and the link to timo rahman who ran organized crime in hamburg and she told him about an idiot who had broken into the grounds of the home of timo rahman and eavesdropped the name of an island and she said they would together observe and possibly disrupt what her boss called a rat run and then she told him that only a serious idiot would sit in the rain in soaked clothes without protection from the wind he took into the toilets the clothing given him when he returned warmer drier and with insurance heavy in his pocket she was leaning against the rail at the back of the ferry and gulls flew prettily above her she took the clothes that ivanhoe manners had bought for him in a charity shop long ago and didnt dump them in the rubbish bin near to her but chucked them up and high so that for a moment socks pants and a shirt soared with the birds then dropped into the ferrys wake at least now she said you wont stink you did worse than a pheasant hung too long for your consideration miss wilkins thank you he said evenly pollyll do too much formality might screw up the convergence of parallel lines when the mainland had slipped away into the mist while the shaking boat went slow up a channel marked by dead wood poles they left the back went to the side and leaned out the wind ripped at their hair and he stood close enough for her to feel the weight of the pistol in his pocket they saw a sandbank high above the surf with seals on it then the islands shoreline dont think i need you he said believe what you want to oskar netzer snarled at the man his neighbour youll take it with you we dont want it here he had opened his front door pushed it wide enough against the winds force to slip through it and it had slammed behind him across the sagged wire fence that divided their properties the chemist from the mainland was putting out plastic bags by the little wicket gate at the end of his front garden path bottle necks peeped from one already with the day hardly started he had heard the clatter of the pushed mower on the aprons of grass flanking the path and down the side of their house the man stood up slowly as if that made for a more defiant pose and gazed back at him oskar had a canvas bag slung on his shoulder heavy with the tools he would need for his days work but he held his ground and allowed the wind to whip his face on a point of principle he burned his own rubbish everything he could in a brazier at the back letting the elements take the smoke and scatter the ashes there was a rubbish collection each week in westdorf and the disposal of it was a constant burden on the permanent residents and was paid for by their taxes but oskar netzer selfappointed guardian of baltrums purity was considered too impoverished to pay dues to the islands council the woman the chemists wife had come to the door of their house and stared back at oskar he saw her annoyance and also that her husbands chin shook at the effort to suppress his anger he went down his own path where weeds grew in the spaces between flagstones and past his own beds where more weeds flourished he would clear those beds only when flowers came up in the summer then he would cut them and take them to the cemetery in ostdorf he glanced down at the neatly stacked plastic bags is that all you do make rubbish for us to clear you should take it with you back where you came from he walked away almost cheerfully up the street he heard only a hiss of breath from the chemist should either have sworn at him if their annoyance had exploded it would have made perfect the beginning of the day but oskar had had enough from them to be almost happy and he strode off he would soon be out of the abomination of closeset houses and away in the freedom of the west of the island where his ducks were and the viewing platform he would repair it was a relief that the rain had been blown away and he expected to be able to work a full day without interruption and alone by the time he was at the end of his street he had forgotten them and their rubbish billy had the wheel harry had the chart spread on the table behind his sons back paul his grandson clung to a holding rail as if his life depended on it the i trawler crawled forward erratically and the course set by harry would take the anneliese royal away from the east coast of england out through offshore gas rigs north of the bruine bank a pencil line on the chart ended south of the german bight at an island shore she had a maximum speed of twelve knots but they did a mere half of that the horizon swung between whitegrey cloud and greengrey sea it was worse because harrys course dictated that the waves swell came from the southwest and battered against the trawlers stern and the pinnacle of each wave drove them aft first into the unyielding mass of the wave ahead they always said skippers with experience that a sea coming against a boat from the stern made for hell on water the boy had already been sick and some of his vomit had missed the bucket lashed by its handle to the back of the wheelhouse harry had had the course the destination in german waters from the radio a frequency on the extreme of the uhf band that was rarely used and therefore was unlikely to be listened to and ricky had given him the coordinates what i need to know harry when are you going to be there hed yelled back the answer that he didnt effing know thats not cooperation harry that doesnt make my life easy you going to be there tonight hed heard the distorted whine in the voice then said hed be there when he was there and not an effing hour before or after hed smiled then grimly to himself and had reflected that if this weather held there would be no german craft customs or coastguard out of harbour and that the sea conditions would obscure the shore radar signature of the anneliese royal small bloody mercy hed finished by cutting across rickys bleat to tell him that he was switching off the radio and would use it again when he was an hour or two from the rendezvous point the sea tossed shook and battered the trawler while his son gripped the wheel his grandson the rail and harry held fast to the chart table and ricky had said it was all to bring back to england just one man so good of you to come mr capel and at such short notice all of us on this team were very grateful we sincerely appreciate your cooperation may i call you percy id like to he was a gentleman percy capel knew hadnt met many but thered been enough for him to know one he would have said that a judge at the old bailey was a gentleman sent him down for five years when it could have been ten with hard labour and there had been a whisper of a smile on his face as hed heard the testimony of how percy had done the entry bit and of course the best gentleman had been major anstruther this one no doubt about it was a proper gentleman what weve realized percy is that our records on albania are quite pathetically thin files of stuff about yugoslavia and greece but some very good things were done in albania and we dont have an adequate picture of them time goes on and if we dont shift ourselves the eyewitnesses the participants will be beyond reach we want to talk to you about albania and your work alongside the group led by mehmet rahman would you be up for that percy he nodded muttered that hed be happy to then saw the smile of appreciation on the gentlemans face it had all happened fast him still in bed with a cup of tea sharon in her housecoat doing breakfast mikey i shaving and the phone had rung sharon had screamed up the stairs that the imperial war museum was on the phone and wanted percy for his experiences and apologies and apologies and more apologies than he could count for the lack of notice and the liberty taken of having sent a car for him in the hope that he wasnt too busy no percy capel had not been too busy he had been driven by a respectful chauffeur across southeast london and at the museum beside those damn great naval guns the gentleman had been waiting for him its what we try to do fill holes in knowledge and nowhere better than from the people who were on the ground i expect youd like some coffee and i think we can rustle up some biscuits the gentleman all oldworld courtesy wore a threepiece suit and a puffedout tie that was immaculate at his collar he had a handkerchief spilling from a breast pocket and shoes you could have seen your face in percy was glad hed kept the chauffeur waiting those extra minutes while hed rummaged for a clean white shirt and sharon had used the stiff brush to get the dandruff off his blazer with the british legion shield on its breast pocket when the coffee was in front of him two lumps please and hed had his second biscuit he started at his elbow a taperecorder turned he didnt think they wanted crap so he told it like it was for history and their archives and scratched in memories that hed long ago discarded he told of the old squadron lancasters and how hed been volunteered out to the middle east so had missed the raid four weeks afterwards to hamburg his new unit flying halifax bill mzs went up the adriatic from the strip outside alexandria then turned to starboard and over the balkans his had had a girl in a swimsuit on the port side of the nose with long legs and she was shouting im easy in white paint on the camouflage the job of the aircraft and crews was to drop agents and weapons into occupied territory that night the weather people said there would be cloud cover to blank out a full moon over the target drop zone and theyd carried a specialoperations major and his sergeant and a mountain of gear in tin cases and hed been in his usual place at the rear gun turret never trust the bloody weather people clear moonlight bathed the halifax on the approach run not a bloody cloud for love or money and the flak bursting and the fire first in port outer then in starboard inner and the pilot had ordered them to bail out hed followed the gear the major and his sergeant but hed been the last to go clear out through the portside hatch in the fuselage and then im easy had corkscrewed and hed been halfway down on his parachute when shed gone in bloody great bang and bloody great fire the majors sergeant had fallen like a stone poor beggar because his canopy hadnt opened in the days and weeks that followed major anstruther had made him batman packmule explosives expert radiooperator and killer they had met up with mehmet rahman and a gang of thugs and lived in caves his toes still hurt from the first dose of frostbite but it wasnt bad enough to stop him helping the major to blow a rail bridge and later to sabotage the shaft and winding shed of a chrome mine and there was the ambush of a convoy of the st mountain corps in a valley up north of shkodra and his sten gun had jammed and beside him the major had used up the last of his loaded magazines and thrown the last of his grenades and if it had not been for mehmet rahman they were both dead meat mehmet rahman had saved his life and major anstruthers they were good troops the mountain corps crack guys soon as we hit they came up off the road and at us wed put down some of them all yelling and hollering and shrieking then the major had nothing more to chuck at them and my sten guns jammed bloody useless things always getting blockages they were all round us coming after us close enough to see them damn soon and it would have been close enough to touch them mehmet rahman came didnt have to he was on his feet and running to us all exposed and his god must have watched for him and there was bullets all round him but he didnt take a scratch he had covering fire from his guys but he cleared a way through to us shooting from the hip the germans backed off must have been chaos for them the ambush and all and they went down to what trucks and armoured stuff was still able to move and quit probably their priority was to get the convoy through i reckon thats why they left their wounded just wasnt the place to do a count theyd have gone for two or three miles then realized how many theyd left we were high up well gone but we saw them come back they didnt need to have bothered because there were no wounded left only the dead he was telling it like it was and hed never told it before he gulped at the coffee in the bonechina cup but a biscuit was left half eaten on the plate the gentleman gazed into his eyes like he knew what was to come and the tape turned up there we couldnt take prisoners certainly not wounded prisoners we couldnt honest believe me do anything for the wounded anstruther shouted to me that i was to come away he tried to get me behind some rocks but shock i suppose i didnt move mehmet rahman went among the wounded those that were bad unconscious he shot but he had a knife the knife was for those who were hit in the legs or the shoulders or had holes in their guts but their eyes were open he took the eyes out first like the knife was taking a stone out of a plumb then he slit their throats i still hear the screaming of some of them those he hadnt reached not mercy killing butchering them for pleasure he did all of them till it was all quiet i caught the majors knee and i pointed to what mehmet rahman did but the major shook his head the major said soft that it was a bad war and that pretending otherwise wouldnt make it a better war mehmet rahman was like a fucking excuse me sir animal because he scooped those mens eyes out and cut off their heads sawed through their pipes and their neck bones did it so that the next in line could see what was coming to him and did it for pleasure then he wiped his knife on his shirt and we went off up the mountain and left the silence i tell you i never heard such silence again not in sixty years there was moisture at his eyes and percy capel prodded a finger behind the lenses of his spectacles and wiped them he was asked the gentlemans voice silken and gentle whether he had ever talked of this what down the legion not likely been part of a war crime sir would you i never told my winifred dead and buried bless her nor my boy nor whats extraordinary my grandson has met up with the rahman family hes in he stopped but he had already launched so he groped for an explanation in import and export buys and sells he met up just by chance with mehmet rahmans grandnephew and that put him in contact business you know with mehmet rahmans son and theyd heard of our family name small world my grandson asked me what i knew of mehmet rahman did i say he was a murdering swine a bloody animal i did not theres truth some of the truth a little of the truth thats what i chose a little of it i said that my family and his were joined by blood that my life was saved by mehmet rahman its a debt right you cant pay off that sort of debt its with you all your time on earth and with your family the gentlemans face showed the vivid expression of not understanding percy capel felt the obligation to explain a debt like that it owns you do you see that it owns me and my son and my grandson its as much my grandsons debt as mine they do business my grandson and mehmet rahmans son and i suppose thats like paying off the debt but i doubt my grandson sees it that way anyway you dont want to know that the frown on the gentlemans forehead had gone as if he now understood and percy was nudged towards further anecdotal memories he talked of more demolition and more sabotage and of a lysander that had landed to pick up the major and himself and fly them out and then the tape was stopped he was told how valuable his record of events would be to historians at the imperial war museum the chauffeur drove him back to bevin close and he was almost home before he realized that he had never been told the gentlemans name he wondered then if he should have talked of timo rahman and ricky and an unpaid debt worth it the curator asked as he pocketed the tape frederick gaunt smiled with warmth ive never done it myself but i can imagine it you prise open the two sides of an encrusted oyster shell and you find inside it a perfectly formed and lustrous pearl very much worth it a man from krakow who hoped to be a policeman had told detectives that his wife strangled to death had kept at the start of their relationship a chain of arabic worrybeads in a drawer in their bedroom and she had sworn to him that they were the gift of a friend a student of mechanical engineering at harburg the only friend in her life before the bahnwacht officer a lecturer at the university had recalled the name of else borchardts boyfriend as sami but not his family name a child in the turkish language and through the help of an interpreter had told detectives of a man who had hustled into the block after the child had pressed the bell at the outer door and his mother had activated the lock a clerk at the warehouse where past student records were kept had ferreted that previous evening and found the papers with the photograph of that student from seven years before a lecturer at the university called by detectives from his midevening dinnertable had confirmed that the photograph shown him was that of else borchardts student boyfriend a child roused from sleep was shown four photographs of male students and had chosen with no hesitation the picture of else borchardts boyfriend and had said that that was the man who had pushed by him when his mother had let him into the block a subeditor with the front page of his newspaper about to close had taken a call on the news desk of the hamburger abendblatt and had been alerted to receive from homicide the photograph of a suspect a journalist had worked at his computer to key in a fullface photograph and the smaller picture of a victim a technician had pressed the button that started the print run of the newspapers altered front page a driver had brought the new editions bound with wire for delivery to wholesale distributors from the presses of the hamburger abendblatt with the suspects photograph spread across three columns of the front page and the victims photograph across one by morning the suspects photograph blared out at readers from flensburg in the north to bremen in the south from lubeck in the east to emden in the west above it wanted for murder was printed in bold type and under it was a picture of a pretty girl who had been strangled in the sight of her baby carrying a plastic bag with four sealed coffee beakers four clingwrapped rounds of sausage sandwiches the nutflavoured milkchocolate bar that was timo rahmans favourite and a folded newspaper the bear left the shop he sauntered towards the mercedes and opened the newspapers front page it hit him he saw the photograph and the headline and under them was the picture of a girl who had deep eyes and a smile it blasted him but it was one of the bears skills that he could hide the shockwave caused by confusion danger no flicker of apprehension crossed his face no twitch of anxiety he could see them timo rahman in the front passenger seat and the arab immediately behind him alongside the mouseboy the newspaper was ripped by the wind and he rolled it quickly there was a signal long agreed between his master and himself in one hand he held the newspaper and the plastic bag and he let the fist of the other drop apparently casually to the seam of his trousers below the pocket his thumb seemed idly to flick his first two fingers it was the signal that risk was around them only a man as cautioned in risk as timo rahman would have watched his driver so closely that he noticed the gesture of the thumb brushing against two fingers the front passenger door opened the appearance of the bear huge shoulders shambling walk and a perpetual frown of confusion was that of a man whose body was an adults but whose brain was that of a child the appearance deceived he saw timo rahman duck his head and make some excuse to those in the back seats then come towards him he was trusted with every secret of his masters life not so the accountants lawyers and investment brokers who surrounded timo rahman alone the bear had the trust he had been at the end of the hoxha regime nineteen years before an officer of the sigurimi the political police of the albanian state earlier than any he had worked with he had had the intelligence to comprehend that the death of the old president would mark the start of a changed world the morning after that death he had slipped away from his office in the town of shkodra had taken a bus high into the mountains and gone to the village of the rahman fis and with humility had pledged his loyalty for two years he had been tested as the fis had expanded its power in the vacuum left by hoxhas death by robbery taxcollection and enforcement the bear had proved his worth he had gone with timo rahman to hamburg and had fought beside him as the empire was created they walked together master and driver to the back of the shop out of sight of the men on the back seat of the car he showed timo rahman the front page of the newspaper timo rahman scoured the page the headline the photograph the picture the report the bear would not speak unless he was asked to would not advise unless the request were made he would have said that it was not wise for timo rahman whatever the rewards to associate with militants but he had not been asked he would not have agreed that alicia the wife of timo rahman had met a lover in the gardens summerhouse but he had not been asked he held his silence and waited and then the paper was crushed in timo rahmans hands he was told where he should drive to and they walked back to the car the face of timo rahman showed no mark of the crisis with the map spread across his knees and silence in the car the bear drove off the main road and away from the village shop they took long narrow side roads and saw tractors in fields and cattle that had been released from winter barns he could not see the sea because his horizon in the north was the longgrassed dyke where sheep grazed he went on until ahead of him there was a tight plantation of pine trees and to the north the spire of a church level with the plantation a signpost gave the direction to the harbour three kilometres away of nessmersiel there the plantation on one side of the road and the signpost on the other he felt the light pressure of timo rahmans finger on his thigh he braked and pulled on to the grass his master was first out of the car and held the rolled newspaper he took the keys from the ignition and followed stood a halfpace behind timo rahman and towered over him the bear did not know the language spoken but understood its meaning it is as far as we take you the mouseboy ricky capel powered down his window and peered from it what you mean this is the middle of fuckall from here you go alone the two of you the mouseboys mouth hung open disbelieving where the hell are we i you walk to nessmersiel you take a small boat to the island you wait to be collected it is what you do the mouseboys face quivered you dumping us me oh thats bloody good you go on from here together the mouseboy ricky capel came out of the car and stood his full height his chest was up against the bears master whats this about it is about a fool the fool is wanted for murder i do not do business with fools the bear watched and his fists were clenched he was ready to thrust his own body between the mouseboys and his master the newspaper was unfolded the photograph was shown he saw the man who had no name lean forward and look past ricky capel and study his own photograph his expression was of sadness not of surprise the mouseboy said then were fucked i dont want no part of that you should know ricky that it is stupid to make enemies of those more powerful than yourself the americans are in love with the expression you can run but you cannot hide take him or you will make bad enemies do not make a bad enemy of me or of his friends because i will find you and they will at the back of the mercedes timo rahman opened the boot the argument brief was finished he lifted out the gear that had been checked at the warehouse in hamburg he laid on the grass at the side of the road under the signpost the case that held the shortwave radio the heavy weatherproofed flashlight two sets of leggings and two heavy coats last he raised the boots flooring and extracted from it a shortbarrelled machine pistol a magazine and a small plastic pouch of loose ammunition he gave those to the man with no name the fool who was hunted from his inside pocket he took a passport and a bulging envelope the passport was offered to the man the envelope to the mouseboy because he had collected it from the people who had printed it the bear knew that the passport was slovenian and in the name of milan draskic and knew that the envelope because he had counted the notes held seventyfive thousand american dollars then he went back to the front took out the plastic bag pocketed the chocolate and left them with coffee and the sandwiches the mouseboy shook in fury not that arsehole whos the fool its me im the bloody idiot for ever coming near you you can run ricky but you cannot hide remember it the bear went back to the car and when timo rahman had settled into his seat he reversed into the turning for nessmersiel and drove away back where they had come from for a long time he could see in his mirror the two men they had abandoned by the road if he had been asked he would not have left them there because of the danger it might bring but he had not been asked at the last before they were too small for him to recognize their movements he saw them carry what they had been given into the cover of the plantation look at him hes the sort of man we need we dont need any man i dont need anyone that is pigheaded malachy and boring they had walked the length of the islands seashore they had come off the ferry at the harbour on the extreme west point of baltrum and had gone by the groynes and the packed stonework that made a barrier against the waves surges they had passed the knots of homes above the barrier then struck out along the beach with the tide far out they had been in a desert of goldwhite sand and grains of it swept across them in stinging clouds polly had wondered if he would play samaritan and offer to take the rucksack but he had not he had kept two paces in front of her and when she had tried to close the distance and be beside him he had lengthened his stride she thought if she had run then so would he far to their left she had heard the rumble of the surf breaking and to their right she saw the low dunes where the coarse grass was flattened by the winds blast the beach sand stretched to the surf and it reached as a thinning finger towards the far length of the island out to sea she had not seen a single ships silhouette against the horizon where clouds seemed to chase away the clear skies and there had not been another living soul for distant company at the tip of the finger facing another island across a channel he had turned inland high on the beach where the sand was softest she had struggled under the weight of the rucksack but had kept pace with him polly wilkins had pride and his rejection of her presence wounded her he had led her on to a path among the dunes and there in gullies they had found protection the wind eased against the rucksack which seemed lighter on her shoulders ill do very well without a lecture that sort of man hes all eyes and ears in the dunes her mobile had rung she had rummaged in pockets for it found it held it clamped to her ear gaunt how was she where was she she had shrieked against the wind that she was fine on baltrum and had been told she was lucky to get the best damn holidayplace postings and that it was about debt about what she had howled louder than a crying seagull that balanced on the wind above her half of the call was lost on a fadeout but she caught enough to hear that timo rahman had called in ricky capels debt the call was cut they had walked on through the dunes along a scuffed path and each few paces she had seen his head swing right then left as if he soaked up an understanding of the place and memorized it they had dropped down into a dip then the path bent sharply and they had seen him the first life since the harbour and the homes close to the sea defences an old man was huddled against the wind and did not have the strength to fight it but tried to straighten the supports for a viewing platform above a shallow weedy stagnant pond maybe she thought the old man in combat with the wind had the same awkwardness as herself the same bloodyminded obstinacy as malachy kitchen without help she realized he would fail and the platform would collapse everyone needs help i do you do he does its wrong involving others involve people and theyre likely to get hurt total rubbish if youve finished your quest for the grail then bugger off i havent and i need help she saw the savagery and heard it and you wont be around after youve involved a man and hes hurt wont be around to pick up the pieces what do you think ive done with you if its not involve you ill pick up my own pieces the ethos of the service which they taught recruits what was practised in field operations was the supremacy of officers over informants milk and dump exploit and quit but malachy kitchen had told her that he was trained in intelligencegathering would know first hand what she had been taught and practised the old man had his shoulder wedged against the right forward support of the pillar of course she would milk and exploit dump and quit im not out on a stroll looking to get back my selfrespect my work is life and death and she regretted the pomposity he said quietly maybe theres a shop in the village up the other end and you can buy yourself a medal if she had not had the rucksack on her shoulders polly wilkins would have flounced away but she hadnt that spring in her she trudged towards the man on a trampeddown track that skirted the pond there were ducks heavy white ducks who didnt seem to know it was about life and death her father was enthralled by birds and her mother made sandwiches for them to take to the chew and blagdon reservoirs where theyd sit and watch waterfowl as a child polly had been dragged along too and had squinted through her fathers telescope for her sixteenth birthday they had given her a pair of pocket binoculars there were big militarystrength ones in the rucksack but she would not show them she moved quietly to the scrub between the track and the pond made certain she did not disturb the ducks she reckoned that any man who was not a fanatic or a lunatic would have been behind his front door that afternoon not heaving without a hope of success at a platforms support poles he would not have heard her against the wind but he must have seen her from the edge of his vision damn good eyes a hawks eyes he stopped took his shoulder off the pole as she came closer she could see the gathering malevolence at his mouth and the suspicion in his eyes she reached him she saw the scarred fleshless hands the face creased with age and distrust the way his overalls hung on him as if worn on a skeleton nothing to say her work was life and death and for that innocents were involved she smiled at him coolly she swung the rucksack off her shoulders and let it fall as if it contained nothing of importance she went past him where his shoulder had been she put hers she heaved gasped and felt the support straighten two or three inches towards the vertical she could smell him the tang of dirt and stale sweat how bloody long would he stay back and watch three inches or four her feet slipped but she dug them into the mud there was a grunt then the old mans body was against pollys five inches or six they pushed together six inches or seven he was groping in his pocket then nails filled his mouth half swallowed between bloodless lips she thought she might buckle under the weight that knifed her shoulder the hammer slammed into the nails taken one at a time from his mouth when malachy came to them and put his weight against the support pole on the left side she knew his name she knew his age she knew the name of his wife she knew of his love for the eider ducks on the pond dusk came and the platform was secure polly had been the leech and had sucked blood she knew that a paradise was threatened by strangers that if it was lost it could never be regained you should go home now oskar get warm and cook yourself something hot mal and i will be here tonight and well watch out for strangers the light through the plantations trees failed the wind sang above them and the upper branches shook the man stood easily then bent and took a sandwich from the bag unwrapped it checked its contents and wolfed it ricky was propped against a tree trunk and watched the mans movements in shadow after the sandwich had been eaten the weapon was secreted in an inner pocket then the flashlight was thrown to him without explanation and he scrabbled to catch it the man hooked the case with the radio under his arm his posture said he would wait a moment but no longer so what are we doing they had not spoken since the mercedes had been driven away they had gone into the depth of the trees and had each found a trunk to rest against backs to each other ricky had waited for him to speak but he had not ricky had been reluctant to break the silence between them as if it would show weakness they had sat spine to spine through the day had shared the quiet the man had an easy voice clear but accented english and seemed to mock does your trawler come here ricky across the fields or do we go to your trawler in ricky capels world disrespect was a crime the punishment for that crime was handed out by davey but davey was not here and this was not rickys world he had seen the photograph in the newspaper a younger man but clearly recognizable and the picture of a woman but there was an envelope in his pocket which contained cash and he had been threatened he trembled sitting against the tree he had eaten two of the sandwiches left for them but he was still hungry what screwed his mind the man seemed to have no fear seemed not to care that the mercedes had gone he pushed himself up felt weak do you have a name the man looked at him pondered briefly then again seemed to laugh at him you follow football a little ricky blinked confused why in london yes what team my boy goes to charlton with his grandad thats charlton athletic at the valley whats that got to do what is the name of the goalkeeper hes republic of ireland and dean something christ i cant remember his bloody name i am a goalkeeper ricky quite good not very good to you i shall be dean for you dean is my name thats just daft ricky spluttered the mocking ended the man said if you need a name for me it shall be dean what you should understand ricky the less you know of me the better you are protected i am very serious the less you learn is the best we go now to find a way to the island where your boat will come right ricky hesitated he pocketed the bag with the one remaining sandwich right dean they left the plantation the light was a fading smear ahead the man led not taking the signposted road to nessmersiel but headed out across fields and found a track flattened by a heavy tractors wheels the mud clung to rickys shoes lightweight and top of the range and spattered his trouser hems below the waterproof leggings gulls from the fields scattered in front of them screaming once his feet slithered away under him and he was pitched down on to his backside but he groped himself upright and followed the man ahead never broke his stride they went round a farm where security lamps were bright and saw a yard of cattle but dogs barked and they kept clear of the buildings they went right through a mass of wind turbines whose great propeller blades churned circles over them then crossed a field that had been ploughed and sown ricky lost his right shoe and had to grope for it in the growing darkness then had to run to catch his man he was panting heaving he was led over a barbedwire fence and the goddamn goalkeeper didnt hold the wire down for him and when his turn came it slashed his hands and ripped the crotch of his leggings they crossed a tarmacadam road then another fence and then they climbed a steep slope of grass sheep barely visible stampeded away from them ricky sobbed for breath when they reached the top when the winds strength slashed at them the man stopped he stood erect and gazed out towards a little cluster of lights beyond a black emptiness short of the horizons last light ricky felt himself shaken by the winds force that is the island where we go brilliant dean bloody brilliant ricky gasped and how do we go they went down the slope slithered and slid and more sheep ran from them they climbed another fence and then they were on the shoreline away to the left a mile and a half or more they saw the fierce shining lights of a harbour and out in that part of the emptiness there were navigation lights but not in front of them too bloody easy to go where the lights were where a ferry boat sailed from not a clever place to be for a man with his face plastered all over the front page of a newspaper there was the stink of the sea and rickys eyes were better now in the darkness than they had been in halflight he could see white caps in front of them that seemed to ride into little gullies how do we go we have to find a little boat what if dean we dont find a little boat we walk and we swim but i think we will find a little boat they did it was up on grass it was as small as the boat twenty years back that mikey might have hired for an hour down at folkestone or margate if hed been out of wandsworth or pentonville on a nice summer sunday and no way sharon would have gone in it the rowing boat was upturned on the grass and a frayed rope tied it to a rotted stump ricky thought the man had faith in luck or faith in god for thinking hed find a boat they had damn near walked into it when theyd tipped it over the man took the flashlight switched it on for a few seconds at a time and ran his hands over the planking as if that way hed find a hole in it there were oars too they dragged the boat away from the grass and down on to mud the man pulled it by the rope and ricky pushed it the mud clung to him next it would be his bloody shoes going down in the mud and bloody lost he took them off and his sodden socks and shoved them into his outer pockets at each step the mud seemed to pull him back but he had his shoulder against the wood of the boat funny but ricky capel who could strut in any company found that he needed not to fail had to show his worth to this man was not going to be found bloody wanting for two whole hours with one rest time of not more than five minutes they scraped the boat over the mud and then they reached the water the surf came in spurts up to their knees then ran back when they floated off when the man dragged on the oars ricky lay in the floor of the boat and water sloshed round him he found under his back a saucepan tied with string to the boats side and began to use it to ladle out the water as fast as he did so the boat filled the water level crept up the saucepan could not compete with it it lapped at the top of his knees and up his hips but he kept bailing because he could not let the man see him fail they grounded across the channel the moon had come up and he could see the line of a shallow hill in front of them they stepped out water up to their thighs went down in a hole and crawled out well done ricky that was good he flushed at the praise and a little of his exhaustion fled if she had asked malachy would have said perhaps timo rahmanll drop them by the ferry or have them brought over in a fast craft theyll link up with a boat offshore use a radio for it the size of boat that can get across the north sea would be too large to come in close so itll have to launch a dinghy and come right in to the beach somewhere along the stretch we walked they can use a radio for the final contact with the boat but theyll have to signal an exact spot for the dinghy and my guess is that theyd use flashing lights to guide it in that wont be easy of course im not a seaman and dont have exact knowledge because of the surf that the storms knocking up i hope to see them when theyve put the light on itll be when their plan is most vulnerable but theyll know with the weather that no living soul is going to be out and watching for them which will give them confidence im not reckoning where we are that we can miss the light theyll use could be tonight or could be tomorrow night maybe right now theyre lying up well see that light i want to hit them when they think theyre on the last leg theyre coming down from the dunes and theyre out on the beach without cover i want to screw it up for ricky capel youve your own target and thats your business mine is with ricky capel i want him out there in the sand and unable to get to his dinghy for him the whole thing is failure on a mindblowing scale its only a gesture but its what i want i want to hear him scream and then i can walk away she was beside him and her sleepingbag was already half buried in the sand that the wind pulled off the beach he could hear the steady rhythm of her breathing he sat hunched and his eyes raked the shoreline and the upper points of the dunes as he watched for a light the same sand that covered her was caking on his chest and shoulders on his lips cheeks and around his eyes he would have liked to listen to his voice telling her that he would hit ricky capel then walk away but she slept and would not have heard him chapter seventeen he sat on an upper point of the dunes and the rain was back and the pledge made to malachy was broken he watched and she was huddled on her side in the sleepingbag eyes clamped shut sand carpeting her hair when the drizzle had started he had carefully lifted the bags neck so that her mouth and nose were covered through her misted spectacles he could see that her eyes stayed closed the pledge broken had been that he would watch till two in the morning and then she would take her turn and he would sleep he had not roused her he glanced regularly at her a few seconds in each two or three minutes but his focus was on the sea where a boat would come more likely the boat would reach them at night guided by lights but he thought the weather rain that drove up on to the dunes mist low cloud that shortened the horizon gave enough cover for a dinghy to be launched it was as if the few clustered houses by the harbour where the ferry docked were detached from the rest of the wilderness of the island the voices he heard were those of gulls that ducked and dived in the wind the tide was up and they had fewer acres of sand to feed from so their hunt for shells to split open was harder and more frantic other sounds were from the winds thrust in the dunes and its singing in the low branches of the few trees behind him he thought she would wake soon because her breathing was less regular than it had been during the night the expanse of the beach was being steadily submerged the tide rolled in in the gloom sometimes he saw the light of a buoy but no boats came past it she woke sudden movement wriggling in the bag and fighting to get an arm clear trying to see a wrist and a watch cursing head lifted spectacles snatched off and wiped crudely on the underside of the bag spectacles replaced looking around eyes fastening on him damn you it amused malachy to see her annoyance good morning miss wilkins you promised an earthquake wouldnt have woken you her fingers were in her hair and sand flew clear she shook her head violently damn you because you promised to wake me if you didnt know it that is insulting he turned his eyes back to the sea what had he seen nothing what could he now see nothing why had he not woken her there was nothing worth waking you for we were supposed to share the watch you half and me half i thought you needed the sleep he said vaguely that is whats insulting i need the sleep and you dont thats a cheap shot he remembered roz remembered manufactured arguments remembered vicious spiky arguments coming out of a clear blue sky remembered her ability to rouse a dispute from a halfthoughtthrough remark he watched the surf where the gulls danced and saw the buoys light right youve seen nothing so what was so important for you that you could let me sleep the chance to think thinking about today or thinking about your bloody past malachy felt himself stiffen as if there was a catch in his throat the past his was never gone from him worse at night when he slept but he would not field that to polly wilkins as an excuse for not waking her bad in the day because it was the small pain that came and came again then he was free of it then it was back she would have seen his mouth stiffen she was close to him and was kicking out of the sleepingbag she had a gimlet gaze on him he did not know whether shed intended it but memories flooded his mind she said spat your problem youre in denial youre hiding my people fed me the stuff im not ignorant i know what the accusation against you is malachy its a pretty bloody one i dont know of anything that beats it what you were called so whats your answer its pathetic i dont know what happened being in denial isnt good enough and hiding from it means youll never clear it all of this stuff thrashing around and trying to play hero wont clear the stigma you have to face facts kick some dirt in your own eyes have you finished god its just that denial isnt a cure can we move on im trying to help please dont her voice rattled in his ear above the wind and the rumble of the surf cant you understand anything malachy im not looking to humble you im not in the bloody queue that was whacking you denial doesnt help you just repeating i dont know what happened wont lift you its shit she sagged back thank you ill do my own suffering he said grimly her lips pursed head down she started to dig in the rucksack she found what she searched for the size of an ironed and folded handkerchief it was layers of silver baking foil she said quietly as if it were important to prove herself that she was trained and could keep her head down when she squatted and knew about burying the stuff and tinfoil masked smells and she said she had food she was on her hands and knees and near to him she touched his arm her hand was on his wrist i think ive realized it the truth you really dont know what happened each time you say it its honest you dont know its the truth im batting on like some bloody shrink about denial but you actually dont know what happened i can see that now what im saying malachy for going on like a pig im sincerely sorry he saw the regret on her face he took her hand small and cold lifted it brushed his lips against it and dropped it he watched her crawl away then disappear down into a gully go clear of the wind and resumed his watch on the sea the waves and the surf she was he realized the first person who believed him and no other bastard had except her they had all rushed to judgement vindictive or ignorant april he was led by the client from the hallway and into the living room and young kitchen was following him oh thats a fine room excellent dimensions right for a family horace wield enthused he owned his highstreet business outright did not have the clutter of partners he liked to believe that as an estate agent he provided a better service than the chains that competed with him it was all about reputation and building confidence with clients whether they were buyers or sellers this was a seller and his first estimate was of an asking price of and a bottom limit if the going was tough of so much you can do with a room like this have a bridge party friends in for a football game on the telly a kids session relatives round at christmas im confident that a house with a room of this size will absolutely not hang around and its very nicely decorated people like that spend an arm and a leg on the house and want to enjoy it not have to rip the wallpaper straight off very tasteful thinking of going somewhere smaller are we they were their son was on the move but they had a daughter up north and wanted to be closer a mass of silverframed photographs stood on the mantelpiece over the gas fire small children the daughter and her husband and a young man standing proudly in profile wearing mess uniform the carpets and curtains look best quality do i assume theyll be staying available to a buyer always good if they can be left mr kitchen will note that well hed taken a chance on that young man and horace wield had built a flourishing trusted business on following the instinct of his nose when he had advertised in the local free sheet for a trainee assistant agent he had been bombarded by youths with earrings and bulky women in trouser suits with shoulder pads and there had been young kitchen who was ten years too old to be a trainee assistant but had a bearing about him and damn fine shined shoes had something of sadness and something remote distant a presence and a good voice had come out of the army wanted civilian life horace wield had gone with his nose and it was a friday that marked the end of young kitchens first week of course the money was rubbish for a man of his age but hed drilled the magic word prospects into him come monday when he had rotary or tuesday when he had golf he would seriously consider letting young kitchen out on his own if the property was at the markets lower end truth was he liked him and thought a bit of polish walked with him when they reached the kitchen and when they were taken up the stairs to see three bedrooms and a bathroom with walkin shower he had found the same cleansed perfection of the living room and the garden a door off the hall was opened this was a different room an untidy space a shrine he waffled ah a little place where a chap can shut himself away i suppose a bit of a refuge sort of room every man should have youre getting the details mr kitchen why a shrine there must have been four more pictures of the son in uniform but not best dress helmeted and in a flakjacket unshaven and in fatigues with an arm round a colleague crouched in front of a small tank turning to the camera and grinning and wearing full combat kit with a mosque dome and minaret tower as background and in every picture a rifle was held in obvious readiness for use two of the pictures were held with drawingpins to the shelves of books one was on the windowledge another was adhesivetaped to the side of the screen normally horace wield would not have talked so fully at a first meeting with a client he did it for the benefit of young kitchen to give him a feel for the patter dont tell meyour boys out in iraq thats a hellhole the boy was in the military police had done kosovo then been posted to alamara t sympathize it must be a considerable anxiety to you both having him in that awful country his wife refused to look at pictures of their son in iraq which was why they were in his den very brave young fellows and a scandalous lack of support for them from too many back home we should be right behind them i think every last one of them is a hero yes a hero we ought all to be grateful for their sense of duty and courage anyway this is a very useful space for any member of a family and of any age dont you think so mr kitchen he looked round and the doorway was empty when they went into the hall horace wield assumed that his trainee assistant was in the kitchen and measuring or in the conservatory noting details a frown twitched at his forehead against the coatstand was the clipboard that young kitchen had carried a chill draught came through the front door which had been left ajar gaunt climbed the stairs as a precaution he had emptied his wallet of all credit cards and identification documents and had left only enough money for the taxi ride to this feral place and a taxi back assuming the impossible that he could find one the driver who had brought him from the gates of vauxhall bridge cross and had dropped him in the heart of the estate had leered at him as he took the money and said you sure this is where you want to be sir sorry and all that but we dont do waits here quite sure thank you he had seen youths loitering at a corner where the graffiti was thick they had hoods over their heads and scarves across their faces and he had seen a man with two german shepherds studded collars on short leashes standing impatiently while they peed in turn on mud beside a pavement he had lifted his tie knot pulled a little more of his handkerchief from the breast pocket swung his furled umbrella forward and stepped out for the blocks entrance he had looked at flat roofs and wondered from which three youths had been suspended and at lamp posts and wondered at which a man had been trussed he avoided human excreta on the stairs and at the second level he used his umbrella tip to ease a syringe into a corner he came out on to the walkway the taxi driver had said i wouldnt have any of mine live here theyd be better off in bosnia good luck sir and watch your back he went by the doorways with the locked barricades went past a door behind which a child howled and saw the number where the man kitchen with the cross on his shoulder had lived he had spoken half an hour earlier before leaving the safety of vbx to polly and another door another barricade he rang the bell mrs johnson a very good morning to you mrs johnson tony sent me he made tea he smelt age and wondered if he alone in the dotage of his retirement would smell the same he was told in which cupboard he would find the biscuit tin he carried in the tray poured through a strainer and was instructed on how much milk she took he used oldworld charm to relax her complimented her on the decoration of her home the choice of pictures and the decent simplicity of her crockery he said as she held her cup and saucer that his business was malachy kitchen and saw defiance settle on her face he hurried to assure her that he intended no harm to her former neighbour but had come to learn of course he had an image of a vigilante a swollen beer belly and shaven head a vocabulary of obscenities and a muscular arm chucking broken bricks at the windows of a suspected perverts home with reedy determination in her voice the sparrowsized woman contradicted the image she said no one else ever did what he done nobody ever stood up to them the way he did i thought it was because of me i was attacked for my bag i was put in hospital yes im rid of the sling but the arms not right not yet and what he did was after that not that he told me it was because of what had happened to me one old lady who is forgotten ands lived too long there was no boast in him wasnt trophies he went after i know it was him when you live too long you get that sense and there wasnt any one else on the amersham whod have done it i told him to his face that i had not given myself such importance and i asked him to kiss me and he did then he was gone im alone too much and alone i think cheeky of me really to believe it was for me there was what happened here and then my friend thats dawn saw something in the paper about the house of a big drug man being burned the last time malachy came when he kissed me he had scars on him like hed been beaten only after hed gone did i know it wasnt for me i had that conceit but ive ditched i t it was about the past something hideous happened to him in his past and i havent an idea what his past gave him strength so much of it and more guts than any other man on the amersham are you going to tell me what hes done now where he is gravely freddie gaunt shook his head he did not think she expected an answer her cup was as full as when he had poured it pieces had fallen into place confirmations had been given she said each thing he did was harder than the last down at our pensioners association they have gym machines and theres that gear you walk on and you can make it go faster you with me its like each time he did something he made the machine go quicker youve come to see me which tells me hes not given up on it and so im thinking he must be running now running rather fast gaunt thought but did not tell her if you ever see him you give him my love give him millie johnsons love please dont let it go too fast that machine he heard a hiss of passion in her voice but it subsided i get tired im sorry he took the cups saucers and plates back into the kitchen returned the biscuits to the tin and washed up as her onetime neighbour would have leaving the crockery to dry on the drainingboard when he left her eyes were closed and she might have been asleep he closed the front door quietly pulled the barricade shut and heard the click of its lock the boy his grandson screamed not letting go of the wheel harry rogers swung his shoulders the plate arced up and the sandwiches flew towards the ceiling the kid was pitched sideways and his shoulder cannoned against the rail under the windows he saw young paul slide down god god only a bloody sandwich that hed asked for and the lashed bucket was already well filled with his vomit and his legs had been weak when hed gone down to the galley to make them couldnt have asked his son not billy to make him sandwiches because billy was below nursing the engines you all right to be heard even in the confines of the wheelhouse harry had to shout the kid moaned back at him the noises deafening were of the engines race when the bows went down in a trough and the propeller blades were tilted clear of water and the thud of waves against the hull when the big gusts hit and tilted them the boat groaned as if she were either stretched or crushed you all right young un im sorry sorry you got nothing to be sorry for he saw the pain on the kids face the face so pale if annie ever knew the conditions out on the north sea into which he had taken their grandson she might just lift a kitchen knife against him or she might pack up and quit no choice had to have the third pair of hands and no one else he could have trusted men enough in harbour who yearned for a good payday who didnt care about weather but they were not family the whimper came through the noise belting him im sorry for your sandwiches you broke anything i dont think so forget the goddamn sandwiches how long is it is it long there was pleading in the kids eyes he was seventeen back in the old days sail days the trawlers like the one he coveted took kids to sea fourteen and younger in the same storms and paid them less in a month than they needed to buy a pair of sea boots harry rogers could not tell his grandson that from this sea journey and from two more years and from the ones already done a chest of cash was accumulating the alternative to the chest was gaol for the kid for billy for him harry thought the truth cruel he shouted back and tried to put a smile on his face i reckon were through the worst of i t how long the rest of today and a bit of tonight then and he didnt tell the kid there would be the coming back and maybe more of the same the reference to harry rogers brother of sharon nee rogers capel had been a note buried in a longneglected file he was described in a report on the extended family of mikey capel as a freelance skipper with a masters ticket for taking out deepsea trawlers going deeper digging with the computer bank available to him tony johnson had tapped into back numbers of fishing monthly and had failed to find a match for harry rogers but had hit gold with the weekly fishing news there two paragraphs described the purchase in the channel islands of a beam trawler by rogers and its renaming as anneliese royal and its registration in the devon port of dartmouth from a phone call to the harbourmaster at dartmouth the detective sergeant had learned that the anneliese royal was never seen in west country waters harry lives here and i can give you his address and number but he works the north sea out of the east coast not in bother is he hes a very good guy oh no not in any bother only has the bloody spooks sniffing at his backside he had checked with harbourmasters from immingham to harwich back on his familiar workload humantrafficking vice he had revelled in the extreme secrecy imposed by frederick gaunt and had done his checks late in the evening and early that morning before the pace of the national criminal intelligence service had resurfaced a laconic answer from lowestoft had lifted him the last call he made before the openplan office area filled around him the anneliese royal was here and now is not hold on a second friend and ill give you timings from our log pretty rotten weather when she sailed and not much sign of it changing god knows why they went because theres no way theyll have the nets down rather them than me here we are i can be quite exact its thirtysix hours and about fifteen minutes since she went dont get me wrong beam trawlers rarely sink but it wont be any sort of comfort cruise he had waited for the coffee trolley to come round because that was when people went out on to the front pavement for a smoke he left the building and walked fast didnt use the nearest public telephones theyd break his legs if they knew that without sanction and authorization he was moonlighting for the spooks why did he do it risk himself because he had entrapped malachy kitchen and because ricky capel walked top of the shitheap and believed himself untouchable two reasons each good enough with a handkerchief over his mouth giving muffled disguise he spoke to a recording machine on the number given him and told what he knew didnt give his name and rang off he hoped he had done something to help one man and skewer another when he came to the platform in the faint first light he had seen the mass of scattered feathers anger churned in oskar netzer he stood beside the upright poles straightened and nailed of the platform and in the growing brightness he saw the devastation of the killing site the feathers were spread about an area of mud beside the pond at the moment of the attack the ducks would have fled but now they had returned and stayed on the far side of the water the bird had flown off low and hugging the dunes shallow contours the moment he had reached the platform and it would have carried a last scrap of the ducks breast in its talons the killing bird circled high and at a distance it would have been aware with its keen eyesight of him standing beside the posts it wanted to feed to take more of the flesh of its victim oskar saw the remaining eiders innocent and without protection and seemed to hear the voice of his mother as she read the letter that had been left with a lawyer by his uncle who had driven the lorry from the camp at neuengamme to the school at bullenhuser damm he saw the killer struggling for stable flight in the wind and he listened as his mother read the story of the children being hoisted up for the ropes to be dropped round their necks was it in the blood did it run in oskar netzers veins as it did in the harriers an instinct of barbarity the demons tugged at him his uncle rolf had not intervened had sat in the cab of the lorry as the atrocity was done in the schools cellars he would break a rule of the islands wilderness he would turn his back on a law of baltrums nature park the harrier was the cock it fed and savaged for two the hen would be on the nest eggs under her warmth alone a little of the madness of old times ravaged him he strode away the anger and the demons gripped him he knew to within ten metres the location of the marsh harriers nest his uncle rolf had done nothing to save the innocents he would he would find the nest in the reeds on the land side of the island and he would ignore the screaming of the harriers over him and he would stamp his boot down on the carefully woven bowl of fronds and see no beauty in it and would break the eggs and see the yolks splatter out of them he would do it to escape the demons and to save the eiders tugged at by the wind and spat at by the rain he was a slight solitary figure moving among scrub and between the low trees that were crushed and stunted by the weather he slipped into the reed bed beyond its expanse was the seas inner channel the steinplatte but he would not see the mainland which was shrouded in mist and cloud what he found was a track made by men confusion smacked his mind the track was not clean but blundered across the route he took to approach the nest he stopped who was the greater enemy the harriers that killed his ducks or strangers who broke the peace of paradise he turned away from the direction of the nest where a hen bird sat upon eggs and felt relief swamp him that rules and laws would stay inviolate he began to follow the track of snappeddown reeds none of the islands residents he knew would have walked through the reed beds and made a track that led towards the heart of the island from the landside shore of baltrum he walked the track he could recognize the prints left by rabbits different gulls oystercatchers divers and ducks and it was not hard for oskar netzer to follow a trail left clumsily by two men coming in darkness new purpose came to him and the image of demons of childrens swinging feet was killed he saw the tread of a pair of boots preserved in mud and the smooth sole shapes of street shoes and he went where they had gone old eyes but sharp identified the route two men had taken when they had come out of the reed bed and on to the sand of the lower dunes and he saw the flattened grass where they had sat then two places where they had gone in the night into the scrub thorn at one a handkerchief had been tugged from a pocket and hung as a marker on the scrubs barbs and at another he spotted the fibres of a coat he imagined them cursing trying to force a way through twice turning back and searching for a new way he moved now with greater care as if he were the harrier and tested each footstep as if he were the hunter the wind sang noisily around him but oskars movement was silent he froze when he heard a long hacked cough and a man spluttering phlegm from his throat then went closer first he saw the shoes they were shoes for a citys pavements they were sodden wet and mudstained and had been hung on scrub branches above a small grassed hollow that was sheltered from most of the driven rain he thought it a futile gesture to try to dry them because the wind did not come into the hollow a man slept there he was on his side his back to oskar hunched knees drawn up he thought the man had coughed in his sleep beside him was a plastic bag and its neck guttered in the light wind in the hollow he saw the firearm a loaded machine pistol and a metal box on his way home he had stopped at the cemetery at the edge of ostdorf and he had sat by the grave he had told gertrud of the young woman who had helped him rebuild the viewing platform of her kindness her interest in him and her sweetness so different from the many who abused and sneered he saw one of two strangers and a machine pistol and his eyes showed him the path taken by the second man who had the heavy tread of strong boots he lost the sense of time he would not have known or cared whether he followed the boots tread for an hour or for two hours he had seen the weapon and moved with considered caution it did not cross his mind that he should turn on his heel tramp back to westdorf and go to the little brick building where the islands policeman lived he did not have a friend in authority on the island did not have a friend in the world except gertrud he crossed the dunes a wraith and every few paces he would stop listen then go forward with his head low and his eyes searching for the tread marks if he had not for a short moment been upright oskar would not have seen him the man was briefly visible at the top of the dunes below him would have been the soft sand that fell away to the beach and the sea the man bent again as if to satisfy himself a last time then abruptly began to retrace his steps on his stomach oskar netzer nine days short of his seventieth birthday ducked and crawled into the last of the scrub a dozen metres from him seen through a tangle of branches the man stopped took a cloth from his pocket ripped a strip from it and tied the strip to a branch as if for a marker then he was gone oskar saw his face as he passed sallow and stubblecovered the face of a stranger who threatened paradise when he came out from the cover and gazed back he saw a second cloth marker knotted to a scrub bush he went forward where the man had been at the top of the dune where it looked over the sand the beach and the sea a triangular support had been made from a length of driftwood and two dead but solid branches the pieces of wood had been driven into the ground and lashed together with string to form a cradle in it was as large a flashlight as oskar had ever seen facing the beach and the surf he believed he had found a light that would be used after darkness to signal to the sea he believed that the two men would come in the black of the night using markers left to guide them unencumbered by the weight of the light why he had no idea no interest with clinical ferocity he tore apart the string that held the light in place kicked in the glass face and the bulb then used his hands to scoop out a hole in the sand he dug and dug then he buried the broken light and the glass shards and felt some small pleasure at having safeguarded paradise after they had gone the professor went out on to the veranda and dropped heavily exhausted from the emotion of the encounter into his favourite chair of woven rushes he had been shown the photographs magnified almost to lifesize of his son and had been told they were taken from illegal travel documents he had been asked if he could identify them he believed that in their search for information the political police had visited many scores of homes any family where a son had shown an early trace of opposition to the regime then disappeared he had not been able to hide his recognition and he had seen the boredom of many denials flee the two mens faces his nostrils had scented their excitement he had dumbly nodded his agreement any father would know a photograph of his son even when he had not seen or heard of him for a decade was he alive he had not been told where was he a second refusal what had he done their backs to him they had headed for the door now he sat in his chair and thought of his son anwar who was betrayed by his own father he had heard their car speed away and knew they would be going fast to the police headquarters in alexandria on sharia yousef he wept and thought that his own flesh and blood had destroyed him as he shrugged out of his overcoat and hitched his umbrella handle on the hook gloria gave him the signal received via the cairo station from alexandria he read the name then said it out loud as if that reinforced its weight anwar maghroub well mr maghroub i think i hear the clink of handcuffs on you gaunt listened and she played him the tape from the answermachine then passed him the transcript she had typed all tightening nicely please whats in my diary this afternoon you are seeing the nurse the annual health review blood pressure et cetera i did tell you be so kind cancel it she mimicked horror the ahr is set in granite about as compulsory as anything gets he grinned acted sheepish cancel it thank you with abject apologies and plead an appointment with god he began to smack his consoles keys furiously for fifteen minutes in a document he entitled rat run which was littered with typographical errors he wrote the report some material sourced from provenance and some not he spilled down through the paragraphs what had been told him by a pensioner widow the story of an unpaid debt the heresies of an expert in islamic studies the nightmares of a thames house colleague at belmarsh magistrates court the detail given by a harbourmaster where polly wilkins was and the hired hand she had recruited after he had finished gloria tidied and printed it carrying his report gaunt went to heaven by the elevator briefed the assistant deputy director and requested that a meeting should be called for early afternoon back in his room he lowered his blind and shut out that perfect privileged view of the river he loosed his laces kicked off his shoes swung his heels on to his desk tilted back his chair and reflected that a chaotic confused investigation was now close to satisfaction cursed himself for presumption then catnapped come on what have you seen she knew he held back but could not fathom why she was cold chilled to her bones by the wind and the old man kept a distance from her she had been up on the platform when he had come back he had not joined her but had squatted down against the pole she had helped to strengthen she had come down the rickety ladder and had sat beside him but then he had stood and moved away from her she had closed the distance between them and again he had moved had he walked the shoreline he had nodded noncommittal had he seen anything of interest he had pointed down to the little patch of spread feathers then pointed up and away into the distance and she had identified the harrier above a reed bed had he watched people out in the wilderness he had shrugged as if the movement of people was of no matter to him had he noted the presence of strangers on this part of the island he had snorted then looked away she shivered and the motion made the words in her throat croak i think oskar that tonight my business in your paradise will be finished after it is finished i will never return i am here to find strangers who have come to baltrum oskar i need your help in finding them she spoke softly tried to find gentleness please if you have seen strangers where was it but he showed her his back and gazed down on the ducks she had heard of but never met before this week men who lived their lives as hermits cocooned in isolation they found a refuge beyond the need of others she reflected this man living with the stink of old sweat and old dirt and old damp ran from reality as did malachy kitchen god save her two recluses the one trapped on this nowhere island and the other trapped on an innercity sink estate just her bloody luck to get two of them and need them in a single week she sought to honey her voice oskar you are running you can tell me what from he faced her and smiled at her as if he believed himself sane and her an idiot and he said i run from the sight of the dancing bare feet of children as he walked away he took a piece of bread from his pocket and she saw the green of mould on it he gestured with his hand that she should not follow him and he went down the slope below the viewing platform he was breaking the bread and throwing it forward towards the cluster of ducks bloody mad or worse the dancing bare feet of children what did that add up to a paedophile the dancing bare feet of children a man who hung around playgrounds in a city with a bag of sweets in a pocket she saw damn right a reason for running as great a reason as hiding in a sink estate from cowardice her temper snapped she had played gentle and it had taken her to bloody nowhere in her fluent and best german she barked against the wind you hide then see if it matters to me or bloody keep running and see if im bothered not that it would interest you with your problem but i am attempting to save lives thats the lives of ordinary totally innocent people but you wouldnt care would you so bloody absorbed in your own foul little world voyeuring kids watching the dancing bare feet of children and no doubt imagining whats under their skirts and shorts you make me with your selfishness sick hear me sick he did not turn at her attack his shoulders seemed to crumple his voice was frail uncertain my uncle drove a lorry from the kz at neuengamme that took children to a schools cellar medical experiments had been performed on them and they were killed so they could not testify against the doctors the feet that danced were those of the children who were hanged in the cellar of the school leave me alone go away she rocked reeled she had nothing to say the cold engulfed her she went dismissed and shame blistered her he had heard the sluicing of the water and the screams now timo rahman heard the whimpers of his wife and the stamp down the stairs of alicias aunt it could not have been otherwise the last night he had slept in the guest room which was never used because no guests were invited to stay at their home the bear had driven the girls to school and they had gone sullen and frightened aware of but not understanding the crisis afflicting their parents they would never challenge their father and neither had dared to ask why their mother was locked a prisoner in her bedroom he sat in the living room his head and body statue still the coat with the harris tweed label clutched in his fists on his lap and he waited for her aunt to come off the stairs and cross the hall which he could see the bear who loved alicia to the point of devotion was in the garden and away from sight through the window he raked leaves and perhaps wept but it could not have been otherwise in the village in the mountains where timo rahman had been raised she would have been beaten to death at his own hand then buried in a shallow unmarked grave and would never again have been spoken of her aunt passed the door she did not stop to show her long arms and the skin on them wet from the bath soiled with blood she did not hold up the brush of steel bristles that had last been used by the bear to scrape rust from an old bucket she went by the door but he had seen the blood and the brush he knew that his wife had met a man in the summerhouse of their garden knew it because ricky capel would not have dared to lie to him and had denied the man was at the house because of him and knew that for her betrayal of him she was now cleaned he could hear each sound she made through the bedrooms locked door and down the stairs and across the hall and into the living room and knew her body was now cleaned by a brush of steel bristles the dirt scoured away so that the skin bled it could not have been otherwise the man dean or whatever he was supposed to call him cleaned the gun ricky said im alive why am i alive because i lied i lied to timo rahman if i hadnt lied id be dead hed have strangled me or broken my head open with a hammer if i hadnt lied for giving him the truth he wouldnt have shot me because that would be too quick and hed have wanted to hurt me his body shook in spasms and he watched as each part of the weapon was laid out on a coat and meticulously wiped he rambled a man came after me where i live i dont know who he is and i dont know what his problem is a guy i do business with his home was burned down with petrol this man came to where i live and his coat stunk of petrol the coat was distinctive sort you see once and not again but you dont forget it from the once and im at rahmans all bloody hell breaks out alarms and things and theres a man legging it over the fence at the back of the garden but his coat catches on the wire and theyd have had him if he hadnt slipped off the coat the coat came in the house brought in by that bloody gorilla and it was the same coat and it had the same stink petrol he asked me straight rahman did i know the coat basically what hes asking me was a man in his garden because of me simple question i lied said i didnt know nothing about it id have been dead if i hadnt lied im thinking now the man whose coat was lost rahmanll believe hed come to meet his wife poor cow but not my problem you look after yourself in this world first and second and third the cold ached in every joint of his body but he had lost feeling in his feet however hard he rubbed them he did not hear his own voice whats just amazing he swallowed it i hadnt the lie off my lips before id reckoned it out nobody lies to him dont dare to get caught in a lie to him and hed take a week to kill you sort of making a judgement isnt it get killed in an hour or two for telling the truth get killed in a week because you lied and got caught out matter of judgement im telling you because i like you because i trust you the weapon was reassembled ricky could not have stripped it cleaned it put back the parts we get on that boat get across the water and we drop you off then youre gone its like you never existed my secret and your secret carried to your grave and mine i dont hear of you ever again and you dont ever meet up with me what you do i thought it was my concern thought it mattered to me isnt doesnt im telling you honest when i realized what you did then i told rahman i wasnt taking you and he twisted my bloody arm like it was right out the socket then he showed you the picture of that girl bawled you out for what you done to her me i dont have an opinion not any more you see dean were friends i like you friends with trust thats good us as friends the weapon was loaded cocked and laid down hands slipped to rickys feet peeled off the socks squeezed the last moisture from them and started to massage his skin the soles and the insteps and he felt the first flicker of heat there was wet at his eyes brilliant dean thats just bloody brilliant what have i done something brutal what are the consequences of it nothing what am i saying malachy im saying this bloody awful place has brought out the bitch in me he lifted his arm swung it hooked it round her shoulder in front of them was the beach and the surf and the horizon where the sea met the clouds dont think malachy that anyone from my crowd will ever thank you they dont do that all except one theyre as awful as here is im saying that you have to stand tall for yourself got me she wriggled she worked her body closer to his and he tightened his grip on her shoulder her hair was against his chin its what you deserve to stand tall whatever it was that happened you get to a time when youve paid your dues owe nobody anything he felt the warmth of her i want to be there and i want to see it you standing tall malachy chapter eighteen the tide had turned to reveal the wide depth of the beach and the gulls wheeled while searching for washedup crabs and shells and they ate from the rucksack she had taken a tin of chicken in white sauce another of rice and one of peach slices in syrup they passed the tins between them and scooped with their fingers at the meat the rice and the peaches licked the sauce and syrup off themselves malachy felt the sand grains clog in his throat as he swallowed and once she coughed hard and spat to clear her mouth at the bottom of the bag there was a small collapsed burner and tablets in a sachet for lighting under it and a rack the size of a palm for fastening over it but the wind was too great and the rain too hard for them to try to heat the chicken or the rice and the smell would have carried on the wind with smoke that was a signature he made a rhythm for himself with the binoculars he watched the skyline where the white caps met the cloud tracked the lenses over the dunes to the west and to the east followed the flight of the ducks when they dived to feed then back to the horizon the roll of the waves and the clouds chase each time he saw her lingered on her he thought she took longer to lick her fingers and nails then her palm her face was pale and her lips sand crusted her cheeks and settled on her glasses all of her animation was in her tongue working meat scraps fruit rice sauce and syrup from her hand licking and sucking she sat with her shoulder pressed against his when he lifted the binoculars his elbow lurched against her arm when he dropped them on their neck strap and reached to scoop from the tins his elbow pressed against her chest and softness beneath the weatherproof coat but he kept to the rhythm he had constructed and watched the sea the beach and the dunes the tins were emptied she had her boots and the overtrousers inside the zippeddown sleepingbag and he felt through his elbow the shiver of her body through the lenses he saw the break of the waves far out and the spray leaping above the surf but no darker shadow of a boat coming towards land the gulls in soft focus were distorted closer to him she shook in little convulsions malachy had reason to be there huddled in soft sand and with bent grass stems around him all that survived in the dunes he had a purpose and she did not should not have been there hunger took him back to the tin that had contained meat and sauce for the last traces of it his elbow against her chest he pressed his forefinger grimy and coated with sand down into the tin and scraped its sides his nail against the bottom the skin caught the top edge serrated with tiny teeth from the ripping out of the lid blood ran no pain but blood from a small wound spilled on to the cans base she took his hand in hers lifted it she gazed at him tiredness swelled the rims of her eyes at the limits of the frames of her spectacles and hair damp limp fell over them but the eyes had brightness and light blood came from his cut and smeared her hand not looking away from him not breaking her gaze she slipped his finger between her lips and closed round it he felt her suck swallow and her tongue moved on the wound there was at first sweetness gentleness then the tongue brushed his finger with more force and the lips held it tighter she said muffled because her mouth held his finger and her tongue took the blood from it and closed the wound i cant think of anything to talk about the warmth from his finger ran in his hand we could if you wanted to talk about the weather she said is it going to rain much longer i think its getting brighter in the west dont you the winds not dropping is it do you want to talk about the weather her tongue licked his finger and she swallowed his blood if you wont talk about the weather you could talk about damn hypothermia or you could do something about it with her free hand she pulled down a little more of the bags zipper but she held his finger in her mouth and she wriggled to the side he slipped into the bag pushed into it the old brogue shoes and felt them run against her legs then against the bags bottom stitching and heaved his weight against her she grimaced ive never done it like this before get sand in me and ill kill you she reached behind him and dragged up as much of the zip as she could and they were pressed together he felt the hardness of the pistol barrel gouge at his skin and the angles of the binoculars he took his finger from her mouth and kissed her he held her head and her eyes did not close as if the moment were too vital to go unseen and his lips found hers and he tasted her breath and his own blood he remembered what she had said to him on a bench in a park of spring flowers do it like you mean it dont get any bloody ideas he had done as he was told it had not entered his mind that she had kissed him under the blossom and watched by the search party from affection she squirmed in the bag god arent you going to help do i have to do it all there were zips and eyelets buttons belts and hooks and they writhed together to free themselves he did not think it was love but need i dont have one dont suppose you do not to worry not that time of the month i can feel that bloody sand the need was bred on emptiness malachy recognized it the void of his life and a corresponding chasm in hers each of them with an unspoken loneliness burdening them he felt her skin its coldness had his hands under her waterproof coat her sweater and blouse and his fingers moved with wonderment as if privilege was given him and she caught the hand where the wound had been and forced it lower their loneliness made it desperate he heard the zipper of the bag torn open as he came across her they clung to each other and she stroked him and he buried himself in her and then the motion calmed she moaned she bucked under him it was as he had never known it before she cried out piercing as the gulls did over them and he felt the ecstasy of it it was for need hers and his and they fell apart she had said do it like you mean it he had and he cradled her head he thought it took them nowhere he crawled out of the bag she swivelled on to her side and her back was to him he did up the zips and buttons reefed in his belt he did not know of any future only that emptiness must be filled he lifted the binoculars scanned and tracked what can you see he said only the waves and the clouds and the birds but theyll come i know i t thank you crazy isnt it you being my friend me not being your enemy mad isnt it if you saw me where you come from whatever place it is id be your enemy and if youd just pitched up in bevin close i wouldnt be your friend but were here the voice dripped in his ear your thing is killing people whats mine im not bloody proud do heroin from afghanistan and cocaine from venezuela dean have you been in afghanistan sorry sorry not for me to ask forget that were friends and we dont ask dont need to know i often wonder what afghanistans like it comes on the tv but that shows you nothing just ruins and old tanks and kids without shoes and women who cover themselves i tell you straight up ive made big money out of afghanistan five times the money i make out of venezuela im not hating you because you kill people and youre not judging me for what i do the voice rambled incoherent he let him talk he understood most of what ricky capel said and he tolerated it he took help where he could find it and when the usefulness of the help was finished he discarded it he had put the fools socks against the skin of his crotch and let them dry out against his body warmth and then he had peeled them on to the feet he had massaged then put the shoes back on the idiots feet pulled the laces tight and knotted them for him it was critical to him to have the imbeciles help the voice droned he remembered iyad the true friend who had given up his life that time could be bought a proven fighter who never bragged on their journey there had been long hours between them of valued silence you must be thinking dean natural you would can ricky capel keep his mouth shut you have no worries back home we got police and they dont get a sniff on me up where i am and i reckon im big enough we have the spies that are supposed to go after highvalue targets they got bugs and tracker sensors and cameras so bloody small you cant see them what they havent got is me why because im sharper than them theyve never had me never been charged all of that lot queuing up after me because im a highvalue target and they havent ever been able to lay a charge against me i was in once three years back and was held for fortyeight hours and a good half of that was in the interview room i never said nothing four sessions maybe six hours each i took an eyeline on the floor and one on the ceiling one on the table one on the door i said nothing never spoke but had a different eyeline each time you should have seen them dean and they were going fucking spare believe it you can rely on it i dont talk and i dont reckon you would its why were friends can depend on each other in his mind irritated by the voice he recalled codenames given him and addresses too sensitive to be written down and the words of the book that he would use and the responses that would be made you want to know anything dean about sensors and bugs cameras and audio or phones me i never use them then im your man to ask i got a guy clever little sod and i pay him well and hes ahead of their game better than the spies i know everything they put against me and how to block it didnt have an education but im not stupid youve seen that i aim to stay safe and anyone whos my friend will stay safe its why weve got the boat coming an old trawler flogging around the fishing banks and putting in to port often enough for it to be familiar clever that youre all right with me he thought of the places he had been while the voice nagged at him and of the young men and the young woman all martyrs whom he had sent out on the road to paradise and their cheerfulness to him and their gratitude that they were chosen and he had been long gone from taba cairo and riyadh when their pictures were put in newspapers with the images of what they had done what i like about you dean is that you show respect for me and im telling you its twoway i dont mean respect because im a big man most who give me respect back home its because theyre frightened of me men i do business with most of them they give me respect because of fear im not afraid of you youre not afraid of me but theres respect because were equals and friends right now when i get back theres a matter of respect its disrespect to be sorted that old bastard rahman he didnt give me it and he has a nephew a flash little prick and hes ready for a lesson in respect off the boat and ill be working on i t i got my cousins i got people who watch my back and will watch it when i sort out disrespect he suggested softly and soothing that it might be the right time to make the radio link with the boat and reached out took a cold hand and squeezed it in reassurance because he was the equal of ricky capel his friend and felt no guilt at the deceit if you didnt know it the weather out here is foul harry shouted at the microphone the trawler shook then cascaded into the trough walls of water climbed higher than the wheelhouse windows then hit a solid ungiving mass and the anneliese royal seemed to stop about as foul as ive known it for a moment she was dead in the sea and lurched to port he clung whiteknuckled hands to the wheel and for endless seconds she seemed to go over then the stabilizers dragged her upright but at the limit of the trough a wave made a cliff face and she collided with it he heard the boy his grandson cry out behind him in stark fear now harry saw nothing beyond the windows as sheets of spray covered them and rivers of the damn stuff would be sluicing on to the decks weighing her down and he could hear the roar of the weather and the engines howl and the distorted voice of ricky capel and the questions coming more frantic when was he going to be there what time why so long a rogue wave could come as one in ten or one in a hundred a rogue wave could not be ridden by a trawler they went on through it and the wheelhouse seemed to go dark seemed as though night came of blackened blue and green then they burst clear light where there had been darkness and the anneliese royal steadied and harry knew he would not be pitched over on to the wheelhouse plank floor he loosened his hold on the wheel and the sweat spilled down the nape of his neck and on his throat he looked behind him and the boy hung in misery from the rail round the wheelhouses sides and the door to the deck had come unfastened in the impact and hammered backwards and forwards the sea came in and cleaned some of the boys sickness harry tried to smile to find confidence for the boy took a hand off the wheel and gestured that his grandson should get the door closed maybe it would be the last time he went out of harbour for ricky capel maybe he depressed the switch dont know where you are ricky where i am its force ten and gusting up to force eleven and sometimes its cyclonic right when are we getting there im reckoning to be in the approach channel for german bight and turning into jade approach at approximately twenty hundred hours local and thatll put me off shore around twentytwo thirty if the old girls still holding together itll be a dinghy pickup whichll be no picnic i dont want any more radio traffic before twentyone hundred dont want the world to know and ill want a light signal from twentytwo thirty for the dinghy oh ricky ill have the guest suite ready and ricky i wont be hanging about so youll need to paddle out quick for the pickup like i said no picnic over out give it to the germans good god no absolutely not the meeting was chaired by the assistant deputy director gilbert let the germans in on the act i can promise you and it will be pain and tears he presided at the end of the table in a room set aside for conferences on the ground floor if the bloody germans are involved their lawyers will demand access to every slip of paper intelligence material that we have no way not to be considered sandwiches coffee nibbles and jugs of fruit juice were at the side and plates cups and glasses had been brought to the table we all know the german style its endless court cases appeals thatll go into the next century and weakkneed determination to see it through forget them behind the assistant deputy director sitting on six straightbacked chairs was a line of stenographers each was there to write up the contribution of their own man and later it would be polished in that mans interests scrub the germans out of it and let us do our own thing present four on one side of the table and facing freddie gaunt were dennis from the security service trevor of special branch in the metropolitan police jimmy who was senior in the norfolk constabulary and would also watch over the suffolk brief and bill who did liaison between special forces at hereford and poole with vauxhall bridge cross all of them on arrival had chimed complaints about the short notice given them and all had let it be known with force that they expected the inconvenience to be softened by a matter of genuine importance the meeting had started tetchily the assistant deputy director had sketched through a picture of a coordinator who was believed to be travelling to the united kingdom only believed and was now probably only probably on the german island of baltrum on the frisian coast the add had then asked should the german agencies be informed should their help be sought i think i have the general drift of opinion gilbert said i think you have all made clear a lack of enthusiasm for that course any final thoughts before we close on it dennis of the security service and irritable because he had walked over the bridge from thames house been caught in a shower and had sodden trouser ankles said theyd flood the target area with goons pick up this man who is probably there and believed to be significant and any chance of control is lost to us look at the last two cases to go through their courts in hamburg and mainz enough said yes yes id like freddie now to tell us what he knows the balls in your court freddie it would be of course a turf war each of them opposite him would fight a corner for primacy he started with the story of a war being fought in distant mountains in a distant time he saw a pencil twisting a demonstration of impatience in denniss hands please could we have something of today not of times before i was born he spoke of ricky capel drugs importer from southeast london and of alliances that facilitated the movement of classa narcotics into britain and saw boredom on the face of trevor the fidgeting at his cufflinks i hardly think freddie that we have been dragged round here for a lecture on how cocaine and heroin end up on our streets were supposed to be flushing out alqaeda operatives not mincing round the drugs problems he talked of a trawler that was in foul weather somewhere out in the north sea and said that he thought it would be used for a rat run across the water and back to british shores and saw the first light of interest settle in the eyes of the norfolk policeman as if everything said before had been dross well theres your answer seems simple enough to me freddie ive excellently trained firearms officers ready to be deployed and so have suffolk were not yokels out there we have experience weve done the exercises we follow the trawler radar and all that back over the north sea and we have my people and suffolks on standby along the coast soon as theyre ashore weve got them openandshut business not that we need it but do you have any more for us he said that the trawler did not have a regular home port and he could not promise where it would come into harbour and the special forces liaison bill seemed alerted to the opportunity all of the others round the table wore suits but this man had obviously reckoned his different status should be recognized by his faded cord trousers and heavy cableknit sweater with the greatest respect to our country cousins i dont think this is up the street of norfolk and suffolk this is a job for us im putting my weight behind a joint team hereford and poole which keeps both of them happy and taken to sea tonight in a coastguard cutter or anything thats got the legs on a trawler and an interception in international waters its the sort of operation that should be left to professionals and thats us were discreet and dynamic its for special forces my people i really dont think theres room for debate he described the island he talked of polly wilkins out on the dunes who would give a warning when the trawler came inshore with some pride gaunt spoke of the achievement of this young woman on her first overseas posting and of the doors she had prised open since a fire and a death in prague he saw overplayed incredulity snap at denniss face am i hearing you right freddie are you telling us that you have on the ground in a situation of this importance a rookie a slip of a girl just off your induction course is that it ill say it to your face freddie if this all goes sour and its down to your young womans failure i would not imagine as far as government service goes your feetil touch the ground youll be out on your arse freddie and damn well rightly so it is and im sorry to say it a cavalier road youre following not that its for me to criticize the actions procedures and operational decisions of a sister organization but i reckon it hard to credit that were going to be dependent on the skills of one young woman a rookie a raw recruit he ploughed on led with his chin he had learned well at the breakup of his old unit that when dogs circled him he could expect no help from his own no protection from the assistant deputy director he anticipated the sneers and inevitable derision but without enthusiasm he described polly wilkinss companion on the island and his past the information he had provided when he drew breath a babble broke round him after the quiet and the shock are you levelling with us youve dragged in a bloody vagrant for backup am i getting this correctly a man who is disgraced with the stain of cowardice in the field has been taken on to your payroll are you short of bodies or just a sense of priorities whats going on here freddie he shuffled together his papers everything except the photograph of anwar maghroub went back into his briefcase the case was his pride and gave him the small sense of belonging to the service little enough of it it had been bought for him by his wife on his first birthday after their marriage a technician down in the basement of a former building had for cash in hand put the gold stamp of eiir on the cases flap worn and faded now the edges were curled from use he felt old tired and useless and each barb of their contempt had hurt a little more than the last but the worse hurt was that he had not defended with resolve the efforts of polly wilkins and the man with her on the faraway dunes he said with a trifle of dignity that he did not think he could be of further help well thats it then most grateful to you freddie the assistant deputy director intoned im sure that the comments of colleagues were in no way meant as personal not as reflections on your very satisfactory summary of where we are thats the past our concern now is where we should be in the future the next few hours he hardly listened gaunt could have written the script we are the providers and you gentlemen are the customers and i think bar some small blemishes we have provided well it seems to me that the point at issue is whether to intercept at sea it should be at sea bill the liaison man said at sea is where my people have expertise or whether we should go for the land option so much tidier if its us doing it jimmy the assistant chief constable said on land and done by us or suffolk dennis was asked did he have a dog in this fight he shrugged doesnt matter to us wed be easy with land or sea watching his almighty who had descended from an upperfloor firmament gaunt saw the lips purse and the forehead of the assistant deputy director furrow he could predict the judgement as if from solomons seat divide the baby chop the little beggar in half and then there would be two parts to the corpse special forces to shadow the trawler and watch for a dropoff short of the coast with constant readiness for intervention and a cordon of guns from the suffolk and norfolk forces to be on the quayside at whatever port on the east anglian mainland the trawler docked it was theatre but it would be compromise the almighty or solomon held his hands together in front of his mouth and pondered the prayer gesture and took the deep breath gaunt knew what he would say could almost recite it i believe a median solution will see us where we all want to be i suggest that excuse me gaunt flashed a glance at the source of the interruption the special branch officer the assistant deputy director flicked a tongue gaunt thought it a snakes strike across his lips yes trevor not lifting his head speaking with a gentle welsh accent trevor said excuse me but i think you miss the essential do we trevor well thats a late but interesting contribution we are all busy men so perhaps you could enlighten us how do we miss the essential you have the floor gaunt thought it that sort of moment when men in waders stand in a wretched stream and identify the reward a trout and prepare to cast a fly over it but a damn great cormorant comes from the clear blue sky and nicks the fish his mood lightened and he anticipated amusement trevor said we are missing the essential i tell you what is our fear in the branch and the same fear will be mirrored at thames house that fear is the sleepers each time we go out on an arrest job i feel little elation the fear is not bred by what i know but what i dont know i am in ignorance of the sleepers how many where are they located what are their common factors i will answer each point there might be ten sleepers a hundred or a thousand i dont know they are located anywhere you choose to put a pin in a map in any major city or in any provincial town the common factors are that they swim unrecognized in our society are normal and ordinary in every outward facet of appearance and they hate us and all that we in this room seek to defend i go further in explanation of us missing the essentials with due humility we are told that a resourceful and valued man a coordinator of attacks is seeking covert entry to britain such a man does not waste his time and hazard his freedom if the individuals he will work with are of second or third grade he will only travel if he believes he will meet young men or women of dedication and skill and the purpose of his journey is to wake them who are they i dont know how do i find them i cant what is my assessment of their worth a team of sleepers can inflict guided by a strong hand damage to us not equalled since the blitz bombing of the s we have to find them he paused gaunt reflected that any of them round the table could have made that speech perhaps not with such celtic flourish and hit the same nails but none had no chair scraped no pencil was twirled no fist masked a yawn the branch man used his hands as if he spoke of something of childlike simplicity outstretched them said it like it was obvious to an idiot he takes us there arrest him at sea or in port and we will gain little because he will carry no laptop wont have a convenient and uncoded address book he leads us to this disparate cadre the new leaders are trained in counterinterrogation methods trained well and i doubt he would talk even without fingernails and with his testicles wired to the mains his is the road we follow lift him at sea or on a dockside and we would have the empty shell of a body and not his minds contents i suggest we permit him to land and we are with him under close and expert surveillance we let him run the silence into which only the welsh voice had intruded broke by god thats highoctane stuff exciting fascinating challenging a cell block filled with little scrotes sends a signal to whatever cave that bearded bastards in that were on top of him crushing him the assistant deputy director smacked the palm of his hand on the table i congratulate you trevor original thinking where we were lacking we let him run first class what i like everybody is involved special forces shadow at sea suffolk and norfolk are at the landfall creating a sanitized perimeter the service dennis are singing off the same hymn sheet as the branch trevor and will do the clever stuff the surveillance in cooperation i would like to suggest if there are no dissenters that i should chair a daily meeting of principals i think noon as good a time as any were a big family and so much the more effective when we pull together we let him run brilliant lets get it in place gentlemen lets do the detail gaunt stood and it seemed not to be noticed the photograph of anwar maghroub lay on the table and the women who did the shorthand had the details of ricky capels life and of the trawler that was called the anneliese royal and of the island he thought he had no longer a part to play he turned to gloria and almost imperceptibly raised an eyebrow then flicked a glance at the door he saw her smooth her skirt and drop her pad into her bag around the table there was a sudden explosion of voices a call to hereford and the alerting of the section on standby done staccato then poole notified a barked demand to constabulary headquarters for firearms officers to be pulled off all other duties no not sandringham a full muster of thames house guys and girls a branch people who did surveillance and bugs to be made ready special branch teams to be put together that afternoon gaunt moved towards the door gloria alongside him he saw from the corner of his eye the look on her face of suppressed fury her man put down then hung out to dry unwanted he stepped aside to let her go through the door before him a voice denniss piped behind him when you next call your island outstation freddie tell the rookie we want the departure time nothing more imperative that she does not show herself no intervention just sits on a sandcastle a mile back then bill the bloody man booming as if he were on a survival run in the brecons and tell her to keep old white feather clear not that he sounds like a hero right out of it they went up together and the lift was full neither spoke but in the corridor he said quietly they didnt want a doubter did they didnt want a thomas a sceptic such excitement such certainty what happens if they bloody lose him or never bloody find him what happens if we let him run screws up i think with our man across the water you get one chance and not to take it is a criminal act but they didnt want to hear that and they didnt want to hear what the professor up north told me eradicate from your mind the due process of law kill him itll rub off always does the gloss of excitement and you and i will then be behind a big high wall of sandbags ah well time to say it was all right when it left us we let him run i wouldnt have but my opinion was not requested what i think we need is a good strong cup of tea with sugar inside his office his sanctum he dropped his briefcase as if he had no more use of it dialled the number heard the ringing then her voice the faraway wind and the cry of gulls polly sat apart from him the phone was now back in her pocket when it had rung she had crawled away from him and gone down a gully where the wind couldnt reach her she had listened to freddie gaunts faint voice and thought she heard his exhaustion she had been left with the sense of a beaten man his back was to her he tracked and scanned with the binoculars over the dunes and the beach and watched the horizon the swing of his head behind the eyepieces was the only movement he made she did not know what the sex in the sleepingbag meant to her or what it meant to him and always the bloody wind was on her and the bloody rain she did not know she steeled herself came and eased down beside him but his hands stayed on the binoculars and he did not loop his arm round her polly said my people have decided what they want malachy i dont know how itll fit with you but its the way its going to be she saw that his eyes followed the waving of the coarse grass stems on the dunes you are without belittling your achievements outside the loop theyre all grateful in london of course weve moved on theres a plan in place it does not include you im sorry malachy but the concept of the plan is in concrete his head tilted and she could follow the lenses aim she saw the stark empty beach and thought he followed the flight of the gulls we have the name of a beam trawler when it left and which port it sailed from we have the identity of the boats skipper and his link to ricky capel the detail of the debt between the capel family and the rahman clan in blankenese more than that we can put a face and a biography to a big player in the international game terrorism hes the package to be lifted off here by the trawler we accept that parts of the jigsaw were put in place by you but thats history if it sounds brutal it is not intended to im just telling you how the facts play the binoculars were lifted she followed them and saw the mist haze among the furthest white splash of the waves and the grim grey line of clouds where the horizon met the water she had thought before gaunts call that she would go back to the swamp in the islands centre and try to make a peace with the old lunatic the recluse who had jarred her with the story of a concentration camp and victims and pump him for what he had seen during the day but now after the call she had no need of him or of malachy under no circumstances am i to intervene in the pickup that is a very clear order i watch and i report i do not go near them and i do not alert them i am told they should board the trawler however many there are and not know they are under observation i see at a distance the lights and i communicate that to london the plan drops into place and my role in all this is complete your role malachy is already finished and im on my way home the trawler will be tracked across the north sea will be under surveillance and will be allowed to drop off our target hes to be permitted to run in the greater interest of national security and lead the appropriate agencies god willing to those he would hope to meet and work with i dont wish to be cruel malachy but you should feel free to go back to the ferry get to the mainland take a shower and eat a meal and start again on whatever life it is you want to make for yourself those are my instructions a shaft of sunlight low narrow golden broke the cloud and fashioned a corridor over the surge of the sea ran to the whipped sands and the grasses and lit them his shoulders swung and he looked to his right away from her to the dunes damn you malachy ill not forget you or what youve done and who you are can you not say something hes to be permitted to run we dont intervene i have to watch and report isnt it enough for you what youve already done have you nothing to say nothing for me she saw his forehead knitted his concentration on the sands and grasses that made the dunes he was deep in holidayleave charts the bane of the life of a senior officer and waiting for him were overtime dockets when he heard the stampede of feet in the corridor johan konig saw his door snap open no knock of which his rank should have assured him a detective panted a step inside his room and hadnt a voice but beckoned him he took his time killed the computer page pulled his jacket from the hook and turned his back on the picture of the egret perched on a hippopotamus he locked the door after him he did not scurry down the corridor it was not in the book of konig good for juniors to see a ranking officer run but he felt a rising excitement although he had no idea of its source the detective led him to the new communications room he had demanded for his unit his whole team twelve men and two women were crowded inside and their attention was on a blackandwhite monitor screen none saw him come and none made way for him he elbowed his way through pushed forward he saw her a small figure the focus was poor from the camera in the roof of the neighbouring house he had only seen photographs of alicia rahman taken covertly for her husbands file and showing her with her children at the school gate he peered forward blinked to see better she was high on the roofing tiles of the house and her arms were looped round the width of a chimney stack the curtains of an open window flapped below she wore a robe at which the wind tore but either the buttons and the belt had not been fastened when she had come through the window and climbed or they had been ripped undone he saw her naked body and the scars which were vague on the picture but recognizable long darkened marks on her chest and on her stomach close to the dark hair mass and on her thighs the men and women around him all chosen for his unit because of hardened experience cursed what they saw goddamn animals bastards worse than animals barbarians theyve scraped her flayed the skin off her he turned away he had seen enough he tapped the shoulders of brigitte and heinrich told them they would come with him and asked for a car a van of uniformed officers an ambulance and a fire appliance with a crane and cradle he remembered the man on the fence his hands bleeding from the wire and their flight up the side path the silence of the man in the cells and his release into the care of the agent he had trusted rahman for all his skills has allowed himself to be provoked into making a mistake and the mistake will bring him down konig said quietly then swung on his heel cover yourself timo rahman cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted hide yourself he heard in the distance sirens in the streets of blankenese the bear was at the kitchen table his head in his hands sobbing the aunt leaned uselessly out of the open window he had not seen them but he imagined beyond the thick hedge and the high gates from the far side of the street his neighbours gathered to grandstand and stare what he could see was her legs long slim bare and wounded and the hair where he and she had made two daughters and her stomach the raw strips on her skin where blood seeped timo rahman yelled again come down you have to come down come down to the window the sirens closed on him at speed not when he had been stabbed not when he had been shot had he felt that sense of catastrophe surging round him developing as fast as the sirens approach get to the window get inside it is my order she stayed her feet scratched for a grip on the tiles and he could see the hair and her stomach and a breast hung clear of her robe but her arms had a grip on the chimney not a man or a woman since he had come to hamburg had refused an order of timo rahman the scale of the catastrophe facing him leaped in his mind he saw the collapse of an empire he heard the crash and wrench of metal turned from her and saw the front of the fire engine burst the gates the crane on it pulled down the branches of trees and snapped them carelessly he thought high over him and showing her nakedness to the world displaying what he had instructed should be done to her to clean her that her lips moved but the sirens destroyed the sound the last time and the shriek was desperation get back in the house come down you want the world to see you see rahmans wife the world did and what timo rahman saw was the fire engines crane rising with men and women in the cradle a policemans gun covered him as the bear and the aunt were brought out of the house under escort the cradle reached his wife and a blanket for modesty and warmth was wrapped round her a man walked towards him and swung handcuffs on their chain he recognized him the crane lowered the cradle he saw the shine of the handcuffs as they closed on his wrists with kindness his wife was helped into the ambulance and he watched it drive away between the flattened gates his world was broken he was led to the car he had thought if this moment ever came hands gripping his arms and handcuffs biting at his wrists that the chief man among them whom he had thought to be only a tax investigator would wear on his face a mask of gloating satisfaction but there was only impassive coldness a hand wrenched down his head so that his scalp would not hit the top of the car door and he was pushed inside if the man had shown triumph a little of timo rahmans dignity would have survived he sat low in the back seat and humiliation swam over him the consul general took the call what can i do for you dr konig im sorry that name again please miss polly wilkins i dont believe i know her she was here well i never saw her and ive never heard of her there is and i can emphatically state it no one of that name at my consulate i see i see well dr konig i suggest you contact our embassy in berlin i cant imagine where the confusion arose but i regret sincerely that i am unable to be of assistance miss wilkins is not on my staff is not here and i have no idea who or where she is if she were to arrive on my doorstep is there a message for her timo rahman is under arrest is that it if i ever meet her i will assuredly tell her good day dr konig he rang off he gazed bleakly through the window and out over the lake the thought in his mind was of betrayal promises broken contacts thrown to the winds he detested the presence on his premises of what he referred to as the shadows people he thanked his god that she had gone good riddance from the upstairs and permanently locked room to which he had no access and wondered where she was he was buzzed and warned his next appointment had arrived and he erased her and her business from his mind he was drawn back as if a rope pulled him oskar circled them he had been at the platform through the afternoon had cleared away the eiders carcass and had watched the birds renewal of confidence with death gone they had fed and preened but he had known that he would go back late as the suns shafts dipped and fell on the birds and made a brilliance of their plumage he had moved he had thought it as he had approached them and heard one dripping voice a small matter that he had done already the destruction of the light he had felt was of minimal importance he had looked for a larger gesture an act that would mitigate the shame on his family and the poison in his blood he saw the weapon and the steel case which was open and showed him the dials below an extended antenna moving on his stomach so slowly through the scrub and never pulling when a thorn caught him oskar was undecided as to whether to steal the radio or the firearm from the strangers who violated his paradise he did not know which was more vital to them the weapon or the radio their backs were to him to take either he must crawl from the scrubs cover if he had either the radio or the weapon he would go in the dusk the darkness to the home of the islands policeman who thought him a malcontent a troublemaker who would be confounded and would offer fulsome gratitude he had to expose at least his arms head and shoulders if he were to stretch far enough to snatch away the weapon or the radio one talked not a tongue that oskar netzer knew and the other taller lay close to him and was on his side seemed not to respond and might have slept the blackness of the evening was fast coming he did not feel the brittle twig blown away long before by a storm that was dry from the cover of the scrub oskar did not feel it against his stomach and through the thickness of his outer coat he wriggled to go closer he knew that from exertion his old lungs croaked for breath that rattled in his throat and he tried to suppress the wheeze his fingers were perhaps ten centimetres from the weapon but more than twenty from the radio with what he believed to be the greatest caution he brought a knee forward and felt a creaking pain in his joint then squirmed forward he saw the gap his fingers to the weapon shorten he heard the twig snap he was going back thorns caught him he struggled to plunge deeper into the cover the crescendo of gunfire burst over him and he felt numbing shock in his arm his shoulder his hip he went deep into the thorn thicket he heard shouting men blundered in the scrub but had only the small beam of a torch to guide them the wetness of his blood was in his hand he lay as if dead malachy had jerked upright the sound had come on the wind three single shots not on automatic when he started to move into darkness towards where three shots had been fired she clung to his coat it is nothing to do with us she hissed we do not intervene with both hands she held his coat fists buried in it he listened heard the surf break and the whine of the wind chapter nineteen he no longer pulled against her grip he could have struck out could have broken free malachy did not struggle and he could feel her fingers clenched in the sleeve of his coat if he had thought it necessary but he did not he could have swiped at her face with his other hand he allowed her to hold him and controlled his breathing he thought she would believe that he had given up on the struggle unequal against her it was three four minutes since they had heard three shots fired she would not have known it but all of his studied concentration was on the memory of where the gunfire had come from one shot would have been hard for him to make the equations of the direction but three were sufficient in his mind as he relaxed his arm and let it sag for her a line was drawn to his right he estimated that the shots had been fired at a little more than a quarter of a mile from him and perhaps three hundred yards back from where the soft sand marked the end of the dunes and the scrub the start of tire drop to the beach he reckoned that he lulled her im not blaming you she said a small voice against the wind you have to see malachy the big picture its beyond you now dont think after what youve done and where youve been that im not sympathizing but and ive told you you have to let it go the big picture is supreme he knew it there was a slackening in her fingers grip he thought that what she had said no blame her sympathy was utterly and clearly genuine the darkness seemed to malachy to have come fast sun sunk clouds heavier and he could see only the outline of her face but he had felt on his skin little sharp pants of breath as she had spoken of the big pictures supremacy you have to bottle it down swallow it hear me youve done more than anyone could have asked of you i only know the bones of your history malachy but i am telling you that no one could have done more to get back what youve lost if you say that you dont know what happened in that shit place in iraq i am believing you already you have the right to walk tall god that sounds crap now forget whats personal and see the wider scape youre not a fool malachy youre not a selfish man one of her hands now rested on his sleeve the fingers had straightened out and were no longer deep in the material it would have hurt him to hit her he could make out the upper point of the dune crest behind him but the gully beside it was lost locked in his memory he had the imagined line that would take him to a point where a weapon had fired three single shots where ricky capel was he had no doubt of it ricky capel was at the extremity of the line in his mind she lifted his arm and he let her and her lips brushed the skin at the wrist then she lowered his arm he made no resistance she said with gentleness im out of prague there was a guy but its long ago do you think you could get down there malachy to prague god im doing the running cant you help me and see me there walk around a bit eat a bit sleep a bit id said to myself after tonight that id go my way and youd go yours doesnt have to be like that im saying id like it malachy if you came down to prague maybe there was a wetness behind her spectacles in her eyes she had them off he saw the dull white of her handkerchief and he sensed she wiped hard at her eyes and then her head turned away from him as if even in darkness she did not care to show her emotion he was gone away he had not needed to hit her he rolled fast clear of her was on his knees then pushed himself upright stamped his shoes for grip and sand spat from under them he threw the pistol behind him towards her he was into the gully that cut past the crest of the dune he heard her damn you you bastard for gods sake its not about you its for hundreds of people you bastard malachy kitchen didnt you hear what i said the big picture up the gully on to a path that was narrow enough for the thorn to catch his coat malachy ran i found nothing ricky stumbled back and down into the sheltered hollow then tripped on his own feet falling arm out he caught at a branch and tightened his fist then squealed because he had hold of thorns the pencil beam of the small torch approached him you got the light dean dont know what im looking for but i found nothing he heard a murmur but could not make out what he was told his ears rang still with the blast of the weapons discharge like he was goddamn deaf the beam came close then wavered and fell on the depth of the scrub bloodstains were on the ground below the canopy of leaves from blundering in the thornbushes rickys face and arms were scratched his coat and the waterproof trousers ripped the gun had been fired beside his face inches from his ears it had been so fast last thing he had heard was a twig dry breaking and there had been the convulsion of movement beside him then the hammer of the gun and he had been heaved to his feet by a hand on his collar not able to make out the command given him had not known what he looked for had found nothing he gazed down at the blood then the torchs beam veered away who was he what did you see no answer was given him that he could under stand what was said was a whisper to him no point staying quiet you woke the damn dead his hand was grabbed for a moment he recoiled then realized it the grip on his hand was iron tight the panic was in him and he was about to lash out because fear made fury when he felt the smooth shape of the handle against his fingers he clamped on it took the weight of the radio in his hand right you tell me where is he again the whisper havent you got it i cant hear nothing he stood and shivered and the shape moved around him as if he checked the ground for anything they had left there the light came close again a dull narrow beam and it showed the crushed grass then shone on the barrel tip of the weapon then started to move off ricky had to run two three strides to catch the man the radios case banged against his knee and he swore then raised his free arm and took hold of the shoulder in front of him it wasnt bloody clever i dont do mouthing off but it was not clever to fire that bloody gun dont get me wrong im not a frightened man but you could have brought all hell down on us and that is not clever who was it creeping up on us did you see him im asking and ive the right to ask what he heard in the clamour at his ears a hiss of breath through teeth as if he was shushed like he was a kid talking out of turn they were on a path and they climbed and the beam lit a jolting patch of ground in front of each of deans steps and the torch was held low down if he had not held on to deans shoulder he would have spilled off the path and fallen into the scrub for a moment the beam lifted and found a strip of torn cloth and there they had to push their way him first and ricky following between thorns he had pain but the fear was worse when had ricky capel last known fear worse than pain couldnt bloody remember it he saw the face the face was on the pavement and the street light fell on it he thought the face followed him the face from bevin close and now it tracked him three shots fired blood on the ground no body not a scream and not a whimper he thought the face laughed at him bad fear stalked ricky capel like the face did he clung to the shoulder hung on to it as a blind man would never before not as a child had he felt bad fear and he thought the man came after him dripped blood and followed him he strained to listen for the footfall behind him but in his ears was only the ring the clamour of the gunshots i screwed up polly said i screwed up big she sat hunched her chin on her knees and the phone pressed to her face i cant believe it how pathetic i was the darkness enveloped her clung round her hed answered her call now gaunts silence echoed back at her i gave him the party line i called it the big picture what im saying freddie is that i thought hed accepted it you know his little concerns outweighed by the needs of the masses he didnt argue three shots were fired somewhere out in this bloody place god knows where but id given him the instruction no intervention sit watch and report he listened seemed to swallow what i gave him then quit on me i dont know where he is freddie it is so damn dark here you cant see the end of your nose and i dont know what hes going to do id given him a gun pretty damn stupid you dont have to tell me but he chucked it back at me like he wouldnt be needing it whats in his mind i just dont know she was the daughter of schoolteachers it had been drilled into polly wilkins that to admit failure own up to error won its own rewards in heaven most colleagues who had shared desks with her at vauxhall bridge cross she thought would have wormed wriggled from admission of failure and error the response in her ear was a long measured sigh she reckoned it not of anger but the sadness of disappointment i will of course do what i can to give due warning of any pickup i have to say that a lift off the beach will not be fun its a foul evening and its not changing whats worst freddie i miss him it was sort of good having him here what i realize hes not missing me just dumped me a bloody used fag carton i dont know where its going nothing much else to say i wont be here myself but calls to this number will be routed to the necessary people thank you wilco he knew what she meant frederick gaunt could empathize knew what it felt to be a bloody used fag carton and dumped he rang off pressed the button that deactivated the phones scrambler he sensed that gloria hovered behind him and thought her mouth would be slack with astonishment it was he believed a defining moment of his adult life i wont be here myself he could have reflected on other such moments of importance that had fashioned his career and domestic existence a loveless marriage the bitter process of divorce children taught to reject him the first night of utter loneliness in an old mans bachelor apartment the initial occasion when the wmd report had been smartly returned to his desk for reappraisal the meeting when he had been lectured on the requirement of politicians to find meat and not scrag ends in the iraqi desert the summons to an office on an upper floor the averted eyes and barked voice telling him that albania was his new area of interest the last session in the pub with his old team before they were scattered to the winds he could have reflected on any of them and could have claimed each of them as a defining moment top of the heap and he knew it was telling pretty little polly frozen half to death on a godawful beach that calls to this number will be routed through to the necessary people he heard her clear her throat a brief cough to demand his attention did you mean that he said peevishly turning to face her if i said it gloria i expect that i meant it her face was wreathed in bewilderment she stuttered its coming to an end its the last hours its what youve worked for and it is not my dear in my hands you owe it to polly to be here i owe very little not even pocket change to anyone lines creased her forehead and mouth but the threat what about the threat he stared into the confusion of her eyes someone elses problem now pollys problem a crisis committees problem but i fancy not mine i have gloria carried the problem of the bloody threat too damn long its been a lifetime of carrying it cold war threat irish threat iraq threat alqaeda threat you name i t dont you understand that the threat has buckled me every day every night the threat is on my shoulders well not any more i never thought id hear it not from you he grimaced then shrugged he saw her turn on her low heels and she clattered out the door was slammed which would not have been accidental he went to the wardrobe against the wall slipped off his jacket unbuttoned his waistcoat and loosened his tie the man malachy kitchen was without corporate baggage and was not answerable to a crisis committee or to the party line peddled by polly wilco wilkins gaunt dragged his laces undone and kicked off his shoes dropped his waistcoat on to them unhooked the braces and let his trousers fall he opened the wardrobes doors and took out a hanger which carried the name of a singapore hotel from where he had appropriated it a dozen years before and put his suit on it he took another hanger from the intercontinental in helsinki for his shirt he remembered what the old lady had said as he had taken tea with her of a man who did not boast and did not go after trophies who faced challenges each of them harder than the last to claw back his selfrespect and she had said if you ever see him you give him my love and he remembered what bill who had the rippled muscles of special forces training and who arrogantly wore a shapeless cabled sweater had demanded of wilco and tell her to keep old white feather clear not that he sounds like a hero right out of it he realized he rooted more for the man the free spirit than for the big picture and it was better he was gone and soon from an old rucksack on the wardrobe floor he took a shirt trousers and sweater all caked in dried mud boots and a rainproof coat that had overtrousers folded into an inner pocket he dressed hitched the rucksack on to his shoulder and went out through the darkened outer office past glorias cleared desk and past the phones from which polly wilkinss next message would be routed to the crisis folk gaunt had the look of a jobbing gardener on his way to an allotment plot as he made his way to the lift and he imagined the pleasure ahead of him and did not know or care of chaos left behind him oskar left behind him the ducks his true friends safe in the darkness from predators he crawled on the track he had set himself a target that he must reach and the pain that had overcome the shock of numbness was alive in the three wounds on his body but he welcomed it if there had been no pain only exhaustion and weakness he would have felt a clinging urge to settle in the mud and reeds beside the pond and sleep and if he slept he would not achieve his target first he had lain in the scrub and had heard voices and crashing movement around him but a thin torchlight had not pierced the depths of the thorn bushes that had been his immediate refuge they had gone they had blundered away and then he had moved sometimes he had been on his stomach but a few times he had been able to stand sway stagger and he had known that when he was on his feet he lost more blood and with each step the pain was more acute he thought the pain was his penance he thought the blood he lost was contaminated by an old atrocity he thought he deserved the pain for the evil done by a man whose blood he shared he thought he had cleansed himself by breaking the light set in place by the strangers who had come and threatened paradise oskar had no clarity of thought because the pain destroyed it he had told the ducks in a reedy bubbling whisper that he would not be back now he did not have the strength to stand to walk he might have the strength if god were with him to crawl part of the way to his target on his knees and elbows but first he would wriggle on his stomach and lever himself forward he prayed that the strength little of it left would last him above him the wind sighed and the rain spattered down and he writhed on the path made slow agonizing progress and left behind a trail of poisoned blood ahead was a distant light his target if his strength lasted he sat on the bench in the cell his belt and shoe laces had been taken from timo rahman he sat because if he had stood and paced the cell he would have had to hold up his trousers or let them slump to his ankles a light protected by wire mesh beamed down at him from the ceiling the cell stank of old faeces urine and vomit it was cold bitterly so because the high barred window was open to the wind and rain dripped from its aperture on to the prisoner on the bench bed he was offered no respect no deference his lawyer had sat beside him in the interview room he had been shown a preliminary report from a police doctor that listed his wifes injuries on half of a single sheet of paper the lawyer german gross and expensive had read the report first and timo had seen him wince he had known then that the man on his payroll for nine years would have little stomach for a fight in his defence and had not challenged the right of konig to put his questions only three of them had timo rahman himself attacked his wife if he had not himself attacked her had he authorized the scrapingoff of skin from her body if he had not himself authorized the attack did he know who was responsible for the assault he had been told that his housekeeper and chauffeur were in custody and would subsequently be interviewed and that their statements would be matched with his he had not answered any of the three questions if they had given him the respect that was due he would have expected johan konig and the woman officer with him to demonstrate frustration but the coldness he had seen at his home was still alive in their faces and the contempt his lawyer had fled the interview room after leaving him little hope of bail isolation settled on him timo rahman did not think of the island or of the man he had been paid to ship across the water or of ricky capel who he now realized had lied to him a lie he had taken in a lie that would destroy him he thought of wolves in his mind were the wolves that came down long ago from the mountains emaciated foulbreathed bare to the skin at the haunches and tail from mange and they circled a failing fire corralled inside the fence were goats with kids and ewes with lambs he sat with his father beside the fire and darkness masked the high ground above the village near shkodra across his knee held tight was a loaded singlebarrel shotgun and his father had an old german rifle and they could hear the wolves and smell them when the wolves were closest and the smell was bad when they were boldest from the hunger pangs of winter the wolves came right up against the fence and then his father would hurl at them the branch from the fire that burned brightest and they would scatter but they would return always a dog wolf led there had been a year when the high snows had lasted into spring and beyond the time that the kids and lambs were born and starvation had been the enemy of the wolf pack the pack leader had not been driven back by fire his father had shot it as it prepared to launch at the fence with his gewehr mauser rifle and it had fallen dead with a head wound the goats and ewes the kids and lambs had stampeded and screamed with fear his father had gripped his arm had pointed to the downed packleader face alive with excitement father and son they had watched first the wolves had fled to the darkness then had been emboldened had circled in the shadows and scurried forward many targets but his father had not fired the wolves had torn apart th carcass of their pack leader had fought to eat rip swallow savage it timo the boy had watched power gone and when nothing was left on the ground beyond the fence not a bone or a meat scrap no fur not a morsel of skin the wolves had retreated to the nights safety he had never forgotten the sight and sounds of the destruction of a fallen pack leader that evening they would be circling wolves would be abroad would be coming near to a mansion in the blankenese suburb would be edging closer to casinoe and shops bars and brothels in the reeperbahn would be marching on more casinos and more shops more bars and more brothels in the steindamm he had done it himself he a leader of a wolf pack had buried germans and put russians into the trunks of cars word would have spread if it were tax evasion or the corruption of local officials living from the rewards of vice or sextrade trafficking or involvement with an islamic group for which he was investigated then his lawyer would have fought tooth and claw to win his freedom but he was investigated for the peeling of live skin from his wifes body who would stand by him who would believe he could return to a preeminence of power he saw wolves wolves were on a cellblock landing when he returned from exercise in the yard wolves moved into casinos and shops bars and brothels he seemed to feel the heat of wolves breath and the smell of it because he had believed a lie and they edged nearer and their teeth were bared timo rahman screamed he was not heard the cells walls closed around him a europol advisory landed on tony johnsons desk he had his coat on and was preparing himself for the evening struggle on a commuter train when the clerk brought it to him it already had a halfdozen sets of initials on it but what else to expect in this perfect bloody world it would end with him and he was to field it his eyes scanned the single page and he gasped shook and flicked it into his intray for the next mornings attention then he punched the air for a detective sergeant with a reputation deserved for carrying equally weighted chips on each of his shoulders and for spreading contagious gloomy defeatism wherever he walked his stride down the corridor was emphatic with cheerful energy that morning he had repeated his refrain at the weekly meeting of colleagues to hack at current problems that drugs and organized crime and their effect on the great mass of the capital citys punters were on the backburner ignored and victim to the swollen resources pushed at the war on terror at the groundfloor lobby swiping his card he blew a kiss at the lady on reception and saw the shock wobble on the face of the duty guard beside her he went out through the swing doors and on to the street imagined he heard the guards question god whats the matter with that miserable beggar and imagined he heard the ladys answer must be that hes got hot flushes or hes on a bloody good promise or its the lottery what he could have told them was that a europol advisory had reached his desk and stated that police in hamburg had arrested the albanian national timo rahman on charges of grievous bodily harm and wounding and that officers on the case urgently requested cooperation from european colleagues on all links between rahman and criminal organizations for immediate investigation while rahman was in custody and vulnerable what he could also have told them on the reception desk was that he had contributed damned if he knew the detail of how to the life of an untouchable going into the gutter on the pavement he turned heads as he laughed to himself like a maniac you done us proud malachy i hope youve a drink in your hand because thats what you deserve youve done us proper proud i hope its a damn great drink and then another malachy had rainwater in his eyes ears nose had it weighing down the clothes on his back and his legs he quartered ground was inland from the highest dunes he moved alternately slow and fast when he went slowly it was to listen because he could see so little and then he shook his head hard his fingers went into his ears to gouge out the wet but he heard only the winds bluster and the pattering of the rain when he went fast he held to what he believed was the line towards the source of the gunfire and often he thought he had lost it and that his instinct failed him going fast on a track his shoes with their worn tread slid from under him he fell went down the breath squeezed out of his chest and his hands flailed when they hit the mud it was not tackiness they found but something slicked wet but not like mud malachy felt the surface of the path realized its smoothness as if mud had been pressed flat by a solid weight and then the slick had been left he could not see more than the outline of his hands but there was darkness on his palms he believed that it was blood and that the mud had been smoothed by a mans body he thought where he was a wounded man had rested then crawled forward but malachy did not follow the trail and he tried again to find his line he came to the pond a little of the reflection of the water shone back at him through the reeds he saw as a silhouette the shape of the viewing platform where he had put his shoulder against a support post in a crash of noise and he froze ducks fled splashed beat their wings screamed and he could smell the body of the old man as he had done at the platform malachy had warned her that it was a crime to involve others and risk hurting them she had involved the old man had picked at his isolation with honey words and pleading eyes and he had been shot and crawled towards a refuge she had rounded on him what did he think she had done with him if not involve him he had said ill pick up my own pieces he would she sweet girl warm girl with a taste of sadness did not own him nor did those who controlled her in his mind he adjusted the line he came to a hollow he found a plastic bag caught on thorns and near it a cellophane packet that would have held a shopbought sandwich maybe it was because the cloud weakened in its density and a trickle of the moons light came through but small shapes gleamed and then their brightness died he picked up three discarded cartridge cases on his hands on his knees feeling with his fingers he found the trail they had used and the indents in the mud later malachy came to the first marker a strip of cloth tied to a branch he wanted to stand barefaced in front of a mirror with brilliant light shining on his skin and coming back from his eyes he wanted as he had not done for a year and a half to examine that face and those eyes to search for a truth and know himself again he would not know himself until he had hounded down ricky capel on the beach ahead where the sea stampeded the waves then not before he would learn if he was a coward and the word beat in his head as he went forward and looked for the next marker may the old man walking towards the sandbags at the gate was hazed by the high sun on sentry duty with machinegun baz had called for sergeant mcqueen to come double bloody quick time to bravos gate the old man came slowly on the raised road from the village hobbled forward and used a stick in his right hand to ease his weight scanning him with binoculars hamish mcqueen had called for the major to get soonest from the operations bunker to the gate the old man was alone wizened and an sa assault rifle dangled from his left hand and against his thigh half hidden by his robe do i slot him sir baz asked and his eye was against the sight of the machinegun his finger flexed on the triggers guard i dont think so no it was for the major the commanding officer of bravo company a moment of extreme inconvenience his place was in the bunker where his clerks had for him a mountain of paper he watched the old man and the rifle he carried through the binoculars growing clarity in two hours he was due to welcome to bravo the advance force of the infantry unit that would relieve them after their sixmonth tour of duty like a hole in his skull he needed the distraction of an old man coming to their main gate he had laid down that the relieving force would not find justification for even a damned small complaint at the state of the camp left for them the old man carried a weapon that was not used by the ragtag fighters in his area of responsibility they had the ak and its variants but had against his leg a rifle that was exclusively used by british soldiers the sa he checked that his interpreter was behind him saw faisal leaning against the back of the sandbags smoking the major prided himself that he was blessed with a nose for danger for the last week he had cut back on the companys patrolling had reduced it to force protection guaranteeing the security of bravos perimeter and had withdrawn any troop movements from the village he had dreaded losing a jock for nothing in the last hours of th deployment wanted all of them on the flight home to briz norton he sensed no danger on his belt was a service pistol and he unclipped the holsters flap he told baz the machinegunner to cove him and asked that hamish mcqueen be at his side he waved for the interpreter to follow him he walked down the entry road to bravos gates then strode briskly along the road to meet the old man he ducked his head smiled and introduced himself through his interpreter the old man transferred the rifle ponderously to his other hand juggled it with his stick and gave his name he shook the majors fist with a good but bony grip then gave him the rifle on its stock was the reference number in white paint he knew it every man in the unit bloody knew it a lost highvelocity weapons reference number had been dinned into the heads of every jock nco and officer who had been tasked for house searches since the lateafternoon patrol of january its recovery had been an unfulfilled priority he gave it to his sergeant for checking and making safe the interpreter murmured in his ear the gentleman mahmoud alajouti has heard that the british persons are going back to their country and thought it correct this weapon be returned it is his apology that it has not been done before please tell mr alajouti that i am grateful he remembered with the clarity of yesterday and not of three months before what he had seen that day and what he had been told and the gist of what he had said put him somewhere in isolation where he cant infect anyone else i dont know how youd ever get shot of it being called a coward i cant imagine theres any way back the man had been sitting on a chair outside the command bunker head hangdog expressionless silent he had heard from the vine that the man had been shipped home but his failing was talked of still in every mess and barrack room used by the battalion would you ask mr alajouti in what circumstances the rifle came into his possession what he was told through the hesitant voice of the interpreter first confused the major then rocked him the soldiers came up the street where mr alajouti lives above his place of business a bakery shop they knew everybody in the street knew that an ambush was prepared was ready for the next soldiers the next patrol to come on the street his son his son is called tariq he had brought heavy stones footballsized stones into the home above the shop and had a window open enough to throw them down mr alajouti did not know of the stones and he was in the back of his home with his wife and his younger children tariq is the eldest of his children he does not think blame should be given to his son tariq because all of the older children in the village are encouraged by men of the mehdi army followers of the imam to hate soldiers he regrets that a soldier stopped outside mr alajoutis shop his son told him afterwards that is how he knows it the soldier was lying on the ground and his son that is tariq threw down a stone and it hit the soldiers neck which was not protected by the edge of his helmet the stone the size of a football stunned the soldier that is he was made unconscious it was just after a grenade had been fired into the wall near the window where tariq was his son mr alajouti at the back did not know this at that time went down the stairs and opened the door of the shop he took the rifle and took the stone back into the shop the rifle it was hidden under his bed and the stones he took to the yard at the rear where they had come from from a wall that had fallen for sixteen weeks the rifle was under his bed because his son was frightened of having taken it and was frightened of giving it to the mehdi army yesterday mr alajoutis wife found the rifle yesterday he questioned his son yesterday he found the truth is certain it is the truth of how the rifle came to his sons room and of how the soldier was made senseless he begs forgiveness for his son he is ashamed for what his son did he begs it is not spoken of in the village his returning the rifle if it is spoken his life will be taken by the mehdi army he hopes it is enough that he has returned the rifle that his son will not be punished later children came they took the soldiers helmet and the coat against bullets it is the flakjacket mr al ajouti apologizes for the action of his son he wishes you well on your return to britain to your families the major said curtly i am grateful to mr alajouti and i can assure him that his son will not be punished and that the taking of the rifle will not be spoken of from his hip pocket the major took a wad of dinar notes probably the equivalent of what was put over the counter in a village bakery in a week and pressed them into the boneribbed hand the old man bobbed his gratitude then turned then started out on the raised road to return to the village his bakery shop and his home the major strode towards the sandbags the machinegun and the gate his words snapped from the side of his mouth i think faisal it is a matter that is dead buried if you were to speak of it you would betray the trust placed in you by the british army and your employment would cease understood hamish it is a business best forgotten i think your role and mine in the affair concerning allegations made against mal kitchen would not now sustain close examination yes best forgotten forgotten sir already forgotten found on wasteground hidden there handed in by a local who was unable to give an exact location thatll fit the paperwork no medals for digging up the past none sir ill see the word goes round found on wasteground they walked back through the gate bravos major returned to his bunker and the preparations for withdrawal he had names but no identity he had been anwar maghroub born into affluence in a suburb of alexandria but the character of the child was lost the voice behind him beat at the back of his head what im telling you dean and true ill be so damn bloody pleased to be finished with this if youd told me anyone had a month ago that id be flogging myself through this place cold like ive never known it and hungry id have told them to go jump he had also been sami a student of engineering with a girl and with friends who understood the rigour of sacrifice but the personality of the pupil had gone a month ago i wouldnt have thought i could do this go through it and still be on my feet wouldnt have been able to not without having a friend with me and its because im tough its what makes me a leader others come to me and know that ill lead them lazy sods all of them and feeding off me they feed off my brains and my energy he had been abu khaled conspirator and activist in the organization who had studied and learned the lessons of success in attack and failure in security but that mans mind was outdated and finished with because of you what ive learned from you i am telling you that things are going to be different when im back up and running damn different no passengers in my team and no bloodsuckers slim and lean thats what you are and thats what im going to be and ahead of the game in my crowd theyll have one chance and if its blown then theyre out out on their bloody arses best thing that ever happened to me was meeting up with you and thats gods truth im surrounded by passengers and suckers but not for long theyll scream but i wont be listening he had been dean goalkeeper for a team he had not heard of who listened without response to the ramblings of an idiot but the character personality mind of that fantasy had never existed ive got my cousins three of them giving me grief ive got old percy whos all disrespect and what i know is that he loathes me ive got mikey and sharon thats my parents and they live bloody well off my back ive got joanne and wayne hes only a kid and doesnt know better but shes got the hump with me and theres a bloody great crowd like a spider web they all live off me im telling you theres changes coming i like a lot about you but i like most that you go alone i reckon its class to go alone you and me its good were together he was now milan draskic who held a slovenian passport and was a coordinator and sent to erase failures of security and to drive home success in attack but he had not yet learned to live inside the thoughts and skin of that man and they had come past the five marker cloths he had left on branches he stopped dead and gazed forward not at the whitecaps and the surf not at the horizon and the idiot cannoned into him he saw at the top of the dune in front of him the three legs of his tripod but not the flashlamp whats up he said quietly with his hand shielding his voice that the flashlamp as he had left it was gone from the tripod whats that mean he said his words protected from the wind that he had built the tripod in daylight so that it would be secure fastened the flashlamp to it and aimed its face to the sea he had lashed it in place by daylight so that its beam would be steady when it was used he heard the first sliver of the idiots panic well you didnt tie it tight enough did you got to bloody find it havent you didnt allow for the bloody gale did you he sank down into the softness of the sand and felt with his hands and the grains ran through his fingers but the flashlamp was not at the base of his tripods stakes got to be there hasnt it got to be cant have bloody walked off can it the idiot was beside him on his knees and his hands were sweeping at the sand and the idiot squealed cut my bloody self on glass it wasnt the wind christ it wasnt that shifted it his fingers found the flashlamp buried and they ran over shards from its face and touched the broken end of the bulb where it went into the socket the panic became more shrill no light how the fuck are they going to find us out in this shitheap how they going to get to us whatll guide them you fucked up putting the light up and leaving it fucked up bigtime no light how they going to bring the boat in he had only the pencil torch and a beam with a range of only a few metres its all round us dont know where the old jerk you shot the guy who came over the fence and i lied about him all round us and we dont know how close cant bloody see them watching us how we going to get off of here you know it and i know it theyre watching us and round us maybe close enough to bloody touch us what we going to do he pulled the radio set over the sand slipped the clasp on the case opened it threw the switch reached out and dragged the idiot close he felt the shaking fear and he listened he heard only the sets static whine and the winds buffeting you are taking a hell of a chance dad a chance with me in the dinghy with my boy with the boat with yourself you know that dad and now youre saying theyve no light going in with that dinghy its going to be six shades of hell i reckon its one run thats all i cant be stooging there not in that surf theyll have to be out in the water deep enough so i dont snag the outboard and have to be ready how am i going to find them if theres no light is the money that good have you thought dad of just turning round and getting on home what harry rogers knew as he listened to the carp of his son was that he required two fathoms minimum of draught under the keel of the anneliese royal and twelve feet of water would put him a minimum of four hundred yards from the beach the dinghy would need three feet of water and it would not come closer than a hundred yards from the beach the trawler and the dinghy would both be bucking in swell the low clouds and the rains mist would screw his view of the tg buoy and the accumer ee light and he needed both to get in near he reckoned he was three hours from getting far enough to the island to launch the dinghy and the chart in the wheelhouse showed him sunken wrecks sunken obstructions and supposedly cleared areas of dumped explosives there were gas pipes and telephone lines under them and if they snagged one of those bastards by going off course they were screwed they were on the northern edge of a section marked as submarine exercise area not that in these sea conditions a periscope would be slotting up the boat yawed fell into troughs and climbed waves and his grandson was again retching at the bucket harry said i thought about it yes ditching them but thats not my way ill use my light keep it on you while youre taking the dinghy in and theyll have to shift themselves and come to you thats what i told them cant do better you want to hear me say it ill say it i would not dare to ditch ricky capel and thats more important than the fact that i gave my word he was close enough to hear them malachy thought it the perfect battleground he had been drawn to the right place alone to stand and fight unseen by any witness he felt a great calm and peace and he thought a road ended here and that he was within sight of a pyramids summit he rested his fingers on the dogtags at his throat chapter twenty he saw the light riddled with cramp in his stomach pain in his hips and knees sand in his throat that he had to endure and not cough out malachy saw the lights blast out to sea not a brilliant light but one that was misted and confused by cloud and rain but a clear enough beacon to those watching for it it was not aimed at the shore but was directed upwards and bounced back from the cloudbanks and rolled cavorted rocked as if its platform were unstable he thought the trawler on which it was mounted was shaken by the violence of the swell he realized from the light on the cloud ceiling that the boat edged towards the shore where the surf ran near to him separated from him by the blunt sand summit of a dune he heard a little yell of excitement the voice of ricky capel he had felt lying twenty paces from him the fear of the man the fear had been on capels tongue in the whine of his voice and it had grown because he had sensed that he was watched as the hours had passed malachy had felt the mans fear tighten he had known his own fear when he had walked without a weapon and without a helmet or flakjacket down a narrow street in a village with the sun low and scorching his eyes it had been the fear of the man that had sustained him as he had lain in the sand among the dunes grasses he heard now a sharp hiss for quiet and the excitement was stifled the other man had shown malachy no sign of fear he heard low grunts from them both and sensed they stood far away to his left if he raised his head malachy could see the scattered lights of the village and in the near sea if he strained and peered between the bent grasses there were two marker buoys in the hours he had been in place he had learned to recognize the sequences of their flashes one red and one green but the light further towards the horizon beyond the surf bursts had greater strength there were the lights of the village the lights of the buoys the light from the trawler but the rest of the scope of malachys vision showed him nothing more than black darkness he had thought the world had emptied that only he and two men existed and one was beyond the area of his interest as he watched the lights malachy did not recognize polly wilkinss big picture neither did he listen any longer to the contempt of a host of soldiers and a psychiatrist and his wife and a man who ran a business for buying and selling houses he involved no one was owned by no one he flexed his muscles and readied himself when they moved he would follow he heard above the wind the whine dont we get moving i knew hed come hes a good boy my harry is shouldnt we shift down there he heard over the rains beat the response not yet too early they wont hang about for us you know it is too soon malachy realized the authority of the second man he was polly wilkinss target the second man governed the big picture malachy heard the authority spoken softly men he knew it who had authority rarely found it necessary to raise a voice never shouted did not whine he thought the man joined at the hip to ricky capel was burdened he watched the light its beam on the clouds approach the beach he was silent did not dare to speak ricky stood in the force of the wind and saw the light come closer then he shuddered shook he was ricky capel he ran a part of southeast london he was the big man and guys backed off from him he was above grief too big a man to be given disrespect he did not snivel did not cower yes i hear you dean and im saying it as well its not yet its too early to move too soon watching the light he shed from his mind the source of the fear that had nagged eaten at him all the hours they had waited a man stalked him a man followed him straining into the darkness and seeing the roll of the light up and against the cloud the thought of the man was wiped from his mind squinting he saw the light beyond the dim beach expanse and the cresting lines of the surf hed be wading into it into the force of the waves that was what harry had said into that bloody sea in bloody darkness but he was ricky capel and he was a big man the wind hammered against him and would have pitched him back if he had not held tight to the arm beside him should stay patient i dont reckon we should move too soon thats my opinion the light shone out ahead of her and was away to her right and she made her calculation on the point of the beach it approached methodically polly rolled the sleepingbag and the sand in it filled the rucksack and wriggled its straps over her shoulders then she hit the combination of buttons on her mobile for a secure call and dialled she heard it ring out twice before an automated voice not freddie gaunts informed her that she was being diverted it was answered crisply without preamble she was asked to speak its out there the light i cant be exact its dark as hell and i dont know the sea but i estimate it about a mile offshore damn damn theyve killed the light it was there was coming in i suppose it was on long enough to alert the target group b u t there was criticism she should not estimate or suppose facts were required of her she swore under her breath soundless she could not estimate why gaunt had done it to her could not suppose why he had quit on her there was a light offshore on for eight minutes at the moment it was switched off the light was one nautical mile from the tideline they wanted bullshit they would get it she did not know whether the light had been visible for six minutes or nine minutes neither did she know the length of a nautical mile nor see the tideline she imagined them round a table crowded with phones consoles and screens with maps dominating their rooms walls and she was asked for the location of kitchen dont know and that is neither an estimate nor a supposition i have not the faintest idea where he is so as you understand it is pitch bloody black out here and it is peeing with rain and blowing a gale he could be a mile away or ten yards away and that is a fact it is also a fact that i have not been issued with nightvision equipment the cold cut through polly but they would not have been interested in that she was asked what were kitchens intentions when he left her cant estimate and cant suppose not a clue i will call you on further developments out a career gone down the drain perhaps her teeth rattled as she shivered perhaps did she give a damn if a career was lost maybe she pocketed the phone polly wondered if she now had the status of being a flagged pin on a wall map she scrambled down off the dune and tumbled to the start of the loose sand that the sea never reached she was perplexed that she had not seen an answering light from away to her right on a point of high ground did not understand that could not reckon how the trawler would be guided in or the men to be picked up would be floundering in water would be battered by the surf and was confused she went slowly and carefully below the dunes and above the beach stopped to listen then went on stopped again it hurt so bloody much that freddie gaunt had quit on her makes you think doesnt it the last chap here his feet where we are wagons out at the front with everything he and his family own and hes looking around at all thats familiar then hes going to the door and going to nail it shut after him and then hell be joining his neighbours in flight and the enemy is over the hill not quite literally but the barbarians are at the gates and this is where he stood for the last time it no longer rained and the wind had slackened frederick gaunt knelt in the pit and the high lights glistened the mud and he scraped with his trowel at the edge of the small patch of uncovered mosaic he did not know the man beside him had not dug with him before in a few minutes they would break for tea from an urn and that would be welcome for warmth and would be respite from the monologue in his ear the man was young leanfaced and leanbodied and scraped and talked with matching intensity i suppose he knew it was coming yes hed have realized that his time was up must have wounded him to think that civilization all of the comforts of a building like this was going to be tossed over and that the day of the hordes goths visigoths picts you name them had come and the start of a dark age with them he wouldnt have known it but i think its a law of history that new forces will inevitably overwhelm an old order the site was in wiltshire south of keysley down and to the west of berwick st leonard it was approached by a rutted farm track and was lit at fifteen minutes to midnight by a row of generatorpowered arclights negotiations with the landowner had given the diggers a clear seven days and seven nights to work on the villa and after that the excavated ground would be covered with thick plastic sheeting which would in turn be covered with the moved soil and sods of the field it was the third night until that afternoon before his meeting and his butchery at vbx gaunt had not thought he had the vaguest chance of joining these enthusiasts they were mostly students recruited from a southcoast university but he had been allocated to the team leader who talked inevitable that itll all come crashing down once the decadence sets in our chap who stood here in his sandals hed become too comfortable had too much wealth and too much privilege and hed lost the hardness to fight thats it isnt it his civilization morally corrupt could not compete with the simple brutality of the barbarian so he ran and left his home to sixteen hundred years of ruin and pillage then the stones of the walls were taken soil was washed by the rain over what was left then it was buried and eventually we pitched up comfort and decadence theyre killers for any society confronted by an enemy thats hungry ruthless at the extremity of the mosaic there were stone slabs and then the first signs of the praefurnium the stoke nole and in the mud that he lifted on his trowel gaunt found a small piece of compressed black material with near reverence he placed it in the bucket by his elbow when they took tea he would show it to the site surveyor a piece of charcoal that could be radiocarbondated that could tell them when to the year a fire had been lit before the arrival of the forces of that days axis of evil he found the mans thesis not irritating but marginally amusing what i believe frightening is that corruption is at our gates now and tonight trust me im a general practitioner know what i mean you should see what crosses my surgery five days a week nine hours a day i promise you im not a doom merchant but were busy losing our way drug addiction teenage pregnancy child abuse and paedophilia debt entrapment obesity alcoholism benefit dependency ignorance and illiteracy and every symptom of yobbery i see it and i practise in a little backwater in devizes its the drugs culture thats the worst and so few seem to care what seems to me to be so wretchedly stupid is that we are preaching for our failing lifestyle to be adopted by islamic states such conceit he stiffened the trowel slipped from his hand gaunt working at the dig site with the voices and sometimes the laughter of young people around him had felt rare tranquillity he no longer scraped for charcoal pieces or for bone scraps that had been thrown away centuries before on to the cut wood and opencast coal in the praefurnium he had believed he had escaped and had not what now was relevant as if a nerve in him was pinched he saw himself as an old warrior too tired for combat when the barbarians swarmed at the gates a man who spoke of a society decadent and doomed in the corridors of vauxhall bridge cross would gaunt thought be taken to the stake and burned alive as a heretic did a doctor from devizes tell a truth that none dared name it was a mandatorydeathsentence offence in the offices of vbx to suggest that victory was not assured i hope you dont mind me prattling on do you think our times up like this chaps was i wonder about it is all this we hear of the new fundamentalist enemy just modernspeak for barbarians at the gates are we now as decadent as our chap standing here for the last time quite a rum thought in sixteen hundred years folk will be scratching at the foundations of my home and getting all excited when theyve found the sewer pipe and can tell what i ate and have a chuckle and say yes hed have known his time was up sorry sorry talking too much my wife says i always do whats this bare fingers wiped mud smears off a length of bone and the arclights pierced sufficiently into the hole to show the minute working of the decoration at the head of what had been a hairpin consigned to the fire rather than be an ornament in the tresses of a barbarians woman gaunt with all the warmth he could muster congratulated the doctor on his significant find they were called for tea he levered himself out of the pit and carried his bucket to the tent where the urn was and sandwiches he had thought in a wiltshire field he would find sanctuary but his mind was trapped by thoughts of polly and the man she had believed in and the bright but deep eyes in the photograph of an enemy and the casualties of war then and now it was a supreme effort to drag himself to his feet he was so nearly there so close to his grail oskar netzer pulled himself up off his stomach off his knees and elbows and the gate rocked on his weight and his fingers clutched at the catch holding it shut weakness consumed him but the pain was long gone when the gate swung open a little more of his feeble strength left him and he lost his hold on the ironwork he fell forward on to the cemetery path he staggered over the loose gravel towards the stone and his wifes grave he saw nothing ahead of him in the blackness but knew where he must go and he believed he had made expiation for the wrong done by his uncle after a few short steps he collapsed on to the sharp stones but he hoped to reach her restingplace and to sleep there and be with her to tell her of his ducks and of the men who had intruded on his paradise and that he had loosed the evils hold on him he crawled off the path and over sodden grass reached out and found the glass jar the stems of flowers that had been stripped by the wind he clasped the stone and did not know what he had achieved did not know who would bury him and sleep took him a clock chimed a car with lights flashing and with an escort in front and behind brought timo rahman to the prison in the north of hamburg at fuhlsbuttel he was led from it to a desk where the details of his life and the charges he faced would be processed the gaols landings awoke word had passed spoons beat against metal mugs plates rattled against doors his name was shouted and echoed down the blocks iron staircases he was ordered to strip for medical inspection he was in hurtful ignorance of the reason for the collapse of his rule and of who was responsible i cant go in any further its bloody dangerous out there dad myself id do it if i could harry shouted at the wheelhouse door at his son i cant what im promising its never again just get her stern on dad and keep her there he should have been down on the deck to help his boy but dared not leave the wheel and the diesel engines controls to young paul his grandson who had retched again and was now too frail to hold the wheel steady and did not know the working of the engine the door slammed behind him but he yelled and did not know if he was heard dont hang about you get there you ground you pick them up if theyre there but you dont wait their problem if theyre not in place in the water my conscience is clear that my word was kept harry reached up worked the lever that manoeuvred the light on the wheelhouse roof and hit the switch in the flood of the beam he could see his son and grandson heaving the dinghy off the bucking deck and on to the gunwale resting it on the trawlers side then as a spray surge swamped them pushing it over on a wave the dinghy held by a straining rope climbed higher than the gunwale higher than them then fell like the trough had no bottom to it he had given his word to ricky capel and his word was all the honour left to him his son seemed to punch the shoulder of his grandson as if to reassure the kid who was destroyed by sickness then launched himself over the side harry lost sight of him in the next pit then saw him lifted in the dinghy and the kid loosed hold of the rope he kept the light on the dinghy he watched its progress pathetically slow and smoke fumes spat from the outboard it rose and it fell it was hard onehanded to hold the light on the dinghy and to keep the steering on the anneliese royal steady to control the engine and bring the forward speed down from three knots forward to two knots to his starboard side was the roll of the buoy light the accumer ee on the chart and to port were dulled blips of colour from the islands homes a prayer slipped on harrys lips he held the wheelhouse roof light on the dinghy and saw it shaken among the whitecaps and go towards the surf whatever it cost him he swore that he would never again be ricky capels slave he heard about bloody time you ready we go yes we dont hang about not now the world of malachy kitchen was now a tiny confined space his whole world was a dune with blown grass and soft sand a beach riffling surf and a light that wavered on the leaping progress of a dinghy he felt cleansed as if old baggage were dropped and no one here would label him a coward he coiled his body and made ready to run they were gone they went in a sliding chase down loose banks of sand little yelps of elation from ricky capel like a child at play and happy nothing from the man who led him the light on the boat at sea perhaps because she was hurled up wafted away and beyond the dinghy and then raked over the surf and came on to the beach from which the tide ran and malachy saw them saw that capel had the box that was the radio and that the second man carried a machine pistol that trailed loose in his hand malachy stood but the lights beam did not reach him it swung low searched for the dinghy and found the breaking waves then its target they were off the loose sand on the beach and they ran away to his left towards a point that the dinghy headed for he had the tags in his hand and he lifted the strap over his head they were his name his service number his religion and his blood group and they were his history in his fist fiercely clenched malachy held them because he knew when he would hit he waited a few long seconds more he could not see them only the dinghy he thought himself his own master and all that was his old world were the shoes on his feet and the tags in his hand he came off the dune and the sand plunged under his feet he fell and pushed himself back to his feet the wind blasted against him the rain stung at his eyes and he ran shells crunched broke under the tread of his shoes he stretched his stride when the boats light came up again off the dinghy it caught them ricky capel behind and the second man in front of him found them near to the surf line neither looked back he pounded the beach he careered through a lagoon of water it was where he wished to be a battleground that was perfect they were in the water he saw them against the white sweep of the surf and against the thunder of the breaking waves the voices were shouting screaming were coming cant you get in bloody closer you got to come to me im not bloody grounding get in nearer wont risk tipping her tip her and were all bloody gone i cant goddamn swim if the engine goes under were wrecked come on shift it they were into the surf wall ricky capel trailing between the cresting waves ricky capel had the water at his ankles and shins but when the waves rolled at full height the water squirmed round his waist and seemed to drive him back malachy heard ricky capels howl that he had lost a shoe the man ahead never turned never reached back with a hand to steady ricky capel never tried to be of help malachy splashed into the surf and the drive of his legs was blocked he was lifting his knees stamping for height over the surf and was closing on ricky capel he did not think why he was there what he did how ricky capel had become an enemy to be destroyed the past was gone from his mind he struggled against the winds force against the waves he saw that ricky capel had stopped and he thought exhaustion had beaten him malachy seemed to hear the sob of ricky capels breath the gap had opened between the two men as if contact had been lost and beyond both of them riding and falling in the water lit by the light was the dinghy he took the deep gulp swallowed air into his lungs he closed on ricky capel five more strides then three and the water beat against his waist a new wave came that pitched up the dinghy ran against the other mans chest lurched into ricky capel and charged malachy as he braced himself he threw back over his shoulder the two tags and did not twist to see them fall he had no more use for them or for the past and did not hear their splash malachy lunged his fists snatched at space and spray and then his weight hit ricky capel he came without warning and the momentum driven by the grip of his shoes collapsed ricky capel perhaps ricky capel in the two or three seconds between feeling the hammer blow against his back and being forced under the surf tried to shout underwater in darkness malachy gripped the thrashing body and fingers gouged at his eyes and a bare foot kicked at his shin and the height of a wave passed and the wind surged on their faces the light lit them he saw the shock in the eyes of ricky capel as if he did not understand why then the squirm of fear as if he remembered a man on the pavement of bevin close the scream was choked and water spat from his mouth the next wave caught them and the fight had gone from ricky capel hands grasped at malachys coat then his trousers then his shoes then loosed he stood he felt the weight pushed by the surf against his ankles the man was at the dinghy but had turned malachy did not hear the weapon but saw the flashes from it and the man climbed easily up and into the dinghy he felt a weakness in his legs and in his hips and was aware of vague shouts from the dinghy then the roar of its outboard gaining power and felt himself sink it did not seem important to him that the sea closed over him then freed and lifted him covered him then carried him so tired the surf was in his ears and the water caressed him as she had done and he heard her voice fight damn you dont bloody give up on me he craved sleep he can count himself lucky he was shot myself with my own hands id have throttled him its just a total and utter shambles and the responsibility for it a criminal responsibility lies with those who allowed him to be there when the report had been given over the loudspeakers when her voice had gone they had bayed their anger dennis of the security service jimmy from the norfolk police and bill who did liaison for the hereford and poolebased teams and each in turn screwed his lip to outscore the derision the hostility of the previous intervention and last in the line was the special branch officer trevor i think again the essence of the issue is missed he said softly im not talking of any morsel of charity owed to a man who fell far but of the business at hand we spoke of a rat run what i made of the somewhat distraught communication from the officer on location the rat run operates she reported that he the only individual i have interest in boarded the dinghy and was en route to the mother boat when the light was cut the anneliese royal is at sea and we are alive have a man to track kitchens fate is of no concern to me is a mere distraction as are the reasons for the stupidity of his actions a dawn had gone and the last of the storm slipped inland a final shower of rain plastered the beach and was blown on over the german mainland and towards the heathland of luneburg and the baltic coast beyond the sun broke through caught the tail of the shower and threw down a rainbow one end of the rainbow was on the islands endless flat sands and on the slackening surf as the gale died its colours danced on the body of a drowned man that was heaved backwards and forwards by the disapearing tide a woman walking her dog found it and thought from a distance that the cadaver was a dead seal but when she came close she saw the eyes of a man wide in terror and the rainbow went on a man long decamped to the mainland town of norden brought his wife and three teenage children to the islands cemetery at ostdorf to lay flowers on the grave of his parents for the adults it would be a solemn few minutes of contemplation while the children rambled among the stones he was recovering memories of a stern disciplinarian merchant mariner and a mother who had survived baltrums elements into old age when his vigil was broken by the shriek of his younger daughter he hurried to the girl his mood of respect fractured he found wrapped against this stone the body of a man wizened with age and the sunlight fell on darkened bloodstains murmuring so that she would not be heard by her son or by the girls his wife said you know who that is its old netzer it is oskar netzer never had a good word for a living soul never had a friend since she died never did a days work never did anything useful to others the end of a wasted life what could have happened to him to make all that blood polly crouched in front of the washingmachine she had emptied into it everything from the rucksack that could be soaped rinsed tumbled and the sleepingbag dried sand caked the linoleum she heard the door of the apartment open and it was then kicked shut she called out im back in the kitchen she stood and started to strip she was aware that ronnie was in the doorway she peeled off layers of clothing and bent to stuff them into the machine a trilling voice was behind her oh brilliant good to see you had a good time christ thats a serious mess bloody hell you been sleeping on a beach doesnt your lot run to hotels dont tell me you didnt get any shopping done god polly whats that on your hands is that blood old blood on you are you all right she was naked and she had to heave against the washingmachines door to fasten it then hit the button im fine thanks for asking but im fine yes its blood not to worry not mine she watched the machine churning suds through the window in the door you know what im going to ask she heard the giggle whatever it was you did dont mind me did you win she felt the cold on her skin not the warmth of him she felt the salt in her throat not the taste of him some people won and some people lost but theyre history the winners and losers she walked past ronnie across the hall and into the bathroom and lost herself behind the shower curtain under a cascade of hot water near to scalding she scrubbed herself clean sand from her hair welled at the plughole and she washed the last of his old blood from her hands she yelled and did not know if she was heard you never really learn it do you who are the winners and who are the losers harry rogers brought the trawler into harbour and did not know that a crisis committee had monitored his progress across the north sea and that a pilotless drone flying from boscombe down had been overhead and tracking the anneliese royal with a stateoftheart lens and that a submarines periscope had scanned him from close quarters as he approached the east anglian shore they tied up they reported to the harbourmaster that a windinggear malfunction had prevented them fishing when the storm had blown out that they had no catch to land his boy billy took his grandson paul to a doctors surgery in the town for a checkup on his arm and to assess the damage from continuous seasickness harry stayed on board with a hose a brush and a mop he sluiced through the wheelhouse and the galley and if he lifted his head he saw the rest of the towns fleet put to sea in breezy sunshine for more than three hours he was alone on the trawler with memories of a storm blowing off a german island that were alive and dreams of owning an historic sailboat that were dead he locked the wheelhouse hitched his bag on to his shoulder and walked the deck to the point where the old encrusted ladder would take him up on to the quay he swung his legs over the side and on to a slippery rung and saw two men above him no bullshit no protestations of innocence too exhausted for it too much of his life hacked from him they came down the ladder gingerly in their city shoes and suits and he led them back to the wheelhouse he made them coffee but that did not soften the coldness on their faces he had no one on board they could search if they wanted to he had brought back no passenger harry said you make a mistake in your life and each day that follows its harder to extricate yourself from that mistake my mistake was ricky capel i have no excuses and i look for no sympathy and the mistake is mine you want to know about the man with ricky capel on the beach and ill tell you what you want to know billy went out in the dinghy in a hell of a sea and part of what im saying is from him but most of it is from what i saw with the light they were in the water big swell and surf and coming slow towards the dinghy i saw this guy come off the beach and he ran into the surf and ricky capel and his man never saw him ricky was behind the guy smacked into ricky capel and he put him down they went together under then just the guy came up the man rickys man turned would have seen the guy fired at him i saw the flashes and i heard the gun and the guy went down and i killed the light the man got on board billys dinghy billy brought him back to us i was turning hard billy came on board first and then he had hold of the rope took it from young paul and the man was going to follow him i left the wheel left it spinning and i went on deck and i got the rope off billy and i chucked it he lifted the gun and i was flat in his sights hed have blasted me but it didnt fire must have been too much water in it and then there was the gap between him and us i went back in the wheelhouse and took the engine to power we left him he had the dinghy he had an outboard with a full tank he had the reserve but he didnt have us i never saw him again gods truth and billy didnt nor paul we took her back to sea i cant say what happened to him but it was foul conditions for an open dinghy cant say whether he drowned made a landfall whether he survived and is still out there cant he had been summoned to the heavenly heights of vauxhall bridge cross he had knocked and there was the answering call for him to enter but then he was kept standing for those few seconds while the assistant deputy director studied desk papers that confirmed celestial authority ah sorry good to see you freddie your leave went well thank you gilbert yes it was excellent frederick gaunt was damned if he would show annoyance at the casual insult or speak of the raging cold he had acquired in a wiltshire field we had a firstclass dig glad to hear it ill get you up to speed your target anwar maghroub is lost presumed drowned but there is sadly no confirmation of that and no body to be very frank freddie some have spoken of your role in this and that of miss wilkins and of the hired hand as adding up to a shambles the destruction of an operation that should have brought great rewards and would have done if that bloody kitchen and the reasons for his actions remain a mystery had not interfered i of course and you would have the right to expect it have fought your corner with vigour but against considerable opposition i think we are at a time when we require new brooms and fresh perspectives almost a cleaning of augean stables you know washing out the stables of the king of elis a labour of hercules i am familiar with greek mythology good different minds bringing different thinking to ongoing problems we dont want to lose you freddie wed hate a man of your talents to throw in the towel and make an overhasty decision on early retirement though the packages on the table are generous to a fault and offer many opportunities for the pursuit of valuable hobbies wed hate you to walk away whats vacant because of wilsons diagnosis of diabetes is uruguay its a bit of a backwater but thats where we are what do you say to montevideo three years and perhaps an extension to four if he gulped he did not show it if he felt a frisson of anger he hid it gaunt said id like that very much they wanted his neck on the block wanted him gone he would deny them the satisfaction he saw the face across the desk flex in the irritation caused by his acceptance id say uruguay for three years or four would be most challenging worthwhile gulls wheeled screamed and dived on the brightcoloured intruder that was marooned at the base of the red stone cliffs an ornithologist saw it and reported to the coastguard station on the north sea island of helgoland that an upturned dinghy had been washed ashore he was able to return in time to the cliffs and watch men come by cutter and retrieve it but he was on a days visit and did not have time to learn what the had found he telephoned from the mainland the next morning and heard the dinghy carried the name of a british registered trawler and heard also that the cliffs and beaches of helgoland had been searched but without further result no bodies have come ashore none had been discovered perhaps it was taken off the deck by that storm last month perhaps it had been he came out of the stairwell and into the summer heat that burned off the blocks concrete a voice boomed behind him how you doing mr johnson how you keeping he turned saw the big west indian with the weightlifters shoulders fine ivanhoe just fine more important than how youre doing keeping hows millie shes well as good as to be expected quite chirpy she asks after him he had a handkerchief out and mopped his forehead saw that sweat ran rivers on the social workers face she can ask but i doubt shell see him a new man a changed man and without old baggage you mr johnson and me and her wed be old baggage but he came back to the amersham millie heard he was here not living on the estate but working i just seen him the once turned up at my office door and all humble requested a job i sent him where he wanted to go they fixed him a low grade because of no qualifications ive not seen him since where did they place him the arm of ivanhoe manners waved expansively generalized in the direction of the estate facilities buildings that had survived the warfare of vandalism where the money of the new deal for the community had been swallowed where the pensioners association played bingo and the tenants association held meetings over theres where he is you got time to show me a wide frown played on ivanhoe mannerss forehead as if the question perplexed him as if an answer would embarrass him then he scratched at his ear and seemed to wince as if the request hurt him tony johnson knew the basic detail of what had happened months before on a german beach but what had crossed his desk had been sanitized of intelligence material he knew the proof of it because with half a hundred others from the criminal intelligence service and the crime squad and the organized crime unit he had gone down to lewisham to see the coffin of ricky capel the untouchable smart kid put down in the earth not a wet eye to be seen a parson clamouring through the service like hed another one backed up poor turnout and almost a carnival mood from those whod showed he was just home from holiday two weeks on the algarve and millie had told him that malachy was back ears like bloody surveillance antennae the lady possessed he had come almost to wish he hadnt asked ill take you but its not for talking just watching thatll do me they went across a plaza through a play area and across a road the building where the facilities were tony johnson thought was like a damn great bunker and he reckoned it bloody needed to be past mums pushing brats in buggies and kids on a blocks corner maybe it was the sunshine but he rated the numbers of the kids as smaller than usual but that would be the sunshine because the kids were night workers he heard the rumble of many voices and gods truth laughter in the amersham they were at the bunker wall one window set in it covered with thick wire mesh you heard me mr johnson just watching brief and not talking ever were the past and he dont need us i heard you see nothing hear nothing and know nothing thats me he peered through the wire and the sounds yelling shouting laughing belted him and ivanhoe mannerss mouth was close to his ear its the kids hes getting on his side now its basketball earlier it might have been football later itll be the pool tables see him hes a natural me im too old for them and you hes not that much younger than me or you but its like hes lost years theres more kids now playing basketball with him than i ever seen you know what like now hes always in shorts and his tshirt has no sleeves why look there the little pucker marks on the right thigh and shoulder theyre top credibility with the kids bullet scars two bulletholes hardly healed over they win respect i didnt hear where he got them or how they dont know he was ever here like he came out of nowhere that enough for you they walked away left a basketball game behind a window tony johnson said ill see you around ivanhoe like you said best left alone because were the past and of no use to him good to see him standing finding himself look after yourself he went to his car he knew where malachy kitchen had been and the hell of that place and the price paid and he wishec those who had put the man there could have stood with him on tiptoe and peered through a wire mesh and seen a man born again
