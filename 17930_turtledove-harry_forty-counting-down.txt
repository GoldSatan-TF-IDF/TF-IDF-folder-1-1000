harry turtledove forty counting down hey justin sean peterss voice floated over the top of the superstrings ltd cubicle wall its twenty after sixquitting time and then some want a drink or two with me and garth hang on justin kloster answered let me save what im working on first he told his computer to save his work as it stood generate a backup and shut itself off having grown up in the days when voicerecognition software was imperfectly reliable he waited to make sure the machine followed orders it did of course making that software idiotproof had put superstrings on the map a few years after the turn of the century justin got up stretched and looked around not much to see the grayishtan fuzzy walls of the cubicle and an astringently neat desktop that held the computer a wedding photo of megan and him and a phonefax his lips narrowed the marriage had lasted four yearsfour and a half actually he hadnt come close to finding anybody else since footsteps announced peterss arrival he looked like a high school linebacker whod since let most of his muscle go to flab garth oconnell was right behind him he was from the same mold except getting thin on top instead of going gray hows the iron curtain sound peters asked sure justin said its close and you can hear yourself thinkmost of the time anyhow they went out into the parking lot together bitching when they stepped from air conditioning to san fernando valley august heat justins eyes started watering too la smog wasnt so bad as it had been when he was young but it hadnt disappeared an oasis song was playing when the three software engineers walked into the iron curtain and into air conditioning that was chillier than that at the office the music took justin back to the days when hed been getting together with megan though hed liked blur better look out sean peters said theyve got a new fellow behind the bar he and garth chuckled they knew what was going to happen justin sighed so did he peters ordered a gin and tonic oconnell a scotch on the rocks justin asked for a bud sure as hell the bartender said ill be right with you two gentshe nodded to justins coworkersbut for you sir ill need some id with another sigh justin produced his drivers license here the bartender looked at him looked at his picture on the license and looked at his birthdate he scowled you were born in no way his real names dorian gray garth said helpfully oh shut up justin muttered and then louder to the bartender yeah i really turned forty this past spring he was slightly pudgy but hed been slightly pudgy since he was a toddler and hed been very blond since the day he was born if he had any silver mixed with the gold it didnt show he also stayed out of the sun as much as he could because he burned to a crisp when he didnt that left him with a lot fewer lines and wrinkles than his buddies who were both a couple of years younger than he shaking his head the bartender slid justin a beer you coulda fooled me he said you go around picking up high school girls his hands shaped an hourglass in the air no justin stared down at the reflections of the ceiling lights on the polished bar middle school garth suggested hed already made his scotch disappear justin gave him a dirty look it was such a dirty look it got through to sean peters he tapped garth on the arm for a wonder garth eased off justin finished the bud threw a twenty on the bar and got up to leave not going to have another one peters asked surprised nope justin shook his head got some things to do see you in the morning out he went walking fast so his friends couldnt stop him as soon as the microchip inside justins deadbolt lock shook hands with the one in his key his apartment came to life lamps came on the stereo started playing the pulp cd hed left in there this morning the broiler heated up to do the steak the computer knew was in the refrigerator from the bedroom the computer called now or later later justin said so the screen stayed dark he went into the kitchen and tossed a couple of pieces of spam snailmail into the blue wastebasket for recycling the steak went under the broiler frozen mixed vegetables went into the microwave eight minutes later dinner after he finished he rinsed the dishes and silverware and put them in the dishwasher when he closed the door the light inside came on the machine judged itself full enough to run a cycle in the middle of the night like the kitchen his front room was almost as antiseptically tidy as his cubicle at superstrings but for a picture of megan and him on their honeymoon the coffee table was bare all his books and dvds and audio cds were arranged alphabetically by author title or group none stood even an eighth of an inch out of place it was as if none of them dared move without his permission he went into the bedroom now he said and the computer monitor came to life a picture of megan and him stood on the dresser another on the nightstand her high school graduation picture smiled at him whenever he sat down at the desk even after all these years he smiled back most of the time he couldnt help it hed always been happy around megan but she hadnt been happy around him not at the end not for a while before the end either hed been a long long time realizing that stupid he said he wasnt smiling now even with megans young glowing face looking right at him out of the picture frame i was stupid i didnt know enough i didnt know how to take care of her no wonder he hadnt clicked with any other woman he didnt want any other woman he wanted meganand he couldnt have her any more email he told the computer and gave his password he went through it answering what needed answering and deleting the rest then he said banking the computer had paid the monthly weblink bill and the cable bill too all good he told it the cd in the stereo fell silent repeat the computer asked no justin went out to the front room he took the pulp cd out of the player put it in its jewel box and put the jewel box exactly where it belonged on the shelf then he stood there in a rare moment of indecision wondering what to pull out next when he chose a new cd he chuckled he doubted sean or garth would have heard of the trash can sinatras let alone any of their music his work buddies had listened to grunge rock back before the turn of the century not british pop as soon as cake started he went back into the bedroom and sat down at the computer again this time he did smile at megans picture shed been crazy for the trash can sinatras too the music made him especially eager to get back to work superstrings he said and gave a password and virtual reality and another password and not so virtual and one more then he had to wait he would have killed for a mac a quarter this powerful back in but it wasnt a patch on the one he used at the office the company could afford the very best he couldnt not quite he went to the keyboard for this work for numbers it was more precise than dictating and he had to wait again and again while the computer did the crunching one wait was long enough for him to go take a shower when he got back hair still damp the machine hadnt finished muttering to itself justin sighed but the faster macs at the office couldnt leap these numbers at a single bound what he was asking of his home computer was right on the edge of what it could do or maybe it would turn out to be over the edge in that case hed spend even more lunch hours in his cubicle in the days ahead than he had for the past six months he was caught up on everything the people above him wanted they thought he worked his long hours to stay that way what they dont know wont hurt them justin murmured and it may do me some good he didnt think anyone else had combined superstring physics chaos theory and virtual reality this way if anyone had he was keeping quiet about itnothing in the journals not a whisper on the web justin would have known he had virbots out prowling all the time theyd never found anything close he had this all to himself if he hadnt been wasting his time up came the field parameters at long long last justin studied them as the computer had he took his time he didnt want to let enthusiasm run away with him before he was sure hed done that half a lifetime ago and what had it got him a divorce that had blighted his life ever since he wouldnt jump too soon not again not ever again but things looked good yes he said softly hed been saying it that particular way since he was a teenager he couldnt have named the disgraced sportscaster from whom hed borrowed it if hed gone on the rack he saved the parameters quit his application and had the computer back up everything hed done the backup disk went into his briefcase and then yawning he hit the sack three days later garth oconnell was the first to gape when justin came into the office buzz cut he exclaimed and ran a hand over his own thinning hair then he laughed and started talking as if the past twenty years hadnt happened yo dude wheres the combat boots in my closet justin thought he didnt say that what he did say was i felt like doing something different thats all like what garth asked globalsearching for high school quail like the barkeep said the competition doesnt wear short hair any more you know will you melt it down justin snapped okay okay garth spread his hands but you better get used to it cause everybody else is gonna say the same kind of stuff odds were he was right justin realized gloomily he grabbed a cup of coffee at the office machine then ducked into his cubicle and got to work that slowed the stream of comments but didnt stop them people would go by the cubicle see the side view do a double take and start exclaiming inside half an hour justins division head came by to view the prodigy she rubbed her chin well i dont suppose it looks unbusinesslike she said dubiously thanks ms chen justin said i just wanted to start your midlife crisis early as it had a few evenings before sean peterss voice drifted over the walls of the cubicle and thank you sean justin put on his biggest grin ms chen smiled which meant hed passed the test she gave his hair another look nodded more happily than shed spoken and went off to do whatever managers did when they werent worrying about haircuts sean kept his mouth shut till lunchtime when he stuck his head into justins cubicle and said feel like going over to ominos ive got a yen for japanese food he laughed justin groaned that made peters laugh harder than ever justin shook his head pointing toward his monitor he said im brownbagging it today got a ton of stuff that needs doing okay peters shrugged anybodyd think you worked here or something ill see you later then between noon and half past one superstrings was nearly deserted munching on a salami sandwich and an orange justin worked on his own project his private project the office machine was better than his home computer for deciding whether possible meant practical yes he said again a few minutes later and then time to go shopping being the sort of fellow he was he shopped with a list vintage clothes came from aaardvarks odd ark undoubtedly the funkiest secondhand store in town if not in the world as with his haircut he did his best to match the way hed looked just before the turn of the century old money was easier he had to pay only a small premium for oldfashioned smallhead bills at the several coinandstamp shops he visited why do you want em if you dont care about condition one dealer asked maybe i think the new bills are ugly he answered the dealer shrugged tagging him for a nut but a harmless one when he got to he checked money off the list he got to the office very early the next morning the security guard chuckled as he unlocked the door old clothes and everything looks like youre moving in pal seems like that sometimes too bill justin set down his suitcases for a moment but im going out of town this afternoon id rather have this stuff indoors than sitting in the trunk of my car oh yeah bill nodded he had to be seventy but his hair wasnt any lighter than iron gray i know that song he knew lots of songs many dating back to before justin was born hed fought in vietnam and been a cop and now he was doing this because his pension hadnt come close to keeping up with skyrocketing prices justin wondered if his own would come the day but he had different worries now thanks he said when the guard held the door for him he staggered up the stairs thanks to the stash of cash a new compact car here nothing more even with the premium hed had to pay but a young fortune before the turn of the century some period clothes scroungedlike the dilbert tshirt and baggy jeans he had onfrom secondhand stores and the boots those suitcases werent light and hed never been in better shape than he could help the backpack in which he carried his powerbook and vr mask did nothing to make him more graceful either once he got up to the second floor he paused and listened hard yes he said when he heard nothing except for bill down below he was the only person here he went into the mens room piled one suitcase on the other and sat down on them then he took the laptop out of its case he plugged the vr mask into its jack then turned on the computer as soon as it came up he put on the mask the world went black then neutral gray then neutral neutral no color at all just virtual reality waiting to be made real it all took too long he wished he could do this back at his desk with an industrialstrength machine but he didnt dare take the chance this building had been here nineteen years ago this mens room had been here nineteen years ago hed done his homework as well as he could but his homework hadnt been able to tell him where the goddamn cubicle partitions were back before the turn of the century and so the john he took a deep breath run program superstringsslashvirtual realityslashnot so virtual he said the powerbook quivered ever so slightly on his lap his heart thudded talk about your moments of truth either he was as smart as he thought he was or garth or sean or somebody would breeze in and ask justin what the hell are you doing a string in spacetime connected this place now to its earlier self itself in as far as justin knew nobody but him had thought of accessing that string of sliding along it with vr technology when the simulation was good enough it became the realityfor a while anyhow that was what the math said he thought hed done a good enough job here and if he had oh if he had he knew a hell of a lot more now at forty than he had when he was twentyone if henow could be back with megan for a while instead of his younger self he could make things right he could make things last he knew it he had to if he ever wanted to be happy again ill fix it he thought ill fix everything and when i slide back to hereandnow i wont have this emptiness in my past everything will be the way it could have been the way it should have been an image began to emerge from the vr blankness it was the same image hed seen before slipping on the mask blue tile walls with white grouting acoustic ceiling sinks with a mirror above them urinals off to the left toilet stalls behind him dammit he muttered under his breath sure as hell the mens room hadnt changed at all program superstringsslashvirtual realityslashnot so virtual reality is done the powerbook told him he took off the mask here he sat on his suitcases in the mens room of his office building he couldnt tell not staying in here if everything had worked out the way hed calculated it would be before business hours back when hed arrived too all he had to do was walk out that front door and hope the security guard wasnt right there no what he really had to hope was that the security guard wasnt bill he put the computer in his backpack again he picked up the suitcases and walked to the mensroom door he set down a case so he could open the door his heart pounded harder than ever yes or no justin took two steps down the hall toward the stairs before he whispered yes instead of the graygreen carpet hed walked in on this stuff was an ugly mustard yellow he had no proof he was in not yet but he wasnt in kansas any more the place had the quietbeforethestorm feeling offices get waiting for people to show up for work that fit justins calculations the air conditioner was noisier wheezier than the system that had beenwould bein his time but it kept the corridor noticeably cooler than it had been when he lugged his stuff into the mens room the s had ridden an oil glut they burned lavishly to beat summer heat his time couldnt there was the doorway that led to the stairs down he went the walls were different industrial yellow not battleship gray when he got to the little lobby he didnt recognize the furniture what was there seemed no better or worse than what he was used to but it was different if there was a guard he was off making his rounds justin didnt wait for him he opened the door he wondered if that would touch off the alarm but it didnt he stepped out into the cool fresh earlymorning air of when he walked through the empty lot to the sidewalk then looked around across the street a woman out powerwalking glanced his way but didnt stop she wore a cap a tshirt and baggy shorts which proved nothing but then he looked at the parked cars and began to grin a crazy grin most of them had smooth jellybean lines which to his eyes was two style changes out of date if this wasnt it was damn close with a clanking rumble of iron a metrolink train pulled into the little station behind his office a couple of people got off a handful got on in his day with gas ever scarcer ever costlier that commuter train would have far more passengers standing on the sidewalk unnoticed by the world around him he pumped a fist in the air i did it he said i really did it having done it he couldnt do anything else not for a little while not much was open at halfpast five but there was a dennys up the street suitcases in hand he trudged toward it the young boredlooking hispanic waitress who seated him gave him a fishy stare you coulda left your stuff in the car she said pointedly his answer was automatic i dont have a car her eyebrows flew upward if you didnt have a car in la you were nobody if you didnt have a car and did have suitcases you were liable to be a dangerously weird nobody he had to say something inspiration struck i just got off the train somebody shouldve picked me up but he blew it toast and coffee please she relaxed okaycoming up white rye or whole wheat wheat justin looked around he was the only customer in the place can you keep an eye on the cases for a second i want to buy a times hed seen the machine out front but hadnt wanted to stop till he got inside when the waitress nodded he got a paper it was only a quarter that boggled him he paid two bucks weekdays five sundays but the date boggled him more june right on the money he went back inside the coffee waited for him steaming gently the toast came up a moment later as he spread grape jam over it he glanced at the times and wondered what his younger self was doing now sleeping you dummy hed liked to sleep late when he was twentyone and finals at cal state northridge would have just ended hed have the compusa job to go to but the place didnt open till ten megan would be sleeping too he thought of her lying in a tshirt and sweats at her parents house wiggling around the way she did in bed maybe she was dreaming of him and smiling she would be smiling now a few years from now well hed come to fix that he killed fortyfive minutes by then the restaurant was filling up the waitress started to look ticked justin ordered bacon and eggs and hash browns they bought him the table for another hour he tried not to think about what the food was doing to his coronary arteries his younger self wouldnt have cared his younger self loved dennys my younger self was a fool he thought he paid again marveling at how little things cost of course people didnt make much either you could live well on a year he tried to imagine living on in and shook his head you couldnt do it not if you felt like eating too when he went out to the parking lot he stood there for forty minutes looking back toward the train station by then it was getting close to eight oclock up a side street from the dennys was a block of apartment buildings with names like the tivoli the gardens and the yachtsman up the block he trudged the yachtsman had a vacancy sign the manager looked grumpy at getting buzzed so early but the sight of greenbacks cheered him up in a hurry he rented justin a onebedroom furnished apartment at a ridiculously low rate im here on business justin said which was true in a way ill pay three months in advance if you fix me up with a tv and a stereo they dont have to be great they just have to work id have to root around the manager said itd be kind of a pain he waited justin passed him two fifties he nodded so did justin this was business too the manager eyed his suitcases youll want to move in right away wont you justin nodded again and ill want to use your phone to set up my phone service okay the manager said with a sigh come into my place here ill get things set up his fishfaced wife watched justin with wide pale unblinking eyes while he called the phone company and made arrangements the manager headed off with a vacuum cleaner in due course he came back youre ready tv and stereo are in there thanks justin went upstairs to the apartment it was small and bare with furniture that had seen better decades the tv wasnt new the stereo was so old it didnt play cds only records and cassettes well his computer could manage cds he accepted a key to the apartment and another for the security gates then unpacked he couldnt do everything he wanted till he got a phone but he was here he used a pay phone to call a cab and rode over to a used car lot he couldnt do everything he wanted without wheels either he had no trouble proving he was himself hed done some computer forgery before he left to make his drivers license expire in as it really did his number hadnt changed security holograms that would have given a home machine trouble hereandnow were a piece of cake to graphics programs from his younger self didnt know hed just bought a new old car a gray early s toyota much like the one he was already driving insurance is mandatory the salesman said i can sell you a policy justin let him do it to his barely concealed delight it was no doubt highway robbery especially since justin was nominally only twentyone hed dressed for the age he affected in tshirt and jeans to him though no prices seemed expensive he paid cash and took the car getting a bank account wasnt hard either he chose a bank his younger self didnt use research paid off he deposited only ten grand or more in cash and the bank would have reported the transaction to the government he didnt want that kind of notice he wanted no notice at all the assistant manager handed him a book of temporary checks good to have your business mr kloster the personalized ones will be ready in about a week okay justin went off to buy groceries he wasnt a great cook but he was a lot better than his younger self hed had to learn and had once the groceries were stowed in the pantry and the refrigerator he left again this time to a bookstore he went to the computer section first to remind himself of the state of the art after a couple of minutes he was smiling and shaking his head had he done serious work with this junk he supposed he had but he was damned if he saw how before he was born people had used slide rules because there werent any computers yet or even calculators he was damned if he saw how theyd done any work either but the books didnt have exactly what he wanted he went to the magazine rack there was a macaddict in a clear plastic envelope the cdrom that came with the magazine would let him start an account on a couple of online services once he had one he could email his younger self and then hed be in business if ior ithendont flip out altogether he thought things might get pretty crazy now that he was here and on the point of getting started he felt in his belly how crazy they might get and he knew both sides of things his younger self didnt would justinthen even listen to him he had to hope so looking back hed been pretty stupid when he was twentyone no matter how stupid hed been though hed have to pay attention when he got his nose rubbed in the facts wouldnt he justin bought the macaddict and took it back to his apartment as soon as he got online hed be ready to roll he chose aol not earthlink his younger self was on earthlink and looked down his nose at aol and aol let him pay by debiting his checking account he didnt have any credit cards that worked in he supposed he could get one but it would take time hed taken too much time already he thought he had about three months before the spacetime string hed manipulated would snap him back to with luck with skill with what he knew then that he hadnt known now hed be happier there but he had no time to waste his computer throttled down to k access to the outside world might have thought the same but aols local access lines wouldnt support anything faster welcome the electronic voice said as he logged on he ignored it and went straight to email he was pretty sure he remembered his old email address if i dont he thought chuckling a little as he typed whoever is using this address right now will get awfully confused hed pondered what he would say to get his younger selfs attention and settled on the most provocative message he could think of he wrote who but you would know that the first time you jacked off you were looking at miss march a little before your fifteenth birthday nobody right gorgeous blonde wasnt she the only way i know that is that i am you more or less let me hear from you he signed it justin kloster age and sent it then he had to pause his younger self would be working now but hed check his email as soon as he got home justin remembered religiously doing that every day he didnt remember getting email like the message hed just sent of course but that was the point of this exercise waiting till half past five wasnt easy he wished he could use his timetravel algorithm to fastforward to late afternoon but he didnt dare too many superstrings might tangle and even the office machine up in hadnt been able to work out the ramifications of that in another ten years it would probably be childs play for a computer but he wouldnt be able to pretend he was twentyone when he was fifty even a baby face and pale gold hair wouldnt stretch that far he hoped theyd stretch far enough now at he logged onto aol again welcome the voice told him and then youve got mail youve got spam he muttered under his breath and one of the messages in his mailbox was spam he deleted it without a qualm the other one though was from his younger self earthlinknet heart pounding he opened the email what kind of stupid joke is this his younger self wrote whatever it is its not funny justin sighed he supposed he shouldnt have expected himselfattwentyone to be convinced right away this business was hard to believe even for him but he had more shots in his gun than one no joke he wrote back who else but you would know you lost your first baby tooth in a pear at school when you were in the first grade who would know your dad fed you rollos when he took you to work with him that day you were eight or nine who would know you spent most of the time while you were losing your cherry staring at the mole on the side of lindsey fletchers neck me thats who you at he typed his name and sent the message his stomach growled but he didnt go off and make supper he sat by the computer waiting his younger self would still be online hed have to answer wouldnt he justin hadnt figured out what hed do if himselfattwentyone wanted nothing to do with him the prospect had never crossed his mind maybe it should have dont be stupid kid he said softly dont complicate things for me dont complicate things for yourself either he sat he waited he worried after what seemed forever but was less than ten minutes the aol program announced youve got mail he read it i dont watch xfiles much his younger self wrote but maybe i ought to how could you know all that about me i never told anybody about lindsey fletchers neck so far as justin could recall he hadnt told anyone about her neck by either that didnt mean hed forgotten he wouldnt forget till they shoveled dirt over him how do i know he wrote ive told you twice nowi know because i am you you in its not xfiles stuffits good programming the show still ran in endless syndication but he hadnt watched it for years he went on believe me im back here for a good reason and sent the email again he waited again the reply came back fast he imagined his younger self eyeing the screen of his computer eyeing it and scratching his head his younger self must have been scratching hard for what came back was but thats impossible okay he typed its impossible but if it is impossible how do i know all this stuff about you more waiting the hell with it he thought hed intended to broil lamb chops but he would have had to pay attention to keep from cremating them he took a dinner out of the freezer and threw it into the tiny microwave built in above the stove he could punch a button and get it more or less right back to the computer youve got mail it said once more and he did i dont know his younger self had written how do you know all this stuff about me because its stuff about me too he answered you dont seem to be taking that seriously yet the microwave beeped justin started to go off to eat but the powerbook told him he had more mail he called it up if youre supposed to be me himselfattwentyone wrote then youll look like me right justin laughed his younger self wouldnt believe that hed probably think it would make this pretender shut up and go away but justin wasnt a pretender and didnt need to shut uphe could put up instead right he replied meet me in front of the b daltons in the northridge mall tomorrow night at and ill buy you dinner youll see for yourself he sent the message then did walk away from the computer eating frozen food reminded him why hed learned to cook he chucked the tray into the trash then returned to the bedroom to see what his younger self had answered three words see you there the mall surprised justin in his time it had seen better years in just a little after being rebuilt because of the earthquake it still seemed shiny and sparkly and new justin got there early with his hair short with the cow pi tshirt and jeans and big black boots he was wearing he fit in with the kids who shopped and strutted and just hung out he found out how well he fit when he eyed an attractive brunette of thirty or so who was wearing business clothes she caught him doing it looked horrified for a second and then stared through him as if he didnt exist at first he thought her reaction was over the top then he realized it wasnt you may think shes cute but she doesnt think you are she thinks youre wet behind the ears instead of leaving him insulted the womans reaction cheered him maybe i can bring this off he leaned against the brushedaluminum railing in front of the secondlevel b daltons as if he had nothing better to do a grayhaired man in maroon polyester pants muttered something about punk kids as he walked by justin grinned which made the old fart mutter more but then the grin slipped from justins face what replaced it was probably astonishment here came his younger self heading up from the sears end of the mall he could tell the moment when his younger self saw him himselfattwentyone stopped gaped and turned pale he looked as if he wanted to turn around and run away instead after gulping he kept on justins heart pounded he hadnt realized just how strange seeing himself would feel and hed been expecting this for his younger self it was a bolt from the blue that meant he had to be the one in control he stuck out his hand hi he said thanks for coming his younger self shook hands with him they both looked down the two right hands fit perfectly well they would wouldnt they justin thought his younger self still staring said maybe im not crazy maybe youre not crazy either you look just like me funny how that works justin said seeing his younger self wasnt like looking in a mirror it wasnt because himselfattwentyone looked that much youngerhe didnt it wasnt even because his younger self wasnt doing the same things he did after a moment he figured out what it was his younger selfs image wasnt reversed the way it would have been in a mirror that made him look different his younger self put hands on hips prove youre from the future he said justin had expected that he took a little plastic coin purse the kind that can hook onto a key chain out of his pocket and squeezed it open here he said this is for you he handed himselfattwentyone a quarter it looked like any quartertill you noticed the date its from his younger self whispered his eyes got big and round again jesus you werent kidding i told you i wasnt justin said patiently come on whats the name of that korean barbecue place on reseda he thought that was right it had closed a few years after the turn of the century his younger self didnt notice the hesitation the pine tree yeah justin knew the name when he heard it lets go over there ill buy you dinner like i said in email and we can talk about things like what youre doing here his younger self said he nodded yeah like what im doing here none of the waitresses at the pine tree spoke much english that was one reason justin had chosen the place he didnt want anybody eavesdropping but he liked garlic he liked the odd vegetables and he enjoyed grilling beef or pork or chicken or fish on the gas barbecue set into the tabletop he ordered for both of them the waitress scribbled on her pad in the odd characters of hangul then looked from one of them to the other twins she said pulling out a word she did know yeah justin said sort of he thought the waitress went away his younger self pointed at him tell me one thing he said what justin asked he expected anything from what are you doing here to what is the meaning of life but his younger self surprised him that the rolling stones arent still touring by the time youreimforty well no justin said that was a pretty scary thought when you got down to it he and his younger self both laughed they sounded just alike we would he thought the waitress came back with a couple of tall bottles of ob beer she hadnt asked either one of them for an id for which justin was duly grateful his younger self kept quiet while she was around after shed gone away himselfattwentyone said okay i believe you i didnt think i would but i do you know too muchand you couldnt have pulled that quarter out of your ear from nowhere he sipped at the korean beer he looked as if he would sooner have gone out and got drunk thats right justin agreed stay in control the more you sound like you know what youre doing the more hell think you know what youre doing and he has to think that or this wont fly his younger self drank beer faster than he did and waved for a second tall one as soon as the first was empty justin frowned he remembered drinking more in his twenties than he did at forty but didnt care to have his nose rubbed in it he wouldnt have wanted to drive after two big obs but his younger self didnt seem to worry about it with his younger selfs new beer the waitress brought the meat to be grilled and the plates of vegetables she used aluminum tongs to put some pork and some marinated beef over the fire looking at the strips of meat curling and shrinking himselfattwentyone exclaimed oh my god they killed kenny huh justin said and then oh he managed a feeble chuckle he hadnt thought about south park in a long time his younger self eyed him if youd said that to me id have laughed a lot harder but the shows not hot for you any more is it he answered his own question before justin could no it wouldnt be jesus he took another big sip of beer justin grabbed some beef with the tongs he used chopsticks to eat ignoring the fork so did his younger self he was better at it than himselfattwentyone hed had more practice the food was good he remembered it had been after a while his younger self said well will you tell me what this is all about whats the most important thing in your life right now justin asked in return you mean besides trying to figure out why id travel back in time to see me his younger self returned he nodded carefully not smiling hed been looser sillier at twentyone than he was now of course hed had fewer things go wrong then too and his younger self went on what could it be but megan okay were on the same page justin said thats why im here to set things right with megan things with megan dont need setting right himselfattwentyone sounded disgustingly complacent things with megan are great i mean im taking my time and all but theyre great and theyll stay great too how many kids do we have now none justins voice went flat and harsh a muscle at the corner of his jaw jumped he touched it to try to calm it down none his younger self wasnt quick on the uptake he needed his nose rubbed in things he looked at justins left hand youre not wearing a wedding ring he said hed just noticed justins answering nod was grim his younger self asked does that mean we dont get married say it aint so justin did we get married all right and then we get divorced his younger self went as pale as he had when he first saw justin even at twentyone he knew too much about divorce hereandnow his father was living with a woman not much older than he was his mother was living with a woman not much older than he was too that was why he had his own apartment paying his rent was easier for his mom and dad than paying him any real attention but however much himselfattwentyone knew about divorce he didnt know enough hed just been a fairly innocent bystander he hadnt gone through one from the inside he didnt understand the pain and the emptiness and the endless mighthavebeens that kept going through your mind afterward justin had had those mighthavebeens inside his head since he and megan had fallen apart but he was in a unique position sitting here in the pine tree eating kimchi he could do something about them he could if his younger self let him said younger self blurted that cant happen it can it did it will justin said the muscle started twitching again buthow himselfattwentyone sounded somewhere between bewildered and shocked we arent like mom and dadwe dont fight all the time and we dont look for something on the side wherever we can find it even at twentyone he spoke of his parents with casual contempt justin thought no better of them in he said you can fight about sex you can fight about money you can fight about inlaws we ended up doing all three and so he set down his chopsticks and spread his hands wide we broke upwill break upif we dont change things thats why i figured out how to come back to change things i mean his younger self finished the second ob you must have wanted to do that a lot he remarked you might say so justins voice came harsh and ragged yeah you just might say so since we fell apart ive never come close to finding anybody who makes me feel the way megan did if its not her its nobody thats how it looks from here anyhow i want to make things right for the two of us things were going to be right but his younger self lacked conviction justin sat and waited he was better at that than he had been half a lifetime earlier finally himselfattwentyone asked what will you do he didnt ask what do you want to do he spoke as if justin were a force of nature maybe that was his youth showing maybe it was just the beer whatever it was justin encouraged it by telling his younger self what he would do not what hed like to do im going to take over your life for a couple of months im going to be you im going to take megan out im going to make sure things are solidand then the superstring ive ridden to get me here will break down youll live happily ever after ill brief you to make sure you dont screw up what ive built and when i get back to i will have lived happily ever after how does that sound i dont know his younger self said youll be taking megan out justin nodded thats right youll be taking megan back to the apartment yeah justin said but shell think its you remember and pretty soon itll be you and itll keep right on being you till you turn into me if you know what i mean i know what you mean his younger self said still he grimaced i dont know i dont like it you have a better idea justin folded his arms across his chest and waited doing his best to be the picture of inevitability inside his stomach tied itself in knots hed always been better at the tech side of things than at sales its not fair himselfattwentyone said you know all this shit and ive gotta guess justin shrugged if you think i did all this to come back and tell you lies go ahead thats fine it was anything but fine but he couldnt let his younger self see that youll see what happens and well both be sorry i dont know his younger self shook his head again and again his eyes had a trappedanimal look i just dont know everything sounds like it hangs together but you could be bullshitting too just as easy yeah right justin couldnt remember the last time hed said that but it fit here then his younger self got up i wont say yes and i wont say no not now i wont ive got your email address ill use it out he went not quite steady on his feet justin stared after him he paid for both dinnersit seemed like peanuts to himand went home himself his younger self needed time to think things through he saw that seeing it and liking it were two different things and every minute himselfattwenty one dithered was a minute he couldnt get back he stewed he fumed he waited what other choice did he have you could whack him and take over for him but he rejected the thought with a shudder he was no murderer all he wanted was some happiness was that too much to ask he didnt think so not after all hed missed since megan made him move out he checked his email every hour on the hour
