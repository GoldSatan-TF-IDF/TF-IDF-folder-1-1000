james ellroy suicide hill youre alone and you know a few things the stars are pinholes slits in the hangmans mask them rats snakes the chased and chasers thomas lux psychiatric evaluation memorandum from alan d kurland md psychiatrist personnel division to deputy chief t r braverton commander detective division captain john a mcmanus robberyhomicide division subject hopkins lloyd w sergeant robberyhomicide division gentlemen as requested i evaluated sergeant hopkins at my private office in a series of five onehour counseling sessions conducted from november to november i found him to be a physically healthy and mentally alert man of geniuslevel intelligence he was a willing almost eager participant in these sessions belying your initial fears about his cooperation his response to intimate questions and attack queries was unwaveringly honest and candid evaluation sergeant hopkins is a violenceprone obsessivecompulsive personality this personality disorder chiefly manifesting itself in acts of excessive physical force throughout his nineteenyear career as a policeman following secondarily but directly in this overall behavior pattern is a strong sexual drive which he rationalizes as a counterbalancing effort aimed at allaying his violent impulses intellectually both of these drives have been justified by the exigencies of the job and by his desire to uphold his reputation as a uniquely brilliant and celebrated homicide detective in reality both derive from a strident pragmatism of the type seen in emotionally arrested sociopathic personalitiesquite simply a preadolescent selfishness symptomatically sergeant hopkins a selfdescribed hotdog cop and admitted sybarite has followed both his violent impulses and his sexual desires with the heedless fervor of a true sociopath however throughout the years he has felt deep guilt over his outbursts of violence and extramarital womanizing this awareness has been gradual resulting in both the resistance to eschew old behavior patterns and the desire to abandon them and thus gain peace of mind this emotional dilemma is the salient fact of his la noir neuroses yet it is unlikely that it alone by its longterm nature could have produced sergeant hopkinss current state of near nervous collapse hopkins himself attributes his present state of extreme anxiety despondency episodes of weeping and highly uncharacteristic doubts about his abilities as a policeman to his participation in two disturbing homicide investigations in january of sergeant hopkins was involved in the hollywood slaughterer case a case that remains officially unsolved although hopkins claims that he and another officer killed the perpetrator a psychopath believed to have murdered three people in the hollywood area sergeant hopkins who estimated the hollywood slaughterers victims to include an additional sixteen young women was intimately involved with the psychopaths third victim a woman named joan pratt feeling responsible for miss pratts death and the death of another woman named sherry lynn schroeder who was connected to the havillandgoff series of killings may hopkins has transferred that sense of guilt to twin obsessions of protecting innocent women and getting back his estranged wife and three daughters currently residing in san francisco these obsessions which represent delusional thinking of the type common to emotionally disturbed superior intellects were at the core of the professional blunders which led to sergeant hopkinss present suspension from duty on october of this year sergeant hopkins had succeeded in locating a third havillandgoff suspect richard oldfield in new orleans believing oldfield to be armed and dangerous he requested officers from the new orleans pd to aid him in the arrest told to remain at a safe distance while the team of nopd plainclothesmen apprehended the suspect hopkins disobeyed that order and kicked down oldfields door hesitating when he saw that oldfield was with a partially clothed woman after screaming at the woman to get dressed and get out hopkins fired at oldfield missing him and allowing him to escape out the back way while he attempted to comfort the woman the new orleans officers apprehended oldfield some minutes later two plainclothesmen were injured one seriously while making the arrest sergeant hopkins said that his episodes of weeping began shortly after this incident at oldfields arraignment sergeant hopkins was caught prevaricating on the witness stand by oldfields attorney during our second session he admitted that he faked evidence to obtain an extradition warrant for oldfield and that the reason for his courtroom lies was a desire to protect a suicide hill woman involved in the havillandgoffoldfield casea woman he was intimately involved with during the investigation sergeant hopkins became verbally abusive at this point bragging that he would never relinquish the womans name to the district attorney or any police agency conclusions sergeant hopkins fortytwo is experiencing cumulative stress reaction severe type is suffering severe nervous exhaustion exacerbated by an intransigent determination to solve his problems himselfa resolve that implicitly reinforces his personality disorder and makes continued counseling untenable as of this date i deem it impossible for sergeant hopkins to conduct homicide investigations without exploiting them in some social or sexual context it is highly improbable that he can effectively supervise other officers it is equally improbable that given his grandiose selfimage he would ever submit to the performing of nonfield duties his emotional stability is seriously impaired his stress instincts disturbed to the point where his armed presence makes him at best ineffective at worst highly dangerous as a robbery homicide detective it is my opinion that sergeant hopkins should be given early retirement and a full pension the result of a serviceconnected disability and that the administrative processes involving his separation from the lapd should be expedited with all due speed sincerely alan d kurland md psychiatrist the sheriffs transport bus pulled out of the gate of malibu fire camp its cargo sixteen inmates awaiting release work furlough and sentence modification its destination the la county main jail fifteen of the men shouted joyous obscenities pounded the windows and rattled their leg manacles the sixteenth left unencumbered by iron as a nod to his status as a class a firefighter sat up front with the driverdeputy and stared at a photo cube containing a snapshot of a woman in punkrock attire the deputy shifted into second and nudged the man you got a hardon for cyndi lauper duane rice said no officer do you the deputy smiled no but then i dont carry her picture around with me thinking fall backhes just a dumb cop making conversationrice said my girlfriend shes a singer she was singing backup for a lounge act in vegas when i took this picture whats her name vandy vandy she got one name like cher rice looked at the driver then around at the denimclad inmates most of whom would be back in the slam in a month or two tops he remembered a ditty from the jiverhyming poet whod bunked below him lacome on vacation go home on probation knowing he could outthink outgame and outmaneuver any cop judge or po he got hit with and that his destiny was the dead opposite of every man in the bus he said no anne atwater vanderlinden i made her shorten it her full name was too long no marquee value she do everything you tell her to rice then gave the deputy a mirrorperfected thats right just asking the deputy said chicks like that are hard to come by these days with banter effectively shitcanned rice leaned back and stared out the window taking cursory notice of pacific coast highway and winter deserted beaches but feeling the hum of the buss engine and the distance it was racking up between his six months of digging firebreaks and breathing flames and watching mentally impoverished lowlifes get fucked up on raisinjack and his coming two weeks of time at the new county where his sentence reduction for bravery as an inmate fireman would get him a job as a blue trusty with unlimited contact visits he looked at the plastic band on his right wrist name eightdigit booking number the california penal code abbreviation for grand theft auto and his release date the last three numbers made him think of vandy in reflex he fondled the photo cube the bus hit east la and the main county jail an hour later rice walked toward the receiving area beside the driverdeputy who unholstered his service revolver and used it as a pointer to steer the inmates to the electric doors once they were inside with the doors shut behind them the driver handed his gun to the deputy inside the plexiglas control booth and said homeboy here is going to trusty classification hes cyndi laupers boyfriend so no skin search cyndi wouldnt want us looking up his boodie the other guys are rollups for work furlough and weekend release full processing available modules the control booth officer pointed at rice and spoke into a deskmounted microphone walk blue number four fourth tank on your right rice complied placing the photo cube in his flapped breast pocket he walked down the corridor working his gait into a modified jailhouse strut that allowed him to keep his dignity and look like he fit in with the correct walk accomplished he made his eyes burn into his brain a scene that he would never again relinquish himself to prisoners packed like sardines into holding tanks fronted by floortoceiling cadmiumsteel bars shouted and muffled conversations bursting from within their confines the word fuck predominating trusties wearing slitbottomed khakis listlessly pushing brooms down the corridor a group of them standing outside the fruit tank cooing at the drag queens inside the screech and clang of barred doors jerking open and shut business as usual for institutionalized bulls and cons who didnt know theyd be shit out of luck without each other death the door to slid open rice did a quick pivot and walked in his eyes settling on the only other inmate in the tank a burly biker type sitting on the commode reading a paperback western when the door slammed shut the man looked up and said yo fish you going to classification rice decided to be civil i guess so i was hoping for a blue trusty gig but the bulls have obviously got other ideas the biker laid his book on the floor and scratched his razor stubble obviously huh just be glad you aint big like me im going to trash and freight sure as shit ill be hauling laundry bags with niggers while youre pushing a broom somewhere what you in for rice leaned against the bars gta i got sentenced to a bullet did six months at fire camp and got a modification the biker looked at rice with eyes both wary and eager for information deciding to dig for his own information rice said you know a guy named stan klein white guy about forty he would have hit here about six and a half seven months ago popped for possession and sale of cocaine lowered to some kind of misdemeanor hes probably out by now the biker stood up stretched and scratched his stomach rice saw that he was at least sixthree and felt a warning light flash in his head he a friend of yours rice caught a belated recognition of the intelligence in his eyes too smart to bullshit not really not really the big man boomed the words not really obviously you think im stupid obviously you think i dont know how to put two and two together or count obviously you think i dont know that this guy klein ratted on you made a deal with the fuzz and walked around the same time you got busted obviously you do not know that you are in the presence of a superior jailhouse intellect that does not enjoy being gamed rice swallowed dry holding eye contact with the big man waiting for his right shoulder to drop when the biker took a step backward and laughed rice stepped back and forced a smile im used to dealing with dumbfucks he said after a while you start gearing your thinking to their level the biker chuckled this guy klein fuck your woman rice saw everything go red he forgot his teachers warnings about never initiating an attack and he forgot the ritual shouts as he swung up and out with his right leg and felt the bikers jaw crack under his foot blood sprayed the air as the big man crashed into the bars shouts rose from the adjoining tanks rice kicked again as the biker hit the floor through his red curtain he heard a rib cage snap the shouts grew louder as the electric door slammed open rice swiveled to see a half dozen billy clubs arcing toward him brief thoughts of vandy kept him from attacking then everything went dark red and black module of the los angeles main county jail is known as the ding tank comprised of three tiers of oneman security cells linked together by narrow catwalks and stairways it is the facility for nonviolent prisoners too mentally disturbed to exist in the general inmate population droolers babblers public masturbators jesus shriekers and mindblown acidhead mystics awaiting lunacy hearings and eventual shipment to camarillo and countysponsored boardandcare homes although the ding inmates are kept nominally placid through the forced ingestion of highpowered tranquilizers at night when their dosages wear down they spring verbally to life and create a din heard throughout the entire jail when he returned to consciousness in a cell smack in the middle of tier module duane rice thought he was dead and in hell it took him long moments to discover that he wasnt that the tortured shouts and weeping noises were not blows causing the aches and throbs all over his torso as full consciousness dawned the pain started for real and it all came back drowning out a nearby voice screaming ronald reagan sucks cock reflexively rice ran his hands over his face and neck no blood no lumps no bruises only a swelling around his carotid artery choked out and thrown in with the dings but spared the asskicking the jailers usually gave brawlers why rice took a quick inventory of his person satisfying himself that his genitals were unharmed and that no ribs were broken taking off his shirt he probed the welts and bruises on his torso painful but probably no internal damage it was then that he remembered the photo cube and felt his first burst of panic grabbing the shirt off the floor slamming the wall when plastic shards fell from the wad of denim his fists were honing in on the cell bars when the intact photo of anne atwater vanderlinden dropped out of the right pocket and landed faceup on his mattress vandy safe rice spoke the words out loud and the ding tank cacophony receded to a hush her hush rice sat down on the edge of the mattress and moved his eyes back and forth between the photograph and the scratchedon graffiti that covered the cell walls obscenities and black power slogans took up most of the print space but near the waddedup rags that served as a pillow laboriously carved declarations of love took over tyrone and lucy big phil raul y inez por vida running his fingers over the words rice held the aches in his body to a low ebb by concentrating on the story of duane and vandy he was working as pit boss at a midas muffler franchise in the valley pilfering parts from the warehouse and selling them to louie calderon at half pop twentysix and on ya parole for vehicular manslaughter going nowhere and waiting for something to happen louie threw a party at his pad in silverlake promising threetoone women and invited him vandy was there he and louie stood by the door and critiqued the arriving females concluding that for pure sex the skinny girl in the threadbare preppy clothes was near the bottom of the list but that she had something when louie fumbled for words to explain it rice said charisma louie snapped his fingers and agreed then pointed out her shabby threads and runny nose and said snowbird i never seen her before she just sees the open door and walks in maybe she thinks she can glom some blow maybe she got charisma but she got no fucking control louies last word held rice walked over to the girl who smiled at him her face alive with little tics her instant vulnerability ate him up it was over as soon as it started they talked for twelve hours straight he told her about growing up in the projects in hawaiian gardens his boozehound parents and how they drove to the liquor store one night and never returned his ability with cars and how his parents weakness had given him a resolve never to touch booze or dope she scoffed at this saying that she and her brother were dopers because their parents were so uptight and controlled their rapport wavered until he told her the full truth about his manslaughter bust wrapping up both their defiances with a bright red ribbon when he was twentytwo he had a job tuning sports cars at a maserati dealership in beverly hills the other mechanics were loadies who were always ragging him about his disdain for dope one night they fashioned a speedball out of pharmacy meth and percodan and slipped it into his coffee right before he went out to test the idle on a customers ferrari the speedball kicked in as he was driving down doheny he immediately realized what was happening and pulled to the curb determined to wait the high out and do some serious asskicking then it got really bad he started hallucinating and thought he saw the dopeslippers walking across the street a half block down he gunned the engine speedshifted into second and plowed into them at seventy the front bumper was torn off the grille caved in and a severed arm flew across the windshield he downshifted turned the corner onto wilshire got out and ran like hell an incredible adrenaline jolt obliterating the dope rush by the time he had run out of beverly hills he felt in control he knew that he had gotten his revenge and now he had to play the game with the law and get off cheap a twohour steam bath at the hollywood y sweated the rest of the speedball out of his system he took a cab to the beverly hills police station gouged his arm with a penknife to induce crocodile tears and turned himself in he was charged with two counts of thirddegree manslaughter and hit and run bail was set at and arraignment was set for the following morning at arraignment he learned that the two people he had killed were not the dopeslipping mechanics but a solidcitizen husband and wife he pleaded guilty anyway expecting a deuce maximum back on the street in eighteen months tops the judge a kindlylooking old geezer gave him a tenminute lecture five years state time suspended and his sentence one thousand hours of picking up paper refuse from the gutters of doheny avenue between beverly boulevard on the north and pico boulevard on the south after courtroom spectators applauded the decree the judge asked him if he had anything to say he said yes then went on to tell the judge that his mother sucked giant donkey dicks in a tijuana whorehouse and that his wife turned tricks with the gorillas in the griffith park zoo the judge recanted his sentence suspension and hit him with five years in the california youth authority facility at soledadthe baby joint and gladiator school when rice finished his story anne vanderlinden doubled over with laughter and launched her rap chainsmoking two full packs until all the guests had either split or were coupled off in louies upstairs bedrooms she told him about growing up rich in grosse pointe michigan and her hardass tax lawyer father valiumaddict mother and religious crackpot brother who got bombed on acid and stared at the sun seeking mystical synergy until he went totally blind she told him how she dropped out of college because it was boring and how she blew her trust fund on coke and friends and how she liked blow but wasnt strung out rice found her use of street argot naive but pretty well done knowing she was on the skids and probably sleeping around for a place to stay he steered her talk away from the present and into the future what did she really want to do anne vanderlindens little facial tics exploded as she tripped over words to explain her love of music and her plans to spotlight her singing and dancing talents in a series of rock videos one for punk one for ballads one for disco rice watched her features contort as she spoke wanting to grab her head and smooth her face until she was perfectly soft and pretty finally he clutched her lank blonde hair and drew it back into a bun that tightened the skin around her eyes and cheeks whispering babe you wont have shit until you quit sticking that garbage up your nose and you find someone to look after you she fell sobbing into his arms later after they made love she told him it was the first time shed cried since her brother went blind it was over the next few weeks after anne atwater vanderlinden had moved in with him and become vandy that he figured it out you dont wait for things to happenyou make them happen if your woman wants to become a rock star you regulate her coke use and buy her a sexy wardrobe and cultivate music business connections who can do her some good vandy could sing and dance as well as a half dozen female rock stars he knew of and she was too good to go the triedanduntrue route of demo tapes backup gigs and lackluster club dates she had an ace in the hole she had him and he had a chump change job at midas muffler a parole officer who looked at him like he was something that crawled out from under a rock and an overpriced apartment with worldclass cockroaches with his debits cataloged rice figured out his credits he was a great mechanic he knew how to deactivate automobile alarm systems and bore steering columns for a fortysecond start any car anywhere anytime he knew enough industrial chemistry to compound corrosive solutions that would eat the serial numbers off engine blocks he had solid soledad connections who would fix him up with good fences he would make it happen become a worldclass car thief set up vandys career and get out clean for a year and a half it worked with three strategically located storage garages rented and armed with a batterypowered ignition drill he stole late model japanese imports and sold them at twothirds their resale value to a buddy hed known in the joint supervising the engine block dips that rendered the cars untraceable rotating his ripoff territory throughout la and ventura counties to avoid the scrutiny of individual auto theft details in two months he had the down payment for a classy west la condo in three months he had vandy primed for stardom with a health food diet daily aerobics coke as an occasional reward and three walkin closets stuffed with designer threads in four months he had the feedback of two highpriced voice teachers vandy was a weak near tonedeaf soprano with virtually no range she had a decent vibrato growl that could be jazzed up with a good amplifier and gave great microphone head she had the haunted sex look of a punkrock starand very limited talent rice accepted the appraisalsthey made him love vandy more he altered his game plan for crashing the la rock music scene and took vandy to vegas where he dug up three outofwork musicians and paid them two bills a week to serve as her backup group next he bribed the owner of a slot machine arcadebarconvenience store into featuring vandy and the vandals as his lounge act four shows a night seven days a week vandys vibrato growled the punk lyrics of the groups drummer she drew wolf whistles when she sang and wild applause when she humped the air and sucked the microphone after a month of watching his woman perform rice knew she was ready back in la armed with professional photographs bribed press raves and a doctored demo tape he tried to find vandy an agent one brick wall after another greeted him when he got past secretaries he got straight brushoffs and ill call yous and when he got past them and whipped out vandys photos he got comments like interesting nice bod and foxy chick finally in the sunset strip office of an agent named jeffrey jason rifkin his frustration came to a head when rifkin handed back the photos and said cute but i have enough clients right now rice balled his fists and took a bead on the mans head then inspiration struck and he said jew boy howd you like a brandnew silver gray mercedes sl absolutely free a week later after he picked up his car rifkin told rice that he could introduce him to a lot of people who might help vandys career and that her idea of showcasing her talent via a series of rock videos was an excellent highexposure breakthrough strategy albeit expensive k minimum he would do what he could with his contacts but in the meantime he also knew a lot of people who would pay hard cash for discount benzes and other status carspeople in the industry rice smiled use and be usedan arrangement he could trust he and vandy went hollywood rifkin was partially good to his word he never procured any recording or club gigs but he did introduce them to a large crowd of semisuccessful tv actors directors coke dealers and lowerechelon movie executives many of whom were interested in highline cars with mexican license plates at tremendous discounts over the next year paperwork aided by an ensenada dmvemployed cousin of his old soledad buddy chula medina rice stole highliners banking close to a hundred fifty thou toward the production of vandys rock videos and then just as he was about to drill the column of a chocolatebrown benz ragtop four lapd auto theft dicks drew down on him with shotguns and one of them whispered freeze or die motherfucker out on bail his show biz attorney gave him the word for the right amount of cash his bank account would not be seized and he would get a year county time if the money were not paid it would be a parole violation and probable indictments on at least another fifteen counts of grand theft auto the lapd had an informant by the balls and they were squeezing him hard he could only buy the judge if he acted now if he were quickly sentenced the lapd would most likely drop its investigation rice agreed the decision cost him an even his attorneys fees cost him an additional forty ten k for vandy and bribe money his lawyer slipped to an lapd records clerk to learn the identity of the informant had eaten up the rest of his bank account and had not yielded the name of the snitch rice suspected the reason for this was that the shyster pocketed the bread because he knew that the snitch was stan klein a coke dealer entrepreneur in the hollywood crowd they ran with when he learned klein had been popped for conspiracy to sell dangerous drugs and that it was later dropped to a misdemeanor he became the number one suspect but he had to be sure and the decision to be sure had cost him his last dime and gotten him zilch and two weeks away from the release date hed eaten smoke fire and bullshit to earn hed fucked it up and probably earned himself a firstdegree assault charge and at least another ninety days of county time and vandy hadnt written to him or visited him in a month on your feet blue wristband count rice jerked his head in the direction of the words i wont let you medicate me he said ill fight you and the whole la county sheriffs department before i let you zone me out on that prolixin shit nobody wants to medicate you blue the voice said a few of la countys finest might wanta shake your hand but thats about it besides i can sell that goose juice on the street make a few bucks and serve law and order by keeping the negro element sedated lets try this again wristband count walk over to the bars stick your right wrist out to me tell me your name and booking number rice got up walked to the front of the cell and stuck his right arm through the bars the owner of the voice came into focus on the catwalk a pudgy deputy with thin gray hair blown out in a razor cut his name tag read g meyers rice duane richard when do i get arraigned on the new charge deputy g meyers laughed what new charge that scumbag you wasted was in for assault on a police officer with a half dozen priors and you carried three la county firemen to safety during the agoura fire are you fucking serious the watch commander read your record then scumbags and made scumbag a deal he presses charges on you then the county presses charges on him for grabbing your shlong not wanting a fruit jacket he agreed he gets to spend the rest of his sentence in the hospital ward and you get to serve as blue trusty here in the rubber ramada where hopefully you will not get the urge to whip any more ass where did you learn that kung fu shit rice kicked the news around in his head sizing up the man whod delivered it friendly and harmless he decided probably close to retirement with no good guysbad guys left in him soledad he said there was a jap corrections officer who taught classes he gave us a lot of spiritual stuff along with it but nobody listened the warden finally got wise to the fact that he was teaching violent junior criminals to be better violent junior criminals and stopped it whats a ding trusty do meyers took a key from his sam browne belt and unlocked the cell come on well go down to my office ive got a bottle well belt a few and ill tell you about the job i dont drink yeah what the fuck kind of criminal are you the smart kind you booze on duty meyers laughed and tapped his badge turned my papers in yesterday twenty years and nine days on the job ironclad civil service pension im only sticking around until they rotate in a new man to fill my spot ten days from now i am adios motherfucker so till then im playing catchup as gordon meyers explained it the job was simple sleep all day while the dings were dinged out on their medication eat leftovers from the officers dining room have free run of his collection of playboy and penthouse be cool with the daywatch jailer at night his duties began feed the dings their one meal per day move them out of their cells one at a time and mop the floors get them to the showers once a week the most important thing was to keep them reasonably quiet at night meyers emphasized he would be using his onduty time to read the classified ads and write out job applications and he did not want the dings dinging his concentration talk softly to them if they started to scream and if that failed scream back and make them scared of you if worse came to worse give them a spritz of the fire hose and any ding who smeared shit on his cell walls got five whacks in the ass with the leadfilled dingdonger meyers carried rice promised to do a good job and decided to wait five days before manipulating the fatmouthed cop for favors the job was simple rice slept six hours a day ate the highquality institutional fare the jailers ate and did a minimum of one thousand pushups daily at night he would bring the dings their chow gi their cells and stroll the catwalk exchanging words with them through the bars he found that if he kept up a continuous line of celltocell communication the dings screamed less and he thought of vandy less after a few days he got to know some of the guys and tailored his spiels to fit their individual boogeymen a was a black guy popped for getting dogs out of the lincoln heights shelter and cooking them up for rastafarian feasts the bulls had shaved off his dreadlocks before they threw him in the tank and he was afraid that demons could enter his brain through his bald head rice told him that dreadlocks were out and brought him a copy of ebony that featured ads for various afro wigs he pointed out that the reverend jesse jackson was sporting a modified afro and getting a lot of pussy the man nodded along grabbed the magazine and from then on would yell afro wig when rice strolled by his cell c was an old man who wanted to get off the streets and back to camarillo rice falsely reported him as a shitsmearer for three nights running and gave him three fake beatings thumping the dingdonger into the mattress and screaming himself on the third night meyers got tired of the noise and turned the old man over to the head jailer of the hospital ward who said the geezer was camarillo quail for sure the tattooed man in c was the hardest to deal with because the white trash rice grew up with in hawaiian gardens all had tattoos and he early on figured tattooing as the mark of the worlds ultimate losers c a youth awaiting a conservatorship hearing had his entire torso adorned with snarling jungle cats and was trying to tattoo his arms with a piece of mattress spring and the ink off newspapers soaked in toilet water he had managed to gouge the first two letters of mom when rice caught him and took his spring away he started bawling then and rice screamed at him to quit marking himself like a lowlife sleazebag finally the young man quieted down every time he walked by the cell rice would roust him for tattooing tools after a few times the youth snapped into a frisking position when he heard him coming around midnight when the dings began falling asleep rice joined gordon meyers in his office and listened to his dingedout ramblings biting his cheeks to keep from laughing rice nodded along as meyers told him of the crime scams hed dreamed up in his sixteen years working the tank a couple were almost smart like a plan to capitalize on his locksmith expertisegetting a job as a bank guard and pilfering safedeposit box valuables to local beat cops who frequented the bank staying above suspicion by not leaving the bank and letting the beat cops do the fencing but most were twilight zone material prostitution rings of women prisoners bused around to construction sites where they would dispense blowjobs to horny workers in exchange for sentence reductions marijuana farms staffed by inmate harvesters who would cultivate tons of weed and load it into the sheriffs helicopters that would drop it off into the backyards of highranking police pushers porno films featuring male and female inmates directed by meyers himself to be screened on the exclusive allcop cable network he planned to set up meyers rambled on for three nights rice moved his plan up a day and started telling him about vandy about how she hadnt written to him or visited him in weeks meyers sympathized and mentioned that he was the one who made sure his photo of her wasnt destroyed when the bulls choked him out after thanking him for that rice made his pitch could he use the phone to make calls to get a line on her meyers said no and told him to write her name date of birth physical description and last known address on a piece of paper rice did it then sat there gouging his fingernails into his palms to keep from hitting the dingedout deputy ill handle it gordon meyers said ive got clout over the next fortyeight hours rice concentrated on not clouting the dings or the inanimate objects in the tank he upped his pushup count to two thousand a day he laid a barrage of brownnosing on the daywatch jailer hoping for at least a phone call to louie calderon who could probably be persuaded to check around for vandy he stayed away from gordon meyers busying himself with long stints of pacing the catwalks and then just after midnight when the ding noise subsided meyerss voice came over the tanks pa system duane rice roll it to the office your attorney is here rice walked into the office figuring meyers was fried and wanted to bullshit and there she was dressed in pink cords and a kelly green sweater an outfit hed told her never to wear told you i had clout meyers said as he closed the door on them rice watched vandy put her hands on her hips and pivot to face him a seduction pose hed devised for her lounge act he was starting toward her when he caught his first glimpse of her face his world crashed when he saw the hollows in her cheeks and the blueblack circles under her eyes strung out he grabbed her and held her until she said stop duane that hurts then he put his hands on her shoulders pushed her out to arms length and whispered why babe we had a good deal going vandy twisted free of his grasp these cops came by the condo and told me you were really sick so i came then your friend tells me youre not really sick you just wanted to see me thats not fair duane i was going to taper off and be totally clean by the time you got out its not fair so dont be mad at me rice stared at the wall clock to avoid vandys cokestressed face where have you been why havent you been to see me vandy took her purse off meyerss desk and dug through it for cigarettes and a lighter rice watched her hands tremble as she lit up exhaling a lungful of smoke she said i didnt come to see you at camp because it was too depressing and you know i hate to write rice caught his hands shaking and jammed them into his pants pockets yeah but what have you been doing besides sticking shit up your nose vandy cocked one hip in his direction another move hed taught her making friends cultivating the right people like you told me i should do hanging out friends you mean men vandy flushed then said just friends people what about your friends that guy gordon is looney tunes when he brought me up from the parking lot he told me he was going to organize this hit squad of doberman pinschers what kind of friends have you been making rice felt his anger ease the fire in vandys eyes was hope gordons not a bad guy hes just been hanging around wackos too long listen are you okay on bread have you got any of the money i gave you left im okay vandy lowered her eyes rice saw the fire die you holding out on me babe ten k wouldnt have lasted you this long if you were on a coke run you feel like telling me about these fr vandy threw her purse at the wall and shrieked dont be so jealous of me you told me i should get in with people in the industry and thats what ive been doing i hate you when youre this way rice reached out for her wrist but she batted his hand and moved backward until she bumped the wall and there was no place to go except forward into his arms with her elbows pressed into herself she let him embrace her and stroke her hair easy babe he cooed easy ill be out in a few days and ill get working on your videos again ill make it happen well make it happen wanting to see vandys face rice dropped his arms and stepped back when she brought her eyes up to him he saw that she looked like the old anne atwater vanderlinden not the woman he molded and loved how duane she said you cant steal cars anymore another job at midas muffler rice let the ugly words hang there between them vandy walked past him and picked her purse up off the floor then turned around and said this whole thing wasnt fair ive been making friends who can help me and i deserve to do a little blow if i want to your control trip is really uptight uptight people dont make it in the industry there was a rapping at the door and meyers poked his head in and said i hate to break this up but the watch commander is walking and i dont think hell buy vandy here as an attorney rice nodded then walked to vandy and tilted her chin up so that their eyes locked go back to the pad babe try to stay clean and ill see you on the thirtieth he bent over and kissed the part in her hair vandy stood still and mute with her eyes closed and dont ever underestimate me rice said meyers was waiting for him on the catwalk tapping a billy club against his leg listen a is acting up he shit on his mattress and smeared food on the walls you go give him a few whacks with the dingdonger while i escort your girl downstairs when you get him pacified come back to the office and well bat the breeze rice grabbed the billy club and strode down the catwalk pushing images of vandys decay out of his mind by concentrating on the jumble of ding noises wishing the babbles and shouts would engulf him to the point where all his senses were numbed slapping the dingdonger harder and harder into his palm he turned into the open front of a wondering why the light was off he was about to call out for meyers to hit the electricity when the door slid shut behind him the darkness deepened and the ding noise grew still then fired up again rice yelled unlock a gordon goddammit then squinted around the cell as his eyes became accustomed to the dark he saw that it was empty he smashed the billy club into the bars full force once twice three times hoping to scare the dings into temporary quiet the crash of metal on metal assailed him and the force of the blows sent shock waves through his entire body a hush came over the tank followed by meyerss mocking laugh and the words told you i had clout when the meaning clicked fully in rice began smashing the club into the wall four shots at a time hearing hellish whispers in the wake of the noise its real pharmaceutical blow baby duane wouldnt want me to come on sweetie party hearty when the voices degenerated into giggles he slammed the dingdonger harder and harder until the wood casing cracked and the dings screamed along in cadence with his blows then sections of plaster exploded in his eyes and into his mouth and his head started to reel he surrendered himself to the asphyxiation and fell backward into total silence a severed arm spraying blood across a windshield the steam room at the hollywood y rice came to with a ringing in his ears and a hazy red curtain in front of his eyes snapping immediately to the bandage at the crook of his elbow and the walltowall padding that surrounded him goosejuiced because he had destroyed a because gordon had rice held his breath until he passed out his last halfconscious thought to kill the dope with sleep and get even he slept wakened slept stumbling trips to the toilet untouched trays of food and a thickening razor stubble marked his drifting in and out of consciousness dimly he knew his kickout date was coming and the bulls were leaving him alone because they were afraid of him but vandy no again and again he plunged into selfasphyxiation finally hunger jerked him fully awake he counted twelve trays of stale sandwiches and figured his prolixin jolt had lasted four days leaving him three days from the streets ravenous he ate until he threw up that night a mexican deputy came by his cell to bring him a fresh tray and told him he was in hospital isolation between the ding and the highpower tanks and that his release date was two days away the jailer was wearing a paper party hat rice asked him why the nightwatch ding jailer just retired he said the watch commander threw him a party rice nodded it couldnt have happened vandy would never let a wimp like gordon meyers touch her but when the jailer walked away the doubts came back he tried to force sleep but it wouldnt come the edge of his vision started to go red hours of pushups and leg lifts produced an exhaustion that felt pure and nonchemical rice drifted off again then awakened to muffled voices coming from somewhere outside his cell he followed the sound to a grated ventilator shaft next to the toilet peering through the grates he saw two pairs of denimclad legs facing each other the white stripes along the pants seams were a dead giveawayhe was looking into a highpower tank cell laughter then a deep voice taking over his words echoing clearly through the shaft i heard a dream score the other day from this black guy on the folsom chain he and his partner were gonna do it then he got violated on a liquor store heist he was one smart nigger he had it documented the whole shot a different softer voice smart nigger is a contradiction in terms bullshit dig this threeman stickup gang a bonaroo kidnap angle an ace fucking safeguard heres the play two guys hold the girlfriend of

city a house on the corner of hildebrand and gage i told you one smart fucking nigger i still dont believe it if bo derek offered you a headjob youd think she was a drag queen youre just a terminal fucking skeptic rice listened as the conversation deteriorated into the usual jailhouse shtick of sports and sex when the talk died altogether he lay down with his head next to the ventilator shaft and once more fell asleep vandy took over his dreams shorttake images of her laughing moving around in bed then she was there with the vandals vibrato growling their closing number gotta get down in the prison of your love get down get down gonna drown gonna come so good so hard burn my body in your prison yard prison of your love rice awakened for the final time in la county jail stint just as vandy and the vandals brought prison of your love to its offkey crescendo coward he said to himself coward using sleep the way a junkie uses smack maybe she fucked him and maybe she didnt when you look into her eyes youll know so stay awake and fight he stood up and looked around the cell his eyes catching a wad of newspaper beside the toilet and a book of matches on top of the sink thinking let them know he struck a match on the ventilator grate then lit the newspaper and watched it fireball when it started to burn his hand he dropped it into the toilet and listened to the sizzle and hiss of newsprint satisfied with the way the ink was running he turned his attention to the floortowalltoceiling padding gouging was the only way rice dug his fingernails into a seam of wall padding and pulled outward naugahyde foam and a layer of webbed cotton were revealed he poked a finger into the hole and felt metal in back of the webbing spring reinforcement he gouged his way to it then twisted the nearest piece of metal back and forth until it broke off in his hand it took him hours to hone his tool on the ventilator shaft grates when the spring was razor sharp he pressed it into a sodden ball of newspaper and darkened the tip flexing his left biceps into a hard surface he thought of hawaiian gardens and vandy then he marked himself with his past and future so the whole world would know the words were death before dishonor bobby boogaloo garcia watched his kid brother joe loosen his clerical collar and do air guitar riffs in front of the bedroom mirror he felt his own priest outfit constrict his body and said i cant take none of your rock and roll rap today pendejo i quit fighting cause niggers kept knocking me out in the third round and youll never make it as a musician cause you got no drive and no talent but we both got a job to do and were behind for the month so lets do it joe cut off the music in his head his lyrics put to an old fats domino tune suicide hill substituted for blueberry hill leave it to bobby to puncture both their balloons with one shot so he wouldnt have a good comeback tomorrows december first the christmas rush and the rainy season well double up on bibles and prayer kits and siding jobs bobbys jaw clenched at the last words and joe added and well give some money to saint sebastians a tithe well find some suckers with bucks and rip them off and give the dinero to earthquake re bobby stopped him with a slow finger across the throat not earthquake relief puto its a scam you dont do penance for one scam by giving bucks to another one but henderson gave two grand to that priest from the archdiocese for earthquake relief he bobby shook his head a scam within a scam within a scam pendejo he gave the priest a check for two k and got a receipt for three that priest has got a brother in the das office the fraud division need i say fucking more joe tightened his collar feeling his nice guymusician self slip back into father hernandez the phone scam padre he grabbed a stack of naugahydebound bibles off the floor and carried them out to the car wondering for the ten millionth time how bobby could love hating his brother and his job and his life as much as he did bobby and joe worked for henderson enterprises inc purveyors of aluminum siding and bibles in spanish the scam originated in a phone room where salesmen pitched rustproof patios and eternal salvation through jesus to unsophisticated and semiimpoverished angelenos offering them free gas coupons as a comeon to get the field representative out to their homes where he signed them up for lifetime protection guarantees which in reality meant a new siding job or bible on a regular installation basismeaning debilitating permanent monthly payments to whoever was gullible enough to sign on the dotted line which was where bobby and joe as father gonzalez and father hernandez labased freelance priests came in they were the heavy closerspsychological intimidation specialists who sized up weaknesses on the followup calls and made the sucker sign setting in motion a string of kickbacks originating in the main office of us aluminum inc and its subsidiary company the truth and light publishing house with the trunk of their camaro stuffed with bibles siding samples and wall hangings of jesus the garcias drove to a close in el monte on the pomona freeway joe was at the wheel humming springsteen under his breath so his brother wouldnt hear bobby threw short punches toward the windshield and stared out at the dark clouds that were forming hoping for thundershowers to spook their closees into buying when raindrops spattered the glass in front of him he closed his eyes and thought of how everything important in his life happened when it was raining like the time he sparred with little red lopez and knocked him through the ropes with a perfect right cross red said his timing was off because bad weather made his old knife scars ache like the time joe and his garage band won the battle of the bands at el monte legion stadium he played adoring older brother and glommed a groupie who gave him head in his car while he smoked weed and kept the wipers going so he could eyeball prowling fuzz like the righteous burglaries he and joe pulled in west la during the floods when the lapd and chp were all evacuating hillsides and mopping blood off the freeways like the time he felt guilty about treating joe like dirt and agreed to rip off the guitars and amplifiers from the j geils bass players pad in benedict canyon halfway down to sunset with the loot the car fishtails and sideswipes a sheriffs nark ark joe freaks at the badge and cocked magnum in his face and starts blabbing how a hitchhiker left the stuff in the trunk no way jose the cop said bingo nine months in the laundry at wayside like the times when they were kids and joe got terrified of thunder and woke him up and made him promise always to protect him bobby switched to left jabs aimed at the wiper blades pulling his fist back a split second before it hit the glass watching joe flinch out of the corner of his eye i always carried you aint i like i promised to when we were kids joe kept his eyes on the road but clenched his elbows to his side like he always did when bobby started talking scary sure bobby thats true and youve always watchdogged me when i got off too deep into my weird shit aint that true joe saw what was coming and swallowed so his voice would be steady thats true youve got to say it tightening his hands on the wheel joe fought an image of their last b ampe of the woman with her skirt up over her head bobby with his knife at her throat as he raped her yyoud be youd hurt people what kind of people joe stared straight ahead the sky was getting darker and taillights began flashing on concentrating on their reflections off the wet pavement gave him a moment to think up a new answer that would satisfy bobbys weirdness and let him keep a piece of his pride he was about to speak when a station wagon swerved in front of them joe flinched backward and bobby grabbed the wheel out of his hands and yanked it hard right the car lurched forward missing the station wagons rear bumper by inches bobby jammed his foot onto the accelerator looked over his shoulder saw a tight passing space and jerked the car across four lanes and down a darkened offramp he slowly applied the brake and when they came to a stop at the flooded intersection joe was brushing tears from his eyes say it bobby said joe screamed the words his voice breaking youre a rapeo youre a mind fuck youre on a wacko guilt trip and im not kicking out any more of my money for your penance he swung the car out into the stream of traffic punching the gas doing a deft brody that set off a chain of honks from cutoff motorists bobby cracked the passenger window for air then said softly i just want you to know how things are how theyre always gonna be i owe you for getting us out of burglary too many women out there too many chances to pull weird shit but you owe me your guts cause without me you aint got any we gotta remember that stuff knowing bobby was trying to get at something joe pressed the edge that his tears always gave him you sent that woman five k right the money orders were cashed so you know she got them you sent her a note so even though the signatures on the checks were false she knew it was you you havent done it again so why are you rehashing all this old stuff weve got a good deal with hendy but you keep talking it down like its nothing bobby popped short leftright combos until his arms ached and his tunic was soaked with sweat im just getting itchy little brother he said at last like something has gotta happen real soon take surface streets i gotta cool out before the close they cruised east on valley boulevard joe driving slowly in the middle lane so he could scope out the scene on both sides of the street the rain died to a drizzle and bobby took a hand squeeze from the glove compartment and started a long set of grip builders dangling his right arm out the window to get a good extension when joe saw that the streets were nothing but usedcar lots liquor stores burrito stands and boredom he tried to think up some more lyrics to suicide hill when words wouldnt come he slumped down in his seat and let the story take over suicide hill was a long cement embankment that led down to a deep sewage sluice in back of the sepulveda va hospital the hill and the scrubland that surrounded it were encircled by high barbedwire fencing that was cut through in dozens of places by the gang members who used it as a meeting place and fuck turf the hill itself was used to test courage steep and slick from spilled oil it served as the ultimate motorcycle gauntlet riders would start at the top and try to coast down slowly picking up speed then popping the bike into first and hurdling the sewage sluice which was thirteen feet across and rife with garbage industrial chemicals and a thirtyyear accumulation of sharp objects thrown in to inflict pain gang rivalries were settled by two riders starting off on top of the hill at the same time each armed with a bicycle chain the object to knock the opponent into the muck while hurdling it himself scores of bodies were rumored to be decomposing in the sluice suicide hill was considered a bad motherfucker and a destroyer of good men so was the man it was named after fritz suicide hill and the va hospital dated back to the days immediately following world war ii when scores of returning gis necessitated the creation of veterans domiciles rumor had it that fritz was housed at the brandnew institution for shell shock and after his recovery was assigned to a domicile ward to ease his emotional readjustment fritz had other ideas he pitched a tent in the scrubland by the embankment and started an la chapter of the hells angels then embarked on a career as a motorcycle highwayman shaking down motorists all over southern california always returning to his encampment by the sepulveda wash that part of the legend joe accepted as fact the rest was a mixture of bullshit and tall tales and the part that joe wanted to put into his song suicide hill sliced the guy who sliced the black dahlia he masterminded a plot to break caryl chessman out of death row he tommygunned niggers from a freeway overpass during the watts riot he turned leary on to acid and kicked charlie mansons ass the cops wouldnt fuck with him because he knew where the bodies were buried even legendary hot dogs like john st john colin forbes and crazy lloyd hopkins shit shotgun shells when suicide hill made the scene the most popular ending of the legend had fritz hill dying of cancer from all the chemicals hed sucked in during his many dunks in the sepulveda wash when he saw the end coming he hauled his cc vincent black shadow up to the roof of the hospital and popped a wheelie over the edge in second gear flying some five hundred yards before he crashed into the scrubland igniting a funeral pyre that could be seen all over la joe knew that the whole story rebop truth and all was the story of everything he and bobby had ever done but all he had so far was and death was a thrill on suicide hilland those ten bars were enough for a plagiarism beef bobby nudged him out of his reverie hang a right the pad should be on the next block joe complied pulling onto a street of identical tract houses all of them painted pink peach or electric blue bobby scanned addresses then pointed to the curb and shook his head jesus christ father hernandez another stone wacko que father gonzalez joe set the brake and got out of the car then looked over at the front lawn of the closees pad and answered his own question wackos not the word padre the walkway of the peachcolored house was lined with dayglo plaster statues of jesus and his disciples on one side of the lawn a plastic saint francis stood guard over a flock of walt disney squeeze toys on the other side stuffed teddy bears and pandas were arranged around a papiermache nativity scene joe walked over and checked out the manger a donald duck doll was wrapped in swaddling clothes minnie mouse and snoopy leaned against the crib sheepherder staffs pinned to their sides the whole collage was sopping wet from the rain holy fuck he whispered bobby cuffed him on the back of the head this is too fucking sad anybody this fucking crazy has gotta be a rollover lets just get a signature and split he shoved a turquoise bible and matching siding sample at joe then stared at the opposite side of the lawn his eyes caught a toppled jesus statue and a kermit the frog puppet going sixtynine he grabbed joes arm and pushed him up the walkway five minutes in and out no rosaries no bullshit before joe could respond a fat white woman in a rumpled housedress opened the door and stood on the porch in front of them grateful that she wasnt mexican bobby said im father gonzalez and this is father hernandez were the field priests from the henderson company we brought you your siding sample and bible the workmen will be out to put up your patio next week he reached into his breast pocket for a blank contract all we need is your signature if you sign today you get our november bonus the henderson prayer service millions of catholics worldwide will pray for you every day for the rest of your life the woman reached into the pockets of her dress and pulled out rosary beads and a wad of onedollar bills she bit at her lip and said the phone man said i got to give to earthquake relief to get prayed for he said to give you the money to give to him and youd pray for my husband too hes got the cancer powerful bad joe was reaching for the money when he saw bobby smile the slow smile he used to flash just before a fight he knew he was going to lose he dropped his hand and stood off to one side as the veins in his brothers forehead started to twitch and spit bubbles popped from his mouth the woman stammered hehes sick powerful bad and bobby ran back to the car and began hurling bibles and siding samples out into the street covering the pavement with pastel naugahyde and aluminum when there were no more phone scam products left to throw he tore off his priest jacket and his cassock and dropped them into the gutter followed by the money in his pants pockets joe stood on the porch beside the shockstilled woman watching the last five years of his life go up in smoke knowing that what made it so bad was that bobby believed in god worse than any of the people he hurt three weeks into his suspension from duty lloyd hopkins flew to san francisco and kept his family under a rolling stakeout he rented a room at a holiday inn on the edge of chinatown and a latemodel ford and watched from a distance as his wife made her rounds of the city as an antique broker and met her lover for drinks dinner and overnight visits at her pacific heights apartment from a further distance he followed his daughters to school on errands and out on dates after a week of loose surveillance he knew that he had gleaned no information and gained no special insights that would make his job easier all he could do was let them find him and see where it went from there he decided to let the girls make the discovery and drove to their school and parked across the street at classes adjourned for an hour and anne and caroline always ate with friends under the big oak tree in the schools backyard while penny skipped lunch and brooded by herself on the steps if he stood by the car big and familiar in his favorite herringbone jacket then sooner or later they would notice him and he would be able to read their faces and know what to do at precisely the schools back door opened and the first wave of students exited and jockeyed for positions under the oak tree lloyd got out and leaned against the hood of his car anne and caroline appeared moments later chattering and making faces as they examined the contents of their lunch sacks they found spaces on the grass and began eating caroline making her usual liverwurst face as she unwrapped her first sandwich penny walked out then peering around before disappearing into a swarm of children lloyd felt tears in his eyes but kept them on his daughters anyway waiting for the moment of recognition loitering in the vicinity of school yards huh lets see your id pervert lloyd did a slow turn savoring the sound of pennys voice and the anticipation of their identical gray eyes meeting penny foiled his plan by jumping into his arms and burying her head in his chest lloyd held his youngest daughter and dried his eyes on her dodgers cap when she started growling and nudging his shoulders like a cat he growled back and said whos the pervert and whats with this feline stuff the last i heard you were a penguin penny stepped back lloyd saw that the color in her eyes had deepened gaining a hint of janices hazel penguins are passe youve lost weight daddy what are you doing in frisco this skulkingaround scene wasnt too subtle you know lloyd laughed do the others know im here penny shook her head no theyre not too subtle either i figured it out two days ago this friend of mine said there was this big man in a tweed jacket checking out the school yard he said the guy looked like a nark or a perv i said that sounds like my dad i kept peeking outside during classes until i saw you she stood on her tiptoes and poked lloyds necktie speaking of which my dummy sisters just figured it out looking over his shoulder lloyd saw caroline and anne staring at him even from a distance he could see shock and anger on their faces he waved and anne dropped her lunch sack and grabbed her sisters arm together they ran toward the schools back door lloyd looked at penny theyre pissed why the last time i came up we got along great penny leaned against the car its cumulative daddy were the geniuses theyre the plodders they resent me because im the youngest the smartest and have the biggest breasts they no goddammit what really dont yell im serious annie and liney have gone tres frisco they want mom to divorce you and marry roger mom and roger are on the rocks so theyre scared daddy are you in trouble in the department realizing that his two older daughters werent going to join him lloyd put an arm around his youngest and drew her close yeah i blew an extradition bust and fucked up at the guys arraignment ive been suspended from duty until the first of the year im not sure whats going to happen but im sure im finished in robberyhomicide i might get transferred to a uniformed division until my twenty years come up i might get my choice of flake assignments i just dont fucking know penny burrowed deeper into her father and youre scared yeah im scared and you still want all of us back more than ever

lloyd laughed ive been observing you lately dont you ever eat lunch penny laughed back the school serves nothing but health food and moms sandwiches suck i hit a burger joint on the way home come on well get a pizza and conspire against your mother after a long lunch lloyd dropped penny back at school and drove to janices apartment there was a note on the door rogerrunning late make yourself at home should ret around he checked his watch and picked the lock with a credit card and let himself in when he saw the state of the living room he realized janices success not her lover was his chief competition every piece of furniture was a fraillooking antique the type he had told her never to buy for the house because he was afraid it wouldnt support his pounds every framed painting was the german expressionist stuff he despised the rugs were light blue persian the kind janice had always wanted but was certain hed ruin with coffee stains everything was tasteful expensive and a testament to her freedom as a single woman lloyd sat down carefully in a cherrywood armchair and stretched his legs so that his feet rested on polished hardwood not pale carpeting he tried to kill time imagining what janice would be wearing but kept picturing her nude when that led to thoughts of roger he let his eyes scan the room for something of or by himself seeing nothing he fought an impulse to check out janices bedroom then he heard a key in the lock and felt himself start to shiver janice saw him immediately and didnt register an ounce of surprise hello lloyd she said liney called me at the office and told me you were in town i expected you to come by but i didnt expect you to break in lloyd stood up a red wool suit and a new shorter hairdo he hadnt been close cops have criminal tendencies you look wonderful jan janice sighed and let her purse drop to the floor no i dont im fortytwo and im putting on weight im fortytwo and losing weight so i can see so much for the amen lloyd took two steps forward janice one they embraced hands to shoulders keeping a space between them lloyd broke it off first so the contact wouldnt make him want more he took a step backward and said you know why im here janice pointed to a louis xiv sofa yes of course when lloyd sat down she took a chair across from him and said i know what you want and im glad that you want it but i dont know what i want and i may never know thats as honest an answer as i can give you lloyd felt threads of their past unraveling not knowing whether to press or retreat he said youve made a good life for yourself here this pad your business the life youve set up for the girls i also have a lover lloyd yeah roger the onandoff lodger hows that going janice laughed youre such a riot when you try to act civilized i read about you in the la papers a couple of weeks ago some man you captured in new orleans some man whose capture i fucked up in new orleans some man whose arraignment i almost blew in la janice smoothed the hem of her skirt and leaned forward ive never heard you admit to making mistakes before as a cop i mean lloyd leaned back the sofa creaked against his weight and combined with janices words to form an accusation i never made them before dont shout i wasnt accusing you of anything what did the man do the creaking grew for a split second lloyd thought he could feel the floor start to tremble the man he beat a woman to death during a snuff film roger ever take out any scumbags like that janice started to flush at the cheeks lloyd grabbed the arms of the sofa to keep from going to her roger doesnt take out scumbags she said he doesnt break into my apartment or carry a gun or beat up on people lloyd im a middleaged woman i was in love with your intensity for a long long time but i cant handle it anymore maybe it isnt a nice thing to say but roger is a comfortable nofireworks lover for a middleaged antique broker who put in nineteen years as wife to a hotdog cop lloyd do you know what im saying the perfect softness of the indictment rang in lloyds ears ive made amends as best i could he said consciously holding his voice at a whisper ive tried to admit the things i did wrong with you and the girls janices whisper was softer and your admissions were excessive and hurt me you told me things that you shouldnt ever ever tell any woman that you claim to love i do love you goddammit i know and i love you and even if i stay with roger and divorce you and marry him ill always love you and roger will never own me the way you have but im too tired for the kind of love you have to give lloyd stood up and walked to the door averting his eyes from janice and groping for threads of hope the girls would you consider how they feel about me if they were younger yes but now theyre practically grown up and i cant let them influence me lloyd turned around and looked at his wife youre not yielding on this an inch are you i yielded too long and too much and you still dont know what you want janice stared at the light blue persian carpet she had coveted since the day of her wedding yesi still dont know then i guess ill just have to outyield you lloyd said she was gone and shed taken everything that could be converted into quick cash with her duane rice walked through the condo hed shared with vandy keeping a running tab on the missing items and the risks hed taken to earn them tv console stateoftheart stereo system and four rooms worth of expensive hightech furnituregone four walkin closets full of clothes three for her one for himgone paintings that vandy insisted gave the pad classgone the down payment and maintenance costs on a flop that he now couldnt live inadios motherfucker add on the empty carport in back of the building and total it up two hundred class a felonies committed in the jurisdictions of the most triggerhappy police departments in the country sold down the river by a worthless when he couldnt finish the thought rice knew that the game wasnt over he pissed on the living room carpet and kicked the front door off its hinges then he went looking for felony number and the means to get back his woman the pico bus dropped him on lincoln avenue a stones throw from venice ghosttown and the likelihood of a shitload of customized taco wagons without alarm systems on lincoln and ocean park he spotted a hardware store and went in and boosted a large chisel rattail file and pair of pliers exiting the store he smiled and looked at his watch two hours and ten minutes out of the rock and back on the roll rice waited for dusk at a burrito stand on the edge of ghosttown drinking coffee and eyeballing the east venice spectacle of overage hippies overage hookers overage lowriders and underage cops trying to look cool he watched horny businessmen in company cars prowl for poontang tried to guess which hooker theyd hit on and wondered why he had to love a woman before he could fuck her he watched an aged love child with an amplifier strapped to his back strum a guitar for chump change and suck on a short dog of tbird the scene filled him with disgust and when twilight hit he felt his disgust turn to highoctane fuel and walked into ghosttown stucco walkback apartment buildings white woodframe houses spraypainted with gang graffiti vacant lots covered with garbage emaciated dogs looking for someone to bite the cars either abandoned jig rigs or welfare wagons in mint condition but nothing exceptional rice walked west toward the beach grateful that the cold weather had the locals indoors seeing nothing that louie calderon would pay more than five bills for out of friendship he kept walking and was almost out of ghosttown when automotive perfection hit him right between the eyes it was a chevy convertible candyapple sapphire blue with a canary yellow top smoked windshield and full continental kit if the interior was cherry and the engine was in good shape he was home rice walked up to the driversside door and pretended to admire the car while he got out his chisel and pliers he counted slowly to ten and when he could feel no suspicion coming down on him jammed the chisel into the space between the doorlock and chassis and yanked outward the door snapped open no alarm went off rice saw that the dash was a restored original and felt underneath it for the ignition wires pay dirt he took his pliers and twisted the two wires together the engine came to life and he drove the car away two hours later with the chevy safely stashed rice walked in the door of louie calderons auto body shop and tapped louie on the shoulder louie looked up from the tool kit he was digging through and said duane the brain whend you get out rice ignored the oilcovered hand he offered and placed an arm over louies shoulders today he looked around and saw two mechanics staring at them lets go up to your office business business they walked through the shop and up to the office that adjoined the second story of louies house when they were seated across the papercluttered desk from each other rice said now resting in your hot roller garage out by suicide hill is a mint chevy ragtop continental kit supercharged full leather tuck and roll handrubbed sapphire blue metal flake paint job intact id say its worth twelve k parts close to ten the upholstery is worth at least two louie opened the refrigerator next to his desk and pulled out a can of coors he popped the top and said youre crazy with your record you have got to be the primo auto theft suspect in la county you bought your way out of what a hundred counts that kind of shit only happens once next time they fuck you for the ones they got you on and the ones you got away with howd you get in my garage rice cracked his knuckles i

quick stake nice sled huh primo if you werent a mexican id call it a bonaroo taco wagon louie laughed all chicanos with ambition are honorary anglos how much you want two grand and a couple of favors

them to rice deal the car is ugly but it runs remember this number got it rice said got it and stuck the money in his pocket i also heard you were dealing guns louies eyes became cold brown slits you

saw louies face cloud over he shook his head to blot out the sound of vandys but duane wouldnt want me to then said what is it dont hold back on me louie drained his beer in one gulp i was going to tell you i was just waiting for the right time a friend of mine saw vandy sometime last week she was walking out of this outcall service place on the strip you know by the allamerican burger he said at first he didnt recognize her with all this makeup on but then he was sure im sorry man rice stood up louie saw the look in his eyes and said maybe it dont mean that it means i have to find her rice said go get me my car duane rice drove his new pontiac to the east end of the sunset strip hugging the righthand lane in order to check out the hookers clustered by bus benches searching for vandys aristocratic features wasted by makeup and dope every face he saw burned itself into his brain where it was superimposed against a reflex image of gordon meyers and preppy anne atwater vanderlinden but none of the faces was her and when he saw three solid blocks of massage parlors fuck pads and outcall services looming in front of him he gnawed his lips until he tasted blood rice parked in the allamerican burger lot and walked slowly west on the south side of sunset all the streetwalkers now were black so he kept his eyes glued to the shabby storefronts and their flashing neon signs he passed wet teenagers outcall and soul sisters mud wrestling new yokohama oriental massage and the h clubhot handsome horny and hung after a block the obscenities blurred together so that he couldnt read individual names and he stared at front doors waiting for her to come out when he saw that guiltylooking men were the only ones entering and leaving he started to see red and walked to a curbside bus bench and braced his hands against it in an isometric press with his eyes closed he forced himself to think finally he remembered the snapshot of vandy hed carried through jail he reached for his wallet and pulled it from its plastic holder then turned around and again confronted the flashing beacons nuclear nookie outcall wet and woolly massage satans house of sin this time the words didnt blur he pulled out a handful of louie calderons twenties and walked through the nearest door a bored black man behind a desk looked up as he entered and said yeah rice held the photo of vandy and a double saw under the mans nose have you seen this woman the man put down his copy of the watchtower grabbed the twenty and looked at the snapshot no too goodlookin for this jive place if you want to pork this kinda chick i can fix you up with a cutrate version who gives mean head rice breathed out slowly the red trapdoor behind his eyes eased shut no thanks i want her got any ideas the man stuck the twenty in his shirt pocket i dont know what places got what quality pussy but i know this jive place aint got nothin but woofwoofs you just keep walkin and whippin out that green maybe you find her rice took the mans advice and walked east he showed the snapshot to every doorman and bouncer at every sex joint on the row handing out over three hundred dollars getting nothing but negative head shakes and a consensus that vandy was too foxy to be doing either strip outcall or street hooking after four straight hours of breathing nothing but sleaze he got coffee at the allamerican burger and sat down at an outside table to think he came up with facts that he trusted louie and his friends were solid if one of them saw vandy out here in whore makeup it was probably true without him to look after her she was a stone selfdestructor none of the assage and outcall slimebags hed talked to had idd herand it was to their financial advantage to do so louies friend had seen her sometime last week probably right after she visited him and cleaned out the pad it all felt right rice looked at his watch the whores thinning out as the traffic on sunset dwindled the only hookers still working were black and unlikely to have info on vandyshe avoided all jigs like the plague draining his coffee he stood up and started for the car then he saw an incredible redhead walk over to the curb and stick out her thumb rice moved fast running to his car and pulling up in front of the girl cutting off a slowtrawling mercedes the redhead looked in the passenger window distastefully then back at the status car rice yelled a cnote for ten minutes and the girl hesitated then opened the door and got in rice handed her a wad of twenties as the driver of the mercedes accelerated and flipped them the bird the redhead stuffed the money into her purse and poked a finger at the tufts of foam sticking out of the seat this car sucks can we go to a motel or something rice turned around the corner then pulled over to the curb and flicked on the dashboard light i dont want to get laid i just had a feeling you could help me find this woman he handed her the photo of vandy and watched as she examined it then shook her head no never your chick thats right she a working girl rice swallowed a wave of anger yeah ive heard shes been doing outcall around here but nobody recognizes her and i believe them the redhead scrutinized the snapshot then said shes real cute too classy for most of the places around here what do you mean most well theres this highline place a couple of blocks from here off the strip they run only really foxy chicks to these movies and rock big shots i worked out of there for a week or so then i quit too much of a drug scene im into health food rice felt his skin prickle whats the name of the place silver foxes no outcall just silver foxes whats the address gardner just off the strip lavender building you cant miss it but they only send chicks out on referrals you know its real exclusive phone number the girl hesitated rice dug in his pocket for more money then handed it to her tell me goddammit she grabbed the door handle you wont tell where you got it no the girl darted out of the car rice watched her counting her money as she walked back to the strip it took him less than ten minutes to find the lavender apartment building it stood just south of sunset in the glow of a streetlamp a plain spanishstyle fourflat with no lights burning rice parked and walked across the lawn to the cement porch four doors were recessed in the entranceway illuminated only by mailbox lights he squinted and saw that three of the apartments belonged to individuals while the last box was embossed with a raised metal insignia of a fox in a mink coat winking seductively there was a buzzer beneath the words silver foxes rice pressed it three times and heard its echo no lights went on and no sounds of movement answered the buzzing he reached into the mailbox and found it empty then stood back on the lawn so he could eyeball the whole building still nothing but darkness and silence rice drove to a pay hone and dialed a recorded womans voice answered hi this is silver foxes foxes of every persuasion for every occasion if youre already registered with us leave your code number and let us know what you want well get back to you soon if youre a new friend let us know who you know and give us their code numbers and your phone number well get in touch soon there was an interval of soft disco music then a beep rice slammed down the receiver and drove back to outcall row only the dregs of the hookers were still out garishly madeup junkies who stepped into the street and lifted their skirts as cars passed by rice sat at a table inside the allamerican burger and drank coffee while he scanned women on both sides of sunset every face he glimpsed looked ravaged every body bloated or emaciated toward dawn the neon lights on the outcall offices and massage parlors started going off when streetsweeping machines pushed the few remaining hookers back onto the sidewalk he took it as his cue to leave and check out business rice drove across laurel canyon coming down into the valley just as full daylight hit when he reached ventura boulevard he recalled verbatim the facts hed heard through the ventilator shaft kling and valley view pink apartment house christine something studio city house on the corner of hildebrand and gage truth halftruth or bullshit at hildebrand and gage he got his first validation the mailbox of the northeast corner house was tagged with the name christine confrey that fact gave him a feeling of destiny that built up harder and harder as he drove west to encino when he got to kling and valley view and saw a faded pink apartment house on the corner with an outofplace cadillac parked in front the feeling exploded rice kept it at a low roar by calculating odds five to one that the info was correct making the heists possible checking the mailboxes of the sixunit building he saw that only one single woman lived theresally issler in he found a door designated on the groundfloor street side with a high hedge fronting the apartments large picture window rice squatted behind the hedge waiting for the owner of the caddy to cut the odds down to zero he waited an hour and a half before a door opened and two voices one male one female gave him pay dirt my wife gets back tomorrow no overnighters for a while matinees you know like the songafternoon delight the man laughed we can hit hot tub fever during your lunch hour sounds good but i read in cosmo that those hot tub places all have herpes germs in the water dont believe everything you read call me at the bank yeah rice heard sounds of kissing followed by a door slamming he counted to ten then stood up and peered around the hedge the cadillac was just taking off he ran for his car and pursued it it led him to a bank of america branch on woodman and ventura rice sized up the man who got out tall broadhipped sunkenchested a wimp whose sex appeal was his money the man walked up to the front doors rice followed from a safe distance passing him as he stepped inside when the manager locked the doors behind him rice counted to ten then peered through the plateglass window and smiled the manager was alone inside the bank and the surveillance cameras were fixedfocused at the floor the tellers stations were visible from the street only if a passerby was willing to stand on his tiptoes and crane his neck rice watched the manager walk directly to the teller area and take a key from his pocket then open drawers and transfer cash to his briefcase leaving pieces of paper in the moneys placeprobably doctored tally slips the odds zoomed to perfection rice ran to his car then drove to a pay phone and called louie calderon at his message drop number speak louie its duane already dont tell me the car broke down and youre pissed nothing like that another favor yeah i want threes and one of those dart guns youve got darts too yeah before we go any further i dont wanna know what you got in mind you got that right silencers i

and im tellin you i dont want to know nothin about your plans comprende comprende good ill call bobby and set it up when you meet him tell him how you saw him knock little red lopez through the ropes with a right cross hell eat it up the phone went dead rice walked back to his car when he stuck the key in the ignition he was trembling it felt good even as the dream unfolded he knew that it was just a dream one of the stock nightmares that owned him and if he didnt panic it would run its course and he would wake up safe sometime back in or when he was working hollywood patrol he and his partner flanders got an unknown trouble call directing their unit to an old house in a culdesac off the cahuenga pass a block of ramshackle pads rented out dirt cheap because noise from the freeway overpass made living there intolerable when no one answered their knocks and shouted police officers open up he and flanders kicked in the door only to be driven back outside by the stench of stale cordite and decomposing flesh while flanders radioed for backup units he drew his service revolver and prowled the pad discovering the five headless bodies brainspattered walls expended shotgun rounds and the note taped to the tv set i keep hearing these voices thru the freeway noise telling peg and the kids about me and billy its a lie but they wont believe it was just one time when we was drunk and that dont count this way nobodys going to know except billy and he dont care the man who wrote the note was slumped by the tv set he had jammed the sawedoff gauge into his crotch and blown himself in two the shotgun lay beside him in a pile of congealed viscera then the dream speeded up and he wasnt sure if it was happening or not flanders came back inside and yelled backup detectives and me on their way hoppy he saw him reach for a cigarette to kill the awful stink and was about to scream about gas escaping from stiffs but knew flanders would call it college boy bullshit he ran toward him anyway just as the match was struck and the little boys stomach exploded and flanders ran out the door with his face on fire then he was screaming and ambulances were screaming and he knew it wasnt a dream it was the telephone lloyd rolled over and reached for it surprised to find that he had fallen asleep fully clothed yes who is it a familiar voice came on the line dutch lloyd you all right you woke me up sorry kid dont be you did me a favor what do you mean never mind what is it dutch when there was a long silence on the la end of the line lloyd tensed and shook off the last remnants of sleep he heard the bustle of hollywood station going on in the background and pictured his best friend getting up the guts to tell him something very bad goddammit dutch tell me dutch peltz said so far its just a rumor but its an informed rumor and i credit it that shrink you saw last month recommended you be given early retirement you know emotional disability incurred in the line of service full pension that kind of thing ive heard that braverton and mcmanus are behind it and that if you dont accept the plan youll be given a trial board for dereliction of duty lloyd they mean it if the trial board finds you guilty youll be kicked off the department a kaleidoscope of memories flashed in front of lloyds eyes and for long moments he didnt know if he was back in a dream or not no dutch they wouldnt do that to me lloyd its true ive also heard that fred gaffaney has got a file on you nasty stuff some sex shit you pulled when you worked venice vice that was fifteen fucking years ago and i wasnt the only one dutch said sssh sssh im just telling you i dont know if gaffaney is in with braverton and mcmanus on this but i know its all coming down bad for you retire lloyd with your masters you can teach anywhere you can do consulting work you can lloyd screamed no and picked up the phone then saw the framed photograph of his family on the nightstand and put it back down no no no if they want me out theyll have to fight me for it think of janice and the girls lloyd think of the time youd have to spend with them youre talking shit dutch without the job theres nothing even janice knows that so fuck em all except six and save them for the pallbearers see you in la captain peltz dutchs voice was soft and hoarse until then sergeant hopkins lloyd hung up and walked into the bathroom cursing when he saw the daintily wrapped soap bars and his disposable razor crusted with shaving cream muttering fuck it he soaked a washcloth in cold sink water and wiped his face then straightened his necktie wondering why he always wore one even when he didnt have to when he looked in the mirror the answer came to him and he prepared to do battle with the institution that had given him all of his nightmares and most of his dreams at a stand of pay phones in the lobby lloyd found a copy of the san francisco yellow pages and leafed through the as until he hit attorneys dismissing the shysters who had fullpage ads mentioning their low rates and drunkdriving experience he got out a pencil and notepad and started jotting down names and addresses at random filling up half a page before he noticed brewer cafferty and brown at an address on montgomery that was probably only a half dozen blocks from where he was standing again muttering fuck it he smoothed his necktie and walked there jamming his hands into his pockets to keep from running the waiting room of brewer cafferty and brown was furnished in the oldline california style of leather armchairs and brass floor lamps the photographs on the walls blew the sense of tradition apart lloyd walked in and knew immediately that chance had directed him to either the best or the worst law firm ever to be considered by a defendant in an interdepartmental police trial bobby seale huey p newton and eldridge cleaver glared down at him giving the clenchedfist salute a group photo of the united bay area gay collective beamed down hanging over the reception desk was a purple wall tapestry with power to the people embroidered in the center and beside it there was a photographic blowup of dozens of oriental men in karate stances lloyd examined the picture figuring it for an outtake from a martial arts movie he was wrong it was the boat peoples political action army sitting down to wait for someone to welcome him he felt like he had been given the dts without benefit of booze after a few minutes a tall black woman in a tweed suit walked in and said yes may i help you lloyd stood up noticing the woman catch sight of the strapped to his belt i came to see an attorney he said your office was close to my hotel so i came here then you dont have an appointment the woman was staring openly at his gun lloyd took out his id holder and badge and showed it to her im a los angeles police officer he said im looking for an attorney to represent me at a police trial board an outoftown lawyer is probably a good idea ive got forty thousand dollars in the bank and ill spend every dime to keep my job the woman smiled and walked back out of the room lloyd held eye contact with huey newton until she returned and said this way please mr hopkins and led him to an inner office a pale man was sitting behind a desk reading a newspaper mr brewer mr hopkins the woman said then exited and closed the door behind her brewer looked up from his paper lapd huh well we know they didnt bring you up on charges of excessive force because they dont recognize that concept he stood up and extended his hand lloyd shook it measuring the mans words deciding his abrasiveness was a test i like your office he said as he took a chair next to the desk out of the lowrent district you do a lot of oilleasing contracts on the side take down the pictures of the niggers when the fat cats come to call brewer filled a pipe with tobacco and tamped it down so much for light conversation i dont have to agree with a clients ideology in order to represent him why are you getting a trial board lloyd forced himself to talk slowly the overall charge will probably be dereliction of duty im currently on a sixweek suspension with pay the specific charge or charges will have to do with a recent perjury i committed at a murder trial arraignment i brewer jabbed the air with his pipe stem why did you commit perjury is this a common practice of yours i lied to protect a woman innocently involved in the case lloyd said softy and ive lied previously only to circumvent probablecause statutes in regard to hard felonies i see by any chance were you intimately involved with this woman lloyd grasped the arms of his chair thats none of your business counselor next question very well lets backtrack tell me about your career with the lapd lloyd said nineteen years on the job fourteen as a detectivesergeant eleven in robberyhomicide division ive got a masters in criminology from stanford im considered the best homicide detective in the department ive earned more commendations than i can count ive successfully investigated a number of highly publicized murder cases my arrest record is legendary brewer lit his pipe then blew smoke at the ceiling impressive but whats more impressive is that someone with such an outstanding record should have incurred such departmental disfavor i should think that one perjury slipup wouldnt have been sufficient to jeopardize your career i know the lapd looks after their own theres other stuff minor fuckups over the years the high brass sent me to a shrink i shot my mouth off about things i shouldnt have why because i wanted to get rid of it because i never thought theyd try to do this to me please calm down sergeant there are ways to get around one psychiatrists report usually by mitigating it with the report of a different analyst one with a superior reputation lloyd gripped the sides of the desk until he felt his hands go numb counselor this isnt a trial in a court of law this is a kangaroo cop trial and academic credentials dont mean shit saving my job is a long shot from the gate and making a department employee look bad would only make the odds worse brewer slid back in his chair and stared past lloyd at the far wall well there are other approaches you have a family wife and three daughters im separated from them but you remain cordial yes lloyd stared at the attorney who kept his eyes fixed on a point just above his head and said then we can exploit them as character witnesses gain sympathy for you that way you yourself present an interesting picture one that can be used to advantage are you aware that your clothes dont fit theyre at least two sizes too large we can portray you in court as a victim of your own conscientiousness a man driven to radical weight loss by overzealous dedication to duty if you were to lose even more weight that sympathy factor would be increased with proper coaching your daughters would elicit the mo look at me lloyd hissed holding down a picture of his hands around brewers throat squeezing until the lawyers averted eyes popped out of his skull look at me you cocksucker brewer closed his eyes control your language sergeant i want you to get used to wearing a penitent expression one that wi lloyd stepped around the desk grabbed brewer by the arms and shoved him into a glass bookcase the glass shattered law texts spilled to the floor lloyd took hold of brewers neck with his left hand and balled his right hand into a fist and aimed it at the lawyers squeezedshut eyes then he heard a scream and his peripheral vision caught the receptionist with her hands clasped over her mouth he pulled the punch at the last second sending his fist through an unbroken pane of glass shoving brewer aside lloyd held his bloody hand in front of him i im sorry goddamn you im sorry duane rice looked at bobby boogaloo garcia and knew two things that exwelterweight or not he could take him out easy and that the little taco bender was incorrigibly mean after a jailhouse handshake rice looked around his living room saw quality stuff and pegged him as a nondoper who gangsterized because he was too lazy to work and in love with the game thinking so far so good he threw out a line to test his smarts i think i saw you fight once you knocked little red lopez through the ropes at the olympic about ten twelve years ago bobby grinned and pointed to the couch rice sat down seeing smarts up the wazoo and a big determination to milk the game likable louie must have told you that bobby said told you id dig it louies gotta be the dumbest smart guy i know because only about six people in the world know about that and im the only one cares just like youre the only one gives a rats ass about how you ragged that judge fucking louie howd he manage to stay alive so long he can do things we cant do rice said reaching into the back of his waistband and pulling out a silencerfitted automatic like this he worked the slide and ejected the clip catching the chambered round as it popped into the air dum dum likeable louie has stayed alive for so long because guys who can get nice things are likable right bobby laughing bobby held out his hands rice tossed the up to him and he grabbed it and did a series of quick draws aimed at the roberto duran poster above the fireplace pow roberto pow pow no mas no mas grinning from ear to ear he handed the gun back butt first and slumped into a chair across from rice louie aint likable duane hes lovable hes so lovable that id suck his daddys dick just to see where he came from how many of those you got three rice said one for you one for me one for your brother is he coming any minute wanta trade pedigrees sure the vehicular manslaughter conviction you already heard about three years at soledad because i lost my temper and reverted to my white trash origins a bust on one count of gta a bullet in the county reduced to six months ya parole and county probation both of which im hanging up because car thiefmechanic is what my po calls a modus operandioccupational stress combination in other words he expects me to sling burgers at mcdonalds for the minimum wage no way bobby nodded along then flashed a grin and said how many cars you boost before you got busted around three hundred you and your brother did b ampes right right at least four five hundred jobs with one bust and that was a fluke what did you do with the money louie pays a good percentage and he said you guys arent into dope bobby cracked the knuckles of his right hand i own this house man joe and i used to own a coin laundromat and a hotdog stand and i bankrolled a couple of fighters after i quit myself what about you three hundred gtas and you drive up in an old nigger wagon looks like something the cat dragged in whatd you do with your money i spent it rice said boring his eyes into bobbys testing for real now wondering if retreating was the smart thing to do the twoway stare held until bobbys eyelids started to twitch and he smiledwinced and said shit man i like women as much as the next man stalemate bobby had backed off but returned with a good shot right on target rice tasted blood in his mouth and felt his teeth involuntarily biting his cheeks the bloody spittle lubed his voice so his next shot sounded strong to his own ears you think you can be cool with that gun you think you can hold on to it and not shoot it three seconds into a new eyeball duel the front door opened and joe garcia walked in carrying a bag of groceries rice broke the stare and stood up and stuck out his hand joe shifted the bag and grabbed the hand limply then said sorry im late and reached into the bag and pulled out a can of beer he tossed it at bobby who shook it up then popped the top and let the foam shoot out and spray his face chugalugging half the can he cocked a thumb and forefinger at the roberto duran poster and giggled pow pow no mas no mas rice watched joe garcia watch his older brother he seemed wary and disgusted a smart reaction for a tagalong criminal bobby killed his beer and plugged roberto duran a half dozen more times rice knew the charade was a machismo stunt to hide his fear to hide his own contempt and relief he watched joe walk into the kitchen then joined bobby in laughing when joe returned looking outright scared and bobby gazed over at him and wiped his lips rice said lets talk business gentlemen it took him half an hour to outline the plan exactly the way hed heard it through the ventilator shaft stressing that no one knew hed heard it and that hed cased the locations to a t getting the facts validated straight down the line he would be the inside man who actually hit the banks they would be the outside men who held the two girlfriends captive at their pads and received the phone calls from the rogue bank manager gauging their reactions rice saw that bobby wanted it for the money and the pure unadulterated thrillevery time he mentioned the kidnap angle the exwelter popped his knuckles and licked his lips he saw that joe was afraid of the whole thing but more afraid of putting the kibosh on his brothers glee for a twotimeonly deal they were solid partners finishing his pitch rice said a few other things park your car on the nearest big street to the chicks pads thats ventura for the issler woman lankershim for confrey wear gloves but dont put on your ski masks until right before you go in the door carry briefcases and dress well so youll blend in with the neighborhood we meet at my place room at the bowl motel on highland up from the boulevard one hour after i call you at the girlfriends pads tie the chicks up and tape their mouths but make sure they can breathe questions bobby garcia said yeah you said you been casing both gigs for three days what do you mean by that weve got two onthesly romances going down rice said hawley from the b of a and his bitch issler eggers from securitypacific and his babe confrey both men open their banks early by themselves and pilfer from the tellers boxes probably small amounts okay three days now ive seen them tap the tills before opening ive watched the guards and tellers arrive parked across the street with binoculars at both banks the money at the tellers stations is left there overnight joe garcia raised his hand why are these banks so lax about their security good question rice said i thought about that then i did some more checking first off hawley is a fuckup too wimpy to run a tight ship hes got nothing but partyhearty types working there you know everybody smokes dope on their lunch hour young squares with no ambition so theyve got to get wasted to make it through the day also the securitypacific is only half a block from an lapd substationmaybe eggers thinks hes robberyproof who knows and who cares bobby held up his hands then brought them together and began slowly cracking the knuckles on each finger finishing he said lets cut the shit and get to the cut its a righteous fucking plan but how much are we gonna make rice said im guessing at least thirty k per bank minimum sixtyforty splitsixty for me forty for you guys to split bobby snorted joe said that sounds fair to me you did all the wo shut up pendejo bobby yelled lowering his voice he said to rice i like you duane but youre giving me the big one where it hurts the most fiftyfifty or you go take a flying fuck at a rolling donut rice faked a sheepish look his split strategy had worked to perfection deal he said sticking out his right hand for the brothers to grasp wincing when bobby slammed it with both callused palms grinning when joes tagalong hands followed day after tomorrow for hawley and issler ill meet you here tomorrow night at nine for a final briefing if you need me for anything call me at louies bootleg number the three men stood up and shook hands all around rice turned to walk out and bobby tapped him on the shoulder aint you forgetting something duane rice smiled and did a twogun pirouette drawing one from his back waistband and another from his shoulder holster flipping them up by the silencered barrels and catching them by the grips be cool he said as he handed the guns to bobby bobby boogaloo garcia grinned and emptied boths at his back living room wall blowing roberto duran to shreds and the wall itself into a rubble heap of rotted wood dust and plaster chips joe squinted through the gun smoke and saw that the shots had ripped apart the connecting door to his bedroom screaming you rapeo motherfucker you wasted my albums he ran back to inspect the damage bobby bowed to rice and said never liked roberto since hearns kicked his ass silencers work good duane deputy chief thad braverton slammed down the phone and muttered fuck then buzzed his secretary when she appeared in the doorway he said ring captain mcmanus at robberyhomicide and have him come up immediately then call captain gaffaney at internal affairs and have him come up in fifteen minutes no sooner the woman nodded and aboutfaced into her vestibule braverton sent exasperated eyes heavenward and said crazy lloyd jesus fucking christ mcmanus rapped on the doorjamb only moments later braverton took his eyes from the ceiling and said sit down john close the door behind you fred gaffaney is joining us shortly and i dont want him to hear any of this mcmanus nodded and eased the door shut then sat down waiting for the superior officer to speak first close to a minute passed before braverton said hopkins isnt accepting the retirement deal mcmanus shrugged i didnt think he would sir i also didnt know that youd spoken to him i havent braverton said someone leaked the word to him in frisco hopkins went out looking for an attorney to represent him at his trial board and blundered into the office of the most prestigious leftwing firm in the city he ended up shoving around the head shyster and punching out a bookcase mcmanus breathed out slowly jesus fucking christ my initial reaction too charges filed braverton shook his head sfpd talked the shyster out of it applied pressure somehow i just spoke to the station commander who caught the squeal he said when the beef came in hopkins got a standing ovation from the detective squad mcmanus felt chills dance up his spine typical have you decided what youre going to do no would you like my feedback of course youre his immediate supervisor and as cops go an atypical thinker mcmanus didnt know if the chiefs last remark was a compliment or a jibe braverton was a poker voice all the way trying hard to keep his own voice level he said sir ive been hopkinss supervisor since gaffaney made captain and went to iad and ive handled him the way fred and his previous bosses did let him pick his own shots let him head up investigations that should have gone to field lieutenants let him work without a partner the results hes given me have been outstanding his methods of obtaining them either dubious or outright illegal for example he solved havillandgoff brilliantly but in the process shot it out with goff in a crowded nightclub then let him get away then he pulled at least two burglaries to obtain evidence you know how i feel about violation of due process sir hopkins is essentially a criminal what sets him apart from a runofthemill street thug is a oneseventy iq and a badge and hes slipping that foulup at oldfields arraignment is just the beginning hes obsolescent cut him loose braverton remained silent for long moments mcmanus fidgeted then said sir why have you called gaffaney in he was hopkinss previous sup braverton cut him off ill tell you after hes left what you said makes perfect sense john youre probably the worlds only liberal irish cop i th the sound of a buzzer interrupted him braverton said there he is then pressed a button on his phone console there was a tapping on the doorjamb braverton called out enter and captain fred gaffaney walked in and nodded briskly at both men chief captain he said braverton pointed to a chair mcmanus stood up and shook the iad adjutants hand feeling like he had stepped backward in timegaffaneys crew cut and bargainbasement blue suit always reminded him of his rookie days when departmental regulations demanded such a visage his bonecrusher handshake was another anachronism and mcmanus sat down wondering what kind of game braverton was playing gaffaney settled into his chair and fingered his cross and flag lapel pin braverton looked straight at him and said lloyd hopkins is about to be brought up on a trial board dereliction of duty maybe a criminal prosecution for perjury if he doesnt accept the retirement deal the department is going to offer him were looking for backup dirt what have you got on him internal affairs has a substantial file on hopkins captain fred gaffaney said notations covering his numerous insubordinations and illegal search and seizures what are you using for ammo at the trial board braverton smiled the court transcript of his perjury a psychiatrists report that states essentially that hes a burnout if need be we may utilize his iad file your personal testimony might help gaffaneys left hand jerked up to his lapel pin mcmanus watched the witchhunters eyes narrow as he said you mean as to the information in the file thats right of course ill testify chief braverton sighed thanks fred i knew i could count on you gaffaney got to his feet then said if theres nothing else i have an interview in ten minutes braverton nodded dismissal and mcmanus watched the crewcut anachronism exit the office looking strange the chiefs silent deadpan stare compounded the feeling of strangeness knowing he was being tested mcmanus dropped his usual sir and said what was that all about braverton responded with an openarmed gesture that took in his whole office you may well be sitting in this chair one day if you make it youll be dealing more with ambitious brass like gaffaney than with street dicks like crazy lloyd mcmanuss whole being tingled the testing was moving toward a veiled offer of patronage and sir and i have a nominal regard for due process myself gaffaney is on the promotion list hell be a commander very shortly and hell probably take over iad when stillwell retires as far as that goes he deserves the job hes a good exec but hes a bornagain christian loony so far right that he scares me hes been playing savior to some very well placed junior officersfield sergeants in

department steve gaffaney a rookie working west la patrol the kid has been pilfering from the station clerical supplies ammo that kind of thing for months finally the daywatch boss got pissed and called intelligence division because if he initiated an investigation through iad gaffaney senior would pick up on it intelligence checked the kid out and discovered that he had been suspended from high school for pilfering from lockers and that captain fred had bribed the principal of the school to erase all notations pertaining to disciplinary problems on the kids record and to improve his grades junior wouldnt have been admitted to the academy with his real transcript mcmanus whispered and sir and intelligence did some more checking on jesus freak fred and got wind of his little crossandflag coterie which of course is perfectly kosher within departmental regulations whats the upshot for now im going to sit on it if the kid fucks up big or captain fred gets obstreperous ill lower the boom mcmanus smiled as the chief of detectives machinations moved into outandout barter sir you still havent told me where hopkins fits in and you want something smiling back braverton said

loose blackmail jesus fred into retiring by threatening to expose the kid fire the kid and stonewall the whole fucking mess braverton gave his new protege a round of applause bravo except your love of due process and lack of paranoia is appalling first we have to neutralize gaffaneys files which may take a while then first things first today is december sixth on january first you will leave robberyhomicide and take over the violent crime task force in south central la i want a broadminded man down there someone who can deal rationally with blacks mcmanuss throat went dry his first reaction was to offer effusive thanks then respect for the barter game took over whats it going to cost me bravertons eyes clouded i want to ease hopkins out he said hopefully without a trial board i want you to call him back from san francisco and give him some sort of assignment that does not involve homicide and will not insult his intelligence i want him around parker center where i can talk to him hes got to be cut loose but i want it done gently mcmanus winced at the price of his highvisibility promotion you could have made it an order not my style braverton said liberals should be adept at trading up seeing as how theyre handicapped from the gate the epiphany clicked into mcmanuss head and made him forget caution you love him yes and i owe him and you owe him he got the slaughterer and havilland and goff within fifteen months do you know the story on the slaughterer no then you dont want to know will you do this for me mcmanus felt old notions of duty crumble in the pit of his stomach yes good do you have an appropriate assignment for him not right now but something should come up soon it always does duane rice stood in a phone booth adjoining a store in encino he was wearing a threepiece suit bought for ten dollars at a hollywood thrift shop and a curlyhaired wig and beardmustache combo purchased at western costume his shoulder holster held a silencerattached his rear waistband a tranquilizer dart gun loaded with pcp darts his hands were covered with surgical rubber gloves he was ready at exactly the phone rang rice picked up the receiver and said yes the gloating voice was unmistakably bobby garcias got her broke in the side door nobody saw us nobodys gonna see us shes scared shitless but the kid is playing mr nice guy and sweettalking her have lover boy call rice said right then hung up and dialed the home number of robert hawley the phone rang twice then a female voice yawned hello robert hawley please rice said briskly the woman said one minute then called out bob telephone there was the sound of an extension being picked up then a male voice calling ive got it doris go back to sleep when he heard the original line go dead rice said mr hawley yes who is it its a friend of sally issler what the he listen to me and be real real cool and we wont kill her are you listening yes oh god what do rice cut in what do you think we want motherfucker the same thing you rip off from your own fucking employer when he heard hawley start to blubber he lowered his voice you want to be cool or you want sallypoo to die bbe cool hawley gasped then heres the pitch one ive got photographs of you pilfering the b of a tellers boxes with the clock in the background showing that youre on the job when youre not supposed to be and some juicy infrared shots of you and sally fucking if you dont do what i want my buddies chop sally to pieces and the pictures go to your wife the lapd the bank and hustler magazine dig me dick breath the gasp was now a whimper yes yes yes good now i want you to call sally and have her introduce you to my colleagues ill call you back in exactly three minutes theres a tap on your phone so if you call the cops another colleague will know and call sallys roommates and tell them to do some chopping do you understand yyes rice said three minutes or chop chop then hung up he watched the second hand on his timex pleased that his spontaneous bullshit about the photographs and phone tap had been so easy when the hand made three sweeps he again dialed hawleys number yes a groveling whimper you ready yes good i want you to get in your car and take your usual route to the bank ive been tailing you for days so i know the route park on the west side of woodman a half block north of ventura ill meet you there youre being tailed so dont fuck up ill see you there in twelve minutes hawleys reply was a barely audible squeak rice hung up and walked very slowly to his pontiac forcing himself to count to fifty before he hit the ignition and eased the car into traffic when he was six blocks from hawleys house he resumed counting figuring that the bank manager would pass him in the opposite direction before he hit twentyfive he was right at twentytwo hawleys tan cadillac approached at way over the speed limit swerving so close to the double line that he pulled to the right to avoid a headon there were no cop cars anywhere nothing suspicious just business going down rice cut over to side streets paralleling ventura pushing the car at fortyfive so that he wouldnt get stuck waiting for hawley to arrive at woodman he turned right and parked immediately a solid hundred and fifty yards from the spot where the bank man was to meet him just as he set the brake and grabbed a briefcase from the back seat hawleys caddy hung an erratic turn off ventura and slowed rice checked his fake mustache in the rearview mirror mr solid citizen out for a stroll the bank man was acting like mr solid citizen on a trip to panic city rice walked toward the bank parking lot watching hawley scrape bumpers as he parallelparked his caddy plowing into the curb twice before squeezing into an easy space when he finally got out and stood by the car he was shaking from head to toe rice approached swinging the briefcase casually hawley frantically eyeballed the street their eyes locked for an instant then hawley turned around and checked out his blind side rice grinned at his protective image and came up on the bank manager and tapped him on the shoulder bob how nice to see you hawley did a jerky pivot please not now im meeting someone rice clapped hawley on the back and spun him in the direction of the bank keeping an arm around his shoulders as he hissed youre meeting me dick breath were going straight to the tellers boxes then straight back to your car he dug his fingers into the bank mans collarbone and gouged in concert with sound effects chop chop chop hawley winced with each syllable and let himself be propelled toward the bank at the front door hawley inserted keys into the three locks while rice stood aside with one eye cocked in the direction of ventura boulevard no patrol cars no unmarked cruisers nothing remotely off the doors sprung open and they stepped inside the bank man locked a central mechanism attached to the floor runner and looked up at the robber ffast please rice pointed toward the teller area then stepped back and let hawley lead the way when the managers back was turned he opened his briefcase and took out a pint bottle of bourbon and stuck it into his right front pants pocket hawley stepped over a low wooden partition and began unlocking and sliding open drawers rice glanced down and saw rows of folding green then looked closer and saw that it was offgreenfancy travelers checks done up in a wild west motif the cash he hissed wheres the fucking money hawley stammered tttimelocked the vault you said on the phone you wanted ignoring him rice opened the rest of the drawers himself finding nothing but fat stacks of b of a greenbacks in denominations of twenty fifty and a hundred replaying his casing job in his mind he snapped to what happened hawley was pilfering the travelers checks the paperwork he saw him doing was some sort of asscovering seeing the banker outlined in red he said theres no cash in these drawers nnnno youve been ripping off travelers checks shooting a panicky glance at the window hawley said just for a while ive got bad gambling debts and im just trying to get even please dont kill me rice held the briefcase open thinking of chula medina and twenty cents on the dollar tops when hawley started stuffing the rows of greenbacks inside he said talk dick breath give me a good line on your scam and maybe ill let you slide hawley fumbled the packets into the briefcase his eyes averted from rice his voice near cracking as he spoke the greenbacks are tallied by the week ive got duplicate bankbooks for two old lady customerstheyre senileand i transfer cash from their accounts to the bank and take it out in greenbacks i cant do it for much longer its wrong and the paperwork juggling has got to come back on me he opened the last drawer and transferred its contents to the briefcase then held up supplicating hands and whispered please fast rice took in the bank mans scam feeling it sink in as truth knowing that eggerss pilfer scene was probably something similarhe was a fool to think bank pros would leave cash out overnight noting wraparound tabs on the greenbacks he flashed a psycho killer smirk and held his jacket open to show off his i know about exploding ink packets dick breath you ink me and ill come back and chopchop your whole family hawley shook his head and mashed his hands together we do ink only on cash only on payroll days please he looked up doglike for instructions rice closed the briefcase and said back to your car stay calm think about your golf game and youll be cool hawley moved toward the front doors in spastic steps rice was right behind when they hit the street and the manager locked the door behind them he threw his left arm over his shoulders and shifted the tranq gun from his waistband to his right jacket pocket they approached the cadillac from the street rice pointed to the driversside door and hawley got in behind the wheel terror hit his face as he saw rice reach into his waistband and he squeezed his eyes shut and began murmuring the lords prayer rice shot him twice pointblank once in the neck once in the chest just below his left collar point hawley jerked backward in his seat then bounced forward into the steering wheel rice watched him slump sideways his eyes fluttering his limbs going rubber within seconds he was sleeping the openmouthed sleep of the junkie rice leaned into the car and poured the pint of whiskey over his chest and pants legs bon voyage he said after driving to a pay phone and giving bobby garcia the allclear and setting up plans for the split rice removed his facial disguise and hit the freeway to redondo beach the briefcase full of bank checks on the seat beside him he did another replay of the eggers case job as he drove remembering that he had only seen him rummage through the tellers boxeshed never seen him with money in hand that heist had to be a cash rip and that meant the garcias couldnt know about the greenback fuckup turning off the freeway onto sepulveda he beat time on the dashboard the melody was a vandyvandals tune the words he murmured were be home and be flush chula chula medina was at home after bolting the door behind him rice unceremoniously opened the briefcase and dumped the contents on the floor then said quarter on the dollar cash and fast chula medina smiled in answer then sat down crosslegged beside the pile of bank checks rice watched him lick his lips as he counted when he finished he said nice but consecutive serial numbers and an offbrand check these are gonna have to be frozen then sent east youve got sixtyfour k here my first last final and only offer is a dime on the dollar here now cash you walk out and we never met deal rice fingered his death before dishonor tattoo and knew it was a fucking he had to take deal put the money in the briefcase chula got up gave a courtly latin bow and went into his bedroom rice had the briefcase held open when he returned chula dumped in a big handful of real us currency bowed again and pointed to the door vaya con dios duane rice took the to the ventura to the hollywood wondering how the garcias would react to the low numbers and if eggers could be intimidated into the vault for the real stuff at cahuenga he exited the freeway and within minutes he was at his new home the bowl motel seventy scoots a week for a room with a sink toilet shower and hot plate too expensive for dope fiends too far up from the boulevard for hookers too jigfree to interest the local fuzz a good interim pad for a rising young criminal he parked in his space grabbed the briefcase and walked to his room threading his way past groups of beerguzzling pensioners inside he tossed the briefcase on the bed and flopped down beside it grabbing the snapshot of vandy off the nightstand coming home babe coming home ten minutes later the doorbell rang rice put the photo in his shirt pocket then walked over and squinted through the peephole seeing joe and bobby garcia standing there looking hungry joe itchy and anxious like he couldnt believe what hed just done but drooling for the payoff bobby in a gangsteredback thumbsinbelt stance drooling for more the butt of his clearly outlined through his windbreaker rice opened the door and pointed the brothers inside then bolted it shut behind them he grabbed the briefcase and dumped the money onto the bed and said count it its a little less than i figured bobby started to giggle while joe made a beeline for the cash and began separating it into piles rice locked eyes with bobby and said tell me about it bobby let his giggle die slowly rice saw that the exwelter was closer to stone loon than he thoughthe couldnt play anything straight went in easy like i told you bobby said wham blam thank you maam kept our masks and gloves on tied her up good taped her mouth shut i think maybe she dug it her nipples were all pointy he went back to giggling then segued into sex noises while he jabbed his right forefinger into a hole formed by his left thumb and pinky when he started making slurping sounds rice said ease off on that will you bobby kiboshed the slurping and started fondling the religious medals that encircled his neck okay duaneo but she was fine as wine ill tell you that it go good for you rice watched joe stack the loot according to denomination realizing that he liked the tagalong as much as he despised his brother joe hummed as he counted a tune that sounded like blueberry hill listening to the humming made it easy to talk to bobby without wanting to vomit yeah it was pie day after tomorrow for confreyeggers ive got a recon job for you guys in the meantime bobby giggled and said pie like in hairpie and rice saw red he was cocking his fists when joe jumped up from the bed frowned and said sixtyfour hundred on the nose thats really sh bobby shoved his brother aside moved to the bed and began recounting the money finishing he spat on the pile of bills and turned to look up at rice slightly less than you figured huh like twentyfive k less like little bro and me just risked ten to life for three fucking grand he paused then whispered you holding out on us knowing that fire full was the only way out rice said ill chalk that up to disappointment and a bad temper but you say it again and ill kill you joe stood perfectly still bobby gripped the mattress with both hands his jaw trembling saliva starting to creep out the corners of his mouth seeing more fear than anger rice threw him back a chunk of his cojones listen man im just as pissed about it as you and its my fault i should have realized that the real money was left in the vault but were still on for the next bobby screamed youre fucking crazy these bank fools are leaving out peanuts to pilfer and im not risking my ass again for another three grand thinking macho counterpunch rice smiled and said im going to make eggers go into the vault for us the same hostage plan for twenty times the money im going to intercept him in person as he enters the bank then force him to call you guys for confirmation that youre holding his bitch if he agrees to hit the vault ill tell him to sit tight at his desk with his hands in view and ill go across the street and keep him eyeball pinned when the guard and tellers arrive and the real money comes out eggers grabs what he can carry on his person and goes across the street to meet me he figures out a cool way to do this or his bitch gets chopped then i walk him to his car and tranq him grinning like a macho ghoul bobby said suppose he dont agree rice moved to joe and threw a rough arm around his shoulders then i kill him then and there and take the teller box money but hell agree he always wears a baggy suit lots of room and ill tell him cnotes only you in partners bobby whooped and jumped up and down dunking imaginary baskets rice tightened his grip on joes shoulders joe twisted free and stared at him and rice snapped to the fact that he was the smarter of the two joes eyes pleaded rice whispered two more days and its over joe looked at bobby who was throwing leftright body punches at his reflection in the wall mirror rice stuck two fingers into his mouth and forced out a loud shrill whistle the noise brought the scene to a halt bobby leaned against the mirror and said in exaggerated barrioese thirtytwo hundred come up green homeboy with an exaggerated shiteating grin rice moved to the bed and began a slowmotion recount of the money dividing it first in half and shoving that part under the pillow then separating the remaining half into two portions finishing he offered joe the first handful of bills bobby the second both brothers jammed the cash into their front and back pants pockets then stuffed the overflow into their windbreakers when the last of the money was stashed rice gave them a slow eyeball and shook his head his crime partners looked like two greedy greaseballs with elephantiasis like a worldclass dose of bad news bobby cracked his knuckles joe looked at rice and blurted what about the recon job duane you gonna tell us now rice leaned back on the bed and shut his eyes blotting out the bad news yeah i was thinking that maybe hawley and eggers know each other remember we dont know who originally scoped out the heists how he knew who he knew that kind of thing ill be watching the papers to see if they mention hawley and issler and i want you guys to keep a loose tail on eggers and confrey see if the cops or feds are nosing around if they are we have to call the heist off ill call you late tomorrow night if theres no heat we hit friday morning bobby popped his knuckles and said what kinda recon you gonna be doing rice opened his eyes but kept them away from the brothers a little added terror angle in case eggers gets uppity im going to trash his pad and steal some kitchen knives then bring the knives with me when i brace him that way i can tell him youre gonna chop up his bitch with a knife with his prints on them that and the fact that his pads been violated ought to keep him docile bobby whooped and jumped up and touched the ceiling loose bills started to pop out of his pants pockets rice said what was your record as a fighter eleven sixteen and zero bobby said never went the distance knocked out or got knocked out my tops was seven rounds with harry the headhunter hungerford lost on cuts why you asking i was wondering how you survived this long bobby giggled and shoved joe in the direction of the door clean living anonymous good deeds and faith in jesus duaneo he said kneading his brothers shoulders and a good watchdog dont you worry ill keep a good tail on eggers and his mama he unlocked the door and waggled his eyebrows on the way out rice could hear him giggle all the way back to the parking lot with the money under his pillow rice tried to sleep every time he was about to pass out the staccato beat of the vandals gibberish number microwave slave took over and vandy jumped into his mind in the frumpy housedress she wore when she performed the tune finally staying awake seemed like the easier thing to do opening his eyes he saw the ugliness of the room merge with the ugliness of the music the frayed cord on the hot plate a line of dust under the dresser grease spots all along the walls a lingering echo of bobby garcias psychobuffoon act was the final straw rice packed the money and his shaving gear into the briefcase and went looking for a new pad he found a holiday inn on sunset and la brea and paid for a week in advance no grease spots no dust no senile boozehounds clogging up the parking lot tv a view clean sheets and daily maid service after stashing the bulk of his loot rice drove up to the boulevard and spent a k on clothes at pants west he bought six pairs of levi cords and an assortment of underwear at millers outpost he purchased a half dozen plaid shirts his last stop was the london shop where a salesman looked disapprovingly at his tattoo while fitting him for two sport jacketslacks combos he thought about buying a set of threads for vandy but finally axed the idea after he got her off the coke shed be healthier and heavier and a couple of sizes bigger now the only whitetrash link to be severed was the car after dropping off his clothes at the new pad and changing into a new shirt and a pair of levis rice drove to a strip of south western avenue that he knew to be loaded with repo lots two hours and six lots got him zilchthe cars looked shitty and none of the sales bosses would let him do underthehood checks the seventh lot a gm repo outlet on twentyeighth and western was where he hit pay dirt a bored sales manager in a cubicle hung with master ignition keys telling him to grab a set of diagnostic tools and scope out any sled he wanted rice did timing checks battery checks transmission checks and complete engine scrutinies on five domestics before he found what he wanted a black trans am with a fourspeed and lots of musclegood under the hood and even better lookinga car that would impress any crowd he and vandy sought to crash the sales manager wanted four thou rice countered with twentyfive hundred cash the sales manager said feed me and rice handed it over knowing the joker made him for a nonboy scout after signing the purchase papers and pocketing the pink slip rice walked over to the street and saw an old wino sucking on a jug in the shade of his pontiac he tossed him the keys to his former clunker and said ride daddy ride then strolled back to his sleek muscle car when he got in and gunned the engine the wino was peeling rubber down western in the pontiac the bottle held to his lips now vandy rice drove north to the sunset strip savoring the feel of his trans am he avoided putting the car through speed shifts and other hotrod pyrotechnics he was now technically a parole and probation absconder and traffic tickets would mean a warrant check and instant disaster street traffic on the strip was light sidewalk traffic lighterschoolgirl hookers from fairfax high turning a few extra bucks on their lunch hour bouncers sweeping up in front of the massage parlors and outcall offices rice turned off sunset at gardner and parked the lavender fourflat that housed silver foxes looked bland in the daylight like just another hollywood spanish style he walked over and rang the bell beneath the sexy fox emblem a young man in white dungarees and a michael jackson tour tank top opened the door and blocked the entranceway in a handsonhips pose rice sized up his muscles and figured him for a bodybuilder who couldnt lick a chicken strictly adornment and a little jazz for the fag trade may i help you he asked rice said some friends in the industry said this was the place to go for female companionship im in town for a week or so and i havent got a lot of time to hit the party circuit normally paying for it isnt my style but you were very highly recommended he sighed pleased with his performancenot a trace of hawaiian gardens and soledad in his speech the youth flexed his biceps and imitated rices sigh it came out a pout everybody pays for it somehow this is the herpes generation who were these people who recommended us rice pointed to the office he could glimpse past the youths broad shoulders jeffrey jason rifkin the agent and some buddies of his i cant remember their names can we go inside nodding the youth stepped aside just enough to let rice squeeze through the door sideways their arms brushed and rice felt his stomach turn over when the kid let out a little grunt of pleasure the room was all white furnished in danish modernhigh techwhite walls and carpeting metal tubular desk bentwood chairs with white fabric backing scenes from rock videos were hung on the walls elvis costello in fifties garb superimposed against an abomb mushroom cloud bruce springsteen hopping a freight train diana ross drenched to the bone at her central park concert rice sat down without being asked and watched the kid flip through a white rolodex on the desk moving his lips as he read thinking of him coupled obscenely with bobby garcia kept his revulsion down and gave him an edge of frost with a sighing pout the kid looked up and said yes weve done business with mr rifkin in fact weve sent over lots of foxes for his theme parties theme parties it was a reflex blurt and rice knew immediately that it was the wrong thing to say the youth hooded his eyes yes theme parties many of our foxes are aspiring actresses and they enjoy theme parties because they get to act out more than they would on a straight assignment you know playing slave queens or topless cowgirls that kind of thing what do you do in the industry rice said im a talent scout and knew from the young mans puzzled expression that it was an outdated term ive been out of the industry for a while he added and jeffrey jason is helping me get rolling again its a tough racket to get back into yes the young man said it is what kind of fox were you looking for rice stretched his legs and smoothed his shirt front then said listen im very choosy about my women if i describe exactly what i want can you check out your files or whatever and take it from there the young man said we can do better than that weve got au naturel photographs of all our foxes he dug into the top desk drawer and pulled out a white plastic binder and handed it to rice take your time sweetie its a fox hunters candy store and nobodys rushing you rice opened the binder feeling a crazo sensation of being ripped upward from the crotch the first page was a spiel about rare breeds of foxes and fulfillment of fantasies scripted on lavender paper on the second page the women began posed nude in identical reclining postures they were all outright beautiful or outright gutter sensual superbly built in the skinny model and curvy wench modes white black oriental and latina they all firebreathed sex rice turned the pages slowly noticing blank spots where other photos had once been pasted he read the hype printed below each girls first name and physical stats aspiring actress and aspiring singer were the usual subheadings and next to them were lurid sex fantasies supposedly written by the foxes themselves the ridiculous accounts of three ways and four ways made him want to retch and he flipped through to the end of the binder looking only for the body he knew by heart not finding it he glanced up at the young man and said is this all your women the youth nodded and flexed his biceps youre really hard to please those foxes are the creme de la creme rice thought about mentioning former foxes then got an idea listen do you know most of the girls who work out of here some ive only been dispatching for a little over a week why rice said i was looking for a chick i saw walk out of here the last time i was in la about fivesix one hundred ten blonde skinny classy features preppy clothes ring a bell the young man shook his head no im new on the job and besides the owners wouldnt let the foxes dress preppyno sex appeal another idea clicked into rices head too bad listen since i didnt see that particular girl id like you to give me a recommendation brains turn me on i want a smart chickone i can talk to the young man smiled picked up the binder and leafed through it then handed it to rice there he said rhonda shes got a masters degree in economics and shes really groovy a real brain fox rice studied the photograph rhonda was a tall buxom woman with a dark brown afro deeply tanned except for bikini white across her breasts and pelvis she was described as an aspiring stockbroker and her fantasy was listed as orgies with rich intelligent beautiful men on my own private island in the adriatic rice thought she looked shrewd and probably didnt write the retarded fantasy blurb snapping the binder shut he said great can you send her over to the holiday inn on sunset and la brea in an hour the youth gave his sighpout ill call her rhonda is three hundred dollars an hour one hour minimum all our foxes gratefully accept tips over that amount rhonda carries her own visa mastercard and american express receipts and imprinter for the basic fee but please tip her with cash what room number we require a friendship fee of one hundred dollars for firsttime fox hunters like a hunting license the youth giggled rice thought he sounded just like bobby boogaloo garcia thats cute yes call it your deed to the happy hunting grounds cash please and your name rice slipped a cnote from his shirt pocket and stuck it inside the binder harry the fox hunter hungerford the youth giggled as he wrote down the name and rice walked out wondering if the world was nothing but wimps pimps psychos and sex fiends back at the holiday inn he killed time by watching tv for word of the robbery there was no mention of the heist or of a bank manager zoned on dust let alone the hostage anglethe bank bigshots had probably stonewalled the media to save face so far so goodbut his money was running out just as the news brief ended the door chimes rang rice grabbed a wad of twenties from the briefcase and stuck them under the mattress then walked to the door and opened it the woman who stood on the other side in a green knit dress and fur coat was her photograph gone subtle expecting sleazy attire and makeup rice saw class that rivaled vandy at her healthiest no makeup on a face of classic beauty large tortoiseshell glasses that set off that face and made it even more beautiful a rolex watch on her left wrist an attache case in her right hand rices eyes prowled her body until he snapped to what he was doing and brought them back up to her face pissed at his lack of control he said hi come in the woman entered then did a slow models turn as the door was shut setting her attache case on the floor tossing her coat onto a chair rice sized up her moves there was something nonwhorish about her act her voice was cool almost mocking in olden times fox hunting was the private sport of the landed gentry today all naturalborn aristocrats busy men with taste and no time to waste can enjoy that pleasure with silver foxesthe ultimate sensual therapy service for todays takecharge man rice said holy shit and stepped backward his heels bumping the attache case and knocking it over on impulse he bent down and opened it up inside were three metal credit card imprinters a stack of charge slips and a copy of wealth and poverty by george gilder the woman laughed as he snapped the case shut then said im rhonda most clients either love the intro or get embarrassed by it you were incredulous it was cute rice flushed the last time hed been called cute was the sixth grade when he nicknamed hawaiian gardens hawaiian garbage carol douglas shouted youre so cute duaney and chased his ass the rest of the semester cute huh come to any conclusions rhonda took off her glasses and hooked them into her cleavage by a temple piece theyre plate glass i only wore them to look brainy yes ive come to one conclusionyou dont want sex rice sat down on the couch and motioned for rhonda to join him when she sat down an arms length away he said youre a smart lady is that a bogus rolex rhonda flushed yes how did you know that i used to hang out in a hollywood crowd everyone had fake rolexes and they used to talk about how their rolex was real but everyone elses was phony are you calling me a phony no just seeing if you can level can you level you dont look like any hollywood type ive ever seen what were you into rice laughed i was selling stolen cars want me to get to it if you want to its your money rice said im looking for a woman my girlfriend a friend of a friend saw her up on the strip near all the outcall joints i was in jail for six months and she was having a tough time and i rhonda put a hand on his arm and you thought if she needed money badly shed turn tricks pulling his arm away rice said yeah she visited me in jail and i could tell she was strung out on coke he thought of vandy and gordon meyersits real pharmaceutical blow babyduane wouldnt want me to the words and a backup flash of vandys prep clothes hanging loose on her gaunt frame forced his words out in a tumble and i know shed only do it if she was desperate and not really like it and shes a singer and a lot of girls at silver foxes are aspiring singers and maybe she thought she could help herself while i something strange and soft in rhondas eyes stopped him he moved to the bed and dug under the mattress until his hands were full of money then walked back and dumped the stash of twenties in her lap thats for starters he said find her and theres lots more rhonda counted the money and folded it into a tight roll six hundred whats her name have you got a picture rice took the snapshot from his wallet and handed it to her anne vanderlinden she also goes by vandy rhonda looked at the photo and said foxy does she rice screamed dont say that catching himself he lowered his voice shes not a fucking animal shes my woman catching rhondas strange look again he said dont stare at me like that rhonda said sorry then patted the couch rice sat down beside her she put a tentative hand on his knee and asked whats your name rice brushed the hand away duane rice are you in yes put some things together for me about you and anne who she is what she likes to do that kind of thing was she in the hollywood crowd with you rice stared at the wall and straightened out the story in his head then said first off i know she isnt working outcall on the strip ive already checked those places out second she doesnt really have any friends in la except me the last time i saw her was in jail close to three weeks ago she cleaned out the pad we had together she rhonda squeezed his arm tell me about the hollywood crowd i was getting to it vandys a singer used to be lead singer with a vegas lounge group vandy and the vandals i was sort of her manager i did some favors for an agent named jeffrey jason rifkin and he fixed us up with that hollywood crowd it took me a while but i finally figured out that those people were all parasites who couldnt do vandy a bit of good but i was unloading cars on them and making a lot of money i had plenty banked toward making vandys rock videos what rock videos that was my plan get a stake together to produce rock videos featuring vandy it was moving but then i got busted rhonda said softly look duane ive been with silver foxes for over a year and ive never seen vandy or heard of her but lots of outcall girls branch out into other scenes particularly around here where theres all this movie and music industry money especially girls like vandy budding singers looking to get ahead looking to meet people who can help their careers do you follow me rice imitated rhondas soft voice i follow that youre bracing me for something spit it out i didnt give you that money for bullshit rhonda tucked the cash roll into her cleavage rice saw it as her first whorish move she said coldly some girls quit outcall because they get heavy into coke or they get offers to live with men in the industry most of these men expect their girls to sexually service their friends men who can do them favors the girls get room and board and coke and if theyre very lucky bit parts in movies and rock videos theres an industry name for them coke whores coke whores rice forced the name on himself tasting it testing it he looked at rhonda and thought about hitting her with stockbroker groupie and moneyfucker but couldnt do it the big question jumped into his mind and stuck like glue did it happen with meyers rhonda was staring at him giving out big sad doe eyes like carol douglas back in hawaiian garbage rice kneaded his tattooed biceps and said what do i get for that six hundred three hundred rhonda said silver foxes gets three i didnt want to tell you that duane anyone afraid of the truth is a chickenshit youre into these scenes right on the edges of them but im nobodys kept woman i know youre just working your way through college dont be ugly i want to help you was this an a b c or d crowd you and vandy hung out in what rhondas voice revealed exasperation in the movie and music biz there are four crowds a b c and d the as are the heavy heavy hitters bs below them and so forth ds are the nerds who are lucky to get work i was just wondering if vandy could have hooked up with someone she met in your crowd rice shook his head no way i kept her away from the men and she doesnt trust women what crowd are you in rhonda lowered her eyes at the jibe then said any crowd with money if vandys in la and into any industry scenes ill find her can i call you here rice looked around his new home wondering if his talk with the stockbrokerwhore had skunked the place past crashing in no he said i might split he took a pad and pencil off the phone stand and wrote down louie calderons bootleg number you can call me here and leave a message twentyfour hours a day you locate vandy and youll see lots of money rhonda took the slip of paper stood up and collected her attache case and fur coat rice watched her walk toward the door when her hand was on the knob she turned around and said ill be in touch rice said find her for me rhonda traced a dollar sign in the air and closed the door behind her at dusk rice felt the skunk stench close in on the new pad he knew it didnt come from rhonda or psycho bobby garcia or hawley or anybody else it came from being wrapped too tight in his own skull for too long with no one to talk to except people he wanted to use it was what it was like all the time before he met vandy and started to make things happen he made the black trans am happen first he fishtailed out of the holiday inn parking lot then he cruised the boulevard idling the engine at stoplights staying in second gear until he hit western avenue on western northbound he speedshifted into third sized up traffic and vowed not to touch the brake until he hit the griffith park observatory so he tapped the horn as he clutched weaved and shifted and then hollywood was behind him and the park road opened up then the whole world became a narrow strip of asphalt headlight glow and a broken white line seventy eighty eightyfive at ninety on the long upgrade approaching the observatory the trans am started to shimmy rice pulled to the side of the road and decelerated catching a view of the la basin lit with neon he thought immediately of vandy and gauged distances then turned around and drove toward the tiny pinpoints of light that he knew marked their old stomping grounds their old condo was already up for sale with a sign on the front lawn offering reasonable terms and fresh molding beside the door hed kicked off splitsville cold city nada he drove to the on olympic and bundy where he used to send vandy for frozen pizzas and his custom car magazines a new night man behind the counter scoped him out like he was a shoplifter the skunk odor came back so he grabbed a west la local paper and a candy bar and tossed the chump a dollar bill in the parking lot he ate half the candy bar and looked at the front page vandalism at schools in the picorobertson area church bakeoffs in rancho park little theater on westwood boulevard then he turned the page and everything went haywire the article was entitled sheriffs vet heading security at california federal branch and beside it was a closeup photo of gordon meyers rices hands started to shake he placed the newspaper on the hood of the trans am and read california federal banks district personnel supervisor dennis j lafferty today announced that gordon m meyers fortyfour recently retired from the los angeles county sheriffs department has taken over as head of security for the picowestholme branch replacing thomas o burke who died of a heart attack two weeks ago meyers who served most of his duty time as a jailer in the main county jails facility for emotionally disturbed prisoners said im going to make the most of this job after a week on the job cal federal already feels like home its great to be working with sane noncriminal people rice read the article three more times then took his hands from the cars hood they were still trembling and he could see the blood vessels in his arms pulsate a scream built up in his throat then the death before dishonor carved on his left biceps jumped out and calmed him with his tremors now at a low idle he drove to pico and westholme the bank was small dark and still a lowrent job for a lowrent excop with wacko lowrent criminal fantasies rice cruised by once twice three times each time forcing himself to say duane wouldnt want me to anyone afraid of the truth is a chickenshit and it happened on the fourth circuit all that came out was it happened it happened it happened now that he knew it himself he parked the trans am and brainstormed in and out in three minutes a block from the north and southbound two minutes from the santa monica eastwest five from wilshire fiftytwentyfivetwentyfive with the garcias then adios greaseballs the master keys at the repo lot for a foolproof getaway make it happen rice sat back and made pictures of vandy of east coast rock gigs of new york crowds that didnt have letters in front of them and big houses in connecticut then noises in his head bombarded the pictures good metalonmetal noises that he recognized as the clash of gears highpowered engines igniting doubleaught loads snapping from breech to barrel lloyd sat in the outer office of the los angeles fbis bank robbery unit kneading his gauzebandaged right hand and musing on his new lease on professional life mcmanus had called him in frisco with the word his suspension was over he was back on duty with a liaison gig with the feds report tomorrow morning to special agent kapek at the fbi central office and dont fuck up the lease was a phaseout he decided a stratagem to keep him occupied and docile while the high brass figured out a discreet way to give him the big one where it would do the most damage on the flight down and cab ride over he had been exultantly happy then a look at the clerkreceptionists face when he flashed his badge brought it all to a crash it had to be a shit assignment or they would have given it to a field lieutenant his glory days were dead a severelooking woman poked her head out of the connecting door and said sergeant hopkins lloyd pushed himself out of his chair with both hands his right hand throbbed yes to see special agent kapek is he here yet the woman walked toward him holding a manila folder and a sheaf of loose pages hell be here soon he said you should please wait and read these reports lloyd took the papers with his good hand and sat back down dismissing the woman with a nod of the head when he was alone again he opened the folder smiling when he saw that it contained a series of lapd crime reports the first report was submitted by a west valley division daywatch patrol unit and detailed events of wednesday less than twentyfour hours before while on routine patrol of woodman avenue the officers of unit fourcharliez came upon a middleaged white male urinating in the open window of a cadillac seville when they approached they determined that the suspect was heavily under the influence of a narcotic substance and cautiously advised him of his rights before arresting him for indecent exposure and public intoxication the man screamed incoherently as he was handcuffed but the officers were able to pick out the words bank rob and ray gun at the west valley station booking area the suspect was searched his identification revealed him to be robert earle hawley fortyseven the owner of the cadillac seville finding the name familiar the booking officer checked with the daywatch commander and learned that security personnel at the bank of america on woodman and ventura had entered the bank at opening time to find the cash boxes ransacked and the banks manager robert hawley missing hawleys booking was postponed the fbi bank robbery unit was notified of the bank managers incarceration and a team of detectives drove him to usc county general hospital for detoxification after determining that hawley was under the influence of angel dust a counterdose of aretane was administered when hawley returned to a sober state fbi special agent peter kapek and a team of lapd detectives again advised him of his right to remain silent and have an attorney present during questioning waiving those rights hawley gave the officers the following account of his mornings activities at am he received a phone call from an unknown man directing him to call the home of his girlfriend sally issler the man told hawley who is married that miss issler would be killed if his demands were not met and that he would call back in exactly three minutes hawley called miss issler a man with a mexican accent answered then put miss issler on the line she screamed that she was being held captive by two men with guns and knives and to do whatever their friend said hawley said he would then hung up the man called back as he said he would and told hawley to meet him on woodman near the bank in ten minutes warning him that his phone was tapped and any attempts to contact the police would result in miss isslers death hawley met the man near the bank and described him as white late twenties light brown hair blue eyes pounds with neatly trimmed beard and mustache wearing threepiece tan suit the man forced hawley to open the bank and empty cashboxes containing approximately in travelers checks into a briefcase then walked him back to his car where he shot him twice with what looked like a ray gun welts on hawleys neck and collarbone and small metal darts still stuck to his clothing indicated that he was telling the truth officers were dispatched to the home of miss issler they found her bound and gagged but otherwise unharmed she told them that her captors wore ski masks that covered their faces but were obviously mexicans they spoke fluent english with mexican accents one man the softerspoken of the two was tall and slender the other who talked dirty to her was short and muscular she placed both men as being in their early thirties and said they were both armed with armyissue automatics with attached silencers lloyd skimmed through the remaining reports learning that hawley was treated for toxic poisoning and was not charged with a wieniewagger beef or with anything pertaining to the robbery and that sally issler was treated for shock at a local hospital and then released the disparate facts started to sink in pointing to solid criminal brains he was about to give the initial pages another goaround when he sensed someone watching him read he looked up to see a tall man of about thirty hovering near the doorway pete kapek the man said nice caper huh you like it lloyd stood up bank robberys not my meat but ill take it he walked over to the doorway kapek stuck out his right hand then noticed the bandage and switched to his left lloyd said lloyd hopkins and fumbled a handshake kapek said ive heard youre smart what do you think right off the top of your head lloyd walked into kapeks office and went straight for the window and its view of downtown la seven stories below with his eyes on a stream of antlike people scuttling across figueroa he said right off the top why me im a homicide dick two whats with hawley presumably he was chosen because his affair with the issler woman made him particularly vulnerable to a blackmail angle again presumably his wife didnt know about issler then why did he spill his guts so quickly kapek laughed it wasnt in the report but the phone man told hawley he had infrared fuck shots of him and sally he threatened exposure of the affair as well as sallys murder i sized up hawley as a wimp and made him a deal talk and we wouldnt press charges on him for flashing his shlong and wed keep the whole mess out of the medias clutches you like it lloyd turned around and looked at kapek noticing acne scars that undercut his fed image and made him seem more like a cop yeah i like it also right off the top of my head one were dealing with brains stupider guys would have gone straight for hawleys wife right there at his pad and kept her hostage which might have driven hawley to the cops from jump street thats impressive if the wrong guys got ahold of a family hostage idea and got away with it once theyd keep going until someone was killed as it stands this is probably a oneshot deal which leads us back to issler she been polygraphed kapek sat down and poked a pencil at the papers on his desk shes clean no polygraph yet but while she was at the hospital i had a forensic team and latent prints team do a job on her apartment they found jimmy marks on the side door and rubber glove prints on all the surfaces the mexicans would have touched we got a bunch of viable latents and the team stayed up half the night doing eliminations against sally hawley and a list of friends and relatives that sally gave us working with dmv armed forces and passport records you know what we got the above nonsuspects and one unaccountedfor set that later turned out to be some dipshit lapd rookie who saw all the blackandwhites out front and thought hed make the scene the forensic guys got soil and mashedup flower petals coming through the side door the beaners trampled a flower garden on their way in no sally baby was not in on it lloyd said shit competent print men kapek laughed the best one guy is a real freak he dusted the bedposts and logicked that sally likes to get on top you like it only on tuesdays lets get the obvious stuff out of the way the phone man wore gloves and hawley cant id him from mug shots right no eyeball witnesses at either crime scene right the bank checks bug me what can they yield casha quarter on the dollar if that but theyre greenand from a distance you know during a casing job they might appear to be the real thing which doesnt make our boys look too smart lloyd nodded employees and exemployees known associates of issler and hawley being checked out if we dont bust this thing in a week or so ill plant a man in the bank our approaches are narrowing down you like it lloyd collected his thoughts by looking out the window at lowhanging clouds brushing the tops of skyscrapers no i dont one of the reports said issler made the mexicans as carrying armyissues thats a strange perception for a woman kapek chuckled sexist isslers father was a career officer she knows her stuff those old heavys are getting scarce though maybe an approach nodding silently lloyd watched dark clouds devour the restaurant atop the occidental building for a moment he forgot that this case would probably be his last turning to look at kapek he said so were stuck with figuring out where the robbers glommed onto hawley and issler and if either of them have other bank manager friends in similarly vulnerable positions which is a bitch of a fucking intelligence job kapek slapped both thighs how about an ad in the singles tabloids bank managers involved in extramarital romances please come forward to act as decoy no ive already questioned hawley and issler on thatzip this is a oneshot deal perpetrated by brainboys who can control themselves now the crunch question what are you going to do about this thing lloyd cut off kapeks eagerness with a chopped hand gesture no first how are we working this ive been a supervisor and ive worked alone but ive never worked an interagency gig with the feds i realize its your investigation but i want to know what i can ask for who i can delegate and how much slack ive got on doing it my way kapek muttered your way under his breath then said out loud the investigation is structured this way lapd is handling the issler assaultkidnap with the squad lieutenant from west valley dicks supervising he knows youre the liaison hell give you any information or assistance you need ive got three men checking out isslers and hawleys known associates and the restaurants and motels they frequented that kind of thing theyll be compiling data on the people they come into contact with checking them out with lapd r ampi looking for connections the travelers checks are a long shot but the serial numbers have been broadcast nationwide and the west valley cops have put out the word to their snitches i want you as a floater between agencies youve probably got snitches up the yingyang and i want you to utilize them there is absolutely nothing in our computer or files on whitemexican heist teams period let alone ones given to kidnapassaults this caper sounds like street criminals graduatingmore your beat than mine you take it from there lloyd breathed in the declaration of his secondbanana status it felt like a swarm of nasty little bureaucratic bees buzzing at his brain his voice was tight and hoarse as he said lets fucking move then youve got hawley intimidated so grab his credit card bills so we can see where he and sally have been screwing dont trust his memory on itsubconsciously hell be screwing you lean on him polygraph him rattle his skeletons you like it kapek snickered rubber hose him threaten him with an irs audit hes got a son in college whos gay squeeze him by putting it on the six oclock news ease off sergeant the man is cooperating the buzzing grew deafening lloyd looked out the window then jerked his eyes back when the notion of a sevenstory jump to oblivion started feeling good i want to have a shot at issler he said i want to question her about her old boyfriends and i want to put a tap on her home and work phones ill go easy on her kapek stood up put his hands on the desk and leaned forward so that his face was only a few feet from lloyds unequivocally no that order comes directly from your own immediate superior officer captain mcmanus told me personally to keep you away from her and all other women involved in this investigation beyond the level of field interrogation he told me that if you violate that order hell suspend you from duty immediately he means it and if you cross me on this ill report it to him in a hot flash suddenly the bees did a kamikaze attack lloyd looked down at his bandaged hand and saw that he had gripped the window ledge so hard that blood was starting to seep through the gauze he stared out the window at a dark mass of rain clouds seeing that the occidental building was now completely eclipsed he said its your ball game gman ill call you every twentyfour unless something urgent comes up call me at home or parker center if you get anything you like it i like it what else did mcmanus tell you he implied that you have emotional problems pertaining to the pursuit of pussy i told him that my wifes a black belt in karate so i dont have those problems lloyd laughed its your ball game but its my last shot im gonna nail these cocksuckers kapek pointed to the door roll hot dog lloyd rolled first in a cab to parker center where he formally reported back for duty then in a matador to the west valley station staying ahead of the northbound storm clouds that threatened to drench the la basin to the bone in the empty west valley squadroom he read the reports filed by plainclothes officers who had canvassed the two crime scenes late the previous day the woodman and ventura housetohouse was a total blankthree housewives had noticed hawley passed out in his cadillac but no one had seen him in the company of another man the canvass of sally isslers neighborhood was an even bigger zerono male mexicans alone or traveling as a pair were seen on the street and no unknown or suspicious vehicles were parked on or near her apartment building sally isslers formal statement made after she came out of her hospitaladministered sedation was more illuminating asked about the personalities of her two captors she had stated that the tall slender man seemed passive for a criminal softspoken maybe even educated and that the short muscular man came on like a sex freak like one of those mexicans who hit on every chick they meet when asked exactly what the short man said she refused to answer lloyd called telecredit and asked for lists of robert hawleys and sally isslers recent credit card transactions emphasizing restaurant and bar bills and motel accommodations the operator promised to phone him at parker center with the information running down options in his mind lloyd left a note for the lieutenant handling the issler investigation to call him at the center then wrote out a memo to be teletyped to all lapd divisions for roll call all units be alert for twoman stickup team male mexicans early thirties one tall slender and softspoken one short muscular and a possible sex offender both armed with silencered armyissue autos also be alert for b of a greenback travelers checks serial number and denominations in west valley div robbery bulletin direct all queries and field interrogation reports to det sgt hopkins robberyhomicide div x on his way out lloyd left the memo with the watch commander who assured him it would be transmitted in time for the nightwatch crime sheet then he rolled back to parker center this time straight into the storm clouds he was skirting the east edge of hollywood when the rain hit hawley issler and mexican bandits rolled out of his mind and janice rolled in freezeframed as she looked the last time he saw her after punching out the lawyers bookcase he had walked through chinatown pressing his bloody hand into his shirttail numbed and directionless until it started to rain in buckets and he realized he was only a few blocks from janices apartment he knocked on the door and roger answered in a bathrobe his yappy dachshund cowering in back of him roger himself backed off as if fearing a blow lloyd walked past him into the kitchen holding his hand tightly to avoid dripping blood on janices persian carpet the dog alternately yapped growled and took a bead on his ankles as he wrapped a dish towel around his gashed knuckles janice had walked in then carrying a pitcher of frozen daiquiris she jumped back at the sight of lloyd and the pitcher fell to the floor banana and rum fizz flying in all directions lloyd held up his hand and said oh shit jan and the dachshund began lapping up the goo roger entered the kitchen as the dog began to reel from the booze he tried to grab him but slipped on banana residue and hit the floor ass first the drunken hound lapped his face and janice laughed so hard she had to grab lloyd for support he held her with his good arm and she burrowed into him until he could feel them melding into each other the way they used to then roger broke the spell by blubbering about his robe being ruined and janice drew away from her husband and back to her lover but a brush fire had been ignited lloyd whispered i love you as he retreated from the kitchen janice formed yes with her lips and touched her hands to her breasts back at his parker center cubicle lloyd let the brush fire smolder as he figured out shit work logistics first making notes for computer crosschecks then writing an interdepartmental memo alerting detective division personnel to the case and its salient facts the work forged the facts even deeper into his own mind pushing back a notion to pad the job and thus postpone the inevitable the sense of inevitability dug in like spurs and drove him down to the fourthfloor computer room where he had the programmer feed in queries on whitemexican stickup teams and their current dispositions male mexicans with both armed robbery and sex offense convictions and known and suspected gangland armorers the results came back in twenty minutesa printout of forty names and criminal records the first two categories were washouts the twelve whitemexican heist teams all had at least two members currently in prison and the nine mexican armed robbersex offenders were all men aged fortyeight to sixtyone lloyd took the list of gun dealers up to his cubicle and read through the twentyone names and criminal records immediately dismissing the blackslatin and black hoodlums hated each other like poison this eliminated thirteen names and the printout showed that four of the eight men remaining were in county jail and state prison on various charges he wrote down the four names that were left mark mcguire vincent gisalfi luis calderon and leon mazmanian then called his most trusted snitch and gave him the names an outline of the hawley issler case and the promise of a cnote for hard info the shit work completed he looked out his window at the rain and wondered what janice was doing then he balled his bad hand into a fist checking the gauze for seepage seeing none he pulled off the bandage and dressing and tossed it into the wastebasket joe garcia woke up on the morning of his second strongarm assault and found himself eyeball to eyeball with another flattened slug this one mounted on mattress stuffing that had popped out of his sealy posturepedic while he slept rolling onto his back he saw the lumber the workmen had stacked for the reconstruction of his bedroom wall and added the spent piece of metal to the ones hed already dug out of his clothes and books and records eleven bobby had shot off both guns a total of fourteen rounds a stack of his scifi paperbacks his pendletons and all of his old buddy holly records got wasted and three of the little cocksuckers were still hiding waiting to tell him that even though he had almost two grand in his kick and bobby was paying for the damage he was thirtyone and going nowhere figure todays score as ten times the money in a ten times more dangerous plan and he was going nowhere rich then bobby would talk him into some sleazoid quickbucks scam and hed be going nowhere broke pushing himself out of bed joe felt shivers at his back and nailed the source two days ago he became a righteous hardball criminal if he was going nowhere at least he was doing it in style then his eyes caught the silencered handgun on top of his dresser and the source nailed him turning his knees to rubber he was an hour away from committing felonies that could send him to prison for the rest of his life or have him shot on sight the one good line from his longtime epic song supplied the final nail and made his arms shake like jello and death was a thrill on suicide hill joe fought the shakes by thinking of bobby knowing hed get pissed or depressed or grateful if he kept running riffs on him while he dressed he remembered growing up in lincoln heights and how bobby held him when the old man came home juiced and looking for things to hit how he tied him to his bed so he could go out and play without him how all the neighbors despised their family because only two kids meant they were bad catholics and how bobby beat up the kids who said they were really jews in disguise bobby saved his ass then but when father chacon talked the old lady into trying for more rug rats against doctors advice and she died in childbirth bobby kicked the shit out of him when he called the dippy old priest a puto and bobby carried him through burglary and jail and bobby spit on his dreams and he could split from him but he had to stay in la for the music biz and if he stayed in la bobby would find him and bobby would need him because without him bobby was a oneway ticket to the locked ward at atascadero the rundown calmed joe to the point where he could shave and dress in his camouflage outfit of business suit and shiny black shoes but when he stuck the into his belt the shakes returned this time he fought them with pictures of k worth of guitars amps and recording equipment it worked until bobby jumped into the doorway his arms raised like the wolfman growling lets go pendejo im hunnnnggry the brothers drove to their target at studio and gage they parked and fed two hours worth of coins to the meter then walked the three blocks north to hildebrand street traffic was scarce pedestrian traffic nonexistent at they came up on christine confreys ranchstyle house her red toyota parked in the driveway bobby said walk like youre the landlord joe whispered be ultra frosty bobby grinned now little brother they took the driveway straight to the back door joe looked for witnesses while bobby took a metal ruler from his jacket pocket and slipped it between the door and doorjamb and pushed up the catch snapped and they entered into a tiny room filled with folding lawn chairs joe reset the latch and felt his sweat go icecold at the moment of b ampe terror if they were seen it was over bobby eyed the door to the house proper and picked a soiled towel up off the floor joe slipped a length of nylon cord from his back pocket then watched his brothers lips do a silent countdown at they donned their ski masks and gloves at they moved pushing through the door at a fast walk the connecting hallway was still joe heard music coming from a door at the far left end and took that side of the hall knowing part of his watchdog job was to be the one who grabbed the girl as the music grew louder he pressed himself to the wall when the music drowned out the slamming of his heart he leaped through the open door and jumped on the woman who was standing with one foot on the bathtub ledge poising a razor over her leg the woman screamed as joes arms went around her the razor gouged a section of calf bobby elbowed his way into the bathroom and wrapped the towel over her head stuffing a large wad of it into her mouth stifling her screams joe fumbled her robe into her breasts so they wouldnt stick out then circled the cord around her pressing her arms to her sides when he got it tied he lifted her off the floor kicking and flailing still tightly grasping the razor he whispered sssh sssh sssh were not going to hurt you we just want money we just want money bobby got out his roll of tape and pulled a long piece loose then withdrew the towel the woman let out a short screech before he was able to loop the tape around her head and press it to her mouth when he saw the terror in her eyes his whole body started to twitch and he whispered get her fucking calmed down joe loosened his grip on the woman as bobby stumbled out of the bathroom with one hand he took out his and held it in front of her with the other he smoothed her disheveled hair sssh sssh were not going to hurt you this is a robbery its got to do with you and your boyfriend eggers you have to do two things you have to not be scared but you have to act scared when the phone rings and you talk to your boyfriend my buddys a crazy man but i can control him be cool and you wont get hurt christine confreys tremors decelerated just a notch joe could feel her thinking when she dropped the razor he relaxed his grip and steered her into the hallway bobby was there leaning against the wall giving the thumbsup sign the phone is gonna ring real soon he giggled joe nodded and moved christine into the bedroom motioning bobby to stay out he noticed the phone on a nightstand it had the look of something about to explode when it rang shrilly he looked into his captives eyes just be cool he whispered gently pulling the tape from her mouth he picked up the phone on the fifth ring and said eggers getting a yyes chrissy pplease pput her on nodding at christine and holding up the for her to see he handed the receiver over she grasped it with shaking hands and tried to form words joe fought a desire to smooth her hair finally her voice caught john theres these two men here theyve got guns and they say that all they want is money she watched joe stroke the barrel of his and her voice accelerated please john goddammit dont be fucking cheapdo whatever they tell you to do or theyll kill me they joe grabbed the phone and put his free hand over christines mouth he said got it eggers and got yes you animal in return joe said just do what our friend says then hung up christine confrey twisted her head free and said now what joe thought of tiresquealing blackandwhites and shotgunwielding fuzz now we wait he said an hour tops then we get another call and we tape your mouth and you never see us again youre a slimy piece of mexican shit christine confrey replied joe caught himself starting to nod in agreement but said instead be cool his face began sweating beneath the ski mask it felt like a shroud they waited in silence christine sitting on the bed joe standing by the bedroom door looking at his watch and listening to bobby giggle as he prowled the house it felt like he had two senses both of them working toward something bad after thirtytwo minutes of scoping out the timex bobbys giggles exploded into a big burst of laughter then the door pushed open and the skimasked loony was there a magazine in his hands growling check the skin book homeboy righteous hairpie christine pointed to the magazine bobby was waving hyperventilating then getting out iii was nineteen i needed the money and i only kept it because john likes to see what i was like then and i joe moved to the bed and wrapped the discarded section of tape around christines mouth bobby was at his back holding the copy of beaverooney open jabbing his right forefinger at the pictures inside dig it bro is this bitch fine as wine or am i woofin dig it to placate bobby joe glanced at the legsapart nude spread yeah but just maintain mainfuckingtain bobby shoved him aside and sat down on the edge of the bed christine strained against the cord and tape kicking her legs in an effort to propel herself away working her lips trying to scream a stream of urine stained the front of her robe and trickled down her thighs bobby squealed righteous and grabbed both her ankles with his left hand and held them to the bed while his right hand hovered over her pelvis in a parody of a shark about to attack he grunted duhnduhnduhnduhn and joe recognized it as the theme from jaws bobbys shark hand did slow figure eights bobby himself whispered we reconned you good baby but i didnt pick up on how fine you are fine as wine im the sharkman baby duhnduhnduhnduhn i give righteous fin and even better snout joe whimpered no no no as bobby stuck his tongue through the hole in his ski mask and lowered his head when his mouth made contact with christines leg he shrieked no you fucking rapeo no the phone rang bobby jerked his head up as joe moved toward the nightstand he pulled the from his waistband and aimed it straight between his brothers eyes let it ring puto the shark wants to give some snout and no candy ass watchdog is gonna stop him joe backed into the wall the phone rang another six times then stopped bobby giggled and started making slurping noises christine squeezed her eyes shut and tried to bring her hands together in prayer joe shut his own eyes and when he heard bobby titter shark goin down he stumbled out of the bedroom picturing tear gas and choppers and death then there was a crashing sound from the rear of the house joe opened his eyes and saw duane rice running down the hallway holding a briefcase and the no ski mask and no beard disguise on the house went silent then bobbys sharkman sharkman reverberated like thunder rice crashed into the bedroom and joe heard a sound hed never heard before bobby squealing in terror he ran to the bedroom door and looked in rice had bobby on the floor and was slamming punches at his midsection christine confrey was still on the bed trying to scream her robe was pulled up over her stomach and her panties were curled around her ankles joe ran to the bed and pulled down the robe then grabbed duane rices shoulders and screamed dont dont youll kill him rices head and fists jerked back at the same instant and he twisted to look up at the voice joe said please and rice weaved to his feet and gasped get the briefcase bobby moaned and curled into a ball christine tried to bury her head in the bed sheets rice felt the throbbing redness that was devouring him ease down when joe came back holding the briefcase he pinned his shoulders to the wall and hissed you listen to this and well survive get psycho out of here and run herd on him like you never did before tie the woman up even better and dont let that piece of shit near her if i find out he even touched her again ill kill him do you believe me joe nodded and said yes rice released him opened the briefcase and started extracting handfuls of money dropping them on the bed when the briefcase was half empty he pointed to the pile and said your share ill call you tonight i trust you for some reason so you take care of him joe looked at the wads of cash covering the crumpled sheets and christine confreys legs then looked down at bobby slowly rising to his knees he turned around for sight of duane rice but he was already gone rice forced himself to walk slowly to the trans am parked a block from christine confreys house he swung the briefcase like mr square citizen and wondered how good a look the woman got at his face and why for a split second her face looked just like vandys then he remembered how at their first meeting joe garcia had called his brother a rapeo and how it didnt register as anything but jive eggers was angel dust pie but it was bobby boogaloo who put them inches away from the shithouse after stashing the briefcase in the trunk rice drove down gage to studio and at the corner saw the garcias camaro parked at the curb he pulled into a liquor store lot across the street to observe the brothers getaway and see if the fuzz approached the confrey pad if no blackandwhites descended and joe and the rapeo looked good they were clear and pico and westholme was still a possible he thought of the score of the sheer audacity of trashing eggerss sterile colonial crib and the look on his face when he showed him the knives hed stolen and said christine confrey chop chop your prints you know what i want the look got better as the heist progressed the bank man realizing there was no way out except to obey even though the take was probably only k tops it was twice the amount of the first joba good omen and a better appetite whetter after ten minutes no patrol cars or unmarked cruisers appeared and he could see straight up gage and tell that the house was still undisturbed his hands throbbed from whomping bobby garcia and he gripped the steering wheel to control the pain after twenty minutes the garcias swung onto studio boulevard from a block east of gage walking two abreast with shopping bags partially shielding their faces bobby was limping probably from abdominal pain and joe was talking him through the whole scene more like a daddy than a kid brother rice smiled as they got in their camaro and drove off for a cowardly tagalong criminal joe garcia had balls if he could control the rapeos balls for three hours hed make pico and westholme happen when he got home to the holiday inn rice changed from his bank robber suit into a new shirtlevi combo and counted the proceeds of the eggersconfrey job his half of the haphazardly split take came to fondling the money felt obscene and he remembered what a softhearted old bull at soledad told him dont fuck whores because then all women start looking like whores he remembered christine confreys terrified face and wondered if you loved a woman then did all women start looking like her even though christine and vandy were physical opposites their resemblance was weird rice looked at the phone and flashed on an idea to call the fuzz and tip them to christine then doubleflashed on it as suicide and dialed louie calderons bootleg number louie picked up on the first ring talk to me its duane got any messages for me duane the brain hows it hangin a hard yard any calls yeah if a nigger and a mexican jump off the top of the occidental building at the same time who hits the ground first jesus louie who the nigger cause the mexicans gotta stop on the way down and spray his name on the wall louie went into a laughing attack then recovered and said i thought it was funny and im a fuckin mexican got a pencil i can remember it shoot okay call rhonda sexedout voice

money klein the dope dealer who probably ratted him off on his gta bust klein the lounge lizard who he always figured had the hots for vandy and the hotel room reeled adrenaline juiced through rice like the shot of dope that had cost him three years of his life the phone dropped to the floor and through a long red tunnel rhondas voice echoed im sorry duane im sorry im really sorry everything went crazy then a jolt of ice water made the room sizzle like a live wire you cant kill him you cant kill him because hes a known associate you cant kill him because vandys a known associate and the cops will sweat her at sybil brand and the dykes will eat her up you cant kill him because then you and vandy cant make the rock scene in the big apple and youll never have the place in connecticut and it was enough icewater fuel rice ran for the trans am leaving the under the pillow as added insurance rhondas pleas were still coming out of the phone im sorry goddammit but i need money you promised you promised mount olympus was an upscale tract of twostory mediterranean villas situated off fairfax in the lower part of the hollywood hills rice cruised the access road looking for stan kleins red porsche with the personalized plate stan man when all he saw were benzes caddys and audis mostly colorcoordinated to the houses he pulled into the empty driveway of number and got out grabbing a skinnyhead screwdriver from the glove compartment the windows were too high to reach but the door looked flimsy rice rang the bell waited twenty seconds then rang again hearing no sounds of movement inside he inserted the screwdriver into the door runner just above the lock and yanked the cheap plywood cracked and the door opened he stepped inside and closed the door making a mental note not to leave prints the entrance foyer was dark but off to his left he could see a big highceilinged living room rice walked in and gasped every inch of floor and wall space was covered with stereo and video equipment vcrs and betamaxes were stacked along one wall floor to ceiling home computer terminals tv sets and giant cardboard boxes piled with sony walkmans were lined up on the floor three pacman machines were propped by the doorway and the rest of the room was taken up by mounds of small cardboard boxes threading his way into the maze rice grabbed a box at random rhonda the fox and a naked man were on the cover beneath the legend help me rhondathe beach boys private collectors itemavailable only thru stan man enterprises box la calif it all went red rice tore through every box in the room read every cover shitloads of naked woman and oldies but goodies but no vandy his frost was returning when he saw a phone and phone machine atop a color tv he punched the play message button and got hi this is stan klein on the line for stan man enterprises annie and i are on a video shoot but well be back monday night talk to the beep bye rice pushed incoming there was a tape hiss followed by a beep and a male voice stanley baby its chick listen annie was great unbelievable skull so listen if youre free can we talk ad space like tuesday call me beep stan this is ward carter iuh want to thank you for the uh you know eskimo tradeoff annie was fabulous about the porn vid its strictly bootleg on the song rights but im sure i can work out a deal with this man i know whos got a chain of xrated motels hes mob and you know how those guys are into blondes so maybe you could set up a party talk to you mondayish the rest of the messages went unheard a hideous wailing was drowning them out rice wondered where the sound was coming from when his eyes started to burn he knew he was weeping for the first time since the sixth grade in hawaiian garbage lloyd was asleep in his parker center cubicle when the phone rang snapping awake he pulled his legs off the desk and checked his watch afternoon dozeoffs another sign of encroaching middle age he grabbed the receiver and said robberyhomicide hopkins peter kapek weve got another one ive got the manager hes agreed to talk with no attorney west la federal building fourthfloor interview rooms fortyfive minutes thirty and rolling lloyd said and hung up he made the trip in thirtyfive leadfooting it code three all the way then running upstairs to the fbis criminal division offices the receptionist looked at his badge and pointed him down a long corridor inset with plexiglas cubicles on one side and listening rooms on the other at the far end he looked through the oneway glass and saw peter kapek and a middleaged man in a tweed suit sitting at a metal table the man appeared composed kapek harried as he jotted notes on a legal pad lloyd stepped across the hall to the booth where a headsetwearing stenographer was transcribing the interrogation he said lapd and the woman nodded and tore off the long roll of paper flowing out of her machine its complete she said you didnt miss that much lloyd took the paper and pulled it taut squinting to read the computer type hrs wla fed crim div present sa peter kapek john brownell eggers wm dob no wants no warrants no criminal record re robbery at security pacific bank lankershim blvd van nuys subject waived attorney pk mr eggers i want you to forget what you already told the lapd officers at the station on the ride over i want a chronological reconstruction of todays events take your time and be as detailed as you like je of course i went to the bank early this morningabout because i had some papers to go over as i was about to unlock the door pk excuse me mr eggers was there anyone else there at the bank je no there wasnt the staff doesnt arrive until pk thank you please continue je a man approached me as i was about to unlock the doors he was a white man about thirty about six feet oneseventy or so medium brown hair neatly trimmed mustache and beard he was wearing a cheap tan threepiece suit and carrying a briefcase and i didnt see him get in or out of a car long pause the man showed me a gun in a shoulder holster and told me that he was the one who had broken into my home two nights before i had already reported that to the police he made me unlock the door then he walked me to my desk he told me that he wanted vault money as much as i could carry outside on my person once the time lock went off at opening time then pause then the man took out a knife that he had stolen from my kitchen he told me that two accomplices of his were holding my wife and daughter hostage at our vacation house in lake arrowhead and that if i didnt cooperate they would be raped then dismembered with a second knife of mine one that he knew had my fingerprints on it i said i would cooperate and begged the man not to let his partners hurt my family pk go on mr eggers slowly please je thinking of my wife and daughter held hostage terrified me the man told me to sit at my desk facing the window with my hands in my lap and to remain that way until opening time he said he would be across the street watching and waiting and at i should walk outside with the money and he would find me he said that if i called the police or i wasnt outside at the specified time my wife and daughter would diebecause his partners were going to kill them at exactly unless he delivered the allclear pause at with money distributed to the tellers i chitted for the contents of one station i couldnt think straight i just mumbled something about a cash draft stuffed the money in my pockets and walked outside when i was out of sight of the bank the robber grabbed me and forced me to hand over the money then he led me to my car and made me sit down behind the drivers seat and he shot me with this ray gun and i blacked out when i woke up around one oclock i had an awful headache i ran to a pay phone and called my wife in arrowhead and she and cathy were safe no one had held them captive i had been had the police were at the bank because i had disappeared for hours and the rest you know pk backtracking mr eggers could you describe any distinctive mannerisms that the robber had the computer roll ended lloyd handed it back to the steno and walked across the hall and stared at the bank manager through the oneway glass wondering how much of his bullshit peter kapek bought thinking fuck it he knocked on the door and stood aside so that eggers couldnt see him kapek walked into the corridor seconds later saw lloyd and smiled is this bimbo slick as shit you like him lloyd imitated the smile you charging him with what perjury thats your scene what weve got so far is a pussy hound trying to protect his reputation except for the lake arrowhead bullshit and no mention of his sweetie pie hes leveling im going to goose him then pleabargain him into cooperating by giving him immunity on the girlfriend angle lloyd shook his head kapek we cant do that this makes two in three days and the mo is getting hairier we need a media alert on this have you hit him with hawley and issler he doesnt know them that i believe absolutely this whole shtick is beginning to get to me hopkins you get anything from your files your informers lloyd grabbed kapeks arm and led him down the hall out of earshot of the steno booths dont play this joker straight he said hes slick and hes got a lot of hardball in him and hell tie us up for days trying to id his girlfriend kapek yanked his arm free hell cooperate as soon as i say getting any on the side hell fold bullshit you want a reconstruction on this i buy the stolen knives as our guyseggers isnt hip enough to come up with something like that the robbery went down just like he called it our boys got stiffed on the travelers checks and theyre pissed only eggers came off the dust looking to save his ass he made the call to arrowhead from a pay phone probably with a credit card so thered be a record and he got detoxed from the dust before he hit the bank so hed be coherent he should be zorched to the gills but hes mr lucidity you mention adultery and hell shut up tighter than a crabs asshole no he wont lloyd muttered shit that was gospel about his pad getting burglarized all the way kapek said i read the crime report an hour agono witnesses no printsnothing eyeball witnesses at the bank zero shit lets lean on eggers youre a blackglove cop hopkins im not eggers is a big man so the dust shot didnt hit him as hard as hawley we play it my way he shook his head and started to walk away lloyd stepped in front of him and made his voice placating listen trust me on something turn the heat up in the interview room get him to take off his jacket youll see a spike mark or a bandaid at the crook of one of his elbows my guess is that he hasnt even gone by the girlfriends pad to see if shes okay the cocksucker hit the family doctor for an antitoxin then started covering his ass you release him like everythings copacetic hell lead us straight to her kapek smiled i like it but if theres no track or bandaid we play it my way he walked to the front of the corridor and talked to the receptionist then returned and winked you like it five minutes later the corridor started heating up ten minutes later it was outright hot lloyd watched through the oneway glass as john eggers fidgeted in his chair then took off his jacket kapek aped his actions then rolled up his sleeves this time eggers aped the fbi man and by squinting lloyd could see the small circular bandaid on the inside of his left elbow kapek stood up and stretched then walked past eggers and stepped into the corridor seeing lloyd he closed the door and said youre good im sending slick home in a cab in five minutes tail him but if he goes to his skirt dont approach call me he drew a slow finger across his throat i mean that also we should have another confab van nuys station at six lloyd said be there or be square then wiped a line of sweat from his forehead and walked downstairs in the parking lot he stood by the sidestreet entrance and waited for the arrival of the taxi shortly a yellow cab pulled in and cruised up to the buildings back entrance john eggers his suit coat slung over one shoulder walked outside and got in when the taxi swung out onto veteran avenue lloyd counted to twentyfive and pursued he caught the cab at the onramp to the northbound and let a car get between them as they headed toward the valley at ventura the taxi exited and swung east staying in the middle lane the driver cruising so maddeningly slow that lloyd wanted to ram him with his unmarked units snout and shove them all the way to eggerss destination just when his frustration felt like it was about to peak the cab lurched and hung a sharp left turn onto gage avenue and went north lloyd started to tingle too declasse a neighborhood for a middleaged bank exec they were headed for the girlfriends pad when the cab drew to the curb at the corner of hildebrand he continued on looking back through his side mirror eggers got out and walked up the steps of a modest ranchtype house and let himself in lloyd parked and walked down the street to his target eyeing the windows for good listening spots deciding to prowl the houses perimeter he walked down the driveway with his ears perked for sounds of weeping and comforting he was all the way around the back to the other side when he heard the sounds of pure hard female rage and its all on you you bastard they were going to leave me alone until the bad one found that sleazy picture book that youre so fucking in love with the voice took on a baby talk tone poor johnnypoo got held up and hes sooo afraid that the bankypoo and his wifeypoo are going to find out about his affair with chrissypoo awww the mean old robberpoo shot johnnypoo with dustypoo and he got his brooksiepoo suit allll wrinkled awww there was a sharp fleshonflesh noise then the womans voice came out soft and dripping with contempt that man who robbed you is more of a fucking man than youll ever be think about it john next time you start talking about all the sacrifices youve made to be with me think about that man beating up one of his partners to keep me from getting raped eggers retort was a beatendog grovel but you wont tell the police chrissy my jobour future depends on keeping this quiet no the woman said i wont i care about you too much to hurt you that way but take this with you when you see your wife in arrowhead tomorrow he was sexy and somewhere down the line when were screwing im going to be thinking of him of the man who made you look weak and foolish now get out of my sight lloyd leaned against the house and listened to the sound of an impotent footstomping departure when the door slammed the womans weeping took over and he waited until the sobs trailed off before walking around to the front door when he rang the bell his hands were shaking he looked at the name taped above the buzzerchristine confreyand wondered what the woman with the volatile voice would look like the door swung open and he saw chrissy confrey was a small woman with a face of perfectly mismatched parts high cheekbones broad nose and pointed chin her hair was straight and long and her tears had already dried lloyd winced at her handsomeness and realized he didnt know how to play the interrogation holding out his badge he said lapd i know all about it miss confrey two mexicans with ski masks one softspoken one the guy who tried to molest you the white guy you were tell christine confrey tried to push the door shut lloyd jammed his foot into the floor runner and wedged himself into the house shouldering the door and christine behind it aside putting his hands up in a no harm pose i know what youve been through he said and i dont want you to talk about it all i want you to do is look at some photographs will you do that christine hissed get out lloyd stepped toward her you can give your statement to a woman officer and ill try to keep your relationship with eggers out of it this is the second one of these assaults and i want you to look at some photos that the other victims probably didnt see it wont take long her face a hardening mask of hatred christine said have john eggers look at your pictures this is his mess not mine im going to lloyd said but i need you too victims tend to block out the looks of their assailants and quick crosscheck ids can be very helpful i know you got a good look at the man christines face mask stiffened to the point where lloyd thought her features would crack youre the assailant peeping at windows get out lloyd leaned against the door and wondered what to do watching christine confrey hold her ground in front of him her feet dug like a frightened animal poised to attack strategies to cajole retreat and press were roiling up in his brain then blanking out as the violated woman held eye contact finally she did attack rearing back her head and spitting lloyd wiped the wad of mucus from his shirt front and returned with an icevoiced salvo your way huh okay lets try this unless we get these scumbags this is going to happen over and over again your feelings and eggerss job and marriage dont count so youre going to look at mug shots of your sexy savior i know hes a handsome fellow with his groovy beard and all th lloyd stopped when christines face registered befuddlement a light flicked on in his head the beard and mustache that hawley and eggers had described was a fakeone reason why hawley hadnt been able to id any of the mugs he viewed assuming it was only a threeman team the white partner had probably called the mexicans to inform them of his success with eggers and had gotten either a no answer or word of the impending molestation from the softspoken man panicking the white robber had driven to the hostage pad and had entered without his disguise still staring at christine lloyd said get dressed im taking you into custody as a material witness christine confrey broke the stare by spitting at lloyds feet then walking toward the back of the house when she returned to the living room five minutes later she was wearing light makeup and a fresh skirt and blouse as she locked the door she said dont touch me they drove in silence to the van nuys station christine chainsmoking and staring out the window lloyd steering the cruiser in a circuitous route to give himself time to think one train of thought dominated since the lapd and fbi both kept their mug shots crossfiled according to mo and physical stats robert hawley was probably only shown photographs of convicted armed robbers and men matching his beard and mustache description both eggers and confrey would have to view the entire white male age file at parker center but he now had less than two hours before he was to meet kapek and if chrissy confrey was to be tapped for maximum info during that time he would have to shove mugs at her while the white robbers face was still fresh in her mind and let kapek and the feds worry about her statement and known associates thrilled with a solid lead all his own lloyd pulled into the station lot christine got out of the car without being directed and walked ahead of him through the stations front doors eyes downcast lloyd caught up with her and pointed her into the detectives squad room a plainclothes cop approached with a quizzical look lloyd said please have a seat miss confrey then whispered to the plainclothesman hopkins robbery homicide the woman is an eyeball witness i want to show her some mug books white males with nonviolent felony convictions its a hunch im playing can you do that for me the cop nodded and walked into the records booth adjoining the squad room lloyd saw that christine had sat down in the assistant squad commanders chair and was helping herself to his cigarettes he checked his watch rankling that he had to have her out before kapek arrivedkowtowing to a punk gman ten years his junior when the whole thing started to rankle he walked over and said are you going to cooperate christine blew smoke rings at him of course officer the plainclothes cop came back with a stack of looseleaf binders and placed them on the desk in front of christine lloyd opened the top one and saw that the books displayed one man per page with one closeup head shot one fullbody frontal and one fullbody side shot below the blackandwhite photos the mans name date of birth arrest date and charge were typed along with a fivedigit file number lloyd took a pencil from his pocket and poised it over the first sheet of mugs study the pictures carefully he said if you positively identify the man tell me ill be studying you and marking the ones you react to so if you dont make an id we can work up a composite from similarlooking men christine put out her cigarette and lit another i only saw him for a second and i only said he was sexy to hurt john i realize that just look at the pictures carefully and the papers and tv wont find out about john and me lloyd smiled and lied through his teeth thats right for an hour christine smoked and looked at snapshots of white male felons lloyd sat beside her reading her face for flashes of recognition twice she said sort of but not him three more times she held the binder up and gave it an extra close scrutiny then shook her head lloyd marked the pages that drew her strongest reactions and when christine was finished with the last mug book he wrote down the names and file numbers of the felons and went to the records booth to check their files on the offchance that there might be some sort of connection to perk his mental juices he gave the five files cursory readthroughs looking for the felons current dispositions known associates and brothers with criminal records learning that george james turney had been stabbed to death in a san quentin race war six months previous and had two older brothers in their forties that thomas lemuel tucker was on federal parole in alaska and an orphan that alexander ramo ramondelli had a sister and was dying of cancer at vacaville prison hospital that duane richard rice was an only child and was serving a year in the county jail for grand theft auto that paul prescott orchard had a mentally retarded younger brother and was a state parole absconder the known associates were complete washoutsno familiar names no sparks it was time to write up a report to mollify kapek goose the media chase snitch feedback and let the feds run with the ball lloyd put the file numbers in a note to the squad lieutenant supervising the issler assault telling him to have a police artist utilize them with the assistance of a new eyeball witness the feds had after dropping the memo off with the desk officer he walked back to christine and said lets go ill drive you home they were walking out the door when lloyd saw peter kapek striding up the steps toward them he checked his watch the junior gman had outfoxed him with an early arrival kapek looked at christine suspiciously suddenly lloyd felt sad for the bank managers mistress when kapek started to fume silently for an explanation lloyd pulled him out of christines earshot i had to move fast or lose her call me at home and ill tell you about it if you dont like it go fuck yourself and get me detached shes your witness but be good to her kapeks fuming rendered him beet red lloyd nodded to christine then walked back into the station the desk officer handed him a piece of paper just got the call from the switchboard at parker center they didnt say who its from sounds like a snitch to me lloyd looked at the message it said luis calderon dealing armys reliable infocall me for details the restaurant was cool and dark the mexican music soft and harmless the wraparound booth big and cushionya good private place to talk crime plans sipping iced tea and waiting for the garcias duane rice felt his twentyfour hours of nonstop movement lose its frenzied edge it was all going to happen what hed done since splitting stan kleins place proved he could do anything after trashing the pad for info on the video shoot vandy and klein were on and getting zilch he knew it was either tend to business or go gonzo so hed driven by the picowestholme bank and memorized the floor plan then cruised the side streets surrounding it for getaway vehicles around the corner on graystone he noticed an chevy caprice parked in the driveway of a house whose screen door was spilling over with rubberbandwrapped newspapers hed walked up and checked the name on the mailboxlathamthen waited for the paper boy and handed him a spiel about being a friend of the lathams and by the way when were they getting back the kid said next friday bingo one vehicle down one to go then it was think or go gonzo and he forced himself to remember small details all the way back to his kickout from the slam it took half an hour of brainfrying concentration but finally he got it at the burger king down the street from the bowl motel there was a fat slob security guard who bragged to the customers about his sixteenhour shifts and all the money he was making and how he was spending most of it on his malibu with a and a b ampm hydrostick it was never in the lot but it had to be parked nearby after a final recon of the picowestholme area he drove up to hollywood and found the malibu parked on de longpre a half block from the burger king two vehicles downonly the keys to go he drove to an art supply store and bought a large piece of molding wax then cruised by the repo lot on south western it was closed up at nine oclock and there was no nightwatchman a simple chisel pry and he was inside the salesmans hut there was an oversupply of master keys for all latemodel chevys so he forgot about making wax impressions and glommed the keys outright the two getaway vehicles were as good as his next he called rhonda catching her on her way out the door to her weekend at the springs she told him she didnt know where the video shoot that vandy and klein were on was and that she didnt know whether vandy performed in any of kleins xrated videos she said she would talk to people in the springs and leave a message if she got any hard info she mentioned money several times and he promised to call silver foxes monday night to set up a meet then came the tough partmanipulate the garcia brothers both of them for the picowestholme heist joe for a watchdog the heaviest gaming would be groveling to bobby even though it was the right thing to do it felt all wrong and he was relieved when he called and got no answer which left him at midnight with nothing to do and no one to do it with and nowhere near sleep the holiday inn was now total skunk city so he moved back to the same room at the bowl motel where the same grease spots and lines of dust greeted him but did not ease him into sleep since he now had to stay awake to talk to joe garcia it was either move or go gonzo so he moved driving the trans am like a meek old man going a weird kind of gonzo where the superior type english he knew from police reports filled his head with thoughts he didnt want to say or even think out loud unlike stan klein gordon meyers is not a known associate in the course of his career as module night jailer he incurred only mild resentment from the thousands of inmates he supervised all of whom were mentally disturbed misdemeanants incapable of perpetrating armed robbery and murder said unknown perpetrators were obviously seasoned bank robbers most likely san quentin or folsom parolees institutionalized and subconsciously desirous of committing felony acts in hopes of receiving tentolife habitual offender sentences the parole officercopshrink rap kept eating at him finally he started thinking of vandy to hold it down he thought of known associate stan klein whom he couldnt touch and got very calm even cocky deciding to check out stan mans new scam he started asking night clerks at adult motels if they had any good fuck music the first three clerks took his ten spot and said no the fourth said yes and offered him a special short timer rate for private listening steeling himself he accepted the offer the six cassettes stacked atop the vcr in front of the sweatstained bed all bore the stan man name and po box he loaded them into the machine and turned off the lights tremors and a flash thought hit him along with the stan man logo he didnt want it to be vandy but if it was vandy he wouldnt be so godawful alone cursing himself he turned up the volume and watched the show a disco beat then a haggard woman was gobbling a donkeysized dick while donna summer belted she works hard for the money fadeout logo then rhonda the fox was taking on four guys at once the beach boys wailing for her to help them blank frames blurred logo this land is your land on the sound track mondale and ferraro doing a handshaking tour on the screen intercut with a girl in a red white and blue negligee giving head to a jig in an uncle sam costume no vandy if you fuck whores then all women start looking like whores if you love a woman then all women start looking like her rice kicked over the vcr and ran out of the room and across sunset to a phone booth he dialed the garcias number joe answered on the first ring all he got out was hello before duane the brain took over in force you want to come to new york get away from your batshit brother and work a real musician gig you and bobby want twothirds of a hundred k foolproof in and out on monday

garcia sliding into the booth his right hand held out he shook it glad that the restaurant was dark so the greasy piece of sharkshit couldnt read the contempt on his face thinking ice city he said

eat for sixtynine clams rice felt a tide of slime wash over him then joe garcia was there saying duane hows it hanging rice said long and strong and squinted across the booth to get a handle on how the tagalong was holding up not bad he decided scared but probably cash flushed and more scared of continuing a crime career with sharkshit bobby a born follower about to trade leaders the waitress returned the brothers ordered carta blanca rice another iced tea when she brought the drinks the three partners fell silent then rice looked straight at the garcias knowing theyd go for the plan

hand jailhouse style rice held it down in a squarejohn shake that lowrider shit is dead you pull that stuff in new york and theyll laugh you out of town lloyd pulled up to the back entrance of the west la federal building and honked his horn peter kapek walked over to the car and got in expecting a rebuke for the confrey approach lloyd was stunned when the junior gman said good work on the girlfriend i got a good statement out of her no positive id on the white man but confrey and eggers worked up a composite with an lapd artist itll be distributed all points by tomorrow morning where are we going and by the way you look like shit lloyd nosed the matador out onto wilshire didnt you get the complete message were going to brace a suspected gun dealer luis miguel calderon aka likable louie male mexican age thirtynine two convictions for receiving stolen goods former youth gang member mellowed out into smalltime businessman hes got an auto parts shop in silverlake my old neighborhood a snitch i trust says hes dealing armyissues and i look like shit because ive been doing police work all night kapek laughed i like it learn anything lloyd shook his head not really i canvassed the security pacific area and confreys neighborhood brawley from van nuys dicks couldnt spare any men i got a big zerono suspicious people or vehicles i read every report on hawleys and isslers associates eight timesnothing bit me then i called a couple of media people and gave them the whole ball of wax it goes to press and on the air monday night giving us exactly fortyeight hours to figure out a strategy whats the matter gman youre not doing your famous slow burn kapek toyed with the knobs of the twoway radio dont call me gman it turns me on i didnt rat you off on confrey because i heard these homicide guys at parker center talking about you with awe and i actually started to like you a little bit also i got a good statement from confrey the rape guy turned out not to be a rapeo more like a psycho muff diver he did this rebop about being a shark then went down on chrissys bush ive computerfed the info nationwidenothingand ive put it in a memo for lapd roll callsmaybe well get a bite a shark bite very fucking amusing we need a hard lead hopkins this thing is covered from every paper angle our eyeball witnesses have checked every local and federal mug bookzero the men checking out the victims associates have got nothing and ive got an agent going over hawleys and eggerss credit card slips with themyou know all the places they rendezvoused with the girlfriends have got to be checked out if nothing breaks by monday im planting people in the offices where issler and confrey work lloyd nodded and said ive been kicking around an idea that might account for a connection between hawley and eggers and explain why the robbers have escalated their mo im thinking both these guys might be pilfering travelers checksat least hawley heres the reconstruction while theyre casing the b of a the robbers see hawley stealing the green travelers checks which from a distance look like cash they think that money is left overnight in the tellers boxes kapek interrupted hawley said the inside man wanted the bank checksthat he asked for them by name lloyd shook his head thats hawley the pilferer covering his ass obscuring the robbers reasons for hitting his bank heres my reasoning the robbers have either seen eggers pilfering similarly or they figured and this isnt likely given their intelligence that all banks leave loose cash out overnight so after the low score on the travelers checks they figure that eggers is just another check stealer say to themselves fuck that and decide to make eggers go for the vault you like it grinning kapek said it floats but what do we do about it have your bank fraud division people give you a crash course in check ripoff scams maybe they can tell us something we can use to squeeze hawley and eggers ive got a hunch on this i think that if these guys are pilferers its out of desperationcash flow problems that they cant talk about and that makes me think vicegambling dope sex sex the least likely because theyve got the outside stuff going im going to initiate inquiries with every vice squad in the valleymaybe our boys are heavy in hock to bookies or loan sharks or theyre into kinky shit we dont know about if we get a bunch of vice dicks to pump their informants we might get something kapek elbowed lloyd and said i like it theres nothing on the travelers checks by the way but on the cash flow problems im going to peruse our boys bank accounts see what i get lloyd took the words in silently and as the old neighborhood drew closer thought of his family you didnt rag me on the media goose he said come monday night a lot of innocent people are going to be hurting i figured a sensitive guy like you would be pissed kapek flushed it was the right thing i would have waited a day or so then done it im doing the family interviews though and discreetly were almost there gman any thoughts on this interview no you yeah lets test likable louies fuse lloyd pulled to the curb then pointed to the white adobe building that housed louies onestop pit stop no violence kapek said no violence then i like it they walked across the street and through the wideopen front door of the garage into a small room filled with stacks of retread tires a chicano youth popping a pimple at a wall mirror gave them the fisheye and lloyd said wheres louie the youth gouged the zit a last time and reached for an intercom set mounted on the connecting door lloyd said dont do that and motioned for kapek to walk ahead of him the kid shrugged and kapek pushed through the door lloyd was right behind him tingling at the thought of a razzledazzle interrogation the garage proper was huge with pneumatic grease racks sliding drawers full of auto parts and a large drivein space leading to a back entrance and work area lloyd and kapek walked slowly catching copwise squints from the mechanics working beneath the racks a heavyset man glanced at them and lloyd recognized him from his r ampi snapshot luis calderon he walked over and smiled revealing buck teeth and a fortune in dental gold good afternoon officers looking for me lloyd flashed his badge hopkins lapd this is special agent kapek fbi wed like to talk to you calderon sighed have i got a choice lloyd sighed back yeah you do here or rampart station ive already seen it calderon said lets go out back and get some air catching an edge in his voice lloyd said no your office calderon sighed again and started walking toward the garages street entrance lloyd tapped him on the shoulder no louie your real office where youve got your desk and your files and your invoices louie turned around and walked over to and up a flight of wooden stairs next to the tool bin lloyd let kapek get between them knowing the mechanichoods reaction to a fed roust was out of kilter when calderon opened the office door he squeezed in ahead of him and quickly sized up the room sootstained walls papercluttered desk refrigerator and a playboy playmate tacked to the wall probably hiding a safe two phones on the desk one red one black a clipboard holding notebook paper leaning against the red one nothing incriminating at first glance calderon opened the refrigerator and took out a coors then sat down behind his desk popping the can he said topped out my parole topped out my probation pay my taxes and dont associate with no criminal types my only vice is brew im a righteous sudser if outfits were legal id geez the shit im a sudsguzzling motherfucker i pour the shit on my rice krispies in the morning and sometimes i even shave with it i give my dog a brew chaser with his alpo if i was a fag id squirt the shit up my ass i am a righteous beerhound motherfucker so how come youre coming on like storm troopers when all the rampart cops know likable louie likes to cooperate lloyd breathed the spiel in savoring the tension that fueled it he looked over at kapek who was chuckling with genuine amusement and said i dont work out of rampart and i didnt come here to catch your richard pryor shtick i could roust your workers for green cards and get myself a bonaroo immigration bust and id love to run the numbers on your engine blocks a third time receiving conviction is a nickel minimum state time louie and what you get up the ass there aint coors louie calderon sipped beer lloyd saw that his first salvo was on target but not a wounder sensing that kapek was being quiet out of real respect he bored in you snitching for rampart dicks louie calderon smiled lloyd could almost feel the fat mans blood pressure chill out as he said its well known that likable louie likes to cooperate lloyd twisted a wooden chair around and sat down in it facing calderon smiling and hooking a thumb over his back at kapek he said louie that man over there is an fbi criminal division agent why havent you asked me about him because unless he wants a boss transmission overhaul i dont care if he stays lays prays or strays how come youve got two phones different colors the black phones for business the red phones my hot line to the white house ronnie calls me up sometimes we chase pussy together whos your connection at rampart dicks whos your tailor your suit sucks the black phone rang calderon picked it up and spoke into it in spanish lloyd raised his eyebrows at kapek the fbi man said not a word shaking his head lloyd watched likable louie talk a blue streak then hang up and say okay lets see if i can scope this out you need a favor and someone at rampart said i could help you came on strong to test me to see if i could be trusted im tired of playing games what do you need lloyd was reaching for his most disarming smile when the red phone rang louie picked up the receiver and said yes then nodded and wrote on the clipboard lloyd squinted and saw that the top sheet of paper was half covered with pencil scrawl calderon said yes a final time and hung up lloyd looked at the veins in his neck and saw the signs of a slamming heart whos your connection at rampart dicks louies voice was hoarse lloyd could tell that he was getting genuinely befuddled why you keep asking me that man lloyds third volley began with his most evil shitkicker glare i grew up in silverlake i was in the dogtown flats back when you were in the alpines my parents still live over on griffith park and st elmo so i like things safe around here rampart does a pretty good job of keeping the peace because theyve got snitches like you to rat off the bad dudes that everybody hates you get to hire wetbacks and turn over some stolen parts and my mom and dad go to sleep safe at night right louie rrrright louie stammered lloyd stood up and pulled a automatic from his shoulder holster holding it in front of louie calderons trembling face he said theres these three guys perving on women and taking out banks and maybe they got their pieces from you heres the pitch if you turned the pieces youve got twentyfour hours to give me the names if you didnt youve got fortyeight hours to find out who did and who he sold them to if i dont hear from you in fortyeight one way or the other i go to the commander of rampart dicks and snitch you off to him as the kingpin motherfucking gun dealer of la county he dropped his robberyhomicide business card on the desk and reholstered the gun be cool homeboy back at the car kapek looked at lloyd and said jesus fucking christ lloyd unlocked the door and got in meaning calderon kapek took the passenger seat no you how much of that was bluff everything but my threat calderon had that selfsatisfied look and he had a shitload of wetbacks working for him and he didnt want us to see his office my guess is that hes snitching dope dealers to the rampart narks in exchange for immunity on the illegals i know the squad commander at ramparthell let minor shit slide for good information but hes death on violent crime if he finds out louies dealing guns louies ass is fucking grass but is he our gun dealer i dont know the important thing is that hes scared hes between lieutenant buddy bad ass bagdessarian and me on one side the robbers and getting a rat jacket on the other weve got to put a twentyfour tail on himyour menhes too hip to local cops hes an old homeboy a criminal with contacts and he may damn well not be our gun dealer but be able to put the finger on him or he may snitch off the robbers straight out to save his ass with buddy either way were set how soon can you implement the surveillance as soon as you drop me off at central office what are you going to do lloyd hit the ignition and gunned the car out onto tomahawk street read all the paperwork again then write up my ideas for brawley at van nuys dicks then im going to visit an old pal of mine hes a superior court judge and hes senile and a rightwing loony he gets his rocks off issuing searchandseizure warrants i buy him a case of scotch every christmas and he signs whatever i ask him for right before louies fortyeight are up im going in his front door with a gauge and due process to seize every scrap of paper hes got you like it kapek was pale his voice was shaky jesus fucking christ you said that before one other thing im almost positive that the reason calderon didnt want us in his office is the red phone hes either taking bets or running a bootleg message service whats that a twoway answering service mostly its used by parole absconders and their families he had a clipboard with writing on it next to the phonemessages for sure calderons house is right next to the garage and hes probably got someone there monitoring an extension all the time sometimes those numbers are legit ma bell handouts sometimes illegal hookups that cant be traced i want a tap on all calderons lines that requires a federal warrant your side of the street can you swing it kapeks color was returning but a thin layer of sweat was creeping over his forehead he wiped it off with his sleeve and said monday at the earliest federal judges all go incommunicado on the weekends to avoid warrant hassles you really want these guys dont you lloyd smiled im probably getting stresspensioned soon against my will i intend to go out in true hotdog fashion he pulled up in front of the downtown fbi building and kapek got out highballing it to parker center the junior gmans pale face stayed fixed in his mind and he knew he had taken over the investigation with twentyeight sleepless hours behind him lloyd pushed his investigation for another twentyfour flat out at parker center he checked the monicker file for every nickname variation of shark coming away with a large assortment of data pertaining to black youth gangs useless trivia an r ampi check of male mexican registered sex offenders with a cunnilingus mo yielded seven names but three of the men were currently in prison and the other four were in their fiftiesway above sally isslers and christine confreys late twenties early thirties appraisal the only remaining option was to add the shark and oral sex abuse facts to the roll call reports and distribute the word to all lapd informants peter kapek called in the early evening louie calderon was under constant rolling surveillance the agents would be keeping a detailed log on his movements and would be running vehicle and address checks on all persons he came into contact with a team of agents was going over his record for possible armed robbery connections the likable louie angle was covered as were continuing probes into the recent pasts of robert hawley sally issler john eggers and christine confrey come monday channel eyewitness news would leak its cautionary report on the bank robberyextortion gang without mention of the sex assault facts this would leave the families of the male victims open for interrogation on the investigations big question how did the robbers get the information on the two extramarital affairs at home late that night lloyd phoned in the vice squad query he had mentioned to kapek then read the existing files and applied his thinking solely to that question he came up with four logical answers through connection to the victims families through connections to the victims friends and acquaintances through connections at the two banks through the random factor overheard conversations at meeting places such as bars restaurants and other public gathering spots and through informational sources that the four suspects have either consciously or unconsciously refused to reveal knowing that the fourth answer was the most likely lloyd read through the case file two more times then wrote out a memorandum stating his conclusions hrs to sa peter kapek det lieut s brawley re hawleyisslereggersconfrey investigation gentlemen having participated in every aspect of this investigation and having read the case file a dozen times i have come to one conclusion concerning the robbery gangs access to information on the four victims one supported by sound suppositions based on existing facts we know that robert hawley and john eggers both middleaged bank managers are as yet not connected to each other in any discernible personal or professional way exhaustive record searches have turned up no common denominators other than identical professions longterm marriages that appear to be flourishing despite the fact that both men are engaged in extramarital affairs the said extramarital affairs themselves both involving women in their late twenties the same absence of connections exists between the two women involved all our victims live and work in the san fernando valley yet interrogations and crosschecks of credit card records show that these two sets of clandestine lovers have not even dined in the same restaurants or drunk in the same bars as each other at any time in the course of their affairs the odds of a criminal gang divining the existence of two such potentially lucrative and jeopardyprone liaisons separately is preposterous i think there is a viable hawleyisslereggersconfrey link one that the four principals are either willfully or subconsciously suppressing i believe all four principals should be induced to undergo rigorous polygraph tests and should that fail to reveal the link pentothal andor hypnosis questioningradical investigatory measures that i think are justified in this case also since the basic facts of this series of crimes will be aired and published by the media late tomorrow released by me in the interest of a public safety precaution i deem it advisable that the four principals be taken into custody and held without media access on monday morning in order to avoid repercussions deriving from familial reaction to exposure of the two affairs i undertook the media release on my own authority realizing the full implications both my newspaper and television contacts told me they would include a plea for information along with their coverage and pass said information along to us immediately respectfully lloyd w hopkins robberyhomicide division finishing lloyd looked out his kitchen window and saw that it was dawn feeling the family angle gouging at him he walked through the downstairs of the house that he once shared with four women the four rooms he had apportioned himself in their absence every step made him both more exhausted and more aware of the need to work finally he gave in to the need and slumped into the big leather chair where he used to sit with penny no thoughts came and neither did sleep staring at the telephone hoping it would ring supplied one minor brainstorm louie calderons phone number or numbers lloyd called the top supervisor at bell and gave his name and badge number then feverishly asked his question the woman came back with a sadly unfeverish answer louis calderon of tomahawk st la had one house and one business phonewith the same number the red phone was total bootleg more numbing sleeplessness followed temporarily interrupted by a call from peter kapek the first surveillance shift had just reported that louie calderon had left his pad only once at am he walked to the corner and bought a case of beer beerguzzling motherfucker kapek said promising to call with the next shifts report lloyd shaved showered and forced himself to eat a packet of cold luncheon meat chased with a pint of milk and a handful of vitamins still unable to sleep he checked the mailbox for the previous days mail there were three bills and a postcard from penny fishermans wharf on the front her perfect script on the back daddyhang in rogers dog peed on moms beloved carpet rog refused to pay for the cleaning moms response your father despite his many faults was housebroken and never cheap hang in daddy love love lovepenguin now lloyds shot at blissful unconsciousness was broken up by an injection of hope feeling a second mental wind coming on he dialed the home number of judge wilson d penzler prepared to listen to a long rightwing rhapsody before making his warrant request the judges housekeeper answered and said that his honor was in lake tahoe and would be returning home and to the bench on wednesday lloyd hung up then picked up the receiver to call buddy bagdessarian at rampart dicks and blow the whistle on louie calderon his finger was descending on the first digit when caution struck no buddy would blow the plan by going straight for louies throat better to give the beer guzzler some slack daylight came and went lloyd remained fitfully awake swinging on a brain tether of sharks old neighborhood homeboycrooks and his family he was debating whether to turn on the lights or sit in darkness when the phone rang all he got out was speak before kapek came on the line third shift just radioed the beerhound his wife and rug rats just took off theyre following cautiously i also grabbed calderons jail jacket the kas are being checked out what have you been doing lloyd tingled as the idea took hold thinking gotta run peter ill call you tomorrow he hung up and grabbed his burglar tools from the kitchen then ran for his lapd burglar mobile likable louies onestop pit stop and the builton adobe house were dark and silent as lloyd parked on the opposite side of tomahawk street and got up his b ampe guts pulling on surgical rubber gloves he brought his previous visit to the garage to mind and thought of access routes the house was probably too well secured the street door too exposed there was only the back way in lloyd checked the contents of his burlap burglar bag and pulled out a batteryoperated drill and an assortment of bits a set of lock picks a jimmy a can of mace for watchdog debilitation and a large fivecell flashlight he dug in the backseat and found an old briefcase left by another officer stuck his tools inside it then walked down the alley that cut diagonally across tomahawk street a full moon allowed him a good view of the back entrance and music blasting from adjoining houses took care of any noise he might make lloyd looked at the barbedwire fence encircling the work area and resigned himself to getting cut he looked at the pulleyoperated steel door and knew it was the window next to it or nothing taking a deep breath he tossed the briefcase over the fence and hoisted himself up the links his right hand ached from his frisco bookcase smashing and he had to favor it all the way to the top when he reached the barbed wire he rolled into it letting his jacket take the clawing until the last possible second then hooking the strands with his index fingers gouging his legs until he was free of sharp metal and there was nothing left but a twelvefoot drop then he pushed himself off with all his weight landing feet first on a patch of oil slick blacktop no dog no sounds of approach lloyd picked up the briefcase and took the flashlight from it then walked to the window and compared its circumference to his own bulk deciding it would be a tight but makable squeeze he smashed in the glass with the end of the flashlight and tossed in the briefcase then he elbowed himself through the hole his jacket again taking the brunt of the damage his legs getting another brief tearing coming down hands first into the garage the smell of gas and motor oil assaulted him still no dog still nothing to indicate he had been spotted lloyd got to his feet and picked up the flashlight and briefcase then took his bearings as his eyes got used to the darkness he picked out the stairway leading up to louie calderons private office lloyd tiptoed over and up the stairs then tried the door it was unlocked he deepbreathed and pushed it open then flicked on the flashlight and shined it in the direction of the desk the beam illuminated the red phone and clipboard deadon he walked to the desk memorizing the exact positions of the invoices and beer cans on top of it then took a pen and notepad from his back pocket and sat down in louie calderons chair holding the flashlight in his left hand he pushed aside a halffinished coors and put down the pad in its place centering the beam right on top of the clipboard the office around it went totally dark and he did his transcribing in a tunnel of eyegrating light amramon vcall mom amp bro before you talk to po pmduanerhonda talked to friends in ps stan klein returning monday night late remember to call mon niteh wwants pmdanny ccall home pmjulio mcall home pmgeorge vcall louise call po no violation completing the copyover lloyd put the pad back in his pocket and returned the beer can to its proper place pleased that it was a bootleg service rather than a bookie drop he turned his flashlight toward the floor and retraced his steps downstairs grabbing a box of baby moon hubcaps on his way to the front door hoping to put the onus on punks out for a quick score driving home he got his usual postburglary shakes followed by his usual postb ampe knowledge crime was a thrill in his kitchen lloyd copied over the transcribed names and phone numbers for checking against louie calderons ka file then called up the three numbers he had gleaned the first one was a sad nonconnection pretending to be a friend of ramon lloyd asked his mother about his whereabouts learning that he had been cut loose from chino on friday and hadnt as yet contacted his parole officer or family the woman was terrified that he was back in silverlake and on smack the two numbers for rhonda were even sadderboth recorded messages that boomed prostitution loud and clear hi this is rhonda if youve called for my business and your pleasure or the converse leave a message bye this is silver foxes beautiful women of every persuasion for every occasion please leave your name customer number and wishes at the tone lloyd put down the phone then added the information to his ka checkout list the singsong lilt of the last message stayed with him as he turned out the lights and flopped down on the couch while he waited for the sleep that he knew had to come he toyed with the words an exhaustion gibberish crept over him he knew what was behind it the occasions of his persuasion were over the finality of the thought helped and unconsciousness was just about there when he grabbed at an escape hatch an apocalypse could save him the thought was too scary to toy with lloyd slammed the hatch shut with every ounce of his will and slept dreamlessly clockwork rice looked at his watch as he nosed the malibu into the shade of a stand of trees by the freeway offramp at hed glommed the car at hed picked up the brothers who were outfitted for bear and looking greedy at he stopped at a on the edge of hollywood for a lastminute acquisitiona brainstormand now at there was nothing left but to do it he glanced at bobby and joe as he set the brake their suits fit and their offcolor facial hair made them look almost nonmexican their briefcases were big and scuffed it was all running perfect now he said they walked the half block to the corner of pico and westholme and waited for the light when it turned green rice took the lead striding ahead of the brothers in front of the bank he peered through the window and framed the scene inside six tellers stations on the left ropedoff waiting line with no one standing in it the execs at their desks in the carpeted area on the right no armed guards no sign of gordon meyers the surveillance camera sweeping on its tripod above the doors perfection the brothers caught up and rice let them go through the doors first when they were halfway to the teller area he took a can of shaving cream from his jacket pocket shook it and fired a test spritz at the ground when it hit the pavement it hit him when you look into his eyes youll know rice pushed the doors open wheeled and extended his right arm at the camera missing his first spray catching the lens oncenter with the second coming off his toes he saw that no one in the desk area had seen him and that joe and bobby were dawdling by a cardboard display near the rear tellers station he reached into his briefcase and pulled out his then let the spray can drop to the floor the man at the front desk looked up at the noise and saw the gun rice shouted robbery everybody be real quiet or youre gonna be real dead for a second everything froze heads darted up behind the tellers counter the garcias pulled out theirs and moved into position their briefcases held open then little gasps and flutters took over and rice saw everything go blackish red swallowing he heard a scream from a woman staring at joe garcias silencered piece oh my gods were bombarding him from every corner of the bank swallowing what tasted like blood he ran to bobby shoved his briefcase at him and said three minutes fill it up bobby flashed his shark grin and leveled his gun at the teller directly in front of him hissing feed the shark motherfucker or you die the man fumbled packets of currency into the briefcase and bobby shoved rices briefcase over to the next station growling you too bitchyou fucking too the woman dumped in whole cash and change drawers and coins spilled over the counter onto the floor when both tellers backed up and showed empty drawers then ducked to their knees bobby slid down to the next station catching a shot of joe out of the corner of his eye little bro had already hit three stations and was holding a shaky bead on the tellers tears and sweat were pouring off his face soaking his phony beard his face was as red as a babys and his lower lip was flapping so hard his whole head shook along with it from somewhere in the bank duane rice was shouting wheres the fucking security boss sounding like a stone loony bobby maneuvered both briefcases and his piece too in front of the last teller going wired when he saw it was a foxy young blonde wheres the guard wheres the fucking security man bobby heard rices shouts then turned to scope out the blonde she had her three drawers open and the money stacked on the counter bobby scooped it into the briefcase closest to him tickling the girls chin with his silencer as he clamped the case shut you like seafood chiquita he said you like a nice juicy shark sausage go fine as wine with a nice blond furburger rice saw the whole bank shake in front of his eyes his voice sounded like it wasnt his and the people cowering at their desks looked like scary red animals he turned around so he wouldnt see them and saw sharkshit bobby talking trash to a young woman teller he was wondering whether to stop it when gordon meyers walked out of a door next to the vault and he knew rice raised his meyers saw him and turned to run rice squeezed off three shots the back of meyerss white shirt exploded into crimson just as he felt the three silencer kicks the dingedout ding jailer crashed into an american flag on a pole and fell with it to the floor the bank became one gigantic blast of noise and through all of it rice heard a womans voice scum scum scum bobby turned around at the blondes final epithet and saw a dead man on the floor and duane rice and his brother gesturing for him to move he turned to give the girl a jaws theme goodbye and caught a wad of spittle square in the face wiping it off he saw her huge open mouth and knew that whatever she said would be the truth he jabbed his at her teeth and fired twice the shots blew off the back of her head bobby saw blood and brains splatter the wall behind her as she was lifted off her feet recoil spun him around and then joe was there grabbing the two briefcases and shoving him toward the doors outside rice was standing on the sidewalk with the third briefcase jamming a fresh clip into his piece when the brothers crashed through the doors all sweat tears and headtotoe tremors he shoved the briefcase at joe and managed to get out go around the corner to the car from somewhere cool inside his own shakes the garcias moved stumblerunning the three packages of money banging against their legs rice was about to follow when a siren came out of deep nowhere and a blackandwhite with cherry lights flashing zoomed down the sidewalk straight at him rice made frantic flagging motions and fell to his knees as if wounded holding the piece inside his right jacket pocket knowing the silencer would cut down his range to close to nothing when the patrol car decelerated and braked he held his ground knowing they had to have seen him when it did a final fishtail he counted to ten got to his feet and pointed his at the windshield the cops inside were less than four feet away and about to come out the doors with shotguns when he squeezed the trigger seven times the gun at chest level the windshield exploded and rice flung himself to the ground and rolled toward the passenger door ejecting the spent clip jamming in another when both doors remained shut he stood up saw two bloodsoaked blue uniforms and gasping faces and fired seven more times all head shots blood and bone shrapnel sprayed his face and in the distance he could hear other sirens screaming suddenly he felt very calm and very much in control he ran through the bank parking lot and down the alley that paralleled graystone drive then vaulted a chain link fence coming down into a cement backyard the driveway led him out to the street and there were joe and bobby standing by the chevy caprice no neighbors no nosy kids no eyeball witnesses rice walked across front lawns to the chevy and unlocked the driversside door then the passengers the brothers got in the back with the briefcases and huddled down without being told rice started the car and backed out then drove slowly down graystone to westholme then across pico to the freeway when they were headed north on the the sudden screech of sirens became deafening the fiftyfoot freeway elevation gave him a perfect view of the bank and the street in front of it it was bumpertobumper cop cars spilling shotguntoting fuzz choppers were starting to fly in from the east it looked like a war zone rice drove cautiously in the middle lane the challenge of holding down panic in an unfamiliar vehicle kept his mind off the past ten minutes moving out of the area the cop noises subsided except for occasional blackandwhites highballing it past in the opposite direction then when he hit wilshire it sounded like choppers and sirens were right there inside the car and he remembered he wasnt alone the coptersiren noise was the combination of joe garcia sobbing and wheezing and bobby trying to talk rice thought of freeway roadblocks and pulled onto the montana avenue exit he turned to look at the brothers and saw that they were still on the floor with their arms around each other so he couldnt tell who was who the sight was obscene and the dried cop blood he felt on his face made it worse coming down onto a peaceful noiseless street he scrubbed his cheeks with his sleeve and said act like fucking human beings and well walk from this bobby untangled himself from his brother and the collection of briefcases rice checked the rearview and saw him lean into the backseat then help joe up when he saw their unglued beards he ripped off his own and sized them up for survival balls joe was twitching and sitting on his hands to control his shaking sharkshit looked like he was two seconds from a giggling fit that would last until his lungs blew knowing they were punk partners at best he said take off your beards and your jackets and shirts were going to ditch the car then go to my motel and chill out bobby you do your shark act and you are one dead greaser bobby winced his voice was low nothing like a giggle i had to duane i knew what that bitch was gonna say and only priests can say that to me he started mumbling in latin then grabbed one of the briefcases off the floor his garbled rosaries were hitting fever pitch as he reached in and pulled out a packet of hundreds and yanked the tab black ink exploded from the wads of bills sharp jets that hit bobby in the face and deflected off his chest to cover the back windows a second series of sprays burst over joe and he threw himself on top of the briefcase and smothered the residual jets with his body rice pulled to the curb and screamed take off your shirts and roll down the windows and bobby wiped ink from his eyes and ripped off his beard and started pawing with it at the window beside him leaning over into the backseat rice threw an awkward right fist at bobbys face a glancing blow that forced him to stop his scrubbing and reflexively flinch away leaving the window handle exposed rice pushed himself toward it and cranked it down just as joe his torso soaked jet black lowered the opposite one hissing the back rice struggled from his suitcoat and ripped off his white shirt he passed them to joe who pushed them into the back window and let them absorb ink until they were saturated when they were useless sopping rags he pulled them away and let the remaining ink soak down into the top of the seat then he stripped to the waist and started pulling off his brothers clothes murmuring easy bobby easy the watchdog is here rice looked at the inkstreaked window and saw that it could pass for a bad smoky tint job he looked at the garcias and knew that the tagalong had bigger balls from the gate were going to hollyweird homeboys he said just three barechested studs out for a ride a half hour later rice stopped in front of an abandoned welfare hotel on cahuenga two blocks from the bowl motel he turned off the engine got out and checked the trunk no spare clothes only a rattylooking sleeping bag he grabbed it then shoved it through the side window at joe garcia who was still babytalking bobby wrap the briefcases up in this and walk your brother down to my pad act like chicano punks on the stroll and you wont get rousted ill take the money and catch up with you he looked at the black film on their chests then walked back to the garage that he hoped to fucking god was still deserted it was rice cleared an entry path kicking away mounds of empty tbird bottles and then walked to the car joe and bobby were standing mutely beside it the sleeping bag rolled erratically at their feet rice said move then backed the car into the garage and closed the rickety door on it returning to the street he started feeling good then he picked up the sleeping bag and two dimes and a penny fell out of the folds and hit the pavement ahead of him he saw the garcias turn into the alley behind the motel he tried to think of vandy and the rescue mission but the chump change on the ground wouldnt let him driving out wilshire to the west la federal building lloyd knew that the street scene was somehow off that something was missing passing the winchells donut joint that the local cops favored it hit him he hadnt seen a blackandwhite since beverly hills and that one was bhpd flipping on his twoway the dispatcher told him why code four code four all patrol units at pico and westholme and bank area not directly involved in crowd control or housetohouse search resume normal patrol code four code four lloyd attached his red light and turned on his siren then hung a uturn and sped to pico and westholme bank flashed them and housetohouse search meant violence when he was two blocks from the scene he passed a string of patrol cars driving slowly north with their headlights on feeling a wave of nausea lloyd floored the gas then decelerated as pico a barricade of sawhorse detour signs and a streetful of nosetonose blackandwhites appeared in his windshield he braked and parked on the sidewalk then ran the remaining block pinning his badge to the front of his suit coat two young officers with shotguns noticed him and stepped over a sawhorse turning the muzzles of the gauges downward when they saw his badge catching their red faces and rubber knees lloyd said what he already knew one of ours the taller of the young cops answered him in a voice trying hard to be detached two of ours two dead inside the bank no suspects in custody it happened fortyfive minutes ago what division are you lloyd pushed the officer aside and stepped over the detour sign then walked around the corner to pico elbowing his way through the most crowded crime scene he had ever witnessed knots of plainclothes cops were huddled together conferring over notepads straining to hear each other above the radio crackle put out by dozens of official vehicles young patrolmen were standing by their units looking fierce scared and about to burst with rage cherry lights were still whirling and the sidewalk was packed with forensic technicians carrying cameras and evidence kits shouted conversations were competing with the radio noise and lloyd picked out bits and pieces and knew it was them guy inside said autos suppressors and this spic was talking dirty to this teller and then just fucking offed her and one woman said one white two mexican another said all white this is the in the distance lloyd could see the top of a forensic arc light reflecting a red shimmer he shoved past a team of paramedics on the sidewalk directly in front of the bank steeling himself when he saw a blackandwhite sitting under the light dried blood covering the back window a technician was standing beside the car dusting a bullet clip another sid man was squatting on the hood his camera up against the shattered windshield snapping pictures lloyd knew that he had to know and walked over the remains of two young men were death frozen in the front seat every inch of their uniform navy blue was now the maroon of congealing blood both bore highcaliber entry wounds on their faces and gaping brainoozing holes where the backs of their heads used to be the driver had his service revolver unholstered on the seat beside him and the other officer had his right hand on the butt of the units remington pump his index finger on the trigger at half pull wiping tears from his eyes lloyd stumbled through the official crime scene rope in front of the banks double glass doors a technician dusting the door handles muttered hey you cant and lloyd grabbed him by the lapels and shoved him toward the sidewalk then covered his hands with his coat sleeves and pushed the doors open inside the bank a cordon of detective division brass saw him then stepped aside casting worried looks among themselves standing on his tiptoes lloyd surveyed the banks interior straining to see something other than the plainclothes officers who were eclipsing almost the entire floor space by craning his neck he could pick out an sid team marking the outline of a womans body behind the tellers counter and another team in front of the counter vacuuming for trace elements a deputy medical examiner was scooping the womans brains off the wall and into a plastic bag and at the back of the bank near the vault peter kapek and a half dozen feds were talking to distraughtlooking people lloyd threaded a path in kapeks direction more snatches of conversation hit him a woman whimpering the tall mexican was so scared and sweetlooking a young cop in uniform telling another the security guy was a real wacko he used to talk this weird shit to me hey thats lloyd hopkinsyou know crazy lloyd hearing his name lloyd swiveled and looked at the officers who turned around and backed into a crowd of plainclothesmen again standing on his tiptoes for sight of kapek he saw the crowd part and create a space a second later two me assistants carrying a sheetcovered stretcher walked through it and when he saw blood seeping through the white cotton he walked over and yanked the sheet off lloyd ignored the stretcher bearers shocked exclamations and stared at the corpse of a middleaged white man his chest and stomach bore three large cavities circumscribed by burned and shredded tissue obvious highvelocity exit wounds shot in the back caliber quality holes them before he could redrape the dead man lloyd felt a hard tap on his shoulder when he turned around captain john mcmanus was standing there legs spread hands on hips his face beet red working toward purple they locked eyes and lloyd knew that backing down was the only way to win he raised his hands and was groping for croweating words when mcmanus stepped forward and breathed in his face you fucking necrophile i told you you werent to involve yourself in any homicide investigations collateral to your liaison assignment or otherwise youre off that assignment as of now this is a double cop killing and i dont want triggerhappy vigilante shitheads like you anywhere near it one word of protest and ill have braverton suspend you you meddle in this case and ill have your badge and file on you for obstruction of justice now go home and wait for my call lloyd shouldered the captain aside and pushed his way out to the sidewalk a tv minicam crew was now inside the barricades interviewing a group of community relations brass someone shouted thats lloyd hopkins get him and suddenly a microphone was in his face he yanked the mike out of the mans hand and hurled it in the direction of the patrol car cradling the wasted bodies of two young men then ran through the crowd to his own official vehicle with no intention of going home too angry to think beyond them lloyd drove to louie calderons place slamming the wheel when he saw federal surveillance vehicles stationed across the street and in the alley near the back service entrance parking down the block by a momandpop market he defused his tension by gripping the wheel until the strain numbed his brain and a semblance of calm hit allowing him to answer his own questions rationally roust calderon probe poke threaten and scare the shit out of him nothe buddy bagdessarianwarrant approach was still best what happened at the bankthis spic was talking dirty to this teller and then just fucking offed her the tall mexican was so scared and sweetlooking why was the man on the stretcher shot in the back did the shark or the white man shoot the two cops the only sane answer was insanity the only strategy for now was to wait for louie calderon to leave then trash his pad from top to bottom the only easy question was whether or not to obey mcmanus no lloyd settled in to wait eyeing the surveillance unit parked a block in front of him one hour two three four no movement except a stream of customers and mechanics leaving the garage at dusk he walked to the market and bought the evening editions of the times and examiner the pico boulevard slaughter headlined both papers and the times featured the complete story of the first two robberies complete with names mention of the girlfriend angle and heavy speculation that the kidnap assaults were tied in to the stickup that had left four dead the names of the two dead officers were omitted and the bank victims were listed as karleen tuggle twentysix and gordon meyers fortyfour a recently retired la county sheriffs deputy and the banks security chief california federal was offering a reward for information leading to the capture of the killerrobbers and the la city council was putting up an additional predictably chief gates announced the biggest manhunt in los angeles history it all brought tears to lloyds eyes he imagined himself squeezing likable louies fat neck until either his brains or three names popped out then he saw calderon walk out the garage door in the flesh and get into a dodge van at curbside when he drove off the fed unit was a nottoosubtle three car lengths behind lloyd started getting his b ampe shakes and eyed the door of the house then the surveillance car from the alley pulled up the driver got out sat down on calderons front steps and lit a cigarette lloyd hit the wheel with his palms sending shock waves up his bad hand kapek hipped by mcmanus to his penchant for burglary was safeguarding the investigation from hotdog action feeling wasted powerless and unaccountably exhausted lloyd drove home to think going through the front door he heard coughing coming from the direction of the living room he drew his pinned himself to the entrance foyer wall and moved down it then hit the overhead light and stepped forward his gun arm extended and braced with his left hand when he saw who was sitting in his favorite leather chair he said jesus christ dont act surprised captain fred gaffaney said you know why im here lloyd reholstered his no i dont address me as sir lloyd studied the witchhunter gaffaney looked colder than his deepfreeze norm drained of everything human what are you doing here captain gaffaney fingered his cross and flag lapel pin and said in the most emotionless voice lloyd had ever heard my son officer steven d gaffaney was shot and killed in the line of duty this morning he was twentytwo i saw his body i saw his brains all over the backseat of his patrol unit and half of his scalp hanging off his head i forced myself to look so i wouldnt back away from coming to you standing motionless in the doorway lloyd saw where gaffaney was going for a microsecond it seemed like salvation then he gasped against the thought and said i swear to you ill find them and if it comes down to me or them ill take them out but youre thinking execution and im no killer gaffaney took a manila folder from his jacket pocket and laid it on the end table beside him yes you are i know a great deal about you in the summer of when you were on loan out to venice vice you befriended a young rookie who had never been with a woman one night you borrowed a drunk wagon from central division and rousted a half dozen venice hookers and brought them to the rookies apartment you made them a variety of offers service the two of you or suffer arrest for needle tracks or outstanding warrants or plain prostitution they agreed to party and you smoked marijuana with them and fucked several of them and the whores went away with a good deal of your money when you started feeling guilty i have sworn depositions from three of those whores hopkins i know youre trying to reconcile with your family think of how theyll feel when the big orange insider runs the depositions on their front page feeling the old shame settle near his heart lloyd said ive made amends to my family and that story is ancient historyjust another cheap notch on my rep its old stuff gaffaney tapped the folder then tapped his lapel pin heres something you were probably too stoned to remember doing after the whores left you and that rookie had a long conversation about duty and courage the young man doubted his own ability to kill in the line of duty and you told him how in the watts riot you had killed an evil fellow national guardsman who had murdered a group of innocent blacks ive checked your old units records your squad leader staff sergeant richard beller was presumed to have been killed in the riot but his body was never found and he was not seen skirmishing with any rioters he was however on scout patrol with you on the night he disappeared that rookie is now a lieutenant in devonshire division hes a bornagain christian and a protege of mine i have a sworn affidavit from him detailing your activities that night in repeating your conversation almost verbatim lieutenant dayton has a brilliant memory whats the matter hopkins youre looking weak transfixed by a nightmare flashback of richard bellers corpse lloyd trembled and tried to speak his tongue and palate and brain refused to connect and he shook even harder so you see the position youre in gaffaney said i despise you but you are the finest detective the department has ever produced and i need you he pointed toward the dining room on your table are copies of the existing reports on the picowestholme homicides i understand the robbery is connected to two others you were working with the feds on so that gives you an edge im throwing all my clout into getting you assigned to the investigation on your own autonomy im sure ill succeed whatever you need from other reports to men for shit work youll getjust call me if you dont comply i can guarantee your crucifixion in the form of a murder indictment lloyd looked at his accuser and saw the faces of richard beller and the hollywood slaughterer superimposed over his mercilessly cold features he tried to speak but his brain was still jelly gaffaney got up and walked past him to the front door when his hand was on the latch he said get them and ill have mercy but they are not to be arrested kill them or bring them to me now it was clockwork in a hurricane staying icy in a heat wave determined to fry them to cinder city at rice gave the garcias another check for survival balls bobby was quiet sitting in a chair by the dresser reading the gideon bible that came with the room joe was hanging drumtight way inside himself alternately staring at the walls and the noninked k on the bed showered and dressed in rices own clothes the tagalong looked like he had the juice to hold the oldies but goodies hed been softly humming for hours supplying him with the guts not to rabbit at for the second time that day rice said now bobby you stay here joe and i are going to pick up my old lady when we get back well split the money and split up sit still and be cool bobby looked up from his bible and made a weird gesture rice figured was catholic joe took his eyes from the stacks of money and the tune he was humming jumped up three octaves rice recognized it as blueberry hill and said come on watchdog lets move they cruised down highland in the trans am then hung a right turn on franklin and headed west toward the mount olympus development joe reached over to flip on the radio and rice touched his hand and said no well buy a paper at the airport when were free and clear right now you dont want to know joe swallowed and returned to his humming rice openly scrutinized him it looked like he was groping for words to go with the music at fairfax rice swung over to the strip and stopped at a stand of pay phones in a texaco parking lot noting a newspaper rack beside the booths he slipped in a quarter and nickel and forced himself to read the front page of the times the headline screamed four killed in west la bank stickup and the subheading read robbery linked to two others rice scanned the paragraphs that detailed their first two kidnapheists complete with the names of the victims and suspect descriptions provided by christine confrey the bitch hed saved from sharkshit bobby words jumped at him largest manhunt in la history stolen car by freeway offramp presumed to be approach vehicle but no fingerprints discovered offered in combined reward money the bombshell was on page two an artists sketch of him also courtesy of chrissy confrey the resemblance was about threequarters accurate and rice balled the paper up then stepped into the booth and called rhonda the foxs home number hello rice breathed out in relief its duane you want to get paid with a little bonus for some extra info have you found her just about were flying to new york in a few days i need the names of some music peoplesolid people no cocaine sleazebags do you know people who know people there after a long moment of silence rhonda said sure but listen im booked straight through until tomorrow night late can you meet me outside silver foxes tomorrow night at twelve no sooner than that i have to ask around and that takes time rice said ill be there and hung up and walked back to the car joe swallowed a burst of song lyrics as he got in and peeled rubber up fairfax toward the hollywood hills when they were just north of franklin he pulled the trans am into a large vacant lot wracking the undercarriage killing the headlights he eased off the gas and let the car glide to a halt behind a long scrub hedge turning off the ignition rice said wait here then got out and waded through the hedge the mount olympus access road was right in front of him and directly across it he could see stan kleins house with no lights on and no porsche in the driveway or on the street returning to the car he unholstered his and put it in the glove compartment pulling out a pushbutton switchblade to replace it in and out watchdog he said youve got one job and one job only dont let me kill him they waited rice sat perfectly still and stared at the access road waiting for lights to show in number joe made music in his head the night cooled and a light drizzle hit the windshield then just after am the lights in the house went on rice nudged joe and handed him the knife then pointed through the windshield at their target joe got out of the car and walked through the hedge rubberkneed his hands in his jacket pockets to kill his tremors rice caught up with him they crossed the blacktop then rice bolted up the steps and rang the buzzer voices echoed within the house rice heard vandys and knew from the tone that she was tired and cranky joe stood beside him his eyes wide and panicky then the door was thrown open and stan klein was standing there flashing a shiteating grin betrayed by tics around his temples disco duane and friend he said when you get out rice sized klein up red nose from too much coke useless muscles from too much iron pumping bullshit dope bravado fueling him for the confrontation stan man shrugged then faked a sigh i dont think she wants to see you man voice steady rice said she doesnt know what she wants go get her klein sniffed back a noseful of mucus and pointed at joe whos this tonto the strong silent sidekick whats shakin kemo sabe through the halfopen door rice saw the stick skinny legs walking down a wroughtiron staircase he moved straight toward the sight pushing klein backward joe was right behind him sliding past klein just as he muttered hey you cant her rice saw vandy at the foot of the staircase wearing a pink crewneck and kelly green cords she looked emaciated but her face was pure waiflike beauty her voice was just a shadow of her old vibrato growl i dont want to go with you duane rice stood still afraid to move or say the wrong thing joe trembled with his hands in his pockets stan klein walked over to an end table by the staircase and scooped up a mound of coke with a singleedged razor blade squatting he snorted it then laughed you heard the lady she doesnt want to go with you prepared to see red and hold it down rice moved his eyes back and forth from vandy to klein and smelled the bank before it all went haywire vandy nibbling her cuticles klein doing another snootful of coke vandy looking like the wasted little girls in concentration camp pictures then joe garcias scared rabbit squeak duane hes got a gun klein was standing by a row of pacman machines near the living room entranceway licking coke off his fingers and leveling a small automatic at rice come here annie he said vandy walked to klein in jerky littlegirl steps he threw his left arm around her and nuzzled her cheek without relinquishing his bead on rice keeping one eye on joe he said you were fucking comic relief for the whole crowd everybody used you if you werent such a boss car thief we would have laughed you out of la the biggest laugh was you making contacts to boost annies career gonna make her a milliondollar rock video star dig this on your way to the door with pancho im gonna make annie a rock vid star shes gonna be the queen of porn vid first then move up im producing a flick with her and this guy i gotta pay by

nostrils and made his eyes burn you ratted me off on my gta bust motherfucker klein bit at vandys ear then looked directly at rice and said no duaneyboy i didnt annie did she got busted for prostitution and talked her way out of a drug rehab by snitching you off romantic huh now the red rice made a slow deliberate beeline toward the woman he loved and her destroyer vandy screamed klein squeezed the trigger the gun jammed and he pulled back the slide and ejected the chambered round then slid in another and fired the shot went wide tearing into the wall by the staircase rice kept walking joe pinned himself to the pacman machine farthest from klein and stared at the man he was supposed to watchdog who just kept walking klein fired again the shot hit the wall directly above rices head he kept walking and was within pointblank range of his objective when klein put the gun to vandys head took a step backward with her and muttered no no no no no rice halted joe fed himself a bombburst of music pulled the switchblade from his pocket and jumped knife first pushing the button just as klein wheeled and aimed at him the pistol jammed vandy dropped to the floor joe caught klein flush in the stomach and ripped upward with both hands blood spurted from his mouth and rice reached for the gun joe saw him aim it at vandy and the dying man and knew he was fixing to blow away the whole fucking world he got to his feet and grabbed a portable tv from the top of the pacman beside him he swung it forward and rice turned and stepped into the blow catching the plastic and glass missile headon he crumpled across stan kleins body and joe and vandy ran only repeated readings of the picowestholme homicide files kept his mind off watts in the summer of and even then the facts that were being imprinted in his mind stuck as selfaccusation rather than indicators pointing to them karleen tuggle gordon meyers officer steven gaffaney and officer paul loweth were killed by gunshots the two patrolmen and meyers by rounds fired from the same gun tuggle by shots from a different piecesolid ballistics confirmation three for the white man one for the shark and he had killed richard beller with the same type weapon eyewitness accounts were hysterical but crosschecking them allowed him to come up with a reconstruction the robbers enter the bank the white man shoots shaving cream on the surveillance camera this means that unless the lens is cleared in two minutes the silent alarm will go off the mexicans hit the tellers stations the shark goes wacko at the sight of karleen tuggle talks trash to her she reacts and he blows her away the white man is screaming for the security boss gordon meyers appears then turns tail and runs and he shoots him in the back the basics were covered no eyewitnesses outside the bank the malibu found by the freeway ramp covered with glove prints was reported stolen later that day by its owner a rentacop at a burger king in hollywood going on the assumption that the robbers lived in the hollywood area housetohouse checks were being initiated the officers carrying the artists sketch of the white man approach vehicle covered the escape vehicle was most likely an chevy caprice belonging to a family around the corner from the bank neighbors reported it stolen three hours after the robbery it was now the hottest car on the la county hot sheet and the object of an allpoints bulletin lloyd shuddered any man seen driving that car was dead meat and back in he had paid for most of his stanford tuition by clouting chevys them me looking out the window at his neglected front lawn lloyd thought of the new him gordon meyers a team of lapd dicks were checking out his personnel record for kas and possible vengeance motives and gaffaney had included with his paperwork a hastily compiled addendum report on the man as dawn crept up signifying another sleepless night lloyd read the report for the fifth time gordon michael meyers dob la graduated high school in joined sheriffs department in during a manpower shortage wherein they lowered their entrance requirements to recruit men after the mandatory eighteenmonth jail training assigned to lenox station assessed as being too ineffectual for street duty reassigned as night jailer at county jail facility for nonviolent emotionally disturbed prisoners kept that assignment for seventeen and a half years until his retirement unmarried parents retired in arizona address seaglade redondo beach the phone rang lloyd jerked back in his chair the shrill noise registered as a gunshot realizing it wasnt he picked up the receiver and said yes the seething voice on the line was mcmanuss youre back on the investigation two heavy hitters pulled strings dont fuck up lloyd hung up a hideous thought crossed his mind the condemned killer was being let out on parole getting to his feet and stretching he ran mental itineraries review the case with kapek nothis was his roust calderon nojudge penzler would be back in twentyfour hours to sign his warrant and with buddy bagdessarian assisting they could squeeze likable louie to perfection it was time to find out why gordon meyers was shot in the back another hideous thought made him wince the he had killed richard beller with was in his desk drawer oiled dumdum loaded and encased in a shoulder rig them me me or them us lloyd strapped on the weapon that had stood him through his baptism of fire then went out to quash his murder indictment on sepulveda southbound to redondo beach he spotted a tail two car lengths in back of him decelerating and weaving into the slow lane he saw that it was a metro division unmarked unit distinguished from his own matador by an olivedrab paint job and a giant whip antenna slowing to a crawl he let the car come up on his bumper when the driver applied the brakes he stared in his rearview fuming when he saw two classic metro hot dogs in the front seatburly crewcut white men in their midthirties wearing identical navy windbreakers gaffaneys or mcmanuss insurance against possible fuckups lloyd gave the cops the finger and hung a hard right through a liquor store parking lot fishtailing into the alley behind it seeing no cars or pedestrians he punched the gas until the alley ended and angled off into a quiet residential street he took the street at ninety then slowed and zigzagged in a random pattern until he was within sight of the redondo beach pier parking by a chowder stand he looked around for the metro unit it was nowhere in sight exhilarated by the speed lloyd drove slowly to seaglade it was a garage apartment in the shadow of the pier lloyd parked and surveyed the front house there was no car in the driveway and the old white wood frame stood quiet in the early morning sunlight no media vehicles were anywhere to be seen and by squinting he could tell that there was no crime scene notice tacked to the door of knowing that macmanuss two heavy hitters were gaffaney and in all likelihood the big chief himself he grabbed an evidence kit from the backseat walked up the driveway and kicked the door in the burst of sunlight illuminated a dreary living room spotlessly clean but featuring mismatched sofa chairs coffee table and bookshelves lloyd stood in the doorway and made repeated eyeball circuits of the room picking up a profusion of small details that spelled loner expensive tv the only wall adornments photographs of meyers himself alone in his sheriffs uniform and standing by himself holding a fishing reel and string of trout no magazines or ashtrays or portable bar for guests lloyd shut the door and walked into a small dining room catching a first anomaly all the living room furniture was squared off at right angles here the table and chairs were haphazardly arranged the kitchen was more loner confirmation nothing but frozen dinners in the refrigerator plates and dishes for one in the sink a dozen bottles of cheap bourbon in the cupboard the bedroom was off to the side of the kitchen lloyd flicked on a wall light and tingled everything in the small rectangular space was immaculately clean and tidy from the gi madeup bed to the perfectly aligned end table with an alarm clock dead in its middle but the dresser had been pulled out and the three scrapbooks stacked across it had been replaced unevenly one upside down the pad had been crawled lloyd retraced his steps to the front door opened his evidence kit and took out a vial of fingerprint powder and a print brush removing surgical rubber gloves from the kit he put them on and limbered his fingers with a series of stretching exercises then he went to work to find out just how solitary gordon meyers was and if the pad crawler knew his stuff he discovered that meyers was a stone loner and the crawler was a pro for two solid hours lloyd dusted printsustaining surfaces and compared fingerprint points under a magnifying glass concentrating on doors doorknobs and doorjambs he found overlap smudges and viable latents for thumb and index finger all grab prints likely to have been made by a person walking through the apartment opening and closing doors behind them there were also smooth glove prints on the same surfaces and on the living room bookshelves and the dust covers of the books there all the left and right thumb and index prints matched to the tune of ten comparison points and there were no conflicting latents to be found meyers and the man who searched his apartment for what lloyd looked under the furniture behind the books nothing he checked the kitchen and dining room nothing but cooking and eating utensils the desk in meyerss bedroom was nothing but a tidy or tidily rearranged collection of bankbooks pens pencils paycheck stubs and irs forms and his closet held nothing but lasd uniforms and cheap civilian clothes which left the scrapbooks lloyd dusted the spines and held his magnifying glass and penlight on them to assess the results seeing smudged latents and what looked to be glove streaks he began a pagebypage scrutiny of the books the first two books contained photographs of gordon meyers posing with various trophy fish neatly mounted to the black paper in gummed edgeholders lloyd dusted three snapshots at random and got pristine glossy surfacesno latents no glove prints the third scrapbook was cop memorabiliacandid group shots of sheriffs deputies in uniform and meyers himself with jail inmates in blue denim lloyd leafed through the book going cold when he came to a page of snapshots with the corners poking out of their edgeholders going colder when he saw that the opposite page held two empty photo squares thinking check the back for writing just like the crawler did lloyd fumbled at the snapshot immediately in front of him when his gloves made the task too unwieldy he went ice cold then dusted the crookedly replaced photos coming away with a perfect left thumbprint on a snap of meyers and another deputy holding his magnifying glass over it he recalled comparison points from the left thumbs assumed to be meyerss this print was markedly different in whorls and ridges lloyd replaced the scrapbook put the snapshot in an evidence envelope packed up his kit and got the hell out of the tidy loner apartment forty minutes later lloyd was at parker center handing the powdered snapshot to officer artie cranfield of sid saying feed to the central source computer the one with the dmv and armed forces input ill be up in my office if you score get me a printout from r ampi artie laughed youre very authoritative today lloyd lloyds laugh was humorless im authorized on this the big man himself its the cop killings so please fucking hurry artie took off at a jog and lloyd busied himself arranging the surveillance reports on louie calderon that littered his desk thoughts of calling peter kapek for an interagency confab crossed his mind then he saw a memo propped up against his phone sgt hopkinsmeet or call sa kapek at downtown fed bldg he was debating whether to call or roll when artie returned breathless and handed him a manila folder i ran the print hes one of ours lloyd lloyd shivered and thought gaffaney then read through the lapd personnel file holding a hand over the fullface and profile snaps that were clipped to the first page the file detailed the twelveyear police career of metropolitan division sergeant wallace dean collins age thirtyfour his record was impressive class a fitness reports and a number of citations for meritorious service lloyd scanned the list of collinss special assignments surveillance detail narco vice decoy then a transfer to metro on the recommendation of captain frederick gaffaney since his rookie days collins had partnered with sergeant kenneth r lohmann of central division and there was an addendum memo from the central personnel officer stating that lohmann was also flagged for metro dutyon the next available opening lloyd took his hand from the snapshot and smiled collins was the driver of the car tailing him down sepulveda looking at the fidgeting artie cranfield he said howd you get the file so fast artie shrugged i told the clerk at personnel records you had special clearance from braverton and up why lloyd handed the file back just curious take this back to records hold on to the photo and be very quiet about this okay quiet as the grave artie said lloyd drove to the downtown federal building thinking of angles to cutthroat gaffaney and kill the murder indictment now being held over his head as he pulled to the curb at sixth and union the metro unit sidled to a stop two car lengths in back of him collins at the wheel getting out and slamming the door lloyds thoughts moved from blackmail to a double suicide scene to blow gaffaneys career along with his own then curiosity about collins crawling gordon meyerss pad took over and he ran upstairs to kapeks office rapped on the door and said in his most commanding tone come on gman were going cruising where to a hotdog rendezvous they drove east through downtown la lloyd silent with one eye on the road and the other on the metro unit riding their tail behind a slowmoving cadillac kapek fingered his acne scars and stared at lloyd finally breaking the tense quiet ive been forcing myself to concentrate on the first two robberies exclusively and i think i may have a hypothetical connection between hawley and eggers lloyds mind jerked away from the plan he was hatching what listen i checked out both mens bank accounts and got something weird they both withdrew similar large amounts of cash on the same datesoctober seventeenth and november first two fivehundreddollar withdrawals for hawley two sixhundredbuck shots for eggers non sequitur stuffboth guys are strictly check writers these withdrawals were from their individual accountsnot the joint accounts they share with their wives what do you think lloyd whistled then said vice ive already put in my vice query so you call the squad commanders and have them shake down their snitches for specific info what happened on those dates bookies taking heavy action cockfights dogfights i dont buy eggers or hawley as dopers but i could see sally and chrissy doing a few snootfuls of blow with their sugar daddys footing the bill by the way how did the families react to the girlfriend bit any feedback on that kapek breathed out sadly hawleys wife moved out eggers lost his job because he lied to us about confrey and because the big boss at security pacific freaked when he heard about the dead cops and blamed eggers eggerss wife is still up at arrowhead and he went up there to work it out both hawley and eggers are refusing to talk further to us under attorneys orders lloyd said shit i wrote out a memo requesting that they be held as material witnesses to avoid that then all hell broke loose by the way were being tailed theres a metro unit in back of us kapek looked in the rearview is that what this is all about and whats metro passing out of downtown into the east la industrial district lloyd said metro is an lapd special crimes unit a diversified attack force gang fights in watts send in metro too much dope in schools metro shakes down bubblegummers on their lunch hour the unit is effective but its full of rightwing wackos and what this is all about is me being watchdogged were going to the la river and park follow me and do what i tell you now kapek was silent lloyd turned off alameda and skirted the brew brewery then took the water and power department road to the embankment that overlooked the bonedry river the tail car remained fifty yards in back of them and lloyd slowed and parked at the embankments edge checking the rearview a last time he said im hoping theyll think were meeting a snitch come on they walked down the concrete slope sideways plaster debris crackling beneath their feet when they reached the riverbed lloyd got his bearings and saw that the old maintenance shack was still there and still mounted on a cinderblock foundation to keep it from washing away during flood season he pointed kapek toward it and they trudged over through an obstacle course of empty wine bottles and beer cans when they were standing in the shade of the shacks corrugated tin door lloyd tilted his head sideways and caught sight of the two metro cops peering over the edge of the embankment stand here he said keep looking in the direction i take off in and keep looking at your watch like youre expecting someone kapek nodded looking befuddled and slightly angry lloyd walked around the edge of the shack then climbed the embankment on its opposite side coming onto level ground behind a line of abandoned cars squatting low he moved down the row to the end then stood up seeing nothing but a short patch of pavement between himself and the metro unit with collins and his partner fifty yards away still holding surveillance on kapek lloyd sprinted to the car and opened the driversside door the two cops turned around at the noise and started running lloyd flipped open the glove compartmentnothingthen noticed an attache case on the floorboard sgt k r lohmann stenciled on the front he opened it and tore through blank report forms and plastic evidence bags and was about to give up when his hands brushed a bag that held two glossy photographs he fumbled the bag into his inside jacket pocket and backed out of the car just as collins loomed in front of him with the open door between them collins halted then approached on tiptoes lloyd saw his partner ten yards in back of him looking scared when collins moved into a cautious streetfighters stance lloyd slammed the door into his legs knocking him backward onto the ground collins got to his feet and started swinging blindly lloyd sidestepped the blows and brought him to his knees with a left to the solar plexus collins sucked air and held his stomach lloyd balled his right fist the old pain was still there so he swung a short left uppercut instead collins grabbed his nose and fell prone his legs twitching lloyd stood over him and hissed tell captain fred i dont need a backup the other cop was trembling beside the car lloyd stepped toward him and he backed away then peter kapek walked over stationing himself squarely between them shaking his head he looked at lloyd and said dont you get tired of walking all over people arent you a little old for this kind of shit at first he thought it was an awful new kind of rage that took over his whole body making him ache from head to toe and vomit and see double then he thought it was something even strangera defense mechanism put out by his brain to keep the truth from driving him where everything was bright red and skunkstenched a tagalong puto coldcocked him and took off with his woman and if he freaked out and went crazy he was stone fucking dead because he was the most wanted man in la bullet bait for every cop who breathed but confronting the truth and driving the trans am skillfully through the hottest part of town did nothing to kill the revolt inside his body and he couldnt tell if he was in a hallucination or was the hallucination at dawn hed awakened sprawled across stan kleins body it all came back and he got to his feet reeling stumbling and puking and ran outside to the car driving away he started seeing double and pulled over behind the scrub hedge and passed out when he came to it was better and he drove into downtown hollywood on side streets then it got brutal passing the burger king on highland he saw cops handing out pieces of paper to customers other cops were knocking on doors on selma and de longpre and the little culdesacs north of the boulevard cruising by the park two blocks from the bowl motel he saw more cops distributing more paper this time to the winos who used the park as a crash pad the motel sharkshit bobby and the money was right there free of cops but with the feel of a giant booby trap looking up at the palm trees that bordered the place he started to see triple then thought he saw snipers with elephant guns hiding inside the fronds attack dogs started to growl everywhere then the sound became the whir of helicopter rotors when he saw a german shepherd behind the wheel of a volkswagen something snapped and he laughed out loud and rubbed the bloodcrusted bruise that covered the left side of his face he drove to a pay phone and called louie calderon at the bootleg number and louie screamed that the fuzz had him pegged as the gun dealer and there was a twentyfourhour tail on his ass he hadnt given up any names but the heat was huge and crazy lloyd hopkins himself had hassled him hed hung up and made another circuit of highland more cops on the street a group of plainclothesmen housetohousing the block where hed stashed the caprice he was about to make a dash for sharkshit and the money when he noticed a scattering of paper in the gutter he pulled to the curb got out and picked up the first sheet he came to it was the sketch of himself hed seen in the newspapers with white male age lbs written below it the bowl motel gave him a brief comehither look then blew up in his mind bobby had probably rabbited with the money or the cops were waiting there triggerhappy and pumped up for glory all he had left was vandy getting back in the trans am it all came together concussion meet rhonda at silver foxes at midnight get her to make the run to the motel for the money promise her a big cut or nothing at all vandy was probably hiding out with her cocaine sleazebag friends force rhonda to help find her rice looked at his watch twelve hours since the coldcock a wave of nausea hit him producing stomach cramps that shot up into his head and made his vision blur through the pain he got the most frightening idea of the whole horrorshow past month control the concussion so you can survive to get vandy and a shot at the money and kill joe garcia rice drove back to stan kleins villa and walked in the unlocked front door like he owned the place giving only a cursory glance to stan mans body and the dried lake of blood beside it he ran upstairs to the bathroom opened the medicine cabinet and read labels darvon placidil dexedrine percodan he remembered a thousand soledad bull sessions about dope and dryswallowed two perks and three dexies he thought of his boozehound parents walking out the door and never returning and almost retched then walked into the bedroom and fell down on the bed the soft surface made him think of vandy and when the drugs kicked in easing his pain and juicing him with a new shaky energy he wondered if she was worth killing for lloyd turned on the light in his cubicle and saw that the papers on his desk had been sifted through he looked for an inanimate object to hit then remembered kapeks arent you a little old for this kind of shit and the junior gmans disgusted goodbye when he dropped him off only fred gaffaney was worth violence and he was much too potent to fuck with calmed by hatred of the jesus freak he took the plastic evidence baggie from his pocket and studied the two photographs inside the snapshots were of gordon meyers and a young man dressed in civilian clothes seated at what looked like a restaurant or nightclub table meyers beamed broadly in both but in one photo the young man was slackjawed as if caught by unpleasant surprise in the other he held an arm up to cover his face lloyd studied the face knowing that he had seen the blunt cheekbones closeset eyes and crew cut before then the resemblance hit him he ran to the switchboard for a newspaper confirmation and got it from a blackbordered photo on the second page of the times the young man in the snapshots was the late officer steven gaffaney lloyd smiled the connection felt like aiming a crucifixion spike at jesus freds heart he ran back to his cubicle and dialed dutch peltzs number at hollywood station when dutch answered with peltz talk lloyd said no time for amenities dutchman im on the cop killings and i need a favor name it dave stevenson still the commander of west la station yes you still tight with him yes good will you call him and ask him about gaffaney the dead rookie anything and everything no departmental hype the real skinny dutch said call you back in ten minutes and hung up lloyd waited by the phone ready to pounce at the first ring in eight minutes it went off a siren shriek he picked it up and dutch started talking stevenson called gaffaney junior a punk kid a pain in the ass and a dummy unquote he was resented by his fellow officers because he used to preach religion to them and because he used to brag about his father and how his clout would let him climb the promotion ladder in record time the kid was also a thief he stole clerical supplies up the yingyang and used to rip off ammo from the armory interesting huh lloyd whistled yeah did stevenson report any of this did he dutch cut in yes he did he reported the thefts to intelligence division rather than iad because thats gaffaney seniors bailiwick dave clammed up then i just called a friend at intelligence hes going to check into it for me on the qt if he gets something ill let you know what are you fishing for lloyd i dont know dutch do me another favor shoot call the manager at cal federal and set up an interview for me in fortyfive minutes hes probably been besieged by cops but tell him im new on the investigation with new questions for him youve got it get them lloyd lloyd said i will and hung up knowing the statement was aimed at fred gaffaney more than them the california federal manager was a middleaged black man named wallace tyrell lloyd introduced himself in the banks desk area then followed him back to his private office closing the door behind them tyrell said captain peltz mentioned new questions what are they lloyd smiled and sat down in the one visitors chair in the room tell me about gordon meyers positioning himself carefully in the swivel rocker behind his desk tyrell said that isnt a new question tell me anyway as you wish meyers was only with the bank for a little over two weeks i hired him because he was a retired police officer with a satisfactory record and because he accepted a low salary offer aside from that i had him pegged as a garrulous goodnatured man one with a fatherly interest in the young policemen in the area he lloyd held up a hand slow and easy on this mr tyrell its very important as you wish meyers used to buttonhole the local officers at the coffee shop next door apparently to trade war stories i saw him doing it several times it was obvious to me that the officers considered him a nuisance also meyers approached several policemen who had accounts here basically he impressed me as a lonely slightly desperate type of man yet you had no thoughts of firing him no hiring one man to be head of security saves money and avoids having an old pensioner with a gun hanging around reminding customers of possible bank robberies meyers adequately handled vault and safedepositbox security and served as a guardwithout a uniform it was extremely costeffective as i said before these arent new questions youre asking me staring hard at tyrell lloyd said hows this for new were there any shortages of cash or safetybox valuables during the time meyers worked here tyrell sighed and said that is a new question yes two customers mentioned small amounts of jewelry missing from their boxes that happens sometimes people are forgetful of their transactions but rarely twice in one week if it happened again i was going to call the police did you suspect meyers he was the only one to suspect he was vault custodian part of his job was to insert the signature key when the customer inserted their keyour boxes are doublelocked he could have made wax impressions of some of the bottom lockshis application resume said he worked as a locksmith before he joined the sheriffs department also this is a busy time for safetybox transactionspeople withdrawing jewelry for christmas parties and cashing in bonds if meyers was very careful he would have had ample opportunity to pilfer have you told any of the other investigating officers this no it didnt seem germane to the issue lloyd stood up and shook hands with the bank manager thank you mr tyrell i like your style i work at it tyrell said driving away from the bank recent memories tumbled in lloyds mind during the pandemonium following the picowestholme bloodbath he had heard one young patrolman tell another the security guy was a real wacko he used to talk this weird shit to me the cops had backed away when he noticed them but their faces were still in his memory vault now part of the blurred but clearing focus of the gaffaney offshoot of the case checking his dashboard clock he saw that it was twenty minutes until daywatch ended focusing only on those faces he drove to the west la station to make them talk his timing was perfect the station parking lot was a flurry of activity blackandwhites going in and out patrolmen walking back and forth carrying report notebooks and standardissue shotguns standing by the locker room door lloyd scanned faces drawing puzzled return looks from the incoming officers the flurry was dying out when he saw the two from the bank approach with their gear lloyd walked over to them making a snap decision to play it straight but hard when they saw him the patrolmen averted their eyes almost in unison and continued on toward the locker room door lloyd cleared his throat as they passed him then called out come here officers the two young men turned around lloyd matched their faces to their name tags the tall redheaded cop named corcoran was the one who had made the remark at the bank the other a youth with glasses named thompson was the one hed been talking to nodding at them lloyd said im on the bank homicides gentlemen corcoran you said quote the security guy was a real wacko he used to talk this weird shit to me you told that to thompson here you can elaborate on the statement to me or a team of iad bulls which would you prefer corcoran flushed then answered no contest sergeant i was gonna tell the squad room dicks but it slipped my mind he looked at thompson wasnt i tommy you remember me telling you ththats right thompson stammered rreally sarge lloyd said talk omit nothing pertaining to the security man corcoran spoke tommy and i sort of had lunch with him twice last week he came over to our table flashed his retirement badge from the sheriffs and sat down sort of uninvited he started asking these weird questions should prostitution and weed be legalized didnt we think cops made the best whoremasters because they knew the whore psyche so good didnt we think that the county could cut costs by legalizing weed and getting inmates up at wayside to harvest it stone wacko i th thompson cut in i couldnt believe this clown made twenty years as a cop he came on like he was from outer space but i knew he was leading up to something anyway the second time he crashes our lunch he tries to act real cool and asks us if we know any fences who work good with us unbelievable like he thinks policemen and fences are good buddies feeling his blurred focus gain another notch of clarity lloyd said tell me about steven gaffaney dont be afraid to be candid a look passed between the partners then corcoran said nobody on the daywatch could stand him he was a religious crackpot and a freebie scrounger always hitting the halfer restaurants and pocketing the check leaving a quarter tip i heard rumors that he stole stuff from the station and that his old man some heavyhitter captain bribed instructors at the academy to pass him through wh lloyd interrupted whats the source of that last rumor corcoran stared at the ground i heard the squad room lieutenant talking to captain stevenson the skipper shushed him how did gaffaney and his partner get along lloyd asked paul loweth couldnt stand him thompson said when they got assigned together paul requested another partner you know because of a personality conflict they even took separate code sevens because paul couldnt stand eating with gaffaney lloyd said heres the crunch question did you ever see gordon meyers and gaffaney together both officers nodded their heads affirmatively and corcoran said about four or five days before the killings i saw meyers and gaffaney at the coffee shop next to the bank talking like old buddies i didnt hear what they were talking about tommy and i sat down at the counter so the wacko wouldnt hassle us bowing with a flourish lloyd said thank you gentlemen then ran for his matador and drove to seaglade still no car in the driveway still no activity around the front house still no crime scene notice on the door of the garage apartment again lloyd kicked the door in this time splintering the wood around the lock knowing that the pad had already stood two professional prowlings he went straight for the kitchen and opened the drawers until he found a large sawedged steak knife then he walked into the bedroom upended the mattress and looked for telltale slits or stitchings finding a long seam of catgut near the headboard he dug the knife in and ripped out stuffing until his blade hit a sharp object lloyd withdrew the knife and stuck in his hand touching a flat metal surface his fingers pried it loose and he pulled it out it was a fishing tackle box rectangularshaped about two inches deep and unlocked lloyd lifted up the top inside were a half dozen dieboldt security keys balls of molding wax loose colored gemstones and a rolled sheaf of papers unrolling them and turning on the lamp by the bed he smiled no more blurthe gaffaney offshoot of the case was now crystal clear the pages were an official lapd forma west la division daywatch car plan list the names of the officers their sector and unit numbers in one column their assignment dates in another the list detailed november december and beside sector g the names t corcoranj thompson were crossed off while the name s gaffaney bore exclamation points followed by question marks lloyd stood up and put the form in his pocket wondering why the old pursuit high wasnt there long moments passed before the reason came to him gaffaney junior probably didnt have time to receive the stolen jewelry or flat out resisted the temptation the two nightclub snapshots were probably evidence of meyerss second goaround at recruiting him the kid was already pegged as a thief within the department secondgeneration kleptomania was not blackmail parity with firstgeneration murder and the gaffaney offshoot was probably coincidental to them them lloyd thought of louie calderon and of judge penzler still luxuriating at lake tahoe he thought of the blank warrants in his desk at parker center and of the signatures he had forged on stolen payroll checks during college forgery to kill a murder indictment was easy parity even more justified as a means to them one thought stuck in lloyds mind all the way to the center who were they dusk joe garcia looked at anne atwater vanderlinden and wondered for the three thousandth time who she was crouched in the griffith park hideaway hed discovered in high school he watched her chainsmoke and stare at the lights popping on all over the la basin shed run with him away from the lover hed killed and the old lover chasing her no tears no show of fear until she ran out of cigarettes and threw a tantrum in front of a liquor store guts shallowness or dope exhaustion shed fallen asleep in his arms and holding her made him feel strong even though he knew he was a dead man was it her or would any woman have done it for him theyd slept and talked on and off all day and he filled her in on bobby and the money but not on the bank and dead cops she took it in with a shrug looking like a bored rich girl with no connection to dead men and blood money stupid insensitive or just burned out her weird little speeches didnt make figuring her out any easier during the day shed wake up say things like duane and stan had the same karma or stan was a pragmatist duane just thought he was or duane didnt understand my music so it was easy to split from him then doze off again after a fifteenhour crash course in closeness all he knew was that she didnt know they were up someplace worse than the creek with nada anne pointed to the lights going on in the capital records tower stan was going to set me up with a producer there have you ever been in jail yeah i knew it its your clothes youre wearing the kind of clothes duane would wear if he was trying to fit in someplace he didnt belong seeing a picture of himself drenched in ink joe said these are duanes threads you know we have to get out of here we cant stay here forever i know that clothes should reflect a persons early environment then as they put out karma they transform what they wear what did you wear when you were growing up you know prep like me or mod surfer what joe watched anne light a cigarette then exhale and sniff the air like it could get her high in place of coke he said this isnt the time to be talking fashion weve got no car and no money and a crazy man on our ass i cant go by my pad or the motel because hell be there but we have to move and i have to eat anne said ive got friends who can help us and i can make money just answer my question how peddling your pussy dont say that i can give sex and not sacrifice my karma dont say that joe put a hand on her arm and said sssh im sorry but i am in deep trouble then answer my question joe sighed i grew up dressing like a ridiculous mexican gangster plaid sir guy shirts buttoned to the top when it was ninetyfive degrees bellbottom khakis that dragged the ground spitshined navy shoes and an honor farm watch cap it was a joke and it had nothing to do with karma everything does i killed a man last night arent you scared anne sniffed the air i took a dilaudid black beauty speedball just before it got bad with stan and duane and im starting to crash in about an hour ill be real scared you act like a tough guy but you talk like you went to college youre sort of a phony only bobby knew that about him joe put his arms around anne and whispered its because of this song i cant write and bobby and sir guys and khakis and what i have to do but i cant do any more does that make sense to you anne drysobbed into his chest no no no no no joe whispered back youre just pretending not to know youre a musician so i know you know listen ill tell you exactly what were going to do were going to walk down the observatory road to vermont then steal some rich preppy car then were going to hit up these friends of yours and get some money and get the hell out of town say yes if you think we can do it anne made a choking sound and nodded her head up and down joe looked out at the la skyline and knew for the first time in his life that it was hisbecause now he could leave it behind lloyd pulled up across from likable louies onestop pit stop seeing no fed units he grabbed his forged search warrant and ithaca pump ran across the street and knocked on the door of the builton house a feeling of being close grabbed him and he flicked off the safety and jacked a shell into the chamber the door was opened cautiously held to the frame by a long chain a mexican woman peered through the crack and said luis not here police took him lloyd saw copwise smarts you mean federal officers he said fbi luis hip to men watching him these la cops green car big antenna lloyd shuddered metro had glommed the calderon info when he asked half hour i call lawyer lloyd ran back to his car and leadfooted it the two miles to rampart station hoping to find lieutenant buddy bagdessarian or another detective familiar with calderon parking in the lot he saw no blackandwhites only civilian cars and knew that the station contingent was skeletal probably because every available unit was aiding hollywood division in the copkiller canvassing then he spotted an olivedrab metro wagon parked crossways in the watch commanders space the feeling of being close got claustrophobic and he ran into the station fulltilt there was a single officer on duty at the front desk lloyd eased his stride and approached slowly knowing that the early evening station scene was way too quiet way off the desk officer grimaced when he saw him coming he moved toward the intercom phone on the wall behind him then changed his mind and mashed his hands together lloyd reached the desk and saw a cross and flag pin attached next to the mans badge the abomination made his head reel he was about to rip the insignia from the officers chest when a muffled noise stopped him and made him perk his ears to identify it there was a short moment of silence then the noise again this time lloyd knew it was a scream he ran down a long corridor toward the echo past the booking area and drunk tank to a halfopen storage room door behind the door the screams melded with a barrage of other noises retching garbled obscenities loud thuds lloyd forced himself to count to ten an old strategy to resurrect cool then a brassknuckled fist arced across the open door space followed by a burst of blood at seven he attacked collins and lohmann looked up as the door crashed open louie calderon handcuffed behind his back to a chair spat blood and flailed at the metro cops with his legs lloyd moved straight in both fists cocked and aimed shoulderhigh with no swinging room he hurled jerky shots catching lohmann in the neck collins a glancing blow in the chest calderon toppled his chair to the floor collins tripped over him missing a wide roundhouse right at lloyds head lloyd grabbed his wrist as the blow grazed his shoulder bringing his knee up flush into collinss abdomen louie calderon moaned beneath the tangle of feet and lohmann lunged at lloyd with two brasscoiled fists his momentum sending them both back into the door then hands grabbed lloyd from behind and pulled him out of the room lohmann still on top of him trying to extricate himself when the knuckle wielder got untangled lloyd had a clear shot he kicked lohmann in the face and felt his nose crack lloyd was hurled into the holding cell across the corridor when the crossandflag officer got the door secured he stood up reached through the bars and tore off his badge the polished oval hit the floor and the officer picked it up looked at lloyd and hissed satan lloyd laughed in his face then spat in his face collins yelled get back to the fucking desk and the crossandflag man halfwalked halfran down the corridor and out of sight lloyd watched collins help his partner to his feet lohmann was blowing cartilage and bloody mucus out of both nostrils spitting the overflow on the floor collins made him tilt his head backward then with one arm around his shoulders he walked him toward the front of the station louie calderon was still on the storage room floor twisted sideways in his chair lloyd watched him gasp and let out little sobs his own breathing was almost back to normal when collins returned picked up the chair and placed a finger under likable louies chin youre going to give me three names he said a federal officer saw your little boy with a tranq gun we know youre the dealer calderon pulled his chin free your mothers the dealer he slurred she deals aids at a lesbian bar collins hit him in the stomach knocking the chair back to the floor calderon retched for breath then started hyperventilating thrashing with his feet heaving with his shoulders the chair buckled off the floor as he squirmed and one by one the wooden slats on the backing snapped collins stood over calderon until he got his wind and started shrieking pig pig pig then he knelt beside him and said the three names calderon took a long gasp of air and said your mother your partners mother and crazy lloyds mother chinga su madres todos lesbian pig threeway with niggers puto puto puto collins said pig is a nono stuck his right thumb and forefinger behind calderons ear and squeezed the carotid artery the three names lloyd squinted and saw calderons face start turning purple he squeezed the bars pushing harder and harder into them it felt like he was the first part of a chain of pressure moving straight through the bars to the hot dog and his victim and if he let up he would never get to them then when calderons face looked like a plum about to burst he saw what he was doing and screamed no startled collins withdrew the hold he looked over at lloyd and lloyd saw his own eyes burning into him knowing it couldnt be he held his hands up in front of his face seeing nothing he felt all his senses go into his ears and pick up whispers the names ill maim you for life if you dont give them to me no no fuck you no dont please dont think of your family think of your wife at tehachapi where shell be on dope charges if you dont tell me no no no please please no the three names think of your kids in a cutrate boardandcare home have you watched the news lately lot of sexual abuse in those places give me the three names no no no no no yes or i get a dykey woman officer to skin search your wife for the narcotic substances that i know shell find no no n tell me luis no theyll hurt me they wont hurt you but i will no dont say no to me say yes to me or ill hurt your family yes yes duane rice bobby garcia joe garcia them lloyd closed his eyes and flashbacked the duanerhonda message on calderons bootleg message list christine confreys puzzled reaction to the mug shots of duane richard rice allegedly serving a year in county jail for gta he pressed himself into the bars the better to see and listen collins was squatting beside calderon unlocking the handcuffs that bound him to the chair theres a lot of bobby and joe garcias he said be more specific about them likable louie fumbled himself away from the chair slowly stretching his arms and kneading his gouged wrists bobby boogaloo garcia the exboxer his brother joe his voice was filled with the selfdisgust of the freshly turned snitch lloyd held his eyes shut to give the man back some of his dignity he kept them shut until he felt a tap on his shoulder collins was standing directly in front of the cell lloyd saw that his eyes were brown not gray like his own but that they were still somehow identical ill have the desk officer let you out in a little while he said but stay out of this its ours lloyd couldnt think of anything to say he stared at collins as he walked back to the storage room and helped calderon over to the holding cell next to his still too numb to talk he heard the door being unlocked and locked again followed by footsteps moving away from the bloodspattered corridor then from beyond the periphery of his vision louie calderon said dont let them kill the kid bobby and duane are hopetodie trash but the kid was just too weak to say no dont let them kill him midway down vermont to los feliz joe garcia realized he didnt know how to steal a car hed heard nine million raps on hotwiring and drilling steering columns and that was it anne vanderlinden walked beside him talking gibberish about karma and the ritzy houses they were passing her voice was getting more and more feverish and when streetlamp light caught her eyes they glowed wide and loony then joe caught a blast of bob seger and the silver bullet band and weaving headlights he grabbed anne just as a yellow corvette cut a sharp left turn and screeched to a stop in the driveway next to them a young man got out of the car and stumbled across the lawn and through the front door of a large tudor house joe left anne on the sidewalk and checked out the vette the keys were in the ignition he looked at the house and saw window lights going on then off now or never he walked back to anne and shoved her toward the car she got in the passenger side and started burrowing in the glove compartment joe slipped behind the wheel trembling when he saw the shifter on the floor and realized that he didnt know how to drive a stick muttering fuck it he remembered the way bobby used to drive his old vw and watched anne open up a prescription bottle and start shoving pills in her mouth he found neutral he depressed the clutch he hit the ignition bob seger boogied joe slammed the shifter into reverse and inched out of the driveway anne giggled drive to the strip and well call my friends and joe ground his way through the gears stalling the car twice but finally working clutch and gearshift to the point where he could keep them going the moment on the hillside came back ten times as strong and they fishtailed toward hollywood twoway radio crackle in the distance helicopter searchlights swooping the motel at irregular intervals duane and joe gone over twentyfour hours probably dead twice the radio had screeched chevrolet caprice bobby boogaloo garcia knew they were coming for him his hours of bible reading and prayers had reaped nada he was going to die alone excommunicated away from god and his brother two automatics and grand in cash his only companions no one to mourn him no one to talk to on the night he finally figured it all out no chance to pay back his victims and slide into heaven on lastminute good deeds and acts of contrition no one to grant absolution for his sins at first when he got it all down in his head it made him feel peaceful then the choppers kept buzzing and flashing their lights pissing off the old juiceheads boozing in the parking lot who started jabbering and throwing their empty tbird bottles at the wall that made him mad made him feel like going out defiant even when he knew that defiance was his most heavyduty sin that was the funniest part of it half of him wanted to admit it and go out clean the other half wanted to go out righteously defiant because thats what he was for thirtyfour years and if he reversed his act now it meant that he never existed at all bullhorns barking from up the block copter lights flooding the sky every five minutes the winos wailing like nigger banshees finally bobby decided to cover his bets he pulled up his chair to directly in front of the door and placed the bible on the right armrest then loaded boths and unscrewed the silencers for better range sliding shells into both chambers he sat down with the guns in his lap when they kicked in the door hed know how to play it three minutes after his cell door was opened by a station trustee lloyd was in a phone booth on rampart and temple turning out his pockets for change his first call was to the central jail records night line where an information clerk told him that duane richard rice white male dob light brown hair blue eyes had been released on a sentence modification on november after serving six months of a oneyear sentence for grand theft auto he had one previous conviction for vehicular manslaughter and had put in three years of a fiveyear sentence at the california youth authority facility at soledad he was now on both state parole and county probation and his last known address was south barrington west los angeles pressing lloyd asked the clerk what module rice was housed in at the main county jail after a moment spent checking other records she came back on the line and said twentyseven hundred the ding tankgordon meyers connection but why lloyd called the los angeles county probation department and got an operator who put him through to a series of clerks who finally put him through to the countys chief probation officer at home the chief made a series of calls herself and buzzed lloyd back at his pay phone with the word duane richard rice had not reported to his po after his release from jail and had vacated his condo on south barrington he was now technically a parole and probation absconder and a bench warrant for his arrest had been issued hanging up lloyd tried to recall the phone numbers from louie hanging up lloyd tried to recall the phone numbers from louie silver foxes he dialed rhondas number and got the beginning of a recorded message then hung up and called bell telephone and made his demands a supervisor gave him the information he wanted rhonda morrell north vista west hollywood silver foxes north gardner lloyd smiled as he wrote it down the addresses were only a few blocks apart with his unholstered on the seat beside him he drove to west hollywood north vista was a modern building with two stories of apartments around a cement courtyard the directory by the front gate listed r morrell in unit lloyd studied the numerical scheme and judged rhondas apartment to be on the first story dead center he walked over the pressed to his leg no lights were on but he pressed the buzzer beneath the tapedon morrell anyway then stepped to the side a full minute passed with no sounds issuing in response to his ring no rhonda lloyd walked around to the parking space in the back of the building the slot for unit was empty feeling itchy but close he drove the three blocks to silver foxes pulling up and surveying the lavender spanishstyle lloyd was surprised to see no neon beacons or other accoutrements of sleaze only a quiet fourflat with lights coming from the left downstairs side again holding the to his leg he walked over to the lights and rang the bell next to the smiling fox emblem pressing himself against the wall beside the doorway he held the gun next to his chest prepared to wheel and fire silence then a whiney male voice muttering oh shit then footsteps approaching the door when he heard inside locks being unlatched lloyd stepped out and leveled the at midpoint in the doorway the door swung open and a musclebound young man in a tight tank top stood there frozen by the gun held only inches from him police officer lloyd said walk backward inside turn around and place your hands on the wall above your head then step back and spread your legs biting his lip the young man complied lloyd followed him into a stark white room and nudged the door shut with his toe pressing the to the back of his neck frisking him with his left hand the youth moaned when lloyd brushed the insides of his thighs finding no concealed weaponry lloyd said how many other rooms just the bathroom sweetie theres nobody here but us chickens are you a chicken hawk lloyd gave the room a quick onceover catching tube furniture white plasticine desk white walls hung with pictures of rock and rollers no banter he said go over and open the bathroom door then come back here the young man walked over to the bathroom door and pushed it open then returned and sat down on the white desk one foot on the floor one leg dangling in lloyds direction like i said no one here but us chickens my names tim whats yours lloyd reholstered his and said son i am the last person in the world you want to get cute with tonight the last im going to ask you some simple straight questions and i want simple straight answers do you understand tim smiled coyly and tapped his heel against the desk shoot baby first do you know a man named duane rice late twenties six feet oneseventy light brown hair blue eyes no but he sounds cute is he your lover lloyd backhanded the young man knocking him off the desk he smiled and wiped a trickle of blood from his nose lloyd said i dont want to hurt you but please jesus god dont fuck with me not tonight tim stood up say pretty please and ill be a good boy scout and cooperate penny and janice moved through lloyds mind in precaution reflex then jesus fred gaffaney and collins eclipsed them he pushed tim across the room and held him to the wall with a hand on his neck pretty please talk motherfucker before i trash your worthless ass tim made gurgling sounds until lloyd released him and stepped back smiling he rubbed his neck and sighed rough play is one thing hurting is another you said pretty please so ill be a good scout and be nice what do you want to know the singsong words settled on lloyd like fallout and he wondered if this night would ever be over one of your whores he said rhonda morrell i picked up on one of her phone messages from duane rice he was supposed to call her at home or here last night the message mentioned someone named stan klein what do you know about this tim moved to the desk and opened drawers then pulled out a white naugahyde binder and leafed through it holding the binder open he said thats rhonda isnt she foxy lloyd looked at the nude photographs rhonda morrell was a beautiful brunet he memorized her face holding his eyes from the rest of her body tell me about her and about rice and klein tim snapped the binder shut whats to tell rhonda is a real brain fox wants to be a stockbroker shes very much in demand with our clients rice and klein i dont know about although the way you described rice he sounds like this guy who came by last week this guy rhondas got some kind of nonsex scene going with you know for money rhondas a real money fox the wants in calderons message book popped into lloyds head tell me about himand rhonda tim wrapped his arms around himself last week a man came in looking for a fox he didnt seem like silver foxes caliber but i liked his style so i fixed him up with rhonda he gave me a name but i knew it was phony later on rhonda tells me shes helping the guy look for his girlfriend for big bucks in fact she called this afternoon and told me shes supposed to meet him here tonight at midnight she wanted me to hold him in case shes late lloyd fingered the gun he had killed with then looked at the clock on lloyd fingered the gun he had killed with then looked at the clock on caliber killer now he was coming full circle back to that point to pay his dues for the event that had formed him shivering he said tim do you believe in god tim shrugged ive never given it much thought you should hes a tricky bastard you might dig him go home im going to wait for rhonda and her friend is this legal no go home im sorry i hit you im not tim said and walked out the door lloyd waited for ten minutes then went out to his car and turned on his twoway he listened for twenty minutes the air was flooded with calls directing hollywood division units to the area near the hollywood bowl but there was no mention of the hottest trio in la historyduane rice bobby and joe garcia gaffaney and his hot dogs were sitting on the information it was coming down to their outlaw vendetta and his own and when rice fell into his hands at midnight would he be able to press his advantage and take him out in cold blood lloyd walked back to the silver foxes office to await rhonda morrell and then the moment he sat down in an uncomfortable white chair and stared at the pictures on the white walls unable to identify any of the rock and rollers by name checking the clock repeatedly he hoped that rhonda would be late so he could take a post outside and backshoot duane rice as he walked up to the door god as an ironic bastard stuck in his mind taking out the picowestholme cop killer would be considered the zenith of his career not the desperately selfish survival tactic that it was at there was a rapping on the door lloyd took out his and tiptoed over and opened the door startling rhonda morrell who saw the gun and opened her mouth to scream lloyd got her in a headlock with his free arm and pulled her inside stifling her attempts to make noise she bit at his jacket sleeve and he kicked the door shut and whispered lapd im here for duane rice not you i just want to ask you a few questions then get you the hell out of here before he shows up now im going to let you go but you have to promise not to scream okay rhonda quit squirming and biting lloyd released her and she twisted around and stood with her back to him fluffing out her afro turning back she said in a perfectly composed voice he owes me a lot of money if you arrest him he wont be able to pay me lloyd blurted jesus then mustered his thoughts and said theres a lot of reward money being offered for his capture you talk to me fast and ill see that you get it rhonda smiled how much money over seventy thousand lloyd said stealing a glance at his watch tim told me youre helping rice look for his girlfriend tell me about that and tell me about stan klein you know a lot about it already i dont know a fucking thing tell me goddammit rhonda looked at the clock and said i guess this is trading up rice has a cokewhore girlfriend ive been helping him look for her i found out that shes been living with a sleazy entrepreneurial type stan klein i got whats the girlfriends name anne vanderlinden duane called me monday night and we made a date to meet here at midnight he said he and vandy were flying to new york in a few days and he needed the names of some music people apparently vandy is a singer and he wants to help her career he promised me a bonus for that and that was the last time you spoke to him no he called me this afternoon at home to confirm our date he sounded spacey and he said that vandy had left stan kleins place last night with a puto mexican whatever that is now hes promising me the moon if i help him find her again he also said we have to pick up some money lloyd stared at the clock his mind suddenly blank rhonda fidgeted plucking at her hair finally she pointed to the gun in lloyds hand why have you got that out is duane dangerous lloyd laughed yeah hes dangerous i think hes basically sweet with some rough edges if hes so dangerous where are all the other cops never mind youve got to get out of here wait i read the papers today they said theres seventyfive k in reward money out for the person who killed those people at the bank you dont think duane did that he might be a thief but hes not vicious lloyd grabbed rhondas arm and pulled her toward the door go home he hissed get out of here now what about my money how do i know ill get it she paused then looked in lloyds eyes and gasped youre going to kill him because hes a cop killer ive read about that kind of thing you cant fool me get the fuck out now goddamn you there were footsteps on the walkway outside rhonda screamed duane run lloyd froze then threw himself prone when three shots blew the front picture window to bits he grabbed rhondas legs and yanked her to the floor then rolled to the demolished window and fired twice blindly hoping to draw a return volley two muzzle bursts lit up the lawn the shots ricocheted around the white walls ripping out jagged crisscrosses of wood lloyd aimed at the flashes of red and squeezed off five rounds then ejected the spent clip and slipped in a fresh one he took a deep breath of cordite chambered the top round and charged out the window no dead man on the grass rhondas screams echoing behind him lloyd ran up gardner to sunset rounding the corner he heard a shot and a plateglass window two doors down exploded then he saw a crowd of people on the sidewalk scatter into doorways and out on the street and there he was lloyd watched the man weave through shrieking pedestrians then dart past parked cars and start sprinting east on sunset out of his firing range he sprinted fullout himself closing the gap until he saw rice stick his gun in the passenger window of a car stopped for the light at the next intersection then he ran and aimed at the same time knots of latenight strollers making scared and startled sounds as they got out of his way the running posture was awkward and cut down his speed but he almost had a clear shot when rice got in the car and it took off against the light then he heard approaching sirens and it jolted him away from the escaping car and back to his own jeopardy rice would probably ditch the escape vehicle within blocks shots fired and the location would hit the air huge and goose jesus fred and his hot dogs into the area in force lloyd ran back to silver foxes and found rhonda on the front lawn he forced her into his car but when he pulled out he didnt know where they were going he only knew he was terrified rice knew that he had to ditch the car or keep the car and kill the driver digging the barrel of his harder into the old mans neck he said hang a left at the next corner and park the man obeyed turning onto formosa doubleparking grasping the wheel he shut his eyes and began weeping rice snapped to a new plan tie pops up and leave him somewhere take his money and roll you got rope in the trunk motherfucker the man nodded yes and rice grabbed the key from the ignition and walked back to the trunk he was about to open it when the driver bolted and started running toward sunset he was almost there when a blackandwhite pulled to the curb on the opposite side of the street two doors up from the car pops down from him the fuzz thirty yards up rice got back in the car this time behind the wheel his head throbbed burned and crackled but he got a message through all of it be calm he turned on the engine and put the fairlane in drive then started to accelerate then he heard the old man screaming police police behind him then the cop car in front of him turned on its cherry lights time stood still then zoomed back to doheny drive and the first time he had dope in his veins rice punched the gas just as the driver of the patrol car got out with his gun drawn caught in blinding headlight glare he stood transfixed rice smashed the nose of his threehundred horsepower battering ram into him at thirtysix miles per hour catching him flush the impact ripped off the grille and a chunk of the fender the windshield went red just like before rice drove blind his foot held to the floor until wind whipped the crimson curtain from in front of his eyes and real vision made him stop the car and get out and run bobby heard the radio voices stop screeching about the chevy and the housetohouse searches that were zeroing in on him and start barking man down sunset and formosa man down man down within seconds sirens were wailing away from him and the choppers took off leaving the bowl motel in darkness and silence knowing it was a stay of execution straight from god he packed all the money into a supermarket bag and walked out the door leaving thes and bible behind on the chair outside the street was deserted and still with no cars moving either way on highland walking south bobby saw why sawhorse roadblocks hung with flashing lights were stationed at all intersections shutting off northbound traffic turning around he could pick out other lighted blockades a block up just past the motel as he stared at the cordon a group of plainclothes cops with shotguns entered the courtyard god had shot him a splitsecond salvation stepping over the sawhorse at the corner of franklin bobby saw the church and sent up a prayer for it to be catholic his prayer was answered when the white adobe building was caught by headlights coming off a side street saint anselms catholic church in large black letters a light was burning in the window of the white adobe bungalow adjoining the church bobby ran to the beacon and rang the bell the man who opened the door was young dressed in black clerical trousers and a polo shirt bobby grimaced when he saw the alligator on his chest and his newwave haircut not mexican and not irishlooking probably a social activist type are you a priest he asked the man looked bobby up and down he stuck his hands in his pockets and bobby knew he was digging for chump change i dont want no handout he said moneys the one thing i got big i want to make a confession you hear confessions yes weekday afternoons the priest said he reached into his front pocket pulled out a pair of glasses and put them on bobby stood under his gaze watching him pick up on his inkstained arms and face and duane rices shirt that hung on him like a tent please father please the priest nodded and moved past bobby onto the sidewalk making beckoning motions bobby followed him over to the church unlocking the door the priest turned on a light and walked inside bobby waited by the door and murmured hail marys then bolted up the steps and anointed himself with holy water from the font by the back pew as he genuflected toward the altar and made the sign of the cross the shopping bag slipped out of his arms a wad of twenties dropped to the floor and he stuffed them into his pockets and walked to the scrim of velvet curtains that separated the confessional booths from the church proper the priest was in the first booth bobby pulled the drapes aside dropped the bag and knelt in front of the partition that shielded him from his confessor the screen was slid open and bobby could see the priests lips move as he said are you ready to make your confession bobby cleared his throat and said bless me father my last confession was about five or six years ago except i heard some confessions when i worked this religious scam i faked being a priest but i always tried to be fair with the sucki mean the people i scammed what i mean bobby leaned his head against the partition when he saw that his lips were almost touching the lips of his confessor he gasped and brought himself back into a ramrodstraight posture muttering hail marys under his breath he got down what he wanted to say in the right order when he heard the priest cough he pressed his palms together and lowered his head then began i am guilty of many mortal sins i worked this phone scam where i impersonated priests and ripped off money in gods name and i pulled burglaries and i fired off lots of low blows when i was a fighter sometimes i rubbed resin on my gloves between rounds so i could fuckso i would waste the guys eyes when i went headhunting i robbed a bank and i raped a woman and i pulled evil sex shit on another woman and i shot a woman and killed her and bobby stopped when he heard the priest chanting hail marys slamming the partition with his palms he shouted you listen to me motherfucker this is my fucking confession not yours silence answered the outburst then the priest said finish your confession and ill tell you your penance the sternness in the kiddieconfessors voice gave bobby the juice to say it the big stuff he finally figured out i got a brother he said younger than me hes weak cause i made him weak i committed a heinous mortal sin with him when we was kids and i been trying to atone for it by looking after him ever since when what i should have done was cut him loose years ago so he could get balls on his own i always felt guilty about hating him cause i knew that riding herd on his ass was killin me too see i always figured that he knew what i did but he was afraid to say it cause of what it would make us then dig tonight i figured out that he just didnt remember cause it was so long ago which means that all this time i sp the priest interrupted his voice impatient and severe like a confessors voice should be dont interpret tell me the sin bobby said it sounding to himself like an old tv judge handing down a life sentence when we was kids i used to tie little bro up so i could go out and play i came back one day and saw that hed wet himself cause he couldnt get up the whole bed was wet and i got righteously turned on and pulled down his pants and touched him and that is your heinous mortal sin after all the other acts you confessed now bobby heard disgust dont you interpret father theyre my sins mine say the act of contrition and ill give you your penance the priest whispered bobby bowed his head and forced the second part of his sentence out in an anglo accent like the old irish sisters had taught him o my god i am heartily sorry for having offended thee i detest all my sins because i dread the loss of heaven and the pain of hell but most of all because i have offended thee o god who are all good and deserving of all my love i firmly resolve with the help of thy grace to confess my sins do penance and amend my life amen well father i grant you absolution the priest said your penance is good deeds for the rest of your life begin soon you have much to atone for go and sin no more bobby heard his confessor slide through the curtains and walk out of the church he gave him enough time to make it back to the rectory then got to his feet and picked up the shopping bag smiling at the weight begin soon rang in his ears on wobbly legs he obeyed the poor box was on the side wall near the rear pews ironclad but too small to hold sixteen k in penance bucks bobby started shoving cash in the slot anyway big fistfuls of cnotes and twenties bills slipped out of his hands as he worked and he was wondering whether to leave the whole bag by the altar when he heard strained breathing behind him looking over his shoulder he saw duane rice standing just outside the door his high school yearbook prophecy crossed his mind most likely not to survive and suddenly duaneo looked more like a priest than the puto with the alligator fag shirt bobby dropped the bag and fell to his knees rice screwed the silencer onto his and walked over he picked up the bag and placed the gun to the sharkmans temple bobby knew that defiant was the way to go splitsville he got in a righteous giggle and duhnduhnduhnduhn before rice blew his brains out joe sat in a booth in ben franks coffee shop forcing himself to eat a cheeseburger platter through the tinted plateglass window he watched anne talk into a pay phone in the parking lot he tried to read her lips but she was too far away and distant siren blare from the east kept distracting him the food that he figured would calm him down didnt the vette ditched on a side street two blocks away had his prints all over the wheel and dashboard the copter lights and sirens made the hollywoodstrip border area feel like a war zone the thrill of mastering the stick shift in a stolen car was dead and anne had now fed a dozen quarters to the phone trying to connect with her good music friends who would help them out the black pimps at the next table were talking about a shootout on gardner and barricades and cops with shotguns up by the hollywood bowl one of them kept repeating righteous fucking heat and joe knew he was digging it because the heat wasnt directed at him every word every bit of noise from the war sounds to waitresses clanking dishes brought back stan kleins face just as he stuck in the knife that was bad but he knew it was only a delayed reaction something like shock what made it terrible was his music turning on him and death was a thrill on suicide hill bopping in his brain along with pictures of the man he killed joe felt his insides start to turn over he jumped up bumping the table knocking his food on the floor the pimps laughed when french fries flew onto a passing customers legs and joe ran to the bathroom and vomited his meal into the sink holding the wall with one hand he turned on the faucet and doused his head with cold water his stomach heaved and his chest expanded and contracted with short blasts of breath he looked at himself in the mirror then turned away when he saw bobby just like he always looked after getting his ass kicked at the olympic standing upright he gave himself another dousing then wiped his face with a paper towel and walked back into the restaurant a busboy was cleaning up the spillage by his table the pimps snickered at him joe sidestepped the mess and ran out the door the cashier yelling what about your check on the sidewalk he looked for anne she wasnt by the pay phone and she wasnt in the parking lot then he saw her across the street upstaging a group of hookers with a pelvisgrinding boogie aimed at passing cars joe started to jaywalk across sunset a mercedes stretch limo pulled up in front of anne and she got in the stretch hung an immediate right turn and joe ran rounding the corner just in time to see it park halfway down the block walking over he heard male sex grunts shooting out of the backseat then a disco tune smothered the groans and the chauffeur got out and stood by the car trying to look cool about the whole thing with anger blotting out all traces of stan kleins death mask joe retreated to a dark front lawn to play watchdog the limo wobbled on its suspension for half an hour the musical accompaniment going from disco to reggae joe moved back and forth between pinsandneedles alertness and noddingout sleepiness total exhaustion was dropping over him when a door slammed and anne began skipping up to the strip when she passed him joe said you really rocked that stretch any bitch that can rock a benz fender to fender has got to be a pro anne squinted into the darkness when joe walked up to her she said i told you i could give sex and not sacrifice my karma and if you give sex for money you might as well do a good job and i wasnt leaving you i was coming back to bfs joe snickered imitating the pimps at the coffee shop thats because you need a man to tell you what to do okay ill tell you what were gonna do how much did that scumbag in the benz give you a cnote groovy were gonna use about seventy of it to check into that motel next to bfs you check us in ill follow you back dig anne did a nervous foot dance now youre starting to talk like a tough guy people change all right but that trick just told me about this allnight openhouse party at an exec producers place i used to trick regularly with the guy when i worked outcall hes a video heavy and he really liked me i can get some money there i know i can joe shook his head first were getting a flop come on without a word anne led the way back to the strip joe saw that she looked dejected but was secretly glad hed taken charge from the rear of the ben franks parking lot he watched her hit the motel office pay the night clerk and glom a key then walk around to the street and into the courtyard when the clerk sighed and returned to his paperback he followed she was waiting for him in the doorway of a downstairs unit one hip cocked one elbow resting on the doorjamb looking like an evil little girl born to fuck she smiled and shifted her weight her preppy shirt fell away and revealed huge dark hollows across her stomach joe moved toward her to smash the pose and make her real anne resisted the soft kisses on her neck and the softer hands that tried to stop her hips from gyrating holding herself rock still she said whores dont respond to kindness whores rut joe said hush slid his hands under her shirt and traced soft circles on her back anne sighed then caught herself and said whores dont make love whores do the dirty dog deed her own wordplay made her giggle and press her hands to her mouth and joe bit at her neck until she started to squeal uncontrollably an upstairs voice called out go lovebirds go and anne began to cry joe didnt know what the tears meant so he picked her up and carried her to the bed applause and catcalls rained down as he shut and bolted the door when he turned around anne was naked and he was crying himself the smell of decomposing flesh hit him the second he walked in the door lloyd turned to rhonda morrell and said wait here then shot a look at an arched entrance hall crowded with video equipment drawing his he walked in the direction of the stench it was a dead man who matched rhondas description of stan klein he was lying in the middle of a large living room filled with electrical equipmentvcrs tvs computer terminals and video games his corpse was drained of blood the handle of a switchblade was extending from his stomach and the carpet beneath him was caked thick with dried blood a small caliber automatic was in his right hand the knife wound spelled death by stabbing the smell and body drainage indicated that the murder had taken place at least twentyfour hours prior lloyd held a handkerchief to his face and knew that this night would never be over he walked to rhonda still standing by the door go identify the body try not to get hysterical is that what that awful smell is smart girl am i under arrest im holding you as a material witness give me shit and ill fabricate a felony to keep you off your back for years you almost got me killed be grateful that im a sensitive cop rhonda gave lloyd a slow onceover you look spooky really weirded out when can i go home later go identify the stiff rhonda walked into the living room and let out a ladylike shriek lloyd found a phone in the entrance hall and dialed hollywood station dutch peltz answered lapd and lloyd could tell from his hollow tone that he was scared its lloyd dutch what is it its fucking all coming down crazy dutch said there was a shootout on sunset and gardner both perpetrators got away and one of them commandeered a car then ran down one of my men with it he died at central receiving the

he was able to answer i dont know where the fuck i am listen have any apbs been issued no the white man signed into the motel under an obvious aliasjohn smith lloyd marshaled his thoughts deciding not

handcuffed rhonda to the steering column and said ill be no more than half an hour while im gone think about rice and his girlfriend and where shed go if she were scared i think better without handcuffs too bad i dont trust you and with rice on the loose youre in danger thats a laugh he didnt drag me all over town and handcuff me lloyd slammed the car door and walked into the station a uniformed reserve officer noticed him immediately handed him a sheaf of papers and said captain peltz said to tell you that hes busy but he sent the other reservist to get your paperwork heres a memo and the stats on that clown who wants to talk to you hes in a holding cell lloyd nodded and read the memo first to det sgt l hopkins robhom from det lt e hopper west valley vice sergeantregarding your

through percentage arrangement with blank bank checks assumed by informant to be stolen different informant states that eggers has also paid debts with blank check lotspast six weeks or so hope this helpshopper feeling the connection breathing down his neck lloyd turned to a rap sheet in dutchs handwriting shondell tyrone mccarver mn aka soul aka daddy soul aka sweet daddy soul aka soul king aka sweet king of soul conv poss dang drugs armed rbry paroled clean sincedp shaking his head he looked at the officer and said bad nigger the reservist said more the jive type good crank the door in sixty seconds then lock it again the officer aboutfaced and walked to the electrical panel and lloyd strode through the muster room to the jail area passing the framed photographs of hollywood division officers killed in the line of duty he pictured another frame beside them and the station hung with black bunting he knew he was pumping himself up with anger to fuel his interrogation and that it wasnt workingat am on the longest night of his life all he could drum up were the motions except for some babbling from the drunk tank the jail was quiet lloyd saw his man lying on the bottom bunk of a cell on the misdemeanor side of the catwalk the door clanged open a second later and the man shook himself awake and smiled im sweet daddy soul the patriarch of rock and roll he said lloyd stepped inside and the door creaked shut behind him sizing up the man he saw a goodnatured jivehound who thought he was dangerous and might even be not tonight mccarver shondell mccarver smoothed the lapels of his mohair suitcoat another time perhaps lloyd sat on the commode and took out a pen and notepad no you said youve got information and youve got a heist jacket so ill listen to you but catch my interest quick you know i want that reward money you and everybody else talk some brothers i know said you was always good for some rapport cut the shit and get to it mccarver crossed his ankles and laced his fingers behind his head guess they was wrong hows this for starters bet you dont know how the guys who pulled them kidnap heists snapped to the two girlfriends that safe to say lloyds exhaustion dropped his head buzzed with the coming of a second mental wind youve got my interest keep talking the heists was my idea shondell mccarver said up till about two weeks ago i had a bouncer job going a temporary gig every other week or so two hundred scoots a night working for these people of the eyetalian persuasion the basic scene was this setup trying to recreate the sporting houses back in the old days you know like in new orleans for a cnote admission you get complimentary coke within reason highclass whores a shot at a few semipro ladies crap game highstakes poker old ali fights on bigscreen tv fuck films nude swimming sauna what where lloyd said im getting to that mccarver said drawing out the words teasingly the spot was a big house in topanga canyon the two bank guys hawley and eggers brought their chicks to the parties they how often were they held every two weeks or so anyway there was these mirrored bedrooms you know for romance they was all rigged for sound and one of my jobs was to listen for good info like stock tips and the like thats where i heard hawley and eggers talking to their bitches and where i figured out hawley was pilfering from his tellers boxes still got your interest mr policeman lloyd remembered peter kapeks mention of hawleys and eggerss large cash withdrawals were parties thrown on october seventeenth and november first mccarver laughed sure were i got a righteous memory for dates how you know that never mind just keep talking anyhow i heard hawley run down his scam to his bitch he told her that greenbacks were left overnight at the tellers cages and lloyd interrupted did you know that greenbacks is a brand name of travelers check slapping his knee mccarver said aint that a riot shit i read that in the paper and it made me fuckin glad i never got to utilize my plan anyhow i think hes talkin cash he tells the bitch that he goes to the bank early on certain mornings gloms the greenbacks from the teller drawers runs a transaction with a duplicate bankbook belonging to some senile old cooze with big bucks doctors tally slips so that it balances out and looks like a cash withdrawalto the cooze who of course is hawley boy see hawley is scared cause the scam only works if the cooze dont get hip to the missing bucks and hes heard the old girls relatives is about to have her declared noncompas mental and grab the fuckin scoots so hawley is pouring his soul out to his bimbo and unbefuckingknowst to himme lloyd looked up from his notepad what about eggers mccarver said im getting to that anyhow i concocted the plan that ultimately got utilized by them guys youre looking for i staked out hawley for days watched him glom them greenbacks thinkin they was cash watched him do his number with the tally slips and bankbook and computer im thinkin too bad theres only one of these scamsters when this bookie workin the house tells me about eggers bein way behind on his vig so i think gifts in a manger and nudge the bookie to nudge eggers into the scam that hawley pulls then i start tailing eggers and damned if he didnt start pulling the same tricks you dig lloyd said i dig but you never saw eggers with cash in his hands right right his hands was out of sight when he did his rippin i just assumed that since he followed hawleys procedure it had to be cash and it was about six weeks ago that you told the bookie to nudge eggers yeah howd you know that never mind keep going anyhow i never told the eyetalians about any of this and i cased the kidnap part of the deal real goodthe bitches cribs the managers cribs the whole shot then i got me a partner then he decided to take off a liquor store and got busted you follow so far im ahead of you lloyd said wrap it up mccarver lit a cigarette coughed and said homeboys a righteous partner a little on the impetuous side but solid except that hes a fatmouth motherfucker which aint as bad as being a snitch but still aint good when i read about my plan gettin utilized i called homeboy at folsom got through cause he got this cush orderly job i said who the fuck you shoot your fat motherfuckin mouth off to he says who me i says yeah you motherfucker cause whoever you blabbed to utilized my plan plus one other and killed four people includin two cops and there is seventy thou in reward bucks on that motherfuckers ass so homeboy tells me he talked to two paddy dudes in the highpower tank at the new countyfrank ottens and chick geyer i figure righteous those are cop killer motherfuckers then i back off and think what if those dudes blabbed to someone else and righteous third or fourth or fuckin fifthhand info was responsible for the utilization of my plan so i call the jail and they tell me ottens and geyer is still in highpower fighting their beefs so big man you find out who ottens and geyer blabbed to and you find your fuckin cop killer now is that a righteous tip or a righteous tip lloyd stood up and stretched what would have cracked the case twentyfour hours before was now stale bread the highpower tank adjoined the ding tank where duane rice was incarcerated until two weeks ago gordon meyers was the night jailer there and he had incurred rices wrath as a member of the overall robbery scheme or for some other reasonstale bread also because meyers was dead and rice was unlikely to live through the night everyone involved in the twisted mess was dead or marked for death including himself thinking inexplicably of louie calderons the kid was just too scared to say no dont let them kill him lloyd looked at mccarver and said a righteously too late tip but ill give you some righteous advice walk real soft around cops because nothings going to be the same with us anymore mccarver said what the fuck and lloyd walked out to his car and handcuffed witness a crew of reservists were hanging black bunting on the front doors of the station as he drove away pulling into his driveway a half hour later lloyd saw a stack of la county interagency records sleeves beside his kitchen door killing the engine he said to rhonda youre staying with me until rice is killi mean captured rhonda rubbed her wrists what if i dont like the accommodations you also mentioned money a while back lloyd got out of the car and pointed to the door later ive got some reading to do you sit tight while i do it then well talk the records sleeves were thick and heavy with paper picking them up lloyd felt comforted by the bulk of the cop data he unlocked the door flicked on the light and motioned rhonda inside make yourself at home anywhere downstairs what about upstairs its sealed off why never mind youre weird just sit tight all right rhonda shrugged and started opening and closing the kitchen cabinets lloyd carried the sleeves into the living room and arrayed them on the coffee table noting that the paperwork came from the la county department of corrections la county probation department county parole bureau and california state adult authority the pages were not broken down by the names of his four suspects and he had to first collate them into stacksone for duane rice one each for the garcia brothers one for anne vanderlinden that accomplished he broke them down by agency with r ampi rap sheets on top then with the sounds of rhondas kitchen puttering barely denting his concentration he sat back to read and think and scheme hoping to pull cold facts into some kind of salvation duane richard rice quadruple cop killer grew up in the hawaiian gardens housing project graduated bell high school had a iq the first of his two arrests was for vehicular manslaughter while working as a mechanic at a beverly hills sports car dealership he lost control of a car he was testdriving and killed two pedestrians he ran from the scene on foot but turned himself in to the beverly hills police later that same night since rice possessed no criminal record and no drugs or alcohol were involved the judge offered a fiveyear prison sentence then suspended it on the proviso that he perform one thousand hours of public service rice shouted obscenities at the judge who retracted the suspension and sentenced him to five years in the california youth authority facility at soledad while at soledad rice refused to participate in group or individual therapy studied martial arts and worked in the facilitys auto shop he was not a disciplinary problem he formed no discernible close prison ties he was not a member of the aryan brotherhood or other institutional race gangs and abstained from homosexual liaisons judged to be a potential achiever with high intelligence and the potential for developing into a highly motivated young adult he was paroled after serving three years of his sentence rices parole officer considered him withdrawn and potentially volatile but was impressed with his hard work as foreman at a midas muffler franchise and his complete eschewing of the criminal lifestyle thus when rice was subsequently arrested on one count of grand theft auto the officer did not cite him for a parole violation mentioning in a letter to the judge that i believe this offender to be acting under psychological duress deriving from his relationship with the woman with whom he was cohabitating rice received a year in the county jail was sent to the malibu fire camp and evinced spectacular bravery during the agoura brushfires his parole officer and the judge who tried his case granted him a sentence reduction as a result of this adjustment and he was given three years formal county probation and released from custody lloyd put the rice records aside and turned to the paper on the girlfriend vanderlinden anne atwater white female dob grosse pointe michigan had a file containing a scant three pages she had been arrested twice for possession of marijuana receiving small fines and suspended sentences and three times for prostitution she was given two years formal probation following her second conviction and bought her way out of a probation violation on her third arrest by informing on a suspected auto thief to lapd detectives shaking his head sadly lloyd checked the date of anne vanderlindens dismissed charge against the date of duane rices gta bust three days from the former to the latter vandy had snitched off the man who loved her the two remaining stacks of paper read like a travelogue on eerie fraternal bonding with even eerier informational gaps robert garcia known during his losing boxing career as bobby boogaloo garcia the barrio bleeder had been a fight manager the owner of a coin laundromat and a hotdog stand while his brother joseph had his occupations listed as asst fight manager asst laundry operator and fry cook the brothers had been arrested only once together for one count of burglary although they were suspected of having perpetrated others once convicted they were sentenced to nine months county time together and served it together at wayside honor rancho at wayside the brothers antithetical personalities rang out loud and clear lloyd read through a half dozen reports by correctional officers and learned that robert garcia was disciplined for attempting to bribe jailers into placing his brother in the soft tank where youthful inmates who might be subject to sexual abuse were housed and that once those bribes were rebuffed he assaulted two prisoners who spoke jokingly of joe as prime butthole released from the disciplinary tank after ten days confinement the barrio bleeder then beat up his own brother telling a psychiatrist that he did it so little bro would get a little bit tougher when bobby was again placed in solitary joe set his mattress on fire so that he would be placed on the disciplinary tier within shouting distance of the brother who protected and abused him those facts were eerie but the absence of facts on the brothers last five years was even stranger based on christine confreys description and r ampi stats the late robert garcia was obviously the shark yet he had no arrests for sex offenses nor was a penchant for sexual deviation mentioned anywhere in his file both he and his brother were placed on formal probation after their kickout from wayside and reported dutifully until their probationary term was concluded yet there was no mention of employment for either man only one fact made sense listed as the garcias known associate was luis calderon lloyd thought the burgeoning fed investigation into calderon right before the bank slaughter sent everything topsyturvy the connection was there just waiting to be made but it wasnt because there was a correctness a sense of inevitability about this spiral of death lloyd shivered with the thought then took the mental ball and ran with it wrapping up the odds and ends of the case into a tight but anticlimactic package after killing the officer with the commandeered car rice traveled by foot to the vicinity of the bowl motel came across bobby garcia on the street where he could not safely take him out then followed him to the church and killed him why the reason was meaningless joe garcia the tall sweetlooking mexican who bank witnesses said didnt shoot anyone was also the puto mexican that rice told rhonda took off with his girlfriend from stan kleins pad the only loose strand in the fabric was klein rice was there to grab his woman presumably armed with a silencered yet klein was killed with a knife joe garcia was there too but he did not read sound feel or in any way play as a killer again louie calderons words echoed dont let them kill him lloyd put down the paperwork and called out rhonda come here rhonda walked in time to talk money she said nodding lloyd watched her sit down in janices favorite leftbehind chair thats right questions and answers but first theres this if other police officers question you you dont mention stan kleins name or anything about this puto mexican you told me about got it got it but why im not sure its just an ace in the hole im working with what are you talking about never mind first question when rice called you today did he mention this mexican guy by name or anything else about him or where he thought he and anne vanderlinden might have gone thats easy no no and no all he said was this puto mexican took off with vandy and youve got to help me find them all right you said rice wanted you to pick up some money did he say where no he just assumed that since you and anne worked outcall together we didnt work silver foxes together ive never met her its just that we move in some of the same circles and know some of the same people and weve both tricked with a lot of music industry biggies besides vandy isnt working silver foxes now she quit two months ago in october how are you so sure of the date welli got duane the information about vandy and stan klein on my lonesome and i thought if he paid for that then maybe hed pay me for a list of all the clients vandy tricked with regularly so last week when i was in the office i looked at her old file and made a list i was going to sell it to duane tonight you know exploit his jealousy i wouldnt call it that do you think if she were scared and broke shed run to any of the men on the list id make book on it theres one guy a producer who used to use vandy for theme parties paid her top dollar hes a really good bet how much for your silence and the list rhonda took a piece of paper from her bodice duanes bought and paid for right i mean you guys are going to kill him sooner or later right smart girl how much an even thousand lloyd got his checkbook from the dining room table and wrote rhonda morrell a check for one thousand dollars when he handed it to her she smiled nervously and said still want me to stick around lloyd looked away from the smile get out he said the door was opened and shut quietly and high heels tapped toward the street lloyd picked up the piece of paper that rhonda had left saw a list of four names addresses and phone numbers then looked at his phone he was reaching for it when an internal voice said think and made him stop obeying he sat down in janices chair still warm from the silver fox he was doomed because he could not kill duane rice in cold blood rice was doomed from all sides and jesus fred gaffaney was doomed within the department he would undoubtedly offer up his evidence on the watts riot killing as a tactic to save himselfa legendary lapd detective as youthful murderer was prime media meat and the department would pay heavily to stonewall the revelation if the high brass capitulated they would be looking to save face by every means possible and he would be dismissed without the early pension deal now being offered while jesus fred himself would keep his captaincy and get shunted to some safe shithole outpost where a new generation of witchhunters would keep him under wraps until his retirement or death if gaffaney went public with his information as civilian or policeman the grand jury would either indict him or not indict him but either way janice and the girls would know and his local celebrity would be exploited to full advantage lloyd thought of the other victims the families of the dead cops hawley and eggers and their disintegrating marriages sally issler and chrissy confrey dropped like hot rocks amidst desperate declarations of future fidelity the bank teller and her loved ones and the shitload of harmless street people who were going to be bait for thousands of cops in an impotent rage because three of their own got taken out and there was nothing they could do about it feeling buried lloyd thought of watts and the fatuous idealism that had carried him through the riot and into the job he had convinced himself that he wanted to protect innocence when he really wanted to crawl through sewers in search of adventure he had sold himself a bill of goods about the just rule of law when he really wanted to revel in the darkness he pretended to despise with his family and women as safety buffers when the dark ate him up to take the edge of failure off his admissions lloyd tried to bring to mind the most tangible evidence of his successthe faces of innocents spared grief as a result of his hardcharger actions none came and he knew it was because their wellbeing was only a rationalization for his desire to plunder the last admission shined a spotlight on the survival plan that was forming in his mind all night lloyd laughed out loud when he realized he couldnt figure it out for one simple reasonhe thought he was the one he wanted to save knowing now that he wasnt he picked up the phone and punched a painfully familiar number hollywood station captain peltz speaking dutchs voice was stretched thin but it was not the griefstricken voice of two hours before trying to sound panicky and apologetic lloyd said dutchman were in deep shit one of your rare dumb statements lloyd what do you want any response on the apbs yet no but theres roadblocks and chopper patrols all over hollywood and weve got rices vehicle a trans am purchased five days ago it was parked a block from where you guys shot it out if hes still in the area hes dead meat did you get i gave you a wrong name dutch joe garcia wasnt in on the heists or the killings i cant go into it but the third man is a guy named klein hes dead rice killed him yesterday dutchs hollow voice returned in force oh jesus god no oh jesus god yes and listen gaffaney and his freaks had his name and package for hours before the bulletin was issued and they dont give a fuck if hes innocent or lloyd all the stats on the robbers say one white man two mex goddammit listen rice is the white man bobby garcia is mexican klein the other dead man is tall and latinlooking and hes dead all weve got is rice on the loose and hes a pro car thief and probably out of the area how sure are you of all this lloyd tried to sound quietly outraged im the best dutch we both know it and i know joe garcia is innocent do you want to help me or do you want one of your men to gun him down a long silence came over the line lloyd imagined dutch weighing the odds of innocent lives intersecting with triggerhappy cops finally he said goddamn you what do you want a wrench hit lloyds stomach he knew it came from manipulating his best friend with an outright lie garcia is most likely running with rices girlfriend he said a blonde white woman in her midtwenties gaffaneys hot dogs dont know about her because i just found out about her myself the garcia brothers have got no family and the one ka in their file is a gun dealer already in custody im assuming theyll run to her friends ive got a list of names and addresses of four likelies i want surveillances on the four pads experienced officers tell them to apprehend garcia and the woman without force another long silence then dutchs voice cold and all business ill implement it ill direct four unmarked units to the pads and have them hold tight until then ill bring in a fresh shift when the daywatch comes on were talking obvious unmarked cars though theres no time to have the men come to the station for their civilian wheels and i want a full report on this guy kleinfast lloyd picked up rhondas list and read it off slowly marty cutler gretna green brentwood roll your own productions altera drive benedict canyon that has to be a houseits all residential down there another no name addressplastic fantastic rock and roll hillcrest drive trousdale estatesthats also all residential the last one is tucker wilson mabery santa monica canyon got it got it these are all fat city addresses wh rices girlfriend is a class outcall hooker these are former customers of hers my source put an asterisk after the trousdale address and she said some exec producer was an especially good bet you take it from there i will what are you going to do lloyd said figure out a way to cover a lot of asses and hung up looking at the door in front of him and the phone by his right hand he knew that the door meant a trip to stan kleins house wiping it free of possible joe garcia prints then firing his into kleins body and retrieving the spent rounds if the stiff moldered for a few more days then the me who performed the autopsy would not be able to determine whether the knife and gunshot wounds had occurred concurrently the quality holes and slugs straight through the body and floor to the probable dirt foundation would when unfound be attributed to the gun of duane richard rice it was an evidential starting point and if maggots ate away kleins face a death picture could not be shown to the bank eyewitnesses there might be no other klein photos available and joe garcias picture most likely a sixyearold mugshot from his burglary bust might not be recognized if he could pleabargain louie calderon into changing his testimony and make sure joe garcia got out of town without being busted or standing in a lineup little bro might survive still looking at the door lloyd knew that it meant ending the night earning mcmanuss necrophile tag desecrating a corpse then crawling in the dirt it had to be done but the more he stared at the door the more it loomed as an ironclad barrier so he picked up the phone hoping his wifes lover wouldnt be roused from sleep and answer his hands trembled as he tapped the numbers and when he got a tone he was sobbing after the third ring a recorded message came on hi this is janice hopkins the girls and i have taken our act on the road but we should be returning before christmas there was a slight pause then pennys voice the woods are lovely dark and deep leave a message at the beep unable to speak through his tears lloyd hung up and called the number again and again until the repetition of the message lulled him past weeping and he fell asleep with the phone in his hands with the bag of money clutched to his chest rice beat a footpath to silver foxes and the trans am stumbling through dark backyards scaling fences and rolling into a camouflage ball every time a chopper light came anywhere near him roadblocks on sunset to his north and fountain to his south fenced him in and as he crouched low and sprinted across one residential street after another he could see cars being searched on the wide expressways but here in a womb of old houses with backyards and apartment buildings connected by blocklong cement walls he was invisible and safe the cops expected him to be on wheels in the three hours since blundering into sharkshit bobby and blowing him away hed stuck to the dark like a night animal working his way deeper into the danger zone taking shelter in shadows and rest breaks every three blocks his head still ached from the coldcock and his vision shimmied when light hit his eyes but the perkdexie speedballs hed eaten just before the oneonone with the cop kept the pain down and juice in his system he could still function and when he got to his car he could still drive and he could still think coming out of a long driveway rice turned his brain into a map and calculated two blocks to silver foxes if his luck was holding his registration papers wouldnt have hit the dmv computer the fuzz wouldnt know the trans am was his and the outcall office window hed blown to bits would give him a shot at some kind of file on vandyand the rock sleazos she might have run to if the office was under guard he was still armed for pig with the the map thinking gave him a new jolt of juice getting itchy to be there he loosened his grip on the bag in order to regrip it for a straight run at his target when it felt lighter to his touch he checked the bottom and saw a big hole sticking his hand in he saw that more than half the money had fallen out catching himself about to scream rice clutched the bag with all his strength and beelined running across the street and sidewalk back through another driveway and yard ignoring a copter light scanning only three houses away he hurtled an ivycovered chain fence and ran out to the street he was about to keep going when a flash of lavender dented his wobbly vision and registered as home rice let his eyes trawl gardner avenue for danger signs there was no one on either side of the street and no cop cars marked or unmarked squinting at the whore building he saw a black tarpaulin covering the demolished front window flipping an imaginary brain switch marked caution he placed the money bag on the ground and memorized its location then took the from his waistband catching his breath he walked to silver foxes there were no lights on in the fourflat rice checked the luminous dial of his watch saw that it was and did a mental runthrough the whoremasters hobnobbing with the fuzz after the shooting getting workmen to do a quick fixup job until the window could be repaired properly getting rid of the incriminating shit then getting out the thought of no files brought him to the point of screaming and he ran to the tarpaulin grabbed the rightside fastenings with both hands and pulled the tarp came loose and crashed to the lawn rice stepped in the window found the wall light and turned it on the dispatch room was a bulletwasted ruin big chunks of white wall ripped out the plastic desk dinged and cracked from ricochets remembering a rolodex rice scanned the room unsuccessfully for it then went through the desk drawers finding nothing but blank paper and rolls of film he stood up to think and saw an oldfashioned filing cabinet just inside the bathroom door all three drawers were locked standing to one side rice closed the door on the barrel of his so that just the silencer was inside the bathroom he fired seven times at the cabinet and soft plops went off like muffled thunder the last shots reverberated off the metal surface and tore the door in half through muzzle smoke he could see the cabinet on its side spilling manila folders digging into them rice saw names typed on side tabs and that the files had spilled out in close to alphabetical order tearing through the rs ss and ts he felt his bowels loosen then vanderlinden annie was in his hands and he didnt know if it was good or bad so he turned off the light and ran with it out to the trans am but it wasnt there land mines booby traps snipers and werewolffaced dogs flashed through his mind and he hit the ground like soldiers in the million old movies hed seen on tv eating curb grass instead of dirt he waited for machinegun ackack and managed to slide vandys file into his pants along with his when no attack came he did a squat run over to the money bag and picked it up then walked slowly toward the fountain avenue roadblockthe eye of his hurricane staying in the shadows of front porches and shrubbery he saw the cordon setup come into focus northsouth traffic on gardner was blocked off with two cops standing at the ready to pass innocent cars through and fire on ones that rabbited eastwest traffic on fountain was being inspected the same way but only at stoplights since the nearest lights were three blocks away on the east and two on the west all he had to do was get south of fountain steal a car and roll rice eyed the barricade and cops twenty yards away the roadblocks had probably been set up right after he plowed the pig on formosa they were figuring him for a car thief and had zipped the area up tight as a drum if they found bobby sharkshit a block off the boulevard they were probably knocking down doors up there sunset and fountain were sealed and probably hollywood and franklin they would not have the men to hit the streets further south and they probably figured he couldnt have made it that far anyway rice swallowed and secured his only three possessions the gun the file and the paper bag of money feeling them bonded to him he lowered himself to the ground and rolled off the corner house lawn to the sidewalk and into the street a dark pavementeating dervish catching sight of the cops with their backs to him he kept rolling gravel digging into his cheeks and shredding the bag until a trail of cash drifted in his wake he rolled until he hit the opposite sidewalk then elbowed his way over the curb and rolled until soft grass kissed his gouged face when he finally felt safe enough to stand up he was on the beautiful front lawn of a beautiful little house midway down a beautiful little block with no barricade at its southern intersection and plenty of beautiful cars parked within stealing distance on the doorstep of the big house anne smoothed joes shirt front and said you look like a real street person ill tell my friends youre a producer that youre scouting chicano groups in the barrio just listen to the music and youll have a good time punk rock boomed inside joe took a long look at the spectacular view the strip winding to the east beverly hills below them glow from swimming pools the only light i dont want to have a good time he said were down to twenty scoots and we need a traveling stake just remember that anne said you got it tough guy and put out her cigarette on an astroturf mat embossed with if you dont rock dont knock she took a deep breath then started in on her signature boogie and pushed the door open following a pace behind joe thought hed been transported back to lincoln heights in the sixties when the vatos and the hippies were waging war and one side of north broadway was bodegas and poolrooms the other side a twentyfourhouraday light showloveindopein while anne bebopped into the scene he hung back and eyeballed for details to prove that it was not and he wasnt having a shockinduced acid flashback the whole downstairs was a pressedtogether mass of people in costumemen in fulldrape zoot suits and nazi uniforms women in gangster moll dresses and girl scout outfits groups of gangsters and molls slamdanced into nazis and scouts while colored lights blipped from the ceiling and different rock videos flashed on screens hung to the four walls the refrain go down go down go down go down blasted from quadrophonic speakers and joe felt his head reel as he scoped out godzilla attacking tokyo and marlon brando tooling on a harley hog while caped musicians genuflected into his exhaust the other screens were out of focus but he could catch people in weird makeup fucking and sucking a conga line of gangsters were facing off against a trio of goosestepping nazis who were kicking molls and scouts out of their way in the direction of a circle of amyl nitrate sniffers and preppy anne cut a path through all of it screeching wheres mel wheres mel knowing she was stone joe stood on his tiptoes and followed her bobbing pink sweater keeping his head down as he pushed past partyers hoping they wouldnt see his face reflected in the lights and know how scared he was at the far side of the room he saw anne break free and talk to a guy in a butlers outfit who pointed her down the hall slipping out of the crowd himself he caught a glimpse of anne entering a darkly lit room joe walked toward the door when he was just outside it he heard anne pleading just two hundred mel my squeeze and i have to leave la youll blow it on blow annie a coarse male voice said and i thought you were with stan k i know for a fact he aint hurtingi bought some vids off him last week stan and i broke up mel it was sort of quick my new guy and i have to leave you remember duane sure disco duane the discount car king your squeeze before klein before your current bimbo you see a pattern there sweetie mel hes crazy and hes after me i dont blame him youre a class act third class but class nonetheless sweetie if i give you money youll just get coked and be broke again quicksville theres complimentary outside have some anne screeched i popped some strange stuff i found and its still on i dont need blow i need money mel laughed youve got to earn it i know anne said i know joe walked away from the door wondering why he felt betrayedanne was a onehour stand at best retreating toward the back of the house the reason grabbed him by the balls shes your witness she saw you kill a man and steal a car and drive a stick shift she doesnt know about you being dominated by bobby she thinks youre as badass as duane rice coming to a small room next to the kitchen joe looked in and saw a guy watching tv with the sound off the guy was strumming an electric guitar while chortling at a beer ad and joe got another whiff of the bad old sixties then double stone hit the tv and he knew it was hallucinogenic bobby was on the screen wearing gloves and trunks crouched in his boogaloo stance joe ran to the tv and fumbled the volume dial the guy put down the guitar and blurted hey man i want it that way joe got the sound on just as bobby the boxer dissolved into a shot of paramedics carrying a sheetcovered stretcher out of a church and garcia is the second person to be murdered in the hollywood area tonight his body was discovered inside a catholic church on las palmas and franklin half a mile from the spot where an lapd officer was hit and run by a man in a stolen car police spokesmen have said that there may be a link to mondays west la bank robbery that left four dead meanwhile a massive the tv blipped to another beer adthis ones for you no matter what youre doing and youand joe saw that the guitar guy had hit a remotecontrol button this ones for you rang out nonhallucinogenically and he knew it was bobbys epitaph he grabbed the guitar from the guys lap and stalked with it back to the party gangsters molls nazis and scouts were arranged in a circle in the middle of the living room the video screens were blank and the strobes were replaced by normal lighting mels coarse voice rose from inside the circle ladies and jelly beans little annie vandy dirty raunchy cokedout and randy does the toohep dance of the dirty prep holding the guitar by the neck joe used the business end as a prod and poked his way into the circle anne was there attempting to gyrate and pull off her sweater at the same time her eyes were glazed and her whole body twitched mel standing beside her in tennis whites was snapping his fingers this ones for you and the shot of bobby in his leopardskin trunks gave joe the necessary guts he roundhoused the guitar at mels head knocking him into a line of zoot suiters and nazis then swung an overhand shot that grazed helmets and snapbrim fedoras before catching the host in the neck mel hit the floor and the partygoers separated and moved backward joe saw that they werent frightened or shocked but that they were digging it and that anne was running for the door holding the guitarweapon by the tuning pegs he stuck it out at arms length and spun around and around on a tiny foot axis moving into the crowd assailing them with glancing blows that set off a chain reaction of shrieks squeals and bursts of applause as the partygoers gave him more and more space the applause became thunderous joe felt a queasy vertigo and realized that the sleazebags loved him screaming bobby he hurled the guitar into the middle of them and ran out the door reeling across the lawn toward a speck of pink down the street he thought he saw an unmarked fuzz car parked in the shadows feeling invulnerable he flipped it the bird and ran until his preppy partner was only a few feet away slowing to a walk he caught up with her and tapped her shoulder when she turned and looked at him with twilight zone eyes he gasped i aint no fucking musician i aint no fucking rock and roll fool sunlight on his face forced lloyd awake the telephone fell from his lap and he bent over to pick it up remembering dutchs promised surveillance deployment he put the receiver to his ear and started to call the hollywood station number then three little clicks came over the line instead of a dial tone and the phone fell from his hands bugged gaffaney lloyd ran outside and looked up and down the block there were no vans on the street and no other vehicles large enough to hold a mobile bugging apparatus the tap was stationary and had to originate in a nearby dwelling eye trawling lloyd saw his familiar landscape of twostory houses and apartment buildings turn menacing his own small colonial seemed suddenly vulnerable surrounded by potential monsters then the most likely monster caught his attention and made him wince the old spanishstyle building next door recently converted to condos lloyd ran into the entrance vestibule and checked the mailboxes only one unitwas without a name he walked down the hallway feeling his rage escalating as the numbers increased hoping for a flimsy door and another shot at sergeant wallace d collins finding a solid doorway with a mickey mouse lock he took a credit card from his wallet slipped it into the runner crack and jiggled the knob the door opened and he entered a musty apartment furnished with only a desk holding electrical equipment calling out collins lloyd reached for his then flinched at the simple reflex and what it meant when no sounds answered his call he moved to the desk and examined the setup it was a simple tapper to outside wires hookup with a tape recorder attached to record calls a red light glowed on the panel by the remote receiver button and a green light and the number flashed on and off under the switch marked messages received shuddering lloyd pushed the rewind button and watched the tape spool spin when it stopped he hit play hollywood station captain peltz speaking filled the empty room bouncing off the walls like a deadpan death decree lloyd pushed the off button gaffaney and his freaks had word on the surveillances and had listened to him sob to the inanimate voices of his wife and favorite daughter and there was nothing he could do to turn it around turning off the recorder and pulling the plug on the bugging device made the powerless feeling worse lloyd walked home the phone was ringing and he picked up the receiver like it was something about to explode yes dutch lloyd and and you owe me a report and that outcall place on gardner was broken into last night the files were gone through and theres fresh largecaliber gunshot holes in the walls and they had to have come from a silencered piece because two of my men were stationed at a roadblock half a block away a ford ltd was reported stolen on the adjoining block and theres no reports from the first surveillance shift i just dispatched daywatch units to relieve them so thats covered and lloyd hung up listening to dutchs angry litany had been like watching two trains heading toward each other on the same track both on lockedin automatic pilot all he could do now was patrol the wreckage and hope for survivors rice steered the ltd through the winding roads of trousdale estates his vision was going blurry again and he had to hold vandys file up to right in front of his eyes in order to read the address driving with one hand he remembered his first three possibilitiesbig dark houses with fuzzmobiles parked across the street if he hadnt given each pad a slowaroundtheblock circuit hed be dead this approach had to be just as cautious by squinting until tears came into his eyes he was able to pick out hillcrest he tried to make his brain into a map like he did in hollywood then flashed that that only worked when you had some idea where you were slowing to a crawl he squinted for street signs there werent any trousdale was strictly for people who knew where they were going he was about to scrounge the glove compartment for a street atlas when an unmarked matador passed him in the opposite direction so plastic fantastic had to be nearby rice drove slowly watching the matador hazily disappear in his rearview mirror straining to read house numbers was futile making the blurring worse and causing head pounding and stomach cramps on top of it pulling to the curb he got out and walked his legs were wobbly but he was able to move in a straight line thinking in a straight line was harder and he kept wondering why the cop car had split giving him a clean shot finally he gave up thinking and kept walking the front lawns he was passing looked soft and cushiony and every time the green shined through his tear blur he started to yawn reaching into his shirt pocket for the last of the speed he saw that hed already swallowed it and snapped that squinting at addresses from the sidewalk was no better than from the car and twice as dangerous he was about to go back to the ltd when strangely dressed people started walking across an especially beautiful stretch of grass he cut over to meet them and they slid past him in a jet stream that reminded him of taillights on a freeway at night he grabbed at their shadows and spoke to what he could see of their faces vandy vanderlinden you know her you seen her he said it a dozen times and got nothing but hoots and catcalls in return then the people were gone and there was green grass in all directions rice heard breathing in front of him and rubbed his eyes so he could see who he was talking to the absence of tears gave him back most of his sight and his eyes honed in on two big men in windbreakers when he saw that they were aiming shotguns at him he reached for the the butts of their weapons crashed into his head just as he remembered hed left his piece in the car he was on the main drag of hawaiian garbage running red lights on a dare trying to break his old night record of nine straight everything was dark red and very fast and he knew he could go on forever everything was also very warm getting warmer as the string of reds extended then everything went cold and his eyes were forced open and someone was wiping water from his face he knew he was standing that he was being held upright his old snapped in on scrub bushes dirt and a cement embankment that stank of chemicals he knew immediately that he was at suicide hill a fuzz type in a cheapo suit stepped in front of him blotting out his view of the terrain the grip on his arms tightened rice saw a weird lapel pin on the fuzz types jacket and a python in his right hand and knew he was going to die he tried to think up a suitable wisecrack but she was a stone heartbreaker came out instead and i loved her was about to come out but three slugs from the magnum hit him first lloyd waited in the thirdfloor attorney room of the main county jail he had a perjury script in his jacket pocket stan kleins rap sheet in one hand louie calderons arrest report in the other klein had two convictions for possession of marijuana back in the early seventies and likable louie had been booked for assault on a police officer so far the survivor patrol was survivingat least on the basis of planning strategies and circumstantial facts and the more he looked at kleins mug shot the more he resembled joe garcia a jailer ushered calderon into the room and pointed him toward the chair across the table from lloyd his face was bruised and stitched from the metro beating but he walked steadily and his soft brown eyes were clear he looked like a man capable of making smart snap decisions lloyd stood up and stuck out his hand calderon sat down without grasping it what do you want he said lloyd slid stan kleins mug shot over to him i want to save joe garcias ass from the gas chamber and help you beat your assault beef do you know this man calderon glanced at the snapshot and shook his head no who is he hes the third member of the robbery gang his name is stan klein aka stan man hes taking the fall for joe garcia and hes a longtime known associate of yours comprende homeboy calderon narrowed his eyes he gonna lie down for a frame drawing a finger across his throat lloyd said hes dead have you made a statement to anyone here or back at rampart no i just kicked loose with the names you should knowyou were there if this joker klein is eightysix how you gonna make him for the heists and what the fuck do you want savoring likable louies wariness lloyd said rice killed klein bobby garcia is dead shot by rice last night joe and rice are still out there rice wont last much longer but joes got a chance heres the pitch i give you a little fact sheet on klein you memorize it you shut your mouth until you get word that rice is dead i know hes a smart guy but the heat is huge and no cop is going to let him see due process when hes dead you talk to the das investigators who are going to start hounding your ass as soon as i submit my report to them you tell them that you sold the hardware to rice and that he told you that he was forming a ganghim bobby garcia and klein got it calderon leaned forward whats in it for me and whats in it for you leaning forward himself lloyd said louie theres a lot of dead people out there and most of them are cops and you supplied the guns that killed them youre dead and buried the feds have got your number the regular lapd and the freak cops have got it ive got it bobbys dead and rice is as good as dead and the da is going to look for someone to crucify on this thing and its going to be you pale now calderon plucked at his stitches until blood trickled out when he saw what he was doing he stopped and stammered yyyeah bbbut what do you want lloyd said to see you and joe get out of this alive heres the rest of the pitch ive got a little scenario for you to memorize before you talk to the da how you fingered joe garcia because he stiffed you on some burglary goods stuff like that you play it right and the da and his boys will buy your story and i go to the da and tell him how those metro bulls beat the confession out of you and i clean all the incriminating shit out of your pad and i get nate steiner to defend you if you go to trial which you probably wont because the da will not want me to testify in court against other officers id lay three to one that if you cooperate with me youll walk calderon slammed the tabletop with clenched fists hopkins nobody does something like that for nothing what do you fucking want smiling lloyd took the survival script from his pocket and laid it on the table i dont want anything if youre as smart as i think you are youll believe me he stood up and stuck out his hand and this time calderon grasped it and said crazy lloyd hopkins jesus christ lloyd laughed im no savior one more thing have you got any idea where joe would run to if he figured the heat was off likable louie thought for a moment then said the guitar shop on temple and beaudry hes sort of an amateur musician and sooner or later hell show up there he put the two pieces of paper in his shirt pocket and added memorize then flush lloyd buzzed for the jailer to return on his way out the door he pointed a cockedgun finger at calderon and said support your local police now the shit work lloyd drove to the western costume company and purchased a highquality black wig and full beard then drove to stan kleins mount olympus villa a fresh morning newspaper indicated that the pad was untampered with since last nights prowling with rhonda steeling himself with a deep breath and a handkerchief around his nose he picked the lock and walked in the smell was awful but not overpowering lloyd gave the corpse a cursory glance then donned gloves and went to work first he found the central heating and turned the temperature up to eightyfive then he stripped to the waist and wiped all the downstairs touch and grab surfaces visualizing the kleinricegarciavanderlinden confrontation all the while finally deciding that musician joe never made it to the upper floor the heat and the increased odor of decomposition it created were oppressive and he gave up his wiping after a peremptory runthrough leaving the video gadgets surrounding kleins body alone with potential garcia latents in all probability eliminated lloyd tossed the house for photographs of stan klein drenched in sweat he opened drawers and tore through dressers checked the bureaus in all three bedrooms the upstairs yielded a half dozen polaroids that looked recent and the living room two framed portrait photos lloyd placed them by the banister then took a pen and notebook paper from his jacket and jogged up to the master bedroom to write with the door shut and the airconditioning on full he wrote for three hours detailing his investigation of the first two robberykidnaps and captain john mcmanuss assigning of him to the picowestholme robbery homicides this account was factual the rest of the report comprised a companion piece to his script for louie calderon and stated how calderon under physical duress gave the names duane rice bobby garcia and joe garcia to sergeants wd collins and kr lohmann later partially recanting his statement to him stating truthfully that stanley klein was the third man and that he had named joe garcia for revenge on an old criminal grievance omitting mention of rhonda morrell he concluded by stating that he had discovered stan kleins body and that a scrap of paper beside the corpse led him to silver foxes and his still unaccountedfor shootout with duane rice attributing his delay in reporting the body to a desire to remain mobile and assist in the active investigation lloyd signed his name and badge number then sent up a prayer for lackluster forensic technicians to aid him in his lies the smell was now unbearable lloyd turned off the airconditioning and heat then went downstairs and put on his shirt and jacket seeing that the body had bloated at the stomach and that the cheeks had rotted through to the gums he tossed the wig and mustache at the pile of video tapes then found a pluggedin stereo and turned on the fm full blast the noise covered the three desecrated gunshots with ease and he forced himself to look at the damage as he hoped the entry wounds got lost in the overall decomposition knowing he couldnt bear to crawl under the house for the expended rounds lloyd turned off the music and sent up another prayerthis one a general mercy plea then he got out hyperventilating when fresh sane air hit his lungs now the loose ends lloyd drove to hollywood station in the parking lot he put the report in an envelope and wrote captain arthur f peltz on the front then left it with the desk officer who told him that there was no word on the whereabouts of duane richard rice and that the dragnet was still in full force the funereal air of the station was claustrophobic from a street pay phone lloyd called the office of nathan steiner attorney at law and asked for a ballpark figure on a murder one defense steiners head clerk said k minimum hanging up lloyd figured that with a police discount he could swing it now the scary part lloyd fed all the change in his pockets to the phone and dialed janices frisco number grateful that the voices he would be speaking to wouldnt be able to answer back holding his breath he heard hi this is janice hopkins the girls and i have taken our act on the road but we should be returning before christmas and the woods are lovely dark and deep leave a message at the beep the beep went off lloyd let out his breath and said take your act south before i do something crazy youre all ive got left then he drove home and walked upstairs to the bedroom he had kept inviolate since his wife left him two years before there on a dustcovered bed he fell asleep to wait for survival or oblivion eight hours after executing his only sons executioner captain fred gaffaney sat down in his study and began the writing of his last will and testament the execution weapon rested on the desk beside him and he breathed cordite residue as he put to paper his bequest cash amounting to slightly over twenty thousand dollars the house its furnishings and his two cars to the church of jesus christ christian the magnum loomed at the corner of his vision and he tried to recall bible passages that dictated suicide excluding heaven and meeting the savior verses came and went but none stuck and the was still there finally he gave up trying and accepted the fact only catholics bought suicide as an exclusionary sin and they could not justify it with biblical references it was an acceptable out for a warrior christian with nowhere else to go looking over his words gaffaney saw that they took up only one yellow legal page he had written accident reports ten times that long and he didnt want to pull the trigger on a note of brevity he thought he could perform the execution as a ritual that affirmed the rule of law but when lohmann and collins tossed duane rices body into its sewage bed grave he knew that he had violated everything he believed in and that that apostasy demanded the death sentence knowing also that the condemned deserved reflection before their sentence was carried out he allowed himself the mercy of returning to suicide hill in the fall of he was a rookie then working daywatch patrol out of east valley division twentysix years old with a wife and baby son his beat included the sepulveda va hospital and half his duty time was spent ferrying sad old soldier boozehounds from the wine bars on victory boulevard back to their domiciles the other half writing traffic citations it was boring police work for a young man who knew only one thing about himselfthat he was ambitious there was an old wino who kept escaping the domicile to get bombed on white port and pass out religious tracts to the teenaged gangsters who inhabited suicide hill at night the local officers respected him because he refused to accept welfare and stuck the va with the full tab for his room and board he was a tall germaniclooking man with haunting blue eyes and the tracts he distributed emphasized a warrior jesus christ who loved his followers fiercely and exhorted them to strike down evil wherever they saw it the wino was a brilliant storyteller and the gangsters liked to get him juiced and incite him to tall tales he always obliged and he always weaved sermons into his stories ending them with a handing out of leaflets emblazoned with a cross and a flag to officer fred gaffaney irish catholic atheist the wino was a pathetic crackpot he grudgingly followed the implicit division edict of never busting him for plain drunk but he would not listen to his stories for a second thus when the wino approached him one afternoon with a feverish account of a bunch of demon dog members out to kill him he turned a deaf ear gave him fifty cents for a jug and told him to get back to the domicile a week later the winos body was found scattered all over suicide hill he had been drawn and quartered the investigating detectives reconstructed his death as being caused by four motorcycles taking off simultaneously each with one of his limbs tied to the rear axle the me reconstructed that he had been decapitated after his death and officer fred gaffaney reconstructed himself as a coward and did not come forward with his information on the demon dogs because it would hinder his career the anonymous tip on the dogs that he sent to robbery homicide division two torturous weeks after the killing did not lead them to the slayers or ease his conscience the winos blue eyes singed him in his sleep booze and illegally procured sleeping pills didnt help and he could not talk about it to a single human being so he sought out god returning to the old catholic fold helped but he could not take his winovictim with him to the confessional liquor in concert with the church helped a little more but the blue eyes and the dogs got a contract out on me officer fred and you gotta help me were always a half step away ready to pounce just when he thought everything was going to be all right the job helped most of all but still did not provide a panacea he served working long overtime hours writing laborious reports on the most minor occurrences afraid that any parcel of information left unreported would lead to spiritual catastrophe and death a few superior officers regarded him as fanatical but most considered him a model of police meticulousness spurred by constant encouragement he climbed the ladder he became a sergeant and was assigned to the detective division then passed the lieutenants exam and went to robberyhomicide the church the wino and cross and flag nightmares simmered on his souls back burner pushed there by ambitiousness and a barrage of rationalizations his drive for power was atonement his stern rule over lax libertine underlings was a sword thrust that would move the blueeyed specter himself encouraging of his son to become a policeman was evidence that the atonement would pass to a second generation of gaffaneys his wifes death of cancer gave a weight of grief to the guilt procession and when he buried her he felt that the sad old storyteller had finally been put to rest then he met lloyd hopkins and the outofcontrol hot dog blew everything to hell he had of course been hearing about him for years taking in accounts of his exploits with amazement and disgust but never considering him worth knowing from the standpoints of career advancement or robberyhomicide efficacy then assigned as supervisor of his sector thad braverton gave him the word hopkins is the best give him carte blanche the undercutting of his authority had rankled but crazy lloyds actions made it pall by comparison hopkinss life was one giant sword swipe at real and imagined evil the terror and guilt and rage that burned in his eyes were laser beam incisions into that part of him where suicide hill was engraved like gang graffiti he had to fight what hopkins was so he tracked down the cross and flag leaflets and was born again it worked he carried the winos message took comfort in its call to duty he studied the bible and prayed and found fellow officers who believed as he did they followed him and when he passed the captains exam and was flagged for the iad exec position he knew that nothing could stop him from achieving a spellbinding selfhood preordained by god and a martyred madman twenty years dead then hopkins took out the hollywood slaughterer the boldness of his measures inspired awe among the men of the bornagain officer corps and had hopkins walked into one of their prayer meetings they would have genuflected before him as if the sexcrazed lunatic were christ himself his solving of the havillandgoff homicides a year later again brought the men to their figurative knees he became a rival spiritual patriarch who was dangerous precisely because he did not covet spiritual power and the means to his destruction had to be divinely sought and given hours and hours were spent praying he spoke to god of his hatred for hopkins and got small comfort his strategy to upgrade his sons school records and gain his admission to the academy worked and steven graduated and was assigned to west la division prayer and the appointment of a secondgeneration gaffaney to the department helped diffuse hopkinss hold on his mind as did the building up of the interdepartmental dirt files then his prayers were rewarded and promptly backfired lamar dayton a devonshire division lieutenant and longtime bornagain joined the corps and told him of whoremaster hopkins and his watts baptism of fire circumstantial verification of national guard records made the final message ring clear hopkins not himself was the divinely gifted policemanwarrior and what drove him was not god but awful selfwilled needs and desiresall mortal in nature gaffaney stood up and looked at the clock above his desk his stay of execution ruminations had consumed an hour and were still not one hundred percent conclusive he thought of things to be grateful for he and steven had been close in the days before his death and steve had confided that he had resisted the retired deputys fencing imprecations turning over a new leaf that was comforting as was the fact that he had not compounded his selfhatred by letting hopkins perform the execution hopkins and execution filled in the missing percentage points and extended the stay of sentence to the indeterminate near future gaffaney looked at the magnum and suddenly knew why he had stolen his death weapon from an lapd source only lloyd hopkins would be crazy enough and bold enough to follow the gun to its source and back to him regardless of the consequences and devil take the hindmost he had taken the magnum from a wilshire division evidence room in full view of a half dozen officers because he wanted to sacrifice himself to the man he most admired and envied thinking of suicide hill and mercy gaffaney carried his three armfuls of files into the bathroom and dumped them in the tub then walked downstairs and grabbed a bottle of bourbon off the bar returning upstairs with it he doused the pile of paper and dropped a match on top his hold on scores of men went up in flames and he waited until all the data was obliterated before turning on the shower the fire hissed sizzled and died and gaffaney walked back to the den to wait for his executioner awakening from eight hours of dreamless sleep lloyd rolled off the dusty bed and walked to the window to see if it was night or day creeping sunlight from the eastern horizon told him it was dawn and the paperboy hurling the times at the front door told him that it was neither survival nor oblivion simply time to get on with it after shaving showering and dressing in his favorite sport coatslacks combo lloyd sat at the dining room table and wrote out a declaration that two weeks before he would have considered incomprehensible gentlemen this letter constitutes my formal resignation from the los angeles police department it is tendered with regret but not under a state of emotional duress the reasons for my resignation are threefold i wish to devote a good deal of time to my family i have incurred the enmity of several highranking officers and events of the recent past have convinced me that my effectiveness as a homicide investigator is drastically diminished it is my wish to be assigned to either clerking or nonfield supervisory duties until my twentyyear anniversary comes up next october i am grateful for the departments offer of early retirement with full pension but feel it would be dishonorable to accept it without serving the required twenty years respectfully lloyd w hopkins bracing himself for the outside world lloyd put the resignation letter in his pocket and walked to the door hoping the times would carry news of one mans death and another mans safe passage throwing the door open the headline beamed up at him suicide hill suicide ends fourday murder spree leaning into the doorway lloyd let the subheading of cop killerrobber takes own life at fabled youth gang meeting ground sink in then with his brain screaming first gaffaney then no he read the entire account los angeles december the los angeles police department announced today that the greatest manhunt in la history has ended with the suicide of multiple murderer duane richard rice the mastermind behind mondays west los angeles bank robbery that left four dead rice twentyeight a career criminal with convictions for vehicular manslaughter and grand theft auto is believed also to be responsible for tuesday nights hitandrun murder of lapd officer edward qualter and the fatal shootings of the gangs two other members robert garcia and stanley klein bringing the total of his victims to seven at a late night press conference at parker center lapd chief of detectives thad braverton explained how the cooperation of an anonymous associate of the gang gave police the means to reconstruct the reign of terror it was a classic case of a falling out among thieves the chief said rice garcia and klein were the perpetrators of two wellplanned robberyhostage forays in the valley the week preceding the picowestholme bank robbery which we view now as having been undertaken by rice partially out of a desire for revengeone of the bank employees gordon meyers a former los angeles county deputy sheriff was his jailer during a recent incarceration braverton went on we do not know precisely why rice wanted revenge but that he did is a safe assumption our witness in custody is the man who sold the robbery gang their guns and he a longterm associate of the three men states that distrust ran deep among them the other men also possess criminal recordsgarcia for burglary klein for possession of narcotics klein was also heavily involved in video pornography circumstantially we believe that rice shot and killed both garcia and klein his motive being a desire to keep their share of the money from the picowestholme robbery there is also an evidential corroboration for thisour chief ballistics officer arthur cranfield has examined thecaliber slugs taken from the bodies of garcia klein and rice and he states conclusively that they came from the colt armyissue found in duane rices hand when patrolmen discovered his body lying in the sepulveda wash lloyd scanned the rest of the article a hyperbolic spiel about tragedy law and order and the forthcoming lapd funerals the total picture bombarded him as a patchwork of victory and defeat survival and denial his report to dutch the forensic subterfuge at stan kleins pad and louie calderons testimony had been if not actually believed accepted in the spirit of letting sleeping dogs lie but the duane rice suicide was preposterous on tuesday night dutch had said that twos were recovered at the bowl motel while his own gun had supplied the stan klein death shots if rice had been killed with his own piece which was doubtful because he never would have relinquished ithe didnt pull the trigger himself lloyd felt a queasy rage overtake him rice had deserved to die he had contemplated his coldblooded murder himself and the man who most likely killed him held a death sentence over his own head running red lights and siren to parker center he couldnt believe he was crazy enough to take the both of them out in one fell swoop the central crime lab was bustling with technicians lloyd found artie cranfield in his usual workday posture hunched over a doubleplated ballistics microscope knowing that nothing short of an air raid would force arties head up he said tell me the real dope on klein and rice whats braverton stonewalling artie came up smiling hello lloyd would you repeat that lloyd smiled and cleared his throat artie said not here and pointed to his office lloyd walked in and five minutes later artie joined him shutting the door he said straight business nodding affirmatively lloyd said a bunch of fixes are in i found kleins body doa knifing i fired three shots from my into his stiff so i know that same gun stuff in the papers is bullshit did you process the evidence on rice artie gave his four walls a furtive look then said i was there at the autopsy the me handed me three spents dug them out of rices chest the rear of the jackets were nicked right where the firing pin would make contact very distinctive and very familiar i checked ballistics bulletins going back eighteen months bingo matchup to an old unsolved in wilshire division street shooting gun found and held by the wilshire dicks you know to lean on possible shooters with taking the stats in lloyd got the feel of a wild card or big wrong move your conclusions artie do i look dumb one of our guys zapped the copkilling cocksucker anyway i called john mcmanus and told him what i found and he said keep it zipped officer a half hour later big thad shows up hands me three spents and says garcia klein rice case closed capice since i intend to collect my pension i said yes sir so you keep it zipped capice lloydy a technicolor movie of louie calderon guzzling beer and joe garcia strumming a guitar surrounded by hula girls passed through lloyds minds eye he resisted an impulse to grab artie in a bear hug then said do i look dumb no artie said just slaphappy well put i need a favor you always need favors well put ive got a long stakeout coming up processed any speed lately black beauties music to my ears ive got a phone call to make ill see you in five minutes while artie made the speed run lloyd called wilshire detectives his old friend pete ehrlichs answer to his question made wild cardbig wrong move a big understatement at wednesday morning captain fred gaffaney appeared in the wilshire squad room looking uncharacteristically nervous he cracked several uncharacteristic dirty jokes with officers on duty there then demanded the key to the evidence room got it and rummaged through the lockers until he found a python sealed in an evidence bag that also contained a dozen loose shells offering no explanation for his actions he spurned ehrlichs condolences for the loss of his son and walked out of the squad room shaking from head to foot when artie returned with five biphetamine capsules lloyd had gotten his shaking under control after dropping his resignation letter off with thad bravertons secretary he drove to temple and beaudry finding an ace stakeout spot across from the guitar shop he swallowed a black beauty and settled in to await his handpicked survivor soon an amphetamine symphony was ringing in his head gaffaney hopkins two killers doing the doomsday tango unfuckingreal joe balled up the newspaper took a bead on the bright blue sky and hurled the missile of good news straight at the sun street passersby turned to stare at him and he shouted i got a fucking guardian angel and let the ball fall into his hands running with it like a halfback with a hot short pass he headed straight for the motel and anne she was sitting up in bed smoking when he came through the door and smoothed the headline out on the sheet in front of her read it he said bad news and good news but mostly righteously good anne put out her cigarette and read the front page joe sat on the edge of the bed wondering how the fuzz had got it so wrong and why rice offed himself there watching anne read his old song obsession did a brief boogie reprise and death was a thrill on suicide hill anne turned to the second page and joe got curious about how shed react to the story on her old boyfriend and his death hed had her on decreasing coke use for two days now and she was probably as close to being a normal woman as she ever would be would she have the soul to grieve for the crazy motherfucker putting down the newspaper anne lit another cigarette and said wow i thought duane was just a car thief i think that stuff about stan being a bank robber is phony though i think we were together on monday when that bank was robbed joe couldnt tell if she was being cagey or straight you were probably stoned he said he probably split for the heist then came back anne shrugged and blew smoke rings then said wrong baby but who cares also the paper says duane shot stan thats wrong i was there duane stabbed him joe tingled at her mistaken certaintyit meant he could ditch her with a free mind cops screw up sometimes he said or they work things around to fit the evidence they got sweetie what do you want to do you mean in general and about us right anne blew a string of perfect rings and said i like you as a boyfriend but youre too uptight about dope and too macho when we first got together you werent so bad but the more i get to know you the more stern you get like you think violence and manhood are synonymous or something but basically i want to be with you and i want to get back into music i think were a wave we last as long as we last joe bent over and cupped her breasts what about rice he righteously loved you anne caressed the hands caressing her he was a stone loser and you know whats sad karmically he betrayed himself because he said suicide was for cowards thats sad how much of mels money have we got left thinking rip duane rice joe said were almost broke but ive got a buddy holding a guitar of mine and we can get at least three bills for it so lets move is it okay to be out on the streets i think so we got some kind of weird guardian angel and i want to see if the old neighborhood still looks the same at twilight just when the long stint of surveillance was starting to drive him batshit his survivor walked up to the guitar shop window a skinny blonde woman in tow from a distance they looked like a downattheheels couplemodest dreamers in rumpled clothes peering into the glass in search of a dream fix letting them enter the shop lloyd hoped they wouldnt do anything to blow the impression when they walked back out a minute later he was there on the sidewalk waiting joe garcia looked into his eyes and knew anne atwater vanderlinden looked at joe and got the picture secondhand lloyd stepped back toward the curb and put up his hands in surrender peace homeboy he said im on your side anne moved to joes side as he stared at lloyd the tense threeway silence stretched until lloyd put down his hands and joe said what do you want people keep asking me that lloyd said and its getting old you read the papers today joe put an arm around anne she nuzzled into his chest and said maybe hes the guard hes a fucking cop joe blurted seeing a woman pushing a baby carriage past them he lowered his voice crazy lloyd hopkins big fucking deal you dont scare me man lloyd smiled garcia looked like a thirtyyearold teenager trying to impress a high school chick and get a date for the junior prom given what hed been through in the past two weeks the impression was astounding the silence hit again broken this time by joes broad smirk smirking back lloyd hooked a finger at the strangest armed robber hed ever seen joe walked over and lloyd draped an arm around his shoulder and whispered dont be a dumb taco bender let klein take the fall and get the fuck out of la before something goes wrong and dont ask me what i want again or i may have to kick your ass joe twisted free i killed stan klein man i righteously killed him the proud statement hit lloyd between the eyes as truth and he started sensing juice behind the ancient teenagers bravado i believe you tell your old lady were going for a little ride the last of the mechanics were leaving when they pulled up across the street from likable louies onestop pit stop lloyd let them finish locking up and gave them time to get down to sunset then took a crowbar from the trunk ran over and pried the garage door open flicking on the overhead lights the first thing he saw was a lowrider perfection it was a mintcondition chevy ragger candyapple sapphire blue canary yellow top continental kit tuckandroll upholstery lloyd checked the dashboard and grinned the key was in the ignition bonaroo man fine as fucking wine lloyd turned around and saw joe stroking the chevys rear fender skirts anne vanderlinden stood behind him smoking a cigarette and eyeing a tool bin loaded with portable tvs tapping joes shoulder lloyd said are you legit with the greaser act or are you just trying to impress me joe started polishing the car with his sleeve i dont know i righteously dont know what do you know that i righteously know what i dont want to be listen i got a question shoot but nothing about whats going down all you need to know is get the hell out theres loose ends all over the place joe fingered the chevys pinstriping whyd rice kill himself at suicide hill what was he thinking of lloyd shrugged i dont know anne was by the tool bin fiddling with the dials of the tv sets joe could tell that she was dopeitchy looking for something to do with her hands moving his eyes back and forth between his maybe girlfriend and his guardian angel he said hopkins whats with that place i mean youre a cop you must have heard the stories it started out with this dude fritz hill right back in the forties he was a righteous hardball and the hill was named after him lloyd looked out at the street getting nervous because he was a civilian now with no official sanctions for breaking and entering i think most of the story is bullshit he said what ive heard is that back in the fifties and sixties there was an old snitch who used to hang out by the sepulveda wash he pretended to be a religious loony so the local cops and the punks who partied there would think he was harmless he ratted off shitloads of gangsters to the juvie dicks downtown and he got a snitch jacket and got snuffed he was a german guy and his name was fritz something whats the matter homeboy you look sad not sad joe said relieved maybe the keys are in the ignition can you drive a stick can niggers dance only to soul music grab some of those tvs and split joe loaded the trunk and backseat with portable sonys anne stood and watched chainsmoking and shivering when the chevy was filled to capacity he led her over to the passengersside door and lovingly eased her in then returned to lloyd sticking out his hand jailhouse style he said thanks and tell louie ill pay him off someday lloyd corrected the shake in midgrasp my pleasure and dont worry about louie he owes me where are you going i dont know lloyd smiled and said go there fast then dropped joes hand and watched him walk to his chariot the strangest armed robber of all time hit the gas with a flourish and crunched the chevys gears backing out of the garage sideswiping parked cars as he headed south on tomahawk street lloyd turned off the light and shut the door brushing b ampe splinters from his hands when he got to his matador he had a clear view of sunset the chevy was fishtailing it eastbound and anne atwater vanderlinden was standing under a streetlamp dancing with her thumb out tango time lloyd took an inventory of his person punching the seat when he saw that he had forgotten both his newly resurrected and his standard snub nose the only piece in the car was the gauge mounted to the dash and it was too obtrusiveoverkill all the way he had to go to the house first and grab a weapon to show up unarmed for the dance would be suicidal he drove home slowly the amphetamine keeping him hyperalert fear of the confrontation making him dawdle in the slow lane turning onto his block he began composing epitaphs for himself and jesus fred then he saw the moving van in his driveway its headlights illuminating janices persian carpet rolled up against the side door antiques were arranged on the lawn like welcome beacons along with piles of pennys books mine home yes lloyd gasped and punched the accelerator the homecoming dissolved like a mirage and new bursts of death prose kept it pushed down to where it couldnt maim him couldnt destroy his resolve then with miles of obituaries behind him he pulled up in front of captain frederick t gaffaneys house and let it hurt letting his old hotdog persona take over from there mine home him or me lloyd grabbed the shotgun and flipped off the safety then pumped in a shell and walked over to the house the downstairs was dark but dim lights glowed from behind curtained windows on the second floor giving the door handle a test jiggle lloyd felt it click and give he pushed the door open and moved inside the smell of stale cigarette smoke and whiskey filled the living room lloyd padded forward in the darkness the odor getting stronger as a staircase came into shadowy view tiptoeing up it he heard coughing and when he got to the secondfloor landing he saw diffused light glinting off empty liquor bottles strewn across the hallway holding the ithaca at port arms he pressed himself to the wall back first and scissorwalked toward the light source it was a bathroom giving off a different odorthat of charred paper stepping in lloyd saw that the smell emanated from the soggy mounds of blackened folders that filled the bathtub poking the barrel of his shotgun at the top of the pile a layer of soot crumbled and he was able to pick out the stenciled words confidentialneed to know basis a cross and flag logo was imprinted below it a sudden burst of coughing forced lloyd to wheel and aim seeing nothing but the bathroom walls he traced the racking sound down the hall to a halfopen door with total dark behind it he raised his right foot to kick the door flew open and harsh light blinded him he threw the ithaca up into firing position and when his vision cleared he saw that he was muzzle to muzzle with fred gaffaney and a cocked magnum freeze asshole lloyd didnt recognize the voice and could hardly recognize the man it belonged to this was a highranking witchhunter of booze breath sleptin clothes and frazzled nerve ends a bornagain with a threeday beard and a shaky finger on a trigger at half pull a doomsday apparition freeze asshole the second warning came across as hideous selfparody lloyd lowered his shotgun and gaffaney eased down the hammer of the the two weapons fell to rest at their bearers sides simultaneously and lloyd said what are we going to do about this captain stepping back into the study gaffaney waved his gun at the framed lapd group shots on the walls im not a captain anymore sergeant he said his voice regaining its authority i resigned this morning you outrank me i did it to make it easy for you lloyd propped the ithaca up against the doorjamb keeping it within grabbing range im not a sergeant anymore i asked to top out my twenty but theyll never go for it were both civilians that make it easier for you gaffaney looked at a picture of his wife pinning lieutenants bars to his collar my resignation was accepted yours was shelved braverton told me this afternoon he wants you around he wants you around because he loves you lloyd kept his eyes on the magnum that gaffaney dangled by a finger captain were both down the dont call me that goddamn you were both down the river we killed men in cold blood and the department has got the fix in on yours and youve got the fix in on mine and all i want to do is seal the jackets on both deals and go home to my family thats as easy as i can make it gaffaneys rawnerved features went lax his voice went blank you didnt come to arrest me the evidence room charade clicked in as a deliberate big wrong move lloyd let his fingers brush the gauge i thought i could do it but i cant how about it your indictment for mine then i get out of here before something crazy happens gaffaney started shaking his head his arms shook involuntarily as if his entire body were trying to shout his denial the dropped to the floor just as he found his voice no no no no no no no no lloyd made a grab for the magnum he got it in his hands before gaffaney could make a move and had the cylinder emptied just as the string of nos trailed into a weirdly lucid monotone i didnt come this far for you to betray me lloyd slipped the shells into his pocket and tossed the revolver back on the floor then picked up the ithaca and ejected the round in the chamber when the carpet was littered with neutralized weaponry he said why me the witchhunters monotone took on resonance because i was good but youre the best because you were a punk civilian when you killed that man in watts while i was a highranking police officer when i committed murder because the department will never let me be prosecuted because justice in this affair must be total gaffaney paused then said because i love you lloyd moved backward until he bumped the wall youre insane if you think im going to kill you id let you hang me for richard beller before id do that with a ghastly smile as segue fred gaffaney said we both learned the gift of sacrifice late lloyd that happens with selfish men like ourselves im only sorry that our sacrifices have to conflict now tell me in light of this if im insane from the tap on your phone i surmised that you wanted to frame a dead man for joe garcias part in the robberies and killings i held on to the information then this afternoon when i read the paper and saw what you had gotten away with i sent sergeants collins and lohmann to check up on klein he was involved in the filming of pornographic movies on the dates of the three robberies in full view of a dozen witnesses he cannot be connected in any way to luis calderon and a friend of mine in sid said that he died of knife wounds he has in his possession a switchblade whose edges perfectly match a biopsied section of kleins abdomen the handle has joe garcias thumbprint on it no lloyd said in his own doomsday drone no no no no no gaffaney said yes and started ticking off points kleins alibi witnesses wont come forth for fear of their involvement in porno coming to light but questioning the picowestholme eyewitnesses with kleins and joe garcias mugshots should get some interesting feedback and calderon could never get by a persistent grand jury collins and lohmann have duane rices taken from the car he was in when they apprehended him that will contradict bravertons fix had enough you filthy cocksucker lloyd hissed gaffaney spoke softly as a loving parent would to a child i know your guilt and i know you have to expiate it and i know garcia is convenient for that but if we dont follow through on the investigation then it means as policemen we mean nothing lloyd imitated gaffaneys lucid lunatic whisper captain between us weve been hot dogging for over forty years joe garcia is a drop in the bucket compared to all the railroad jobs weve pulled all the laws weve broken youre giving me a song and dance about the law to pump me up to kill you you are stone fucking insane running his fingers over the wall photos fred gaffaney said i heard a human interest story on the radio today a bunch of high school kids found some of the robbery money strewn throughout their neighborhood some inked some not they didnt turn it over to the proper authorities of course they descended on the strip and tried to spend it as fast as they could an offduty sheriffs deputy saw a boy trying to change an inked twenty and got him to talk but by the time a search team was dispatched to the area where the money was found not a single dollar bill could be located you see the kind of world we live in lloyd picked up the and began loading it its a pretty lackluster parable captain tell it to collins and lohmann itll get them jazzed up to do some serious asskicking have you gone forward with your information on garcia anyone beside you and your boys know no not yet why did you burn your files im not a policeman anymore i dont deserve to lead and none of my followers are capable of leading th thats finished snapping the cylinder lloyd said i did what i could garcias got wheels and a head start more than he would have had without me you got anything to say gaffaney frowned rice said she was a stone heartbreaker what do you think he meant i dont know captain for the record you did the right thing he killed your son gaffaney reached out and touched lloyds arm lloyd batted his hand away and said what do you have to say nothing gaffaney said i have nothing lloyd placed the gun in the hands of his old enemy then go out like a soldier but dont take anyone else with you you wont lloyd said no and walked down the hall to the bathroom he was clenching the edge of the tub staring at the cross and flag logo when he heard the shot his hands jerked up ripping out jagged chunks of porcelain and then there was a second shot and another and still another he ran back to the study and found gaffaney on his knees holding the gun and an armful of framed photographs to his chest he was muttering ive got nothing ive got nothing lloyd helped him to his feet the mementos he was grasping made the embrace cumbersome but he was able to get his arms around the sobbing man anyway the simple act felt like mercy for all their lost ones all their stone heartbreakers
