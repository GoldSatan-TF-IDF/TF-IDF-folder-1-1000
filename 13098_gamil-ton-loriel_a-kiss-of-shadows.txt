laurell k hamilton a kiss of shadows the st book in merry gentry series chapter twentythree stories up and all i could see out the windows was grey smog they could call it the city of angels if they wanted to but if there were angels out there they had to be flying blind los angeles is a place where people those with wings and without come to hide hide from others hide from themselves id come to hide and id succeeded but staring out at the thick dirty air i wanted to go home home where the air was blue most of the time and you didnt have to water the ground to get grass to grow home was cahokia illinois but i couldnt go back because theyd kill me if i did my relatives and their allies everyone wants to grow up to be a faerie princess trust me its overrated there was a knock on the office door it opened before i could say anything my boss jeremy grey stood framed in the doorway he was a short grey man four feet eleven inches an inch shorter than me he was grey from his dark armani suit to his buttonup shirt and silk tie only his shoes were black and shiny even his skin was a pale uniform grey not from illness or age no he was a trow in the prime of life just a little over four hundred there were some lines around his eyes along the thin mouth that made him appear mature but hed never be old without the aid of mortal blood and a pretty serious spell jeremy might live forever theoretically scientists say that in about five billion years the sun will expand and engulf the earth the fey wont survive that they will die does five billion years count as forever i dont think so though its close enough to make the rest of us envious i leaned my back against the windows and the thick hanging smog the day was as grey as my boss but his color was a cool crisp grey like clouds before a spring rain what lay outside the window felt heavy and thick like something you would try to swallow but youd never get it down it was a day to choke on or maybe it was just my mood you look gloomy merry jeremy said whats wrong he closed the door behind him making sure it shut privacy he was giving us privacy maybe it was for my benefit but somehow i didnt think so there was a tightness around his eyes a set to his thin welltailored shoulders that said i wasnt the only one in a bad mood today maybe it was the weather or the lack of it a good rain shower or even a good wind would have cleared out the smog and let the city breathe again homesick i said whats wrong jeremy he gave a small smile cant fool you can i merry no i said nice outfit he said i knew i looked hot when jeremy complimented my clothes he always looked impeccable even in jeans and tshirt which he only wore if he absolutely had to be undercover id seen jeremy do a threeminute mile in gucci loafers once chasing a suspect of course it helped that his dexterity and speed were more than human when i thought i might have to actually chase someone a rare occasion i got out the jogging shoes and left the high heels at home jeremy put into his eyes that look a man gives you when hes appreciating the view it wasnt personal but among the fey its an insult to ignore someone whos obviously trying to be attractive a slap in the face telling them that theyd failed apparently i hadnt failed id woken up to the smog and dressed brighter than normal to try and cheer myself up royal blue suit jacket doublebreasted silver buttons a matching blue pleated skirt that was so short it was only a fringe across my thighs underneath the jacket the outfit was short enough that if i crossed my legs wrong id flash the tops of my black thighhighs twoinch patent leather high heels helped show off the legs when youre as short as i am youve got to do something to make your legs look long most days the heels were three inches my hair was a deep rich red in the reflections of the mirrors a color more red than auburn a color that had black highlights instead of the usual brown that most redheads had it was as if someone had taken dark red rubies and spun them out into hair it was a very popular color this year blood auburn it was called in the high court of the fey royalty faerie red sidhe scarlet if you went to a good salon it was actually my natural color until it became popular this year and they finally got the shade right id had to hide my true color id gone for black because it looked more natural than human red with my skin tone a lot of people getting the dye job made the mistake of thinking that sidhe scarlet complements a natural redheads coloring it doesnt its the only true red color i know of that matches a pale pure white skin tone its the red hair for someone who looks great in black true reds royal blues the only things i still had to hide were the vibrant green and gold of my eyes and the luminosity of my skin i used dark brown contacts for the eyes my skinthat i had to tone down using glamour magic just a steady concentration like music in the back of my head to never let down my guard and start to glow humans dont actually glow no matter how luminous they may be no glowing which was why the contacts covered my eyes i also wove a spell around myself like a long familiar coat an illusion that i was just a human with lesser fey blood in my background who had some psychic and mystical abilities that made me a really excellent detective but nothing too special jeremy didnt know what i was no one at the agency knew i was one of the weakest members of the royal court but being sidhe means something even on the weak end of the scale it meant that i had successfully hidden my true self my true abilities from a handful of the best magicians and psychics in the city maybe in the country no small feat but the kind of glamour i was best at wouldnt keep a knife from finding my back or a spell from crushing my heart for that i needed skills that i didnt have and that was one of the reasons i was in hiding i couldnt fight the sidhe not and live the best i could do was hide i trusted jeremy and the others they were my friends what i didnt trust was what the sidhe might do to them if i were discovered and my relatives found out my friends had known my secret if they were truly ignorant then the sidhe would leave them alone and only hurt me ignorance was bliss on this one though i thought that some of my very good friends would see it as a type of betrayal but if the choices were them alive with all their body parts intact but angry at me or dead by torture but not angry at me id take angry i could live with their anger i wasnt sure i could live with their deaths i know i know why not go to the bureau of human and fey affairs and get asylum my relatives would probably kill me when they found me but if i went public and aired our dirty laundry for the world media they would most definitely kill me and theyd kill me slower so no police no ambassadors just the ultimate game of hideandseek i smiled at jeremy and gave him what i knew he wanted the look that said that i appreciated the slender potential of his body under his perfect suit to humans it would have looked like flirting but for the fey any fey it wasnt even close to flirting thanks jeremy but you didnt come in here to compliment my clothes he walked farther into the room running manicured fingers along my desk edge ive got two women in my office they want to be clients he said want to be i said he turned leaning against the desk arms crossed over his chest mirroring my stance at the windows either unconsciously or purposefully though i didnt know why we dont usually do divorce work jeremy said i gave him wide eyes pushing away from the windows day one lecture jeremy the grey detective agency never ever does divorce work i know i know he said he pushed away from the desk and came to stand beside me staring out into the fog he didnt look any happier than i felt i leaned back against the glass so i could see his face better why are you breaking your cardinal rule jeremy he shook his head without looking at me come meet them merry i trust your judgment if you say we stay out of it well stay out of it but i think youll feel the same way i do i touched his shoulder and how are you feeling boss other than worried i ran my hand down his arm and it made him look at me his eyes had gone dark charcoal grey with anger come meet them merry if youre as angry afterward as i am then well nail this bastard i gripped his arm jeremy relax its just a divorce case what if i told you it was attempted murder his voice was calm matter of fact it didnt match the intensity in his eyes the vibrating tension in his arm i moved back from him attempted murder what are you talking about the nastiest death spell thats ever walked into my office the husband is trying to kill her i made it a question someone is and the wife says its the husband the mistress agrees with the wife i blinked at him are you saying that the wife and the mistress are in your office he nodded and even through all the outrage he smiled i smiled back well thats got to be a first he took my hand it might be a first even if we did do divorce work he said his thumb rubbed back and forth over my knuckles he was nervous or he wouldnt be touching me this much a way to reassure himself like a touchstone he raised my hand to his lips and planted a quick kiss on my knuckles i think hed noticed what he was doing that his nerves were showing he flashed me a white smile the best caps money could buy and turned toward the door answer one question first jeremy he adjusted his suit minute movements to tug it back into place as if it needed it ask away why are you scared of this the smile faded until his face was solemn ive got a bad feeling about this one merry prophecy isnt one of my gifts but this one has a bad smell to it then pass it by we arent the cops we do this for a very nice paycheck not because weve sworn to serve and protect jeremy if after you meet them you can honestly walk away from it then we will why is my vote suddenly a presidential veto the name on the door is grey not gentry because teresas so empathic she couldnt turn anyone away roane is too much the bleeding heart to turn tearful women away he adjusted his dove grey tie fingers smoothing over the diamond stickpin the others are good for grunt work but they arent decision makers that leaves you i met his eyes trying to read past the anger the worry to what was really going on inside his head youre not an empath and youre not a bleeding heart and you make dandy decisions so why cant you make this one because if we turn them away they wont have anywhere else to go if they leave this office without our help theyre both dead i stared at him and finally understood you know we should walk away from this one but you cant bring yourself to pass judgment on them you cant bring yourself to condemn them to death he nodded yes what makes you think that i can do it if you cant im hoping one of us is sane enough not to be this stupid i wont get you all killed for the sake of strangers jeremy so be prepared to walk away from this one even to me my voice sounded hard cold he smiled again thats my little coldhearted bitch i shook my head and walked toward the door its one of the reasons you love me jeremy you count on me not to flinch i walked out into the hallway that led between offices sure that i would turn these women away certain that i would be the wall that kept us all safe from jeremys good intentions goddess knows id been wrong before but seldom as wrong as i was about to be chapter i thought for some reason id be able to tell which of the two women was wife and which was mistress just by looking at them but at first glance they were just two attractive women casually dressed like girlfriends out for a day of shopping and lunch one woman was small though a few inches taller than either jeremy or myself blond hair cut just above the shoulders with a careless curl to it that said it was natural and she hadnt done anything special to it this morning she was pretty in a girlnextdoor sort of way with extraordinary blue eyes that took up most of her face her eyebrows arched thick and black balancing out a lace of dark lashes that framed those eyes in a very dramatic fashionthough the dark brows made me speculate about how natural the blond hair might be she wore no makeup and still managed to be very pretty in an ethereal very natural way with makeup and a little effort shed have been a knockout but it would have taken more than makeup and a better fit of clothes she sat huddled in the client chair shoulders hunched as if waiting for a blow to fall her lovely eyes blinked at me like the eyes of a deer caught in headlights as if she were powerless to stop what was happening and what was happening was bad the other woman was tall five feet eight inches or better slender with long pale brown hair that swung straight and shining to her waist at first glance she seemed early twentysomething then i met her eyes and there was an intensity in their brown depths that made me add on ten years you just didnt get that look much before thirty her look was more confident than the blondes but there was a flinching around her eyes a tightness in her shoulders as if something deep inside was hurting there was also a delicacy of bone as if what lay under the skin had been formed of daintier things than mere bone there is only one thing that can give a tall commanding person that look of daintiness she was part sidhe oh it was a few generations back nothing as intimate as my ties to the court but somewhere a severaltimesgreatgrandmother had lain down with something not human and walked away with a child fey blood of any kind marks a family but sidhe blood seems to stay in the genes forever as if once in the mix it never gets cleaned out i was betting the blonde was the wife and the other one the mistress the blonde seemed the more beaten down of the two which is usually the case with an abusive man they may abuse all the women in their lives but theyll usually save the best or worst for immediate family my grandfather had always done it that way i came into the room smiling hand out to shake hands like they were any other clients jeremy made the introductions the small blonde was the wife frances norton the tall brownhaired one was the mistress naomi phelps naomis handshake was firm hand cool to the touch those extraordinary bones moving under her skin i held her hand just a little too long luxuriating in the feel of her touch it was the closest thing id had to another sidhe in three years even a touch of some other fey isnt the same there is something in the royal bloodline that is like some drug once tasted you miss it she looked puzzled at me and it was a very human puzzlement i let her hand go and tried to pretend to be human some days i was better at it than this some days i was worse i could have tried to get the measure of her psychically to see if she had more than bone structure going for her but it was impolite to try and read another persons magical ability at first introduction among the sidhe its considered an open challenge an insult that you dont believe that the other person can shield himself from your most casual magic naomi probably wouldnt have taken it as an insult but her ignorance was no excuse for me to be rude frances norton held out her hand like she was afraid to be touched the arm half bent so she could tuck it back into her body as soon as i was finished with it id have given her the same polite treatment that id given the other woman but with my fingers just above her skin i could feel the spell that small line of energy that surrounds all of us her aura pushed against my skin like it was trying to keep me from touching her someone elses magic was so thick in her body that it had filled her aura up like dirty water in a clean glass in a way the woman wasnt herself anymore it wasnt possession but it was a close cousin it was certainly a violation of several human laws all of them felonies i forced my hand through that roil of energy gripping her hand the spell tried to surge through my skin up my arm there was nothing to see with the eyes but just as you can see things in your dreams so i could sense a faint darkness trying to creep up my arm i stopped it just below my elbow and had to concentrate on peeling it down my arm like stripping off a glove it had breached my shields like they hadnt been there not many things can do that none of them human she was staring at me with wide wide eyes wh what are you doing im not doing anything to you mrs norton my voice sounded a little detached distant because i was concentrating on peeling the spell off of me so that when i let go of her hand none of it would cling to me she tried to take her hand back and i wouldnt let her she started to tug on it weak but frantic the other woman said let frances go now i was almost free almost ready to let her go when the other woman gripped my shoulder the hair on the back of my neck stood up and i lost concentration on my hand because i could sense naomi phelps now the spell poured back over my hand and was halfway to my shoulder before i could concentrate enough to stop it but all i could do was stop it i couldnt push it back because too much of my attention was on the other woman you never touch someone while theyre working magic or doing psychic stuff unless you want something to happen this more than anything told me that neither woman was a practitioner or an active psychic no one with even minimal training would have done it i could feel the remnants of some ritual clinging to naomis body something complex something selfish the thought that came unbidden to my mind was gluttony something had been feeding off of her energy and it had left psychic scars behind she jerked back from me cradling her hand against her chest shed sensed my energy so she had talent not a big surprise what was surprising was that she was untrained maybe totally untrained nowadays they go into preschools and test people for psychic gifts mystical talent but it was a new program in the sixties naomi had managed not to be spotted and now she was over thirty and still hadnt dealt with her abilities most untrained psychics are either crazy criminals or suicides by the time theyre thirty she had to be a very strong person to be as together as she looked but this very strong woman looked at me with tears trembling in her eyes we didnt come here to be abused jeremy had stepped closer to us but was being careful not to touch any of us he knew better no one is abusing you ms phelps the spell on mrs norton tried to leach onto my colleague ms gentry was merely trying to push the spell off of her when you touched her you should never touch anyone when theyre working magic ms phelps the results can be unpredictable the woman looked from one to the other of us and her face said clearly she didnt believe us come on frances were getting the fuck out of here i cant frances said in a voice grown small and submissive she was staring up at me fear plain in her eyes but it was fear of me she felt the energy wrapped around our hands pressing us together but she thought i was doing it i swear to you mrs norton i am not doing this whatever magic has been used against you it thinks im tasty i need to peel it off of me and let it flow back into you i want to get rid of it she said voice high with a faint edge of hysteria trailing around the edges if i dont pull it off of me then whoever did this to you will be able to trace me theyll be able to find me theyll know that i work at a detective agency that specializes in supernatural problems magical solutions it was our slogan theyll know that you came here for help i dont think you want that mrs norton a fine trembling started in her hands and spread up her arms until she stood there shivering as if she were cold maybe she was but it wasnt the kind of cold that an extra sweater would fix no amount of outer warmth would cure the coldness inside shed have to be warmed from the damaged core of her soul out to her fingertips someone would have to pour power into her magic into her a little bit at a time like thawing some ancient body found frozen in ice if you thawed it too fast youd cause more damage than if you just left it alone such delicate use of power was beyond my abilities all i could have done was give her a measure of calmness taken some of her fearbut whoever laid the spell on her would sense that too they wouldnt be able to trace me by it but theyd know shed been to see a practitioner someone whod tried to help her on a psychic level call it a hunch but whoever laid the spell wouldnt like that they might do something rash like speed up the process i could feel the sucking energy of the spell trying to breech my defenses to feed on me too it was like magical cancer but as easy to catch as the flu how many people had she infected how many people were walking around with this spell draining little bits of their energy someone who was only a little bit psychic might know something had happened but not what theyd avoid frances norton because shed hurt them but they might not realize for weeks months that the tiredness the vague feelings of hopelessness the depression were being caused by a spell i started to tell her what i was about to do but staring into her wide eyes i didnt bother shed just tense up be more afraid the best i could do was make it as invisible to her as possible i would try to make sure she didnt feel it slide back inside her but that was the best i could do the spell had grown thicker blacker more real just from those few extra moments of sitting against my skin i began to peel it down my arm it clung like tar and it took a lot more concentration to push it back rolling it back on itself like thick cloth every inch of my skin that i freed up felt lighter cleaner i could not imagine living totally encased in this thing it would be like going through your entire life faintly oxygendeprived shoved in a dark room where the light never came i had freed my arm my hand and began to slowly pull my fingers away from her hand she stayed utterly still against my skin like a rabbit hiding in the grass hoping desperately that the fox will pass her by if only she can lie quiet enough what i dont think frances norton realized yet was that she was halfway down the foxs throat with her little legs kicking in the air when i pulled my fingers away the spell clung to them and then fell back into place around her with an almost audible sound i wiped my hand on my jacket i was clear of the spell but i had a terrible urge to wash my hand with very hot water and lots of soap ordinary water and soap wouldnt help but some salt or holy water might she collapsed into the chair hiding her face in her hands shoulders shaking i thought at first she was crying without making any noise but when naomi hugged her she raised a face devoid of tears frances was shaking just shaking as if she couldnt cry anymore not because she didnt want to but because all the tears had been drained out of her she sat there while her husbands mistress hugged her rocked her she was shaking so badly her teeth began to chatter but she never cried it seemed worse somehow because she didnt cry excuse us for a moment ladies well be right outside i said i looked at jeremy and headed for the door knowing hed follow in the hallway he closed the door behind us im sorry merry i shook her hand and nothing happened the spell didnt react to me i nodded i believed him maybe i just taste better he grinned at me well i dont know from experience but id almost bet on it i smiled physically maybe but mystically youre as powerful in your own way as i am lord and lady youre a better magician than ill ever be yet it didnt react to you he shook his head no it didnt maybe youre right merry maybe its too dangerous for you i frowned at him now he gets cautious he looked at me fighting to make his face neutral why do i get the feeling that youre not going to be the coldhearted bitch i was hoping for i leaned against the far wall and glared at him this thing is so malignant that well be able to get some police help bringing in the police wont save them we dont have enough to prove its the husband if we cant prove it in court he doesnt do jail time and that means hed be free to work more magic on them we need him locked away in a warded cell where he cant harm them theyd need magical protection until he was in custody this isnt just a detective job its a babysitting job uther and ringo are great babysitters he said i guess still not happy why we should walk away from this one i said but you cant do it he said he was smiling now no i cant do it there were lots of detective agencies in the united states that said they specialized in supernatural cases it was big business the preternatural but most agencies couldnt back up their advertising we could we were one of only a handful of agencies that could boast a staff made up entirely of magic practitioners and psychics we were also the only one that could boast that all but two employees were fey there arent that many fullblooded fey who can stand to live in a big crowded city la was better than new york or chicago but it was still exhausting to be surrounded by so much metal so much technology so many humans it didnt bother me my human blood allowed me human tolerances for steel and glass prisons culturally and personally i preferred the country but i didnt have to have it it was nice but i didnt sicken and fade without it some fey would i wish i could turn them away jeremy youve got a bad feeling about this one too dont you i nodded yeah but if i cast them out id see her trembling tearless face in my dreams for all i knew they might come back to haunt me after whoever was killing them finished the job they could come back as righteous ghosts and bemoan me for having knowingly taken their last chance at survival away people always think ghosts haunt the people who actually killed them but thats just not true ghosts seem to have an interesting sense of justice and it would be just my luck to have them following me around until i could find someone to lay them if they could be laid sometimes spirits were tougher than that then you could end up with a family ghost like a banshee howling at every death i doubted either woman had that kind of strength of character but it would have served me right if they had it was my own sense of guilt that made me walk back into that office not fear of ghostly reprisals some people say that the fey have no souls no sense of personal responsibility for some thats true but it wasnt true for jeremy and it wasnt true for me mores the pity sometimes mores the pity chapter naomi phelps did most of the talking while frances sat there and shivered our secretary got her hot coffee and an afghan her hands shook so badly that she spilled coffee on the afghan but she got some of it down whether it was the warmth or the caffeine she looked a little better jeremy had called teresa in to listen to the women teresa was our resident psychic she was two inches shy of six feet slender with high sculpted cheekbones long silky black hair skin the color of pale coffee the first time id seen her id known she had sidhe blood in her along with african american and something fey that hadnt been high court the last was what gave her the slight points to the tops of her ears a lot of faerie wannabes get cartilage implants to make their ears pointy they grow their hair down to their ankles and try to pretend to be sidhe but no pureblooded sidhe has ever had pointed ears its a mark of mixed blood less than pure but some bits of folklore die harder than others to a vast majority of people if you were truly sidhe you had to have pointed ears teresa had that same delicacy of bone that naomi did but id never been tempted to hold teresas hand she was one of the most powerful touch clairvoyants that id ever met i spent a goodly amount of energy making sure she didnt touch me for fear that shed learn my secrets and endanger us all she sat in a chair to one side dark eyes watching the two women she hadnt offered to shake their hands in fact shed walked wide around them so that she didnt accidentally touch either of them her face betrayed nothing but shed felt the spell the danger when she walked into the room i dont know how many mistresses hes had naomi was saying a dozen two dozen hundreds she shrugged all i know for sure is that im the latest in a long line of them mrs norton jeremy said frances turned her eyes up to him startled as if she hadnt expected to be asked to contribute to the story do you have any proof of all these women she swallowed and said in a voice that was almost a whisper polaroids he keeps polaroids she stared down into her lap murmuring he calls them his trophies i had to ask did he show these pictures to you or did you find them she looked up and her eyes were emptyno anger no shame empty he showed them to me he likes he likes to tell me about what hes done with them what each one is good at better at than me i opened my mouth closed it because i couldnt think of a single helpful thing to say i was outraged for her sake but it was francis norton that needed to be angry on behalf of francis norton my anger might help us solve the immediate problem but it wouldnt make her strong again if we could take the husband out of the picture that wouldnt heal all the damage hed done there was a lot more wrong with francis than just a spell naomi touched her arm comforting her thats how she met me she saw my picture and then we just ran into each other one day i caught her staring at me in a restaurant he had woken her when he got home and told her what hed done to me it was naomis turn to look down into her lap her hands lying upright and empty against her legs i had bruises showing she looked up met my eyes frances came over to my table she rolled back her sleeve and showed me her bruises then she just said im his wife and that was how we met she gave a shy smile at the last the sort of smile you give when youve explained how you met your lover a tender story to be related to others i gave her blank eyes but i wondered if the bond between them was more than just the abuse and the husband if they were lovers it could change how the healing was done so often in mystical things the emotions have to be taken into account because love and hate have different energies you work with them differently wed need to know exactly what the bond between the two women was before serious healing work was begun but not today today wed listen to what they wanted to tell us that was very brave of you teresa said her voice like everything about her was somehow soft and feminine with an underlying strength like steel covered by silk id always thought teresa though shed never traveled farther south than mexico would have made an excellent southern belle francess eyes flicked to her then back to her lap then up and her mouth moved it was almost a smile that one small movement made me feel better about the woman if she could begin to smile begin to take pride in what strength shed shown then maybe she would be all right with time naomi squeezed her arm and gave her smile of pride and affection again i got the impression that they were very close it was my salvation from the moment that i met frances i started trying to break away from him i dont know how i allowed him to hurt me im not like that i mean ive never ever let a man abuse me her face showed the shame she felt as if she should have saved herself frances put her hand over the other womans hand giving comfort as well as getting it naomi smiled at her then turned puzzled eyes to us hes like a drug once hes touched you you crave his touch not just him either its like he wakens you sexually until your body aches to be touched she looked down again ive never been so sexually aware of other people it was embarrassing and exciting at first then he started to hurt me at first it was just little things tying me up then spanking she made herself look up forced herself to meet our eyes such anger as if defying us to think the worst of her there was a great deal of strength here how had this man tamed her he made the pain part of the pleasure but then he started doing worse things things that just hurt i tried to get him to stop the kinky stuff and thats when he started beating me for real no pretending that it was part of sex her mouth trembled eyes still defiant but beating me did excite him the fact that it didnt excite me that it scared me he liked that too rape fantasies i said she nodded her eyes wide as she tried to keep the tears glistening in her eyes from falling she held herself very still trying to hold it all inside not just fantasies at the end he likes to take you by force this from the wife i looked at both of them and fought the urge to shake my head id spent the years from sixteen to thirty in the unseelie court the years of my sexual awakening so i knew about combining pleasure with pain but the pain was shared and it was never done against anyones will if the other person didnt think pain was pleasurable it wasnt sex it was torture there is a vast difference between torture and a little hard sex but for sexual sadists there is no difference in the extreme forms they are incapable of sex without the violence or at least the terror of their victim but most sadists are capable of more normal sex they can use that to fool you but in the end they cant keep up a normal relationship in the end what they truly desire must come out and they must have it how was i such an expert like i said i spent my sexual awakening years at the unseelie court dont get me wrong the seelie court has its own brand of unusual activities but they do share the more mainstream human view of dominance and submission the unseelie court is much more welcoming of such things or maybe just more open about it it could also be that the queen of air and darkness my aunt the overall ruler of the court for the last thousand years give or a take a century is very into dominance and borders on being a sexual sadist she has shaped the court in her image as my uncle the king of light and illusion of the seelie court has shaped his court in his image strangely you can scheme and lie more easily in the seelie court theyre into illusion if everything looks good on the outside then it must be good the unseelie court is more honest most of the time teresa said naomi was this your first abusive relationship the woman nodded i still dont understand how i let it get so bad i looked at teresa and she gave a very small nod it meant that shed listened to the answer and that the woman was telling the truth like i said teresa is one of the most powerful psychics in the country its not just her hands you have to watch out for most of the time she can tell if youre lying or not ive had to be very careful around her these three years weve worked together how did you meet him i asked i didnt use his name or say mr norton because both women had been very careful to say only him or he as if there was no other man and you would know whom they were talking about we did i answered a personal ad what did the ad say i asked she shrugged the usual stuff except for the end at the end of the ad it said he was looking for a magical relationship i dont know what it was about the ad but after i read it i had to meet him a compulsion spell jeremy said she looked at him what if youre powerful enough you can put a spell on an ad so that the ad brings to you what you truly desire not necessarily what the ad says you want its the way i ran the ad that ms gentry answered only people with magical ability would have noticed the spell on the ad and only people with exceptional gifts would have been able to see through to the true writing underneath the true writing listed a different phone number than the ad i knew that anyone who called that number was capable of the job i didnt know you could do that with a newspaper naomi said i mean its printed and he couldnt have touched every paper just knowing that not touching the paper physically made the spell harder to cast meant naomi knew more about magic theory than i thought she did but she was right you have to be powerful enough that the ad the words that you read into it carry the spell it is very difficult and that he was capable of it lets us know the kind of skill well be up against so the ad called me to him she asked maybe not you specifically jeremy said but something about you was exactly what he wanted or needed most of the women look fey frances said we all looked at her she blinked at us pointed ears one woman had these catgreen eyes that seemed to glow out of the picture skin colors that no human has like green blue three of them had more parts than a human would have but not like it was a deformity like it was just part of the way they looked i was impressed impressed that shed noticed and put it together in her head if we could save her get her away from him shed make it what did he say about naomi that she was part sidhe he really got off on that if the women were part sidhe he called them his royal whores why fey women jeremy asked he never said frances answered i think it had something to do with the ritual naomi said we all turned to her jeremy and i asked in unison what ritual the first night he took me to the apartment hes rented the bedroom has mirrored walls and this huge circular bed the floor was this beautiful gleaming wood with a persian carpet under the bed everything seemed to glow when i climbed up on the bed i felt something like id walked through a ghost i didnt know what it was that first night but one night i slipped on the rug and underneath was a double circle set into the wood of the floor with symbols in a band around the circle i realized the bed was the center of the circle i didnt recognize the symbols but i knew enough to know it was a circle of power a place to work magic did he ever do anything in the bed that seemed like ritual magic i asked nothing that i recognized we just had sex lots of it was there anything that was the same every time jeremy asked she shook her head no was the sex always in this apartment jeremy asked no sometimes we met at a hotel that surprised me is there anything he does in the apartment inside the circle that he doesnt do anywhere else she blushed bright red its the only place he brings other men other men to have sex with him i asked she shook her head no with me she looked up at us as if waiting for the cry of horror or maybe whore whatever she saw reassured her we all knew how to give good blank face when we needed it besides a little group sex seemed tame after knowing that he showed pictures of his lovers to his wife with details that was a new one group sex had been around a lot longer than polaroids was it always the same men jeremy asked she shook her head no but they knew each other i mean it wasnt like he brought in strangers off the street she sounded defensive as if that would have been so much worse and it wasnt as bad as all that were there any repeats jeremy asked there were three men that i saw more than once do you know their names just their first names liam donald and brendan she seemed very sure of the names how many times did you see these three men she wouldnt meet our eyes i dont know many times five times jeremy asked six twentysix she looked up startled not twenty times not that many then how many he asked maybe eight maybe ten but no more than that it seemed important to her that it hadnt been more than ten was that the magical cutoff more than ten times and you were worse than just eight and the group sex how many times for that she blushed again why do you need to know you called it a ritual not us jeremy said so far there doesnt seem much ritual to it but numbers can have mystical significance the number of men inside the circle the number of times you were inside the circle with more than one man believe me ms phelps this is not how i get my jollies she looked down again i didnt mean to imply yes you did jeremy said but i understand why youd be suspicious of any male human or not i saw the idea float over his face were all the men human donald and liam both had pointed ears but other than that they all seemed human were donald and liam circumcised i asked her voice came out in a hurried rush color high in her cheeks again why do you need to know that because a real male fey would be hundreds of years old and ive never heard of a jewish fey so if they were fey they wouldnt be circumcised she met my eyes oh she said then she thought about the original question liam was but donald wasnt what did donald look like tall muscular like a weight lifter blond hair to his waist was he pretty i asked she had to think about that one too handsome not pretty handsome what color were his eyes i dont remember if theyd been one of the more colorful shades of eyes that the fey are capable of shed have remembered except for the pointed ears he could have been any of a dozen men at the seelie court there were only three blond men at the unseelie court and none of my three uncles lifted weights they had to be more careful of their hands than that for fear theyd rip the surgical gloves they always wore the gloves kept the poison that their hands naturally produced from rubbing off on anyone else theyd been born cursed would you recognize this donald if you saw him again yes was there anything the same about all the men jeremy asked they all had long hair like he has shoulderlength or longer long hair possible cartilage implants in the ears celtic namessounded like faerie wannabes to me id never heard of a sex cult of faerie wannabes but you should never underestimate peoples ability to corrupt an ideal good ms phelps jeremy said how about tattoos symbols written on their bodies a piece of jewelry that they all wore no to all of it did you meet only at night no sometimes in the afternoon sometimes at night no special time of the month not close to a holiday jeremy asked she frowned at him ive been seeing him only a little over two months there havent been any holidays but no special time did you have sex with him or others a certain number of times a week she had to think about that one but finally shook her head it varied did they chant or sing jeremy asked no she said it didnt sound like much of a ritual to me why did you use the term ritual ms phelps why didnt you say spell i dont know you do know i said youre not a practitioner i dont think youd use the term ritual without a reason just think for a minute why that word she thought about it eyes staring into space seeing nothing tiny frown lines between her eyebrows she blinked and looked at me i heard him talking on the phone one night she looked down then up defiant again and i knew she didnt like what she was about to say hed tied me to the bed but hed left the door open a little i could hear him talking he said the ritual will be good tonight then his voice dropped too low for me to hear then he said the untrained ones give it up so easily she looked at me i wasnt a virgin when we met i was experienced before him i thought i was good in bed what makes you think youre not i asked he told me that i wasnt good enough at straight sex to satisfy him that he needed the abuse to spice it up so he wouldnt be bored she tried to stay defiant and failed the hurt showed in her eyes were you in love with him i tried to make the question gentle what difference does that make frances took her hand held it in her lap its all right naomi theyre going to help us i dont see what love has to do with any of this she said if you love him then it will be harder to free you of his influence thats all i said she didnt seem to notice that id changed loved to love she answered the question i thought i loved him do you still love him i hated having to ask but we needed to know she gripped the other womans small hand in both of hers knuckles whitening with the strength of her grip the tears finally slid down her face i dont love him but she had to take a few deep breaths before she could finish but if i see him and he asks for sex i cant seem to say no even when its awful and hes hurt me the actual sex is still better than anything ive ever felt before i can say no over the phone but if he shows up i let him i mean i fight if hes beating me but if its during sex it gets all confused frances stood moving behind the other womans chair spreading the afghan over both of them while she hugged her from behind she made soothing noises kissing the top of her head like youd do with a child have you been hiding from him i asked she nodded i have but frances he can find her no matter where she is he follows the spell i said both women nodded as if theyd figured that much out for themselves but ive hidden from him i moved out of my apartment im surprised he didnt hunt for you i said the building is warded she said i widened eyes at that for a building to be warded not just an apartment but the entire building meant that the protective spells had to be put into the foundation of the building the wards had to be poured with the concrete riveted into place with the steel beams it took a coven of witches or several covens no single practitioner could do it it was not a cheap process only the most expensive highrises or homes could boast of it what do you do for a living ms phelps jeremy asked because i think that he like me had actually not expected the two women to be able to meet our fee we had enough money in the bank under the agencys account and in our own accounts so we could do charity work from time to time we didnt make a habit of it but some cases you dont do for money but because you simply cant say no we both thought this was going to be one of those ive got a trust fund that matured last year i have access to all of it now trust me mr grey i can pay your fee thats very good to know ms phelps but truthfully i wasnt worried about it dont spread it around but if someones in deep enough trouble we dont turn them away because they cant meet our fees she blushed i didnt mean to imply that you were im sorry she bit her lip naomi didnt mean to insult you frances said shes been rich all her life and a lot of people have tried to take advantage of that no offense taken jeremy said though i knew that there probably was some offense taken but he was a very businesslike businessman you didnt get mad at a client not if you were taking the case or at least not until theyd done something really awful teresa asked has he ever tried to get your money naomi looked at her and you could see the surprise on her face no no does he know you have it i asked yes he knew but he never let me pay for anything he said he was oldfashioned that way he didnt care about money at all it was one of the things i liked about him at first so hes not after money i said hes not interested in money frances said i met those big blue eyes and they didnt look scared now she was still standing behind naomi still comforting her and she seemed to gain strength from that what is he interested in i asked power she said i nodded she was right abuse is always about power in one way or another when he said the untrained ones give it up so easily i dont think he was talking about your sexual prowess naomi was holding on to francess hands pressing them to her shoulders then what did he mean youre untrained in the mystic arts she frowned at me then what was it that i gave up so easily if it wasnt sex frances answered power yes mrs norton power naomi frowned at all of us what do you mean power i dont have any power your magic ms phelps hes been taking your magic she looked even more astonished mouth open in a little o of surprise i dont know any magic i get feelings sometimes about things but thats not magic and that of course was why hed been able to do it i wondered if all the women were untrained mystics if they were untrained then we were going to have trouble infiltrating his little world but if all they had to be was part fey and magically talented well id done decoy work before chapter three days later i was standing in the middle of jeremys office wearing nothing but a black lace pushup bra matching panties and black thighhighs a man id never met was fishing down the front of the bra normally i have to be planning to sleep with a man before i let him fondle my breast but it was nothing personal just business maury klein was a sound expert and he was trying to fit a tiny wire with a tiny microphone under my right breast where the underwire of the bra would keep alistair norton from feeling it if he brushed his hand across my ribs or breast hed been fiddling with the wire for about thirty minutes fifteen of that trying to find the best place to hide the wire in my cleavage he was kneeling in front of me the tip of his tongue bitten between his teeth eyes behind the wireframe glasses staring fixedly at his hands one plunged almost out of sight inside the cup of the bra the other holding the material of the bra away from my breast so he could work better by pulling the bra out hed exposed my nipple and most of the rest of my right breast to the room if maury hadnt been so obviously oblivious to both my charms and our audience id have accused him of taking so long because he was enjoying himself but he had that inner stare that said he wasnt really aware of what he was doing except for the job part i understood why hed had complaints from female undercover people before the complaints had been why he insisted on not doing all this in private he wanted witnesses that he hadnt overstepped the bounds though frankly if all the witnesses had been human they might have been on my side anyway hed poked lifted and otherwise manhandled my chest as if it werent attached to anyone what he was doing was very intimate but he didnt mean it to be he was the proverbial nerd or maybe the absentminded professor he had only one love and that was his hidden mikes hidden cameras in los angeles if you wanted the best you went to maury klein he put in security systems for hollywood stars but his true passion was undercover work how to get the equipment even smaller better concealed hed actually at one point suggested that the wire might be best hidden inside my body im not shy but i vetoed that idea maury had shaken his head and muttered dont know how the sound quality would hold up but i wish someone would let me try it he did have an assistant read keeper and probably emergency diplomat chrisif he had a last name id never heard ithad cautioned maury not to be so rough or so indelicate hed hovered until i assured him i was fine now he stayed near maury like a surgical nurse ready to hand him whatever esoteric piece of equipment he needed jeremy sat behind his desk watching the show fingers steepled an amused smile on his face hed shown polite heat in his eyes when i first took my dress off and stripped to the lingerie but after that hed just tried to keep from laughing at maury kleins total lack of heat jeremy had complimented me on the amazing contrast between the perfect white of my skin and the blackness of the lingerie youre always supposed to say something nice the first time you see someone in a state of undress roane finn was sitting on the corner of jeremys desk feet kicking in the air in a soft unconscious movement as he too enjoyed the show he didnt have to compliment me hed seen me naked last night and many nights before that his eyes are the first things you notice about him huge liquid brown orbs that dominate his face like the moon dominates the night sky then its a tossup whether you notice his dark auburn hair and the way it clings to his face rolls down the back of his collar or his lips which are a perfect redtinged pouting bow youd think he used lipstick to get the color but he doesnt its all natural his skin looks white but it isnt really or not pure white its as if someone took my own pale complexion and added a drop of the redbrown of his hair when he wears brown or other autumn colors his skin seems to darken he was my height exactly and it made him appear delicate at first glance but the body that showed under the black clothing hed donned for tonight looked firm and muscular i knew for a fact that he wasnt just strong he was limber i also knew that there were burn scars along his back and shoulders like white calluses on the smooth silk of his body the scars had been caused when a fisherman burned his sealskin roane was a selkie one of the seal people once hed been able to don his sealskin and become a seal then slip the skin and be human or rather human form then a fisherman had found his skin and burned it the skin was not just a magical device for shapeshifting it wasnt even just part of roane the skin was as much him as his eyes or his hair roane is the only seal person ive ever heard of that survived the destruction of his other self he survived but he could never again change form he was doomed to be forever landbound forever denied the other half of his world sometimes at night id find the bed empty if we were at my apartment hed be gazing out the window at nothing if we were at his place hed be looking out at the ocean or vanishing into the waves as i watched from the balcony he never woke me and asked me to join him it was his private pain not to be shared i guess it was fair because in the two years wed been lovers id never dropped my glamour completely hed never seen the dueling scars the injuries would have marked me as someone intimate with the sidhe i might have been hopeless at offensive spells but there were few better at personal glamour in all the courts than me it helped me hide but not much else roane couldnt breech my shields but he knew they were there he knew that even in that moment of release i held back if hed been human he would have asked why but he wasnt human and he didnt ask just like i never questioned him about the call of the waves a human wouldnt have been able not to pry but a human lover also wouldnt have been able to sit calmly while another man fiddled with my breasts there was no jealousy in roane he knew this meant nothing to me so it meant nothing to him the only other woman in the room was detective lucindacall me lucytate wed worked with her on several cases where the perpetrator wasnt human and their decoys were getting bewitched bewildered or killed in fact having jeremy and the rest of us as temporary police had been the first time the magical dispensation act had been stretched to include police work but wed all met the criteria of having magical abilities that made us ideal for the job which meant they could waive all training that a nonmagic cop would have needed and just put us straight on the job sort of like emergency deputies the magical dispensation act is how i got to be a detective fresh off the bus so to speak with none of the hours and hours of training that you normally need to get your license in california detective tate leaned against the wall shaking her head jesus klein no wonder youve got sexual harassment complaints against you maury blinked as if having to draw his attention back from a long way off it was the way people looked at the end of a powerful spell like they were just waking and the dream hadnt finished yet you couldnt fault maurys powers of concentration he finally turned to the detective hands still in my bra i dont know what you mean detective tate i looked at her over maurys kneeling head he really doesnt i said she smiled at me sorry about the manhandling merry if he wasnt the best at what he did nobody would tolerate him we dont use sound equipment and hidden cameras much jeremy said but when we do i like to pay for the best tate looked at him the department certainly couldnt afford him maury spoke without turning his attention from my chest ive done free work for the police in the past detective tate and we really appreciate that mr klein the look on her face didnt quite match the wordsa more mischievous twinkle in the eye and cynicism in the face cynicism seemed to be an occupational hazard the mischievous twinkle was pure lucy tate she always seemed to be laughing softly at everything i was pretty sure it was a defense mechanism to keep the real her hidden but i still hadnt figured out what she was hiding from none of my business but i will admit to a certain amount of very unfeylike curiosity about detective lucy tate it was the very perfection of her camouflage the fact that you never saw beyond that faintly amused shield that made me want to breech it i could see roanes pain so i could leave it alone but i could see nothing in lucy and neither could teresa which meant of course that detective tate was a psychic of considerable power but something had happened at an early age that made her hide her powers so far under that even she didnt know she had them none of us had explained this to her detective tates life seemed to work well she seemed happy if she tore the scar open that had forced her powers underground that could all change it might be something traumatic enough that shed never rebuild from it so we left her alone but we wondered about her and sometimes it was harder than it should have been not to poke at her with magic or psychic feints just to see what would happen maury leaned back hands to himself at last there i think thatll do ill put just a touch of tape to make sure it doesnt shift and youre set chris handed him some small bits of tape on his hand all ready to go anticipating the need maury took the tape without comment youve seen what i had to do to put the mike in well this guy will have to do the same thing to find it he actually had me hold the bra out so he could tape with both hands it was the kindest thing hed done in the last fortyfive minutes he stood and moved back fix the bra the way youd normally wear it i frowned at him this is the way i normally wear it he made a small motion with his hands at about chest level you know fluff that one so it matches the other one fluff i said but i smiled because i finally understood what he meant he sighed and moved forward ill show you i held a hand out i dont need help i bent over and shook my right breast into the cup of the bra having to use my hand to get everything into place the bra was pushup enough that my already nice chest looked positively obscene but when i ran my hand over the area where i should have felt the mike all i could feel was the underwire and material its perfect maury said you can strip down to this just keep your bra on hell never know he cocked his head to one side as if hed just thought of something ive taped the mike to the bra so if you have to you can take it off just leave it within a fivefoot radius closer is better if i make the mike more sensitive wed start picking up your heartbeat and the cloth moving i can filter it out but its easier to do after the tapes made than before im assuming you want to be able to hear tonight in case your bad guy gets out of hand yes jeremy said itd be nice to know if merry needs help the sarcasm was too mild for maury we might have been able to tape the mike to the elastic top of the hose but i couldnt swear that the hose wouldnt roll down and flash the mike if you take the bra off make sure and roll the cloth so the mike doesnt show i dont plan on taking it off maury shrugged just wanting to give you all the options i can i appreciate that maury i said maury nodded chris was already picking up the bits and pieces that had gotten scattered on the floor roane jumped down from the desk lifting my folded dress from the top of it he held the square of black cloth out to me id had to buy a black dress on the advice that it was easier to hide things in black than in lighter colors i never wore unrelieved black if i could help it even though it was a color that looked good on me it was the color favored by the unseelie court because it was their queens favorite color to wear roane let the silk dress unfold from his hands holding it by the shoulders then he began very slowly very deliberately to roll the dress up in his hands watching my face the entire time he did it when the dress was just a thin black fringe hanging from his small strong hands he knelt in front of me holding the dress open so i could step into it i placed my hand on his shoulder for balance and stepped into the circle of cloth roane began to let the dress slide from his hands raising his hands at the same time so the dress fell around me like a theater curtain coming down when his arms were raised as far as theyd go kneeling the dress was to my waist he stood hands resting lightly on my hips the movement put him kissably close his eyes were exactly at the same level as mine there was an intimacy to the eye contact that id never had with anyone else id never been with anyone as short as i was before it made missionary position unbelievably intimate roane raised the dress until i could slip my arms through the sleeves then he raised it over my shoulders moving around me until he was at my back and could pull the last of the silk into place he began to zip the dress up in back the dress tightened as it zipped like it was slowly constricting across my waist my ribs over the breasts the neckline was a very daring v which was another reason for the uplift bra it was the only one id found that you could wear under the dress and not flash the bra the dress was sleeveless and fit like a shiny second skin leaving my flesh very white against the dark fabric id chosen the tightness very deliberately the bodice looked like it was barely there and all it left was a view of my breasts but if you tried to slide your hand into the top you couldnt do it without risking ripping the dress if alistair norton wanted to play with my breasts hed have to keep his play to the exposed tops unless we were planning a rape scenario and according to naomi the rape fantasies had only come out at two months or more the first month had been a perfect affair since this was the first date alistair would probably be on his best behavior id have to take the dress off for him to have a chance at finding the mike and i wasnt planning on taking the dress off roane finished zipping me fastening the small hook at the top he traced his thumbs over the bare skin of my upper back the barest of movements then stepped away from me he actually ran his thumbs over the scars on my back that he could neither see nor feel i was confident enough in my abilities that the dress would have shown the scars except for my glamour they were like ripples in the skin frozen forever another sidhe had tried to change my shape during a duel many of the fey can shapeshift but only the sidhe can change the form of others against their will i cant change my shape or anyone elses another mark against me in the courts how do you do that detective tate asked the question startled me made me turn to her do what i asked chris was glancing up as he repacked equipment maury was already fiddling with a mediumsized transmitter working at it with a tiny screwdriver the rest of us might as well not have been in the room you stand there for nearly an hour in nothing but your underwear with a man fondling your breasts but its not sexual its like an rrated comedy routine then roane helps you on with your dress never touches your bare skin just zips you up and suddenly the sexual tension in the room is thick enough to walk on how the hell do you do that us as in roane and me or us as in i let the thought trail off us as in the fey she said ive seen jeremy do it with a human woman you guys can walk around buck naked and make me comfortable being in the same room with you then fully clothed you do something small and suddenly i feel like i should leave the room she shook her head how do you do that roane and i looked at each other and i saw the same question in his eyes that i knew was in mine how do you explain what it is to be fey to someone who is not the answer of course is you dont you can try but you rarely succeed jeremy tried he was after all the boss it is part of what it means to be fey to be a creature of the senses he rose from his chair and walked to her face body neutral he took her hand and raised it to his lips laying a chaste touch of lips to her knuckles being fey is the difference between that and this he took the same hand again and raised it much slower eyes on her face filled with that polite heat that any fey male might have given to the tall attractive woman the look alone made her shiver he kissed her hand this time a slow caress of lips the upper lip catching just a little on her skin as he drew back from her it had been polite no open mouth no tongue nothing rude but color had spread up her cheeks and from across the room i could tell her breathing had deepened pulse quickening does that answer your question detective he asked she gave a shaky laugh holding her hand with the other hand cradling it against her body no but im afraid to ask again i dont think i could handle the answer and still work tonight jeremy gave a little bow whether tate knew it or not shed just given a very fey compliment everyone likes to be appreciated you warm the cockles of this old mans heart she laughed then high and delighted you may be a lot of things jeremy but youll never be old he gave another bow and i realized something i hadnt before jeremy liked detective tate liked her the way a man likes a woman we all touch humans more than they touch each other or at least more than most american humans touch each other but he could have chosen other ways to explain to tate hed chosen to touch her in a way hed never touched her before taken a liberty with her because shed given him the excuse to do it without seeming forward that was how the fey flirted when invited sometimes it was just a glance but the fey do not go where they are not asked though our men will make the same mistake that human males make sometimes mistaking a little flirting for sexual advance outright rape is almost unknown among us our version of date rape on the other hand has been popular for centuries funny how the thought of date rape brought me back to the job at hand i went to the desk where id left my shoes and slipped into them gaining three inches of height you can tell your new partner that he can come back in now i told lucy it was an insult to insist on modesty in a nonsexual situation among most of the fey certainly among the sidhe thats why the audience to send them away would imply lack of trust or outward dislike there were only two exceptions the first was if the person couldnt behave in a civilized manner detective john wilkes had never worked with nonhumans before he didnt blink when maury asked me to disrobe but when i took the dress off without warning or clearing the room the detective had spilled hot coffee down his shirt when maury plunged his hand down my bra wilkes had said what the hell is he doing i asked him to wait outside lucy gave a low laugh poor boy i think he got seconddegree coffee burns when you took off your dress i shrugged he must not see a lot of naked women she smiled shaking her head ive dealt with fey even a few visiting sidhe and youre the only one ive met that was humble i frowned at her im not humble i just think that if seeing me strip to my underwear is enough to make your partner nearly swallow his tongue he must not be very experienced lucy looked at roane and jeremy does she not know what she looks like no roane said i think though i dont know that our merry was raised somewhere where she was considered the ugly duckling jeremy said i met his eyes my pulse thudding in my neck that one comment was a little too close for comfort i dont know what you guys are talking about i know you dont jeremy said there was a knowledge in his dark grey eyes a guess that was close to a certainty in that moment i knew he suspected who i was what i was but he would never ask he would wait until i was ready to talk or the question would remain forever silent between us i looked at roane he was the only fey lover id known who had not come to my bed to further his political ambitions to him i was just merry gentry a human with fey ancestry not princess meredith nicessus now i stared into that familiar face and tried to read his expression he was smilingly blank either it had never occurred to him that i might be the missing sidhe princess or hed guessed long ago but would never be rude enough to bring it up or had roane known from the first had that been why hed come to me suddenly all the security that id built up with these people my friends began to crumble around me some of it must have shown on my face because roane touched me i drew back from him his face showed the hurt confusion he didnt know i hugged him suddenly hiding my face from him but i could still see jeremy as the look on roanes face had reassured me so the look on jeremys frightened me all it would take was my true name being mentioned after dark and it would float back to my aunt she was the queen of air and darkness and that meant that anything said in the dark was hers to hear eventually the fact that spotting the missing elven american princess had become more popular than spotting elvis helped her magic was always chasing blind leads princess meredith skiing in utah princess meredith dancing in paris princess meredith gambling in vegas after three years i was still a frontpage story for the tabloids though the latest headlines had been speculating that i was as dead as the king of rock and roll if jeremy spoke my name aloud to my face the words would resonate and when they finally floated back to her shed know i was alive and shed know that jeremy had spoken my name even if i ran shed question him and if polite methods didnt work shed use torture i am told she is a creative lover i know she is an inventive torturer i drew back from roane and gave them part of the truth my mother was the beautiful one how do you know that jeremy asked i looked at him she told me so you mean your mother told you you werent beautiful lucy asked it took a human to be that direct i nodded dont take this wrong but what a bitch to that there was only one thing to sayi agree now lets get out of here we wouldnt want to keep mr norton waiting jeremy said i still wish we were going after him for proof on the attempted murder lucy said we cant guarantee proof that will stand up in court about the death spell i said but jeremy said we might be able to prove tonight that he is using magic to seduce women magically aided seduction is rape under california law we need him in jail away from his wife and this is the surest way to do it he wont get bail on a felony charge that includes magic lucy nodded i agree that the plan is great for mrs norton but what about merry what if this guy pulls out the magical aphrodisiac that hes used on the other mistresses the ones who just couldnt get enough of him like naomi phelps were counting on it i said she looked at me what if it works what if you start panting over the microphone then roane breaks down the door playing the jealous lover and drags me out if i have trouble getting her to leave then uther will come in as my friend and help me take my woman back home lucy rolled her eyes well what uther wants uther gets uther was thirteen feet tall with a head that was more pig than human and two curling tusks on either side of his snout he was a jackinirons but he was named uther squarefoot he wasnt much good for undercover work but he was hell on wheels when we needed muscle uther had excused himself from the room when he realized the dress was coming off hed said only its nothing personal merry dont make more of it than there is but seeing any attractive female nearly naked is not good for a man when theres no hope of relieving the thoughts that spring unbidden it wasnt until he made for the door stooping his great shoulders low enough to squeeze out the doorway that i realized something i should have known before uther is thirteen feet tall the size of a large ogre or a very small giant and there arent many females his size in the los angeles area hed been here nearly ten years that was a long time to be without the touch of another naked body how terribly lonely if no one guessed who i really was and if i didnt get bespelled out of my mind by alistair norton id see about fixing uther up with someone uther wasnt the only giantsized fey wandering outside the courts just the only one in the immediate area if we couldnt find someone his size we might be able to come up with other solutions sex doesnt have to mean intercourse there are women on the streets that will do just about anything for a couple of hundred dollars especially if twenty is their going rate if i were truly fey down to my toes id do uther myself thats what a real friend would do but i was raised outside the court out among the humans from age six to sixteen it meant that no matter how fey i was some of my attitudes were human i cant be human because im not but i cant be completely fey because im not that either i am half unseelie court but i am not one of them i am part seelie court but i do not belong among the shining throng i am part dark sidhe part light sidhe and yet neither side wishes to claim me i have always been on the outside looking in my nose pressed to the window but never welcomed inside i understood isolation and loneliness it made me hurt for uther made me regret that i wasnt comfortable helping him with a little friendly casual sex but i wasnt and i wouldnt as usual i was fey enough to see the problem but too human to fix it of course if id been pure seelie sidhe i wouldnt have touched uther at any price he would have been beneath my notice the seelie do not fuck monsters unseelie sidhe well define monster uther wasnt a monster by unseelie standards but alistair norton might be either a monster or a kindred spirit of the dark chapter alistair norton didnt look like a monster id expected him to be handsome but it was still disappointing there is something in all of us that believes deep down that evil shows on the outside that we should be able to pick out the bad people just by looking at them but it just doesnt work that way id spent enough time at both courts to know that beautiful and good were not the same i if anyone knew that beauty was perfect camouflage for the darkest of hearts and still i wanted alistair nortons face to show what he was inside i wanted some visible mark of cain on him but he came smiling into the restaurant tall broadshouldered face full of clean angles so masculine it was almost painful his lips were a little thin for my taste face a little too masculine eyes a very ordinary brown the hair that was tied back in a neat ponytail was an odd shade of brown neither light nor dark but i had to look for imperfections because there just werent any his smile was quick and softened his face to something more approachable less modelperfect the laugh was deep and charming his large hands wore a silver ring with a diamond as big as my thumb but no wedding ring there wasnt even a telltale pale line where the ring had been removed his skin was dark enough that there should have been a tan line hed never worn a ring i always felt that any man who didnt want to wear a wedding band was probably planning to cheat there are always exceptions but not many for his part he seemed pleased your eyes glow like green jewels id left the brown contact lenses at the office my natural eye color really did glow i thanked him for the compliment playing shy looking into my drink it wasnt shyness i was trying to keep him from seeing the contempt in my eyes both human and sidhe culture abhor an adulterer the sidhe dont worry about fornication but once you get married give your word that you will be faithful then you must be faithful no fey will tolerate an oath breaker if your word is worthless then so are you he touched my shoulder such perfect white skin when i didnt chase him away he leaned in and placed a soft kiss on my shoulder i stroked his face as he drew back and that seemed to be a signal of some kind he kissed the side of my neck hand touching my hair your hairs like red silk he breathed against my skin is it your natural color i turned into him answering him with my mouth just above his yes he kissed and it was gentle a good first kiss i hated the fact that he seemed so sincere what was truly horrible was that he might be sincere that at the beginning of the seduction he might mean every word id met men like that before its as if they believe their own lies that this time it will be true love but it never lasts because no woman is perfect enough for them of course it isnt the women who arent perfect enough its the man he tries to fill some void in himself with women or sex if the love is true enough the sex good enough then this time hell feel complete this time hell finally be whole serial womanizers are like serial killers in one respect they both believe that next time will be perfect that the next experience will complete them and stop this unending need but it never does he whispered lets get out of here i nodded not trusting my voice id be doing a lot of eyesclosed kissing because sometimes i could lie with my eyes and sometimes i couldnt it was going to be hard enough to keep the reluctance out of my body as he touched me expecting my eyes to show lust and love was asking too much his car matched the rest of him expensive sleek fast a black jaguar with black leather seats so that it was like sliding into a pool of darkness i put my seat belt on he didnt he drove fast weaving in and out of traffic it would have been more impressive if i hadnt been driving in la for three years everyone drove like this out of sheer selfdefense the house was neat and small the smallest in the neighborhood but it had the largest yard there was actually enough land on either side that even a midwesterner would say it had a goodsized yard the house looked like a place for kids to wait for daddy to come home while mom rushed around in her power suit trying to fix dinner after a hard days work for a moment i wondered if hed actually taken me to his home the one he shared with frances if so it was a break in his pattern and i didnt like that why would he break his pattern i knew he hadnt found the bug and he hadnt touched my purse which meant he didnt know about the hidden camera in it i was saving turning it on until we got to his love nest he couldnt know ringo was posted outside the norton house watching over mrs norton if alistair got too violent before we could get him in jail ringo was on his own best judgment over whether to intercede i didnt look around for ringo if he was here i didnt want to draw attention to him alistair opened the door for me helping me out of the car i let him because i was trying to think i finally tried for honesty sort of you sure youre not married why do you ask this looks like a house for a family he laughed and drew me into the circle of his arm no family just me i just moved in i looked up at him are you buying with an eye for the future munchkins and the family thing he raised my hand to his lips with the right woman anythings possible lord and lady but he knew just how much carrot to dangle in front of most women imply that you could be the woman to tame him make him settle down most women love that i knew better men dont settle down because of the right woman they settle down because they are finally ready for it whatever woman theyre dating when they get ready is the one they settle down with not necessarily the best one or the prettiest just the one who happened to be on hand when the time got to be right unromantic but still true hed moved out of his apartment why did it have something to do with naomi phelps leaving him abruptly did it make him nervous enough to move or had he been planning the move all along no way to know without asking and i couldnt ask as alistair norton ushered me through the door i fought an urge to look back to search for jeremy and the rest i knew my backup was out there i knew because i trusted them alistair hadnt driven fast enough to lose both vehicles the van for the sound system and to hide uther and the car with jeremy at the wheel in case they needed more maneuverability to follow norton or just to switch off so that he wouldnt notice the same car behind him for too long they were out there listening to us i knew that but still i would have liked to have glanced back and seen them just sheer insecurity on my part i felt the warding before the door opened when i stepped over the threshold power shivered over my skin he noticed do you know what youre feeling i could have lied but i didnt id like to say it was a hunch that alistair would be pleased that i was a trained mystic but that wasnt it i wanted him to know that i wasnt helpless youve got the door warded i said the air in the room pressed against my skin and it was as if i couldnt breathe deep enough like there wasnt enough air i stepped off the tiled entryway hoping the atmosphere would get better it didnt if anything the atmosphere grew heavier like wading into deeper water hot close skincrawling water id known he was powerful by the spells hed laid on his wife and his mistress but the amount of power that filled that empty living room was more than human the only way for a human witch to get that much power was to bargain with things not human i hadnt counted on that none of us had he was talking to me but i hadnt heard my mind was screaming leave leave now but if i did that alistair was still free to kill his wife and torture other women me leaving would keep me safe but it wouldnt help our clients it was one of those moments when i had to decide was i going to earn my paycheck or not one thing i did know the guys in the van needed to know what id found out the ward isnt to keep things out is it alistair though it will keep out other powers the ward is to keep anyone else from sensing how much power youve got in here my voice sounded breathy as if i was having trouble breathing he looked at me then and for the first time i saw something in his eyes that wasnt pleasant or smiling for an instant the monster was there in those brown eyes i should have known youd sense it he said my little merry with her sidhe eyes hair and skin if you were tall and willowy youd pass for sidhe so ive been told i said he held his hand out to me i reached for his hand but i had to reach through the power in the room like pushing my hand through an invisible skintingling thickness his fingers touched mine and a jolt of energy like static jumped between us he laughed and wrapped his hand around mine i forced myself not to pull back but i couldnt make myself smile i was having too much trouble breathing through the power id lived in places so full of power the walls groaned with it but this power had been allowed to fill the space available like water until there was no air space left alistair probably thought he was a big powerful witch to be able to call this much power but he was a baby witch if he couldnt control it better than this a lot of people can call power calling is not the measure of your strength as a practitioner its what you can do with the power that counts though as he pulled me gently through the brush of the hovering energy i did wonder what he was doing with all this magic he might be wasting a lot of it just letting it swirl around but you dont get this much energy without having some idea of what youre doing and some plan of what to do with it my voice sounded strange even to me strained and breathy the living room is full of magic alistair what are you going to do with all of it i hoped everyone in the van was getting this let me show you he said we were at the closed door in the lefthand wall whats behind the door i asked it was the only door visible from the entrance there was an open hallway that led from the rear of the living room farther into the house and an open entranceway into the kitchen it was the only closed door and if the guys had to come save me i didnt want them wandering around i wanted them to come straight in and get me out lets not pretend merry we know why youre here why were both here its the bedroom he opened the door and it was the bedroom it was red from the fourposter bed to the drapery that covered every wall to the carpet it was like standing inside a crimson velvet box mirrors were set between the heavy drapes like jewels set to charm the eye there were no windows it was a closed box and the center of the magic that had been called to this place the power rolled over me like suffocating fur warm close choking i couldnt breathe couldnt speak my feet stopped working but alistair didnt seem to notice he kept leading me pulling me into the room so that i stumbled and the only thing that kept me from falling to the polished wood of the floor was his arms he tried to lift me in his arms but i collapsed the rest of the way to the floor so that he couldnt lift me up i wasnt fainting i just didnt want to be picked up because i knew where hed take me to the bed and if that was the center of all this power i didnt want to go there not yet wait i said wait give a girl a second to catch her breath there was a small chest of drawers about waist high just inside the door i used the edge of the chest of drawers to get to my feet though alistair was there to help very solicitous i set my purse on the edge of the chest squeezing the handle twice to turn on the hidden camera if the camera was on it had a near perfect view of the bed he came up behind me arms wrapping around me from behind managing to pin my arms to my sides but not hard he meant it to be a hug the fact that it panicked me wasnt his fault not really i tried to relax against his body in the circle of his arms but couldnt the power was too thick and i couldnt relax the best i could do was not to pull away he nuzzled the side of my face lips moving down my skin youre not wearing any base i don t need any i turned my head just enough to encourage him to continue kissing down my face to my neck it was all the invitation he needed to work his way lower his lips stopped at my shoulder but his hands slid from my arms to encircle my waist god youre a tiny thing i can reach around you with my hands i moved gently away from him toward the bed my senses were dulling to the magic id had years of practice at ignoring amazing amounts of power if youre sensitive to such things and you dont want to go mad you adapt magic can become like white noise like the sounds of the city itself only coming to your attention when you concentrate i stood on the bright persian rug that surrounded the bed just like naomi had described it but i couldnt force myself to walk those last few feet to the bed because i could feel the circle that lay under the rug like a great hand pushing me away it was a circle of power something to stand inside while you conjured so that whatever you called wouldnt come inside and eat you or so you could call something inside the circle and remain safely outside i wouldnt know until i saw the runes which kind of circle it was whether it was a shield or a prison even seeing the runes and the construction of the circle might not tell me i knew sidhe witchery but there are other kinds of power other mystical languages to work magic with i might not recognize any of it and then there would be only one way to know what the circle was by walking into it the real trouble was that some circles are constructed to hold fey captive and once i was inside i might have trouble getting back out if they were really a bunch of fey wannabes they probably wouldnt be trying to capture us but you never know if you love something hard enough but can never touch it or keep it the love can curdle into a jealousy more destructive than any hate alistair loosened his tie as he walked toward me an anticipatory smile curling his lips he was utterly arrogant sure of himself and of me it was so tempting to just walk out just so i could watch that arrogance slide away he hadnt done anything mystical yet let alone illegal was i being too easy did he save the mystical stuff for the reluctant ones did i need to be more reluctant or more aggressive which would get alistair norton on tape doing something illegal i was still trying to make up my mind whether to be the unwilling virgin or the eager whore when he was there in front of me and i was out of time he bent down to kiss me and i raised my head up to meet him rising on tiptoe hands balancing on his arms his biceps flexed under my hands swelling against the cloth of his jacket i dont think he was even aware of it just habit he kissed like he seemed to do everything with a practiced ease smooth skill his arms wrapped around my waist pressed me to his body lifted me off the floor he started moving me backward toward the circle i drew back from the kiss enough to say wait wait but we were in it and it stole my breath for a second until we were on the other side inside the circle it was like being in the eye of a storm inside the circle was quiet the most restful place id felt in the entire house a tightness i hadnt known was there eased from my shoulders and back alistair scooped my legs up and walked us both onto the bed with his knees when we were near the center of the bed he laid me down and stayed on his knees looking at me towering over me but id worked alongside uther for three years six feet was nothing when youd been having lunch with thirteen i dont think i looked impressed enough because he took off the tie and tossed it to the bed fingers going to his shirt buttons he was going to undress first i was surprised a control freak usually wants their victim naked first he was out of his jacket and shirt hands going to his belt before i could figure out what to do slowing him down seemed to be good i sat up touching his hands slow down let me enjoy the unveiling youre rushing through it like youve got another date tonight i held on to his hands rubbing across his skin stroking his bare arms i concentrated on the feel of the tiny hairs on his forearms and how they slid under my touch if i concentrated just on the physical sensations one at a time i could make my eyes lie or at least show a genuine interest the trick was not to think too hard about who i was touching theres no one but you tonight merry he drew me to my knees then ran his hands through my hair letting it slide through his fingers so that he held my face in his big hands there will be no one else for either of us after tonight merry i didnt like the sound of that but it was the first thing hed said that was sort of psychotic so i was doing something right what do you mean alistair we eloping to vegas he smiled still holding my face staring into my eyes liked hed memorize them marriage is just a ceremony but tonight ill show you what it means to be truly one with a man i raised an eyebrow before i could help myself knowing my face already showed it i said my you do have a high opinion of yourself its not idle boasting merry he kissed me softly then crawled past me to the headboard of the bed he pressed on the wood and a little door sprang open a secret compartment how nifty he turned with a small glass bottle in his hands it was one of those glass bottles with curves and frills to it that youre supposed to keep expensive perfume in but no one ever does take off the dress he said why its massage oil he held the bottle up so i could see the thick oil in the light through the ruby glass i smiled at him and i tried to make it everything he wanted sexual flirtatious a little cynical the pants first he grinned at me evidently pleased i thought you said you wanted to go slow if were getting naked you first he started to turn and set the bottle inside the compartment again ill hold it for you i said he stopped in midmotion turning back to me with a heat in his eyes that was almost touchable only if you put some on your breasts while i undress will it stain my dress he actually seemed to think about that face becoming thoughtful intelligence showing through im not sure but ill buy you a new one if its ruined men will promise anything in the heat of the moment i said let me see the oil run down that pure white skin make them glisten for me he handed the bottle to me wrapping my hands around it he kissed me again mouth lingering on me his tongue probing opening my mouth so the kiss could be more he drew back slowly please merry please he moved back but not far hands at his belt again he drew the leather tongue slowly through the gold buckle drawing out each movement while he watched me it made me smile because he was doing what id asked he was slowly unveiling himself the least i could do was do what hed asked the pushup bra left enough of my breasts bare so that i didnt have to lift anything out of the dress i drew the stopper out of the bottle it had one of those long glass rods on the end of it to glide along your skin i sniffed the oil it smelled of cinnamon and vanilla there was something familiar about the odor but i couldnt place it the oil was nearly clear arent you supposed to warm it first i said it reacts to your bodys heat he pulled the belt out of the last loop and tossed it between us on the bed your turn i lifted the stopper out of the bottle the oil clung to it in a heavy strand i touched the end of the glass rod to the top of my breast the oil was already warm body temperature i trailed the rod across the mounds of my breasts and tiny trails of oil followed it tracing like thick tears across my skin the smell of cinnamon and vanilla seemed to soak into my skin like a warm rush alistair undid the snap on his pants and slowly drew down the zipper he wore red bikini underwear like hed dressed to match the bedroom the scarlet was very bright against his skin clinging over the front of his body like a second skin he lay down on the bed to get the pants off gazing up at me so that i towered over him on my knees as he had towered over me earlier he reached up still flat on his back running his fingertips across the oil spreading it over my skin he came to his knees hands smoothing over the tops of my breasts fingers trying to get inside the dress and touch more but it was too tight prior planning prevents embarrassing groping he rubbed his oiled hands down his own chest then took the bottle from me and trailed the glass stopper across my mouth like he was putting on lip gloss it was sweet upon my lips thick and sweet he kissed me both his hands still holding the bottle so that it was just his mouth on mine he kissed me like he was going to eat the oil off my lips i melted into the kiss hands stroking over his oiled chest feeling the muscles of his stomach moving under my hands my hand slid lower over the front of him finding him hard and ready the feel of him thrilled through my body like a jolt of energy that was when i realized that i was enjoying myself and had forgotten why i was there i drew back from the kiss and tried to focus to think i didnt want to think i wanted to touch him and have him touch me my breasts ached to be touched my mouth almost burned with the need to close the distance between us he leaned in for another kiss and i crawled backward falling onto my back in my rush to put distance between us alistair crawled to me on knees and one hand the other hand held the bottle he straddled me the way a horse stands over her colt my gaze kept sliding down his body to the hard front of him i couldnt keep my eyes on his face it was embarrassing and frightening stupid i said so stupid its in the oil theres a spell in the oil his voice came in an almost harsh whisper the oil is the spell i didnt understand what he meant at first but i knew i didnt want anymore of it on me he started to open the bottle and i sat up taking his hands in mine keeping the lid on the damn thing the moment i touched his hands i lost we were kissing again and i hadnt meant to it was as if the more we kissed the more i wanted to be kissed like it fed on itself i threw myself back on the bed hands covering my face no i knew what it was now branwyns tears aevals joy ferguss sweat it could make a human into a sidhe lover for one night it could turn even a sidhe into a sexual slave if that sidhe had no access to other sidhe no fey no matter how talented how powerful can rival the sidhe so its said you can forget what the touch is like you can fight not to dream of glowing flesh and eyes like molten jewels a sweep of anklelength hair across your body but the desire is always there just under the surface like an alcoholic who can never take another drink for fear that one drink will never be enough to satisfy that thirst i screamed loud and long and wordless there was another side effect of branwyns tears no glamour can stand against it because your concentration cant stand against it i felt my glamour leaking away felt my skin as if my entire body took a deep breath i lowered my hands slowly until i was staring up into the mirror on the ceiling my eyes glowed like tricolor jewels the outer edge of my irises was molten gold within that was a circle of jade green and last came emerald fire to chase around the pupil only the sidhe or a cat could have such eyes my mouth was a mixture of crimsons the remains of my lipstick and the scarlet gleam of the lips themselves my skin was a white so pure it shimmered like the most perfect of pearls again there was light coming out of my skin like a candle behind a veil the redblack of my hair fell around the shining colors like a spill of dark blood if my hair had been pure black id have looked like snow white carved from jewels this wasnt just me without the glamour it was me when my power was upon me when magic was in the air my god youre sidhe he whispered i turned those glowing eyes to alistair i expected fear in his eyes but there was a kind of soft wonderment he said you would come if we were faithful if we truly believed and here you are who said id come a sidhe princess to feast upon he spoke in a voice that held awe but his hands slid under my dress fingers curling over the band of my panties i grabbed his wrist and slapped him with the other hand slapped him hard enough to leave a red imprint of my hand on his face we had all the proof we needed to put him in jail i didnt have to play along anymore you can take the energy of branwyns tears and turn it from sex to violence or so they say in the unseelie court i was going to try i was really going to try if hed hit me back it might have worked but he didnt he collapsed his body on top of mine pinning me to the bed he was so low on my body that his face was level with mine there was a moment where i looked into his eyes and i saw the same stricken need in his eyes that i felt in mine the tears cut both ways you could not use it to seduce without being seduced he made a small sound low in his throat and kissed me i ate at his mouth one hand going to the ponytail holder that held his hair back i jerked it out spilling his shoulderlength hair around me like a silken curtain i plunged my hands into his hair two fistfuls of it held tight while i explored his mouth his free hand tried to reach down the dress for my breast but it was still too tight he pulled at the cloth and my body jerked with the force of it as the cloth ripped and his hand spilled inside my bra the touch of his hand on my breast jerked my head back freed my mouth from him i was suddenly looking behind us at the mirrors on the far wall it took me a few seconds to realize something was wrong part of it was distraction alistair was kissing my neck working his mouth over my skin ever lower part of it was someone elses magic someone powerful didnt want me to know they were watching but the mirrors were blank like the eyes of the blind i looked up at the mirror above the bed and it was empty too as if alistair and i werent there then i felt the spell like a great sucking wound drawing my power to the surface until it spilled from the pores of my skin and up up into that mirrored surface whatever it was it was feeding off my power like a psychic leech it pulled the power slowly like sucking up a straw i did the only thing i could think of i shoved the power into the throat of the spell forcefed my power into the magic they hadnt expected that and the magic shuddered there was a figure in the mirror but it wasnt alistair or me the figure was tall slender covered in a hooded grey cloak that hid every inch of the body the cloak was illusion an illusion to hide the witch at the other end of the spell every illusion can be stripped away alistairs mouth bit gently on my breast and my concentration shattered i looked down at him as he drew my nipple into his mouth it felt as if his mouth drew on a hot line that went directly from my breast to my groin it tore a gasp from my throat made me writhe under his touch a small part of me hated that this man could make my body react but the larger part of me had turned to nothing but nerve endings and engorged flesh i was sinking deeper into branwyns tears drowning in them soon thered be no thinking just sensations i couldnt think to draw power all i could smell feel taste was cinnamon vanilla and sex i took that sex that need and wrapped it in my mind and shoved it into the spell the cloak wavered and for a second i almost saw what lay behind it but alistair went to his knees blocking my view he pulled his underwear down his hips his thighs and i was suddenly staring at the hard gleaming length of him it took my breath away for a second not because he was so wonderful but just out of pure need it was as if my body saw the cure for all this need and the cure was lying flat against alistairs belly i dont know if it was the sight of him nude or the power id shoved into the spell but i was feeling more myself a throbbing nymphomaniac self but still it was an improvement i sat up the front of the dress was torn away my bra pulled down so that my breasts were bare i said no alistair no we are not doing this a prickle of energy spilled over the bed running in goose bumps on my body alistair looked up as if he saw something i didnt and said but you said to only use small amounts too much could drive her mad he listened face intent i heard nothing whatever was in the mirror wasnt hiding from alistair just from me alistair opened the bottle i had time to say no my hand went out as if to ward off a blow he threw the oil on me it was like being touched by some great liquid hand i couldnt move couldnt do anything but scream he poured the oil down the front of my body it soaked through my dress to the skin underneath he raised the skirt and this time i couldnt stop him i was frozen overwhelmed he poured the oil over the satin of my panties and i fell back onto the bed my spine bowing hands scrambling at the sheets my skin felt like it was swelling stretching with a desire that narrowed the world down to the need to be touched to be held to be had it wouldnt have mattered who it was the spell did not care and neither did i i opened my arms to the naked man kneeling over me he collapsed on top of me i could feel him tight and heavy against the satin of the panties even that thin piece of cloth was too much i wanted him inside me wanted it more than id ever wanted anything or anyone then something floated down from the mirror it was a tiny black speck but it held my attention compelled it it got closer and i could see that it was a small spider hanging from a silken thread i watched the spider float slowly to alistairs shoulder the spider was small and black and shiny like patent leather my body was cooler my head clearer jeremy had managed to get something through to me i knew now that the magician on the other end of the spell had kept them all trapped outside the house i felt the smooth head of alistairs penis slip around the edge of the panties touching my swollen wetness it made me cry out but i could still talk still think now if i couldnt get away it really was going to be rape stop it alistair stop it i struggled to get out from under him but he was too big too heavy i was trapped he started to push inside me i got a hand between his groin and mine he could have penetrated me but it seemed to distract him he fumbled at my hand trying to move it so he could finish i screamed jeremy alistair and i fought over where my hands were and i glimpsed the mirror it was full of grey swirling fog it shivered rippling like water it bowed out like a bubble it was only then that i knew that the magician was sidhe he or she was hiding themselves from me but the mirrors that was sidhe magic then alistair won the fight and slipped the tip of himself inside me i cried out and it was half protest and half pleasure my mind didnt want this but the oil still rode my body i screamed no but my hips twitched under him trying to help him slide inside me i wanted needed him to be inside me to feel his naked body inside of mine still i screamed no alistair flinched and pulled out of me the small distance hed won rising to his knees brushing at his back he came away with a small smear of crimson hed crushed the spider another small black spider crawled down his arm he batted it away two more spiders crawled over his shoulders he tried to touch the middle of his back and turned like a dog chasing its tail and i saw his back the skin had split open and a wave of tiny black spiders poured out they swarmed over him like black water a moving biting second skin he screamed clawing at his back crushing some of them but there were always more until he was a moving mass of them they poured into his open mouth as he shrieked and he choked and still he screamed all the mirrors were pulsing breathing the glass stretching out and in like something elastic and alive i heard a mans voice in my head get under the bed now i didnt argue i rolled off the bed and crawled under it the red sheets spilled down over the edge hiding everything but a thin sliver of light there was a sound of breaking glass like a thousand windows breaking all at once alistairs screams vanished under the sound of falling glass the glass burst on the carpet like brittle hail a tinkling sharp sound silence filled the room by degrees as the glass settled over the room there was a sound of splintering wood i couldnt see it but i thought it was the door merry merry it was jeremy roane yelled merry dear god i crawled to the edge of the bed and lifted the rim of the sheet to see the floor glittering silver i called im here im here i reached my hand out from under the bed waving it but unable to move farther without getting cut on the glass a hand gripped mine and someone laid a suit jacket over the glass so that roane could pull me out from under the bed it wasnt until he was cradling me in his arms that i realized i was still covered in branwyns tears and what that might mean for us but id gotten a glimpse of what lay on the bed and it stole the words from my mouth i think i forgot to breathe for a second or two roane carried me toward the door i stared back over his shoulder at what lay on the bed i knew it was a man i even knew it was alistair norton but if i hadnt known what i was looking at im not sure id have known it was human the shape was as crimson as the sheets it lay on the glass had turned him into so much raw meat i couldnt see the spiders under all that blood i knew two things maybe three first the magician on the other end of the spell was sidhe second he or she had tried to kill me third if it wasnt for jeremy getting a spell through the ward id be just a smaller red lump on the bloodsoaked bed i owed jeremy a very big favor chapter the police wouldnt let me shower they wouldnt even let me wash my hands four hours after roane carried me out of the bedroom i was still trying to explain to the police exactly what had happened to alistair norton i wasnt having much luck no one believed my version of events theyd all watched the tape and they still didnt believe me i think the only reason i hadnt been charged with alistairs murder was that id been outed as princess meredith nicessus they knew and i knew that all i had to do was claim diplomatic immunity and i could walk out the door so they were taking their time about charges what they didnt know was that i was almost as eager to avoid bringing in the diplomats as they were once i claimed diplomatic immunity theyd contact the board of humanfey relations they would contact the ambassador to the sidhe courts the ambassador would contact the queen of air and darkness hed tell her exactly where i was knowing my aunt shed tell them to keep me safe until her guard could arrive to bring me back home id be trapped like a rabbit in a snare until someone came along to snap my neck and take me home like a prize i sat at the small table with a glass of water in front of me i had a blanket that the paramedics had given me draped over the back of the chair the blanket had been to keep me warm in case of shock and to cover the ruined front of my dress id spent part of the last few hours being cold and needing the blanket but the rest of the time it was as if my blood ran hot i was either shivering or almost sweating a combination of shock and branwyns tears going from one extreme to the other had given me an amazing headache no one would get me anything for the headache because they were all planning on getting me to the hospital soonalways soon never now id still been glowing softly when the first police backups had arrived i wouldnt be able to do glamour as long as the oil was in my system so i couldnt hide some of the first uniforms recognized me one of them had said youre princess meredith the soft california night had taken a breath around us and i knew it was only a matter of time until the queen of air and darkness sent someone to investigate this latest whisper i had to be out of town before that happened i had at least one more night maybe two before my aunts guard would arrive i had time to sit here and answer questions but i was getting tired of answering the same questions so why was i still sitting in the hardbacked chair looking across a small table at a detective id never met before first even if i walked out of here without being charged or claiming diplomatic immunity they would contact the politicians theyd do it to cover their asses second i wanted detective alvera to believe me about branwyns tears and just how serious it would be if there was more of the oil out there probably it was a gift from whatever sidhe had set up the leech spell the one bottle may have been all anyone outside the courts had that was the bestcase scenario but if there was even the slightest chance that humans with or without sidhe help had figured out how to manufacture branwyns tears and it was out on the market then it had to be stopped of course there was another possibility the sidhe that set norton up in his little magicrape scam might have been giving branwyns tears to lots of others this was probably the more likely of the two worstcase scenarios but i couldnt tell the police that another sidhe had been involved with alistair norton you do not take sidhe business to the human police not if you want to keep all your body parts attached police are good at smelling lies or maybe to save time they just assume everyone is lying whatever the reason detective alvera didnt like my story he sat across from me tall dark slender with hands that looked too big for his narrow shoulders his eyes were a solid brown with a fringe of dark lashes that made you notice them or maybe that was just me tonight jeremy had laid a warding over me to help me control the tears hed traced runes across my forehead with his finger and his power nothing visible to the police but i could feel them like a cold fire if i concentrated without jeremys spell goddess knew what id have done by now something embarrassing and slutty even protected by the runes i was very aware of all the men in the room alvera stared at me with lovely distrustful eyes i watched how the shape of his lips formed words such a generous mouth a kissable mouth did you hear what i just said ms nicessus i blinked at him and realized i hadnt im sorry detective could you repeat it i think this interrogation is coming to an end detective alvera my lawyer said its obvious that my client is very tired and in shock my lawyer was a partner at james browning and galan she was galan usually browning handled the grey detective agencys legal affairs i think eileen galan was here because jeremy had mentioned the rape part a woman would be more sympathetic or at least that was the theory she sat beside me in her dark pinstriped skirt suit so neat and pressed she looked like shed just been unwrapped her greying blond hair was styled perfectly her makeup was flawless there was even a shine on her black highheeled pumps it was two oclock in the morning and eileen looked like shed just finished a power breakfast and was eager to greet the day alveras gaze went over me from the pushup bra shoving my breasts in plain view to my eyes last she doesnt look like shes in shock to me counselor my client was raped detective alvera yet she has not been taken to a hospital or examined by a doctor the only reason i have not demanded these things is my clients determination to answer your questions and aid you in this investigation frankly im beginning to think my client is not capable of protecting her own interests tonight i saw how she was brutalized on the tape i must step in for merediths rights even if she doesnt want me to alvera and i looked at each other across the table he spoke the next words staring directly at me major eye contact i saw the tape too counselor it looked like your client was enjoying herself most of the time she said no but her body kept doing yes if alvera thought that i was going to crack under the pressure of his steely gaze and his insults he just didnt know me even normally it wouldnt have worked but tonight i was too numb to rise to such poor bait that is insulting not just to my client but to women everywhere detective alvera this interview is over ill expect a police escort to the hospital for the rape kit he just looked at her with those pretty jaded eyes a woman can keep saying no stop but if shes playing with a mans dick you cant blame him for getting mixed messages i smiled shaking my head you think this is funny ms nicessus the tape may make a case for rape but it also shows you turning alistair norton into so much raw meat one more time i did not kill alistair norton about the rape youre either trying to be deliberately insulting to get me angry enough to say something indiscreet or youre a male chauvinist asshole if the first is true youre wasting your time if the second is true youre wasting mine im sorry that answering questions about a man you left to bleed to death in his own bed at his own house is a waste of your time what kind of man has a house that his wife doesnt know about i asked he was cheating on his wife so he deserved to die is that it i know you fey have a thing about marriage and monogamy but execution seems a bit harsh my client has said repeatedly that she did not do the spell that caused the mirrors to crack but shes alive counselor if she didnt do the spell then how did she know to take cover i said already that i recognized the spell detective alvera why didnt norton recognize the spell hes got a rep as a bigtime magician he should have seen it coming too i told you that branwyns tears effects humans more strongly than it effects the sidhe he wasnt paying as much attention to his surroundings as i was where did the spiders come from i dont know i wasnt telling him that jeremy had done the spiders because then theyd start blaming him for the mirrors or maybe charge us both as conspirators he shook his head just say you did it it was selfdefense the only reason i am still sitting here is because i want you the police to understand how dangerous this spelled oil can be if there is more branwyns tears out there you need to find it and destroy it lust spells dont work ms nicessus aphrodisiacs dont work some magic potion thatll make a woman drop her pants for a man she doesnt want is bullshit it doesnt exist youll wish it didnt if it gets out into the general population maybe norton had the only bottle but just in case there is more of it out there please look for his friends he riffled back through the notebook that had been lying untouched on the table for a very long time yeah liam donald and brendan no last names two of them have faerie ears all of them with long hair yeah well be able to find them no problem of course they might be a lower priority since they arent wanted on murder charges eileen stood again come on meredith this interview is over and i mean it she looked at both of us as if we were naughty first graders and we would not dare argue with her i was tired and they werent going to believe me about branwyns tears i stood up alvera stood too sit down meredith are we on a first name basis alvera i dont know yours its raimundo now sit down if i said if i claim diplomatic immunity i walk out of here and it doesnt matter whos right or whos wrong i looked at him and thanks to jeremys ward i was able to just meet his eyes if i concentrated i hardly noticed the line of his upper lip he looked at me a long time before saying what would keep you from claiming diplomatic immunity and walking out that door princess you believing me about the lust oil raimundo he smiled sure i believe you i shook my head no joy detective a lie wont keep me in this room i was bluffing sort of i hoped he didnt call it what will he said i had an idea i needed to prove to the police just how serious branwyns tears could be sex with a sidhe would haunt a human forever but a taste of it wouldnt do permanent harm some dreams perhaps or extra eagerness in the bedroom for a while but nothing bad you needed the joining of flesh and magic in a major intimate way to be beyond the point of safety if we all shared the merest taste everyone would survive what if i could prove to you that the lust oil worked he crossed his arms over his chest and managed to look even more cynical which i hadnt thought possible im listening you believe that no spell can make you instantly lust after some stranger right he nodded thats right do i have your permission to touch you detective he smiled his gaze roaming over the front of my dress i hoped he was being deliberately insulting because otherwise he wasnt very bright and i needed him to be good at his job with a politically sensitive case like this one alvera was either the best they had or the worst they either hoped for super detective to clear it all up or were offering him up as a sort of preemptive scapegoat for when the shit hit the fan id hoped for super detective but i was beginning to lean toward scapegoat of course since i was lying about several things maybe i didnt want him to be good at his job but i wasnt lying about what he thought i was lying about honest a minute ago i was raimundo now you want permission to touch me and im back to detective its called a distancing technique detective alvera i said and here i thought you wanted to get up close and personal not distant i heard eileen galan draw a breath to speak and i stopped her holding up my hand its okay eileen he cant be this stupid and still have made detective so hes baiting me i dont know what he hopes to gain from it the humor drained from his eyes leaving them cold and dark unreadable as stone the truth would be nice you behaved yourself for hours in here suddenly in the last thirty minutes youve managed to insult me sexually several times and youve been staring at my breasts why the change those cold eyes stared at my face for a heartbeat or two being businesslike and professional wasnt getting me shit im listed as a rape victim in the initial reports whether you believe that or not your conduct in the last half hour could get you on the wrong end of a sexual harassment suit his eyes flicked to my still silent lawyer then back to me ive seen rape victims princess ive taken them to the hospital held their hands while they cried one girl was only twelve she was so traumatized she couldnt speak it took me nine days working with a therapist to get her to name her attackers you dont act like a rape victim i shook my head you arrogant man i made the last word sound like the worst of insults have you ever been raped raimundo he blinked but his eyes stayed neutral no then dont you dare presume to tell me how im supposed to be acting or feeling or any fucking thing im not so broken up tonight part of its the damn spell but part of it detective is that as rapes go this one wasnt that bad eileen said id been brutalized well shes a lawyer i can forgive her the choice of words but she cant know what the word means shes never seen what a man can do to a woman if he really wants to hurt her ive seen brutal detective and what happened tonight wasnt brutal but just because im not bleeding my life away through tubes or my face is still recognizable under the bruises doesnt mean it wasnt rape something passed through his eyes something i couldnt read then his eyes were back to giving nothing away this wasnt your first time was it his voice was soft gentle i looked at the floor afraid to meet his eyes not me detective not me a friend he said in that same gentle voice i looked up then and the sudden show of compassion almost did me in almost made me want to confide in him almost i remembered keelins face a mask of blood one eye socket crushed so that her eye had lolled out onto her cheek if shed had a nose it would have been broken but her mother was a brownie and they dont have human noses three of her arms had been held at awkward angles like the broken legs of a spider no sidhe healer would lay hands on her because she was so near death and they would not risk their own lives for a goblinbrownie halfbreed my father had carried her to a human hospital and reported the attack to the authorities my father had been prince of flame and flesh and even his sister the queen feared him so he was not punished for inviting the humans in it was on record i could talk about it without being punished so good to know there was something i could tell the whole truth on tonight tell me he said voice grown even softer when we were both seventeen my best friend keelin nic brown was raped my voice was bland and empty as alveras eyes had been moments before they broke the bones around one of her eyes so that the eye was just lying there on her face hanging by threads i took a deep breath and pushed the memory away not aware that id pushed it away with my hands as if that would help until id finished the movement ive seen people beaten but not like that never like that they tried to beat her to death and very near succeeded i had myself under control again i wasnt going to cry i was glad i hated to cry it always made me feel so weak im sorry he said dont be sorry for me detective alvera watching keelin heal gave me a measuring rod for violence if it wasnt as bad as what happened to keelin then it cant be that bad its gotten me through some very harsh things without having hysterics like tonight he said in that same talkthejumperdownfromtheledge voice i nodded yeah like tonight though i will admit that what happened to alistair norton was one of the worst things ive ever seen and ive seen some bad things i did not kill him im not saying i might not have killed him if hed completed the rape when i recovered from the lust spell i might have hunted him down i dont know but someone else took care of it for me who he asked my voice dropped to a whisper i wish i knew detective i really wish i knew do you need to touch me to prove this lust oil of yours is real i nodded you have my permission alvera said if i prove that the lust spell is real youll bring in narcotics yeah you swear it i said your word of honor his eyes got all serious he seemed to understand that his word meant something to me that it might not to a human finally he nodded yeah i give you my word i glanced at eileen galan and back to the oneway glass on the far wall spoken before witnesses the gods themselves beware of it if you break your promise he nodded should i be expecting a lightning bolt i shook my head no not a lightning bolt hed started to smile but when i didnt seem to think it was funny his smile faded i keep my word princess i hope so detective for all our sakes eileen took me to one side a few steps away from the detective what are you planning to do meredith are you a practitioner of any mystic art i asked im a lawyer not a witch then just watch its sort of selfexplanatory i drew away from her gently and walked back to alvera i stayed farther away than i would have normally just close enough that i could touch him id had oil on my fingers but some of it had rubbed off i wanted this to work so i drew my fingers across my breasts where the oil was still slick and shining branwyns tears had a long shelf life i reached out toward alveras face he leaned back out of reach i raised an eyebrow at him hand extended in midair you said i could touch you he nodded sorry habit he moved a step closer to me but maneuvered us so that we were in full view of our audience behind the oneway glass he visibly steeled himself not to flinch away from me i wasnt sure if he didnt want me touching him because i was fey or because he thought id murdered someone by magic or because of some esoteric cop thing i traced my fingertips along his full mouth until they glistened like lip gloss his eyes widened and he looked softly stunned i stepped away from him and he reached toward me then stopped himself he folded his arms across his chest and tried to talk then shook his head i went back to my chair and sat down i crossed my legs and the skirt was short enough that i flashed the lacy edge of the thighhighs alvera noticed he watched every move of my hands as i smoothed the skirt into place i could see his pulse in his neck jumping under his skin the wide eyes the halfparted lips as he fought to control himself were very intriguing it took more selfcontrol than was pretty to not close the distance between us and make the first move i was still safe behind jeremys runes but it was an act of will not to go to him eileen galan was looking from one to the other of us a puzzled expression on her face did i miss something alvera just kept staring at me arms hugging himself as if afraid to move or even speak for fear that any forward motion would spill him over the edge and into my arms i answered her yes you missed something what branwyns tears i said softly alvera closed his eyes his body beginning to sway slightly are you all right detective eileen said he opened his eyes and said yeah im he looked back at me fine but that last was barely audible there was a kind of a panic on his face as if he couldnt believe what he was thinking i dont know how long he might have been able to stand there but i had run out of patience tonight i ran my fingertip over the white glistening mounds of my breasts and that was all it took he crossed the room in three strides grabbing my forearms lifting me to my feet he was nearly a foot taller than i was and he had to bend at an awkward angle but he managed he put those kissable lips against mine and the first taste tore jeremys careful spell away i was suddenly a throbbing needful thing my body still wanted to finish what had been denied it earlier i kissed him like i was feeding off of his soft lips my tongue seeking for something deep inside him my oiled hands caressed his face the more oil that touched him the stronger the spell he lifted me around the waist raising me to eye level so he didnt have to bend i wrapped my legs around his waist and i could feel him through the layers of cloth that separated us my body pulsed with the contact and i broke from the kiss not to breathe but to cry out he pressed me to the tabletop his groin grinding into me lying on the table he was too tall to maintain the kiss and keep our lower bodies pressed together so he raised himself up on his arms like a pushup keeping his body pressed into mine i stared up the length of his body and finally met his eyes they held the darkness that usually doesnt come to a mans eyes until later when the clothes are gone and theres no turning back i grabbed two handfuls of his shirt and pulled them sending his buttons flying baring his chest and stomach i raised up doing a sort of situp so i could lick down his chest run my hands across the flatness of his stomach i tried to put my hand down his pants but his belt defeated me suddenly the room was full of uniforms and plainclothes detectives they pulled alvera off me and he fought them they had to pile on top of him ride him to the floor in a mountain of uniforms he was screaming wordlessly i lay on the table the skirt hiked to my waist my body so full of blood and need that i couldnt move i was angry angry that theyd stopped us i knew that was stupid i knew i didnt want to have sex in an interrogation room in front of an entire precinct and yet i was still angry still wanting a young uniformed cop was standing beside the table he was trying not to stare and failing it was easy to grab his hand to press the tears over the pulse point in his wrist his blood beat against my hand and he bent over me kissed me before anyone noticed what was happening someone said jesus riley dont touch her hands grabbed riley tore him from my lips my hands i reached for him sitting up screaming no i started off the table to go to one of them when another detective grabbed my arms held me sitting on the tables edge he stared down at his hands as if hed burned them against my bare arms he said softly oh my god just before he bent and kissed me he yelled get some women officers in here i learned later that this mediumbuild slightly balding man with the strong hands and the muscled body was lieutenant peterson they had to handcuff him before they could carry him out of the room i was buried under a mound of female officers until i couldnt move a couple of the female officers had the same trouble that the men had just as at least one of the men had had no problem not manhandling me nothing like being outed at work they got jeremy back in to redo the warding i calmed eventually but i was in no shape to talk to anyone jeremy assured me that hed talk to narcotics for me though he was pretty sure that the officers who had been in the room with me would be persuasive on the dangers of branwyns tears roane was waiting for me a pair of surgical gloves on his hands so he could touch me a jacket to throw over my head to keep people from recognizing me the police took us out the back way so far the media didnt seem to know that id finally surfaced and under what circumstances but someone at the police station or on the ambulance would talk they might do it for money they might do it by accident but the media would find out it was only a matter of time a race to see which hounds would find me first the tabloids or the queens guard if id been well id have gotten in my car and driven out of state that night or caught the first plane to anywhere but roane took me to his apartment because it was closer than mine i didnt care where we went as long as there was a shower if i didnt get my body free of the tears or have sex soon i was going to lose my mind i was voting for a shower what i didnt realize until too late was that roane was voting for sex chapter the front part of my brain knew i should have had roane take me to my car there was a packet taped under the drivers seat with money a new identity complete with a drivers license and credit cards id always planned on simply driving out of the city or to the airport and taking the first plane that caught my fancy it was a good plan the police would be contacting the embassy by now and before dawn my aunt would know where i was who i was and what id been doing for three years the primitive rear of my brain wanted to jump roane while he was driving eighty on the freeway my skin felt large and swollen with need i actually sat on my hands in the car so i wouldnt touch him the last thing we needed was for me to contaminate him with the tears at least one of us needed to be sane tonight and until i had a shower it wasnt going to be me i mounted the stairs to roanes apartment hugging myself fingers digging into my arms hard enough to leave nail marks it was all that kept me from touching roane as he moved up the stairs just ahead of me he left the door open behind him and i followed him into the room he stood in the center of the large open space even in the dark the room was strangely bright the white walls gleaming in the moonlight roane stood a dark figure in the midst of all that silver gloaming he stared out at the sea as he did every time we entered his apartment stopped and stared out the bank of windows that made up the west and south walls the sea rolled out and out from the windows in a gleaming rushing spill of silver and dark with a rim of white foam riding like an edge of lace as the waves spilled toward the shore i would always be second in roanes heart because his love belonged to his first mistressthe sea he would mourn her loss when i was just dust in a grave there was a loneliness to that knowledge the same loneliness id felt at court watching the sidhe squabble about insults that occurred a hundred years before i was born and that the sidhe would still be quarreling about a hundred years after i died bitter a little but mostly just very aware that i was an outsider i was sidhe so i couldnt be human and i was mortal so i couldnt be sidhe neither fish nor fowl even feeling isolated left out my gaze slid to the bed it was a mound of white sheets and scattered pillowsroane had stripped it but had only done a haphazard job of remaking it if the sheets were clean he never understood the reason for getting the wrinkles out i had a sudden image of him naked against those white sheets the vision was so sharp that it hurt tightening my stomach twisting lower things until it was hard to breathe i leaned against the closed door until i could move then straightened i would not be controlled by chemicals and magic i was sidhe a weak lesser sidhe but that didnt change that i was the height of all we and men called magical i wasnt some human peasant with my first taste of faerie i was a princess of the sidhe and i would by goddess act like it i locked the door behind me and even the sound of the lock going home didnt make roane turn he would commune with his view until he was ready for me i didnt have the patience for it tonight i walked past him through the darkened room to the bathroom i turned the bathroom light on and was left blinking in the brightness the bathroom was tiny barely room for the stool small sink and the bathtub the tub might have been original to the house because it was deep and clawfooted and very antiquelooking the shower curtain had been strung on a rail above the tub the curtain had seals from all over the world on it with their common names in print by each image id ordered it from one of those catalogs that you always seem to get when you have a background in biology found it in among the animalmotif tshirts candles shaped like animals books about trips to the arctic circle and summers spent watching wolves in remote places roane had loved the curtain and id loved giving it to him i loved having sex in the shower surrounded by my gift for him i had a sudden image of his body wet and naked the feel of his skin slick with soap i cursed softly and flung the curtain aside i turned the water on so it would get warm i needed the tears off of me before i did something regrettable i would be safe tonight no one would be able to show up on my doorstep until tomorrow at the earliest i could take roane fill my hands with the silk of his skin coat my body in the sweet scented closeness of his body who would it hurt it was the tears talking not me i needed tonight for my head start if i was to get out of town the police wouldnt like me leaving town but the cops wouldnt kill me and my family would hell california wasnt even a death penalty state the dress was ripped enough that i tried to pull the sleeves down over my shoulders like a jacket but the zipper still held it in place the front of the dress was soaked thick and heavy with the oil id never known anyone to waste so much of something that even the sidhe considered so valuable but if id died with alistair norton then maybe the sidhe wizard was hoping that no one would know what branwyns tears were the sidhe were very snobbish about what the lesser fey did and did not know he she or they might have thought with me dead theyd be safe the sidhe whoever they were had given branwyns tears to a mortal to be used against other fey it was punishable by eternal torture there are a few downsides to being immortal one of the biggest is that punishment can last a very very long time of course so can pleasure i closed my eyes as if that would chase away the images that came flooding back it wasnt roane i was thinking of it was griffin hed been my fiancé for seven years if wed managed to get with child wed have been wife and husband but there had been no child and in the end there had been only pain hed betrayed me with other sidhe women and when i had the bad taste to protest hed told me he was tired of being with a halfmortal he wanted the real thing not a pale imitation i could still hear the words stinging in my ears but it was his golden flesh i saw behind my eyes his copper hair spilled across my body the way candlelight glistened along the shining length of him i hadnt thought about him in years and now i could taste him on my lips for this one night while the oil lasted it could make a lesser fey or a human sidhe they would shine with our power and give and take pleasure as one of us it was a great gift but like most gifts of faerie it was a doubleedged one because the human or fey would spend the rest of their life longing for that power that touch a human could waste and die from lack of it roane was a fey without his magic without his sealskin he had no magic of his own to protect him from what the tears could do to him id known how much i missed the touch of another sidhe but until this moment i hadnt realized how much if griffin had been in the other room id have gone to him i might have driven a knife through his heart in the morning but tonight id have gone to him i heard roane in the doorway behind me but didnt turn i didnt want to see him standing there i wasnt sure my abused strength of will could take it the front of the dress was ripped ruined but i still couldnt get the zipper myself could you please unzip me my voice sounded strangled as if the words had to be pulled from my lips i think because what i wanted to say was take me you rowdy beast but that lacked a certain dignity and roane deserved better than to be left craving something he could never touch again i could drop my glamour and sleep with him after this night but every night he touched me in true form would only draw the addiction tighter he unzipped me hands moving up to help slide the dress from my shoulders i jerked away from him my skin is soaked with the tears dont touch me even with the gloves on he asked id forgotten about the surgical gloves no i guess with the gloves youll be safe enough he lifted the cloth off my shoulders slowly carefully as if he were afraid to touch me i slipped my arms out but the cloth was so thick with oil that the dress wouldnt slide it clung to me like a thick heavy hand sucking against my skin as i peeled it down my body roane helped me pull the wet cloth over my hips kneeling so i could step out of it i was unsteady on the high heels and cursed softly that i hadnt taken them off sooner id closed my eyes so i wouldnt see him as he helped me undress i touched his shoulder to steady myself on the high heels and nearly fell anyway because my hand touched bare skin i opened my eyes and found him kneeling in front of me nude except for the gloves i stumbled back from him so violently that i ended up in the tub on my ass one hand held out in front of me to ward him off i was sitting in about an inch of water and fumbled for the faucets to turn the water off though i might have been better off leaving it on and crawling under it roane was laughing i thought id get you unzipped before you noticed but i didnt know youd close your eyes he stripped the gloves off using his teeth my dress still in his arms he plunged his naked hands into the oilsoaked cloth hugged it against his bare chest i was shaking my head over and over you dont know what youre doing roane he looked at me over the tub edge and there was nothing innocent in his big brown eyes for tonight i can be sidhe for you i sat in the tub like i was about to take a shower in my underwear and tried to sound reasonable all the blood seemed to have left my brain and gathered in other places it made it hard to think i cant do glamour tonight roane i dont want you to do glamour i want to be with you merry no masks no illusions without your own magic youll be like a human you wont be able to protect yourself from the charm youll be i wont wither and die for want of sidhe flesh merry i may have lost my magic but i am immortal you may not die roane but forever is a long time to want what you cannot have i know what i want he said i started to open my mouth to tell him at least part of the truth part of the reason that i had to clean myself off and get out of town but he stood up and my voice died in my throat i couldnt breathe let alone talk all i could do was stare he wadded the dress in his hands so tight that the muscles in his arms strained with the movement oil squeezed out of the cloth gliding in slow lines from his chest across the flat smoothness of his stomach trailing ever lower he was already smooth and hard but when the oil slid over him his breath caught in a sharp hiss he ran one hand down his stomach spreading the oil in a gleaming sheet across the pale perfection of his skin i should have told him to stop should have screamed for help but i watched his hand move lower until he cupped himself slid the oil over the hardness of himself his head threw back eyes closed and words tore in a loud gasp from his strained throat oh gods i remembered that there was something important i should have been saying or doing but for my life i couldnt remember what it was i was thinking things but not words words had deserted me leaving only images sight touch smell and finally taste roanes skin tasted overwhelmingly of cinnamon and vanilla but under that was something green herbal a light clean taste like drinking spring water straight from the heart of the earth under all that was the taste of his skin sweet smooth and lightly salted with sweat we ended on the bed my clothes were gone though i didnt remember them going we were naked and slick with oil on the clean white sheets the feel of his body sliding over mine brought my breath shuddering from between halfparted lips he kissed me tongue probing and i opened to him rising from the bed to force his tongue deeper inside my mouth my hips moved with the kiss and he took it as invitation sliding inside me slowly until he found me wet and ready then he slammed the length of him inside me as fast as far as it would go i cried out under him body rising off the bed then falling back against the sheets staring up at him his face was inches from mine his eyes so close they filled my view he watched my face as he moved inside me halfraised on his arms so he could watch my body writhe underneath him i couldnt stay still i had to move had to rise up to meet him until a rhythm built between us a rhythm forged of pounding flesh the thundering of our hearts the slick juices of our bodies and the throbbing of every nerve it was as if one touch was many caresses one kiss a thousand kisses each movement of his body seemed to fill me like warm water spreading out and out filling up my skin my muscles my blood my bones until it was all one rush of warmth that built and built like the press of light as night fades my body sang with it my fingertips tingled and just when i thought i couldnt hold any more the warmth turned to heat and roared over me through me distantly i heard noises screaming and it was roane and it was me he collapsed on top of me suddenly heavier his neck lying against my face so that i felt his pulse like a racing thing jumping against my skin we lay there entwined as intimately as man can be with woman holding each other until our hearts slowed roane raised his head first propping himself on his arms to look down at me the look was one of wonderment like a child who had learned a new joy that until that moment he hadnt known existed he said nothing just stared down at me smiling i was smiling too but there was a vein of wistfulness to mine i remembered now what id forgotten i should have showered and fled the city i should never have touched roane with branwyns tears on our bodies but the damage was done my voice came soft strange to my own ears as if we hadnt spoken for a very long time look at your skin roane glanced at his own body and hissed like a startled cat he rolled off my body to sit staring at his hands arms everything he was glowing a soft nearly amber light as if fire were being reflected through a golden jewel and that jewel was his body what is it he asked voice low and almost frightened you are sidhe for tonight he looked at me i dont understand he said i sighed i know he put his hand just above my skin i glowed with a white cold light like moonlight caught behind glass the amber glow of his hand reflected off the white glow turning it pale yellow as his hand moved just above my skin what can i do with it i watched him move that glowing hand down my body still careful not to touch my skin i dont know every sidhe is different we all have different abilities different variations on a theme he laid his hand against the scar on my ribs just under my left breast it hurt like the twinge of arthritis when its cold but it wasnt cold i moved his hand away from the mark it was the perfect imprint of a hand bigger than roanes longer more slender fingers it was brown and raised slightly above my skin the scar turned black when my skin glowed as if the light could not touch it a bad spot what happened he asked i was in a duel he started to touch the scar again and i grabbed his hand pressing our flesh together forcing that amber glow into my white it felt as if our hands melded together the flesh parting swallowing he jerked away rubbing his hand against his chest but that slid the oil over his hand and that didnt help roane still didnt understand that hed had only the first taste of what it could mean to be sidhe every sidhe has a hand of power some can heal by touch some can kill the sidhe i fought placed her hand against my ribs she broke my ribs tore through muscle and tried to crush my heart all without ever breaking the skin you lost the duel he said i lost the duel but i survived and that was always win enough for me roane frowned you seem saddened i know you enjoyed it why such gloom he trailed a finger along my face and the glow intensified where we touched i turned my face from him its too late to save you roane but its not too late to save myself i felt him lie down beside me and i moved my body just enough to keep him from lying the length of himself along the length of me i looked at him from inches away save you from what merry i cant tell you why but i need to leave tonight not just this apartment but the city he looked startled why i shook my head if i told you that youd be in more danger than you already are he accepted that and didnt ask again is there anything i can do to help i smiled then laughed i cant go to my car let alone the airport glowing like a rising moon and i cant do glamour until the oil wears away how long he asked i dont know i stared down the length of his body and found him limp though he recovered quickly as a rule but i knew something he didnt tonight like it or not i was sidhe what is your hand of power he asked though it had taken him a long time to ask the question he must have truly wanted to know to ask that which was not offered i sat up i dont have one he frowned you said all sidhe have one i nodded its one of many excuses the others have used over the years to deny me deny you what everything i ran my hand just above the line of his body and the amber light intensified following my touch like a fire when you breath on it to make it glow when our hands melded it was one of the side effects of the power our entire bodies can do the same he raised eyebrows at that i cupped him in my hand and he responded but i spilled power into him and he was instantly hard instantly ready it made his stomach contract made him sit up moving my hand away from him it felt almost too good it almost hurt i nodded yes he gave a nervous laugh i thought you didnt have a hand of power i dont but i am descended from five different fertility deities i can bring you back to strength all night as quickly and as often as we want i leaned my face toward his you are like a child tonight roane you cant control the power but i can i could bring you again and again until you rubbed yourself raw and begged me to stop hed lain down on the bed as i moved over him until he was staring up at me eyes wide his auburn hair spilled around his face tonight it was almost the same shade as mine almost he spoke in a breathy rush if you do that it will be your flesh that gets rubbed raw too think if i was not the only sidhe in this room roane think what we could make you do and you could not stop us i spoke the last into his halfparted lips when i kissed him he jumped as if it had hurt and i knew it hadnt i pulled back enough to see his face youre afraid of me he swallowed yes good now you begin to understand what you have called to life in this room power comes with a price roane and so does pleasure you have called both and if i were a different sidhe you would pay dearly for them i watched the fear slide across his face fill his eyes it pleased me i liked the edge that fear could give sex not the big fear where you truly werent sure youd both come out alive but the lesser fear where you risked blood pain but nothing that wouldnt heal nothing you didnt want there is a vast difference between a little game playing and cruelty i wasnt into cruelty i stared down at roane that sweet flesh those lovely eyes and i wanted to scratch nails over that perfect body sink teeth into his flesh and draw just a little bit of blood in a lot of different places the thought tightened my body in places where most people didnt respond to violence no matter how mild bad wiring maybe but there comes a point when you either embrace who and what you are or condemn yourself to be miserable all your days other people will try to make you miserable dont help them by doing the job yourself i wanted to share a little pain a little blood a little fear but roane wasnt into any of that hurting him wouldnt bring him pleasure and i wasnt into torture i was not a sexual sadist and roane would never know how lucky he was that that particular miswiring was not part of my urges of course there are always other urges i wanted him wanted him so badly that i didnt trust myself to be careful roane would carry the desire for this experience to his grave whenever that would be but he could carry more than psychological scars away from this night if i wasnt careful even now even here with him sidhe for this one night i couldnt drop all my control i was still going to have to be the one in charge the one that said what we would do and what we wouldnt the one that said how far things would go i was achingly tired of being the one who drew the line it wasnt just the magic i missed it was having someone else in charge or at least someone equal i didnt want to have to worry about hurting my lover i wanted my lover to be able to protect himself so that i could truly do what i wanted to do without fearing for his safety was that really too much to ask i glanced back at roane he lay on his back one arm flung over his head the other arm lying across his stomach one leg drawn up so that he was displayed in all his glory the fear had faded from his face leaving only desire behind he had no idea how bad things could get in the next few hours if i wasnt ever so careful i hid my face in my hands i didnt want to be careful i wanted everything that the magic could give me tonight and to hell with the consequences maybe if i hurt him enough roane wouldnt look back on it as something wonderful maybe he wouldnt crave it like some golden dream maybe hed fear it like a nightmare a small voice in my head said it would be kinder in the long run make him fear us our touch our magic so that he would never want the touch of sidhe hands on his body again a little pain now to save him from an eternity of suffering later on i knew it was lies and still i couldnt look at him his fingertips brushed my back and i jumped like hed hit me i kept my hands over my face i wasnt ready to look again those arent burn scars on your shoulders are they i lowered my hands but kept my eyes closed no what then it was another duel he used magic to try and force me to shapeshift in the middle of the fight i heard felt roane moving along the bed closer to me but he didnt try and touch me again i was grateful but changing shape doesnt hurt it feels wonderful maybe to a roane but not to one of us changing shapes is painful like all your bones breaking at once and reforming i cant change shape on my own at all but ive seen it in others youre helpless for the minutes it takes to change form the other sidhe was trying to distract you yes i opened my eyes and stared into the blackness of the windows they acted like a dark mirror showing roane sitting just behind me body halflost to sight glowing like the sun behind the moon of my body the three rings of color in my eyes glowed bright enough that even from that distance you could see the individual colors emerald jade liquid gold even roanes eyes had lightened to a dark honey brown like glowing bronze sidhe magic suited him he reached for me and i tensed he traced his hand over the rippled skin of the scars how did you stop him from changing you into something else i killed him i saw roanes eyes widen in the windows felt his body tense you killed a sidhe royal yes but they are immortal i am truly mortal roane what is the one way for all the eternal fey to die i watched the thoughts flicker across his face and finally saw the realization in his eyes to invoke mortal blood the mortal shares our immortality and we share the mortals mortality exactly he sat close to me going up on his knees but he spoke to my reflection not directly to me but that is a very specific ritual you cant invoke mortality by accident the ritual for a duel binds the two participants together in mortal combat among the unseelie sidhe they share blood before they fight his eyes went wider still until they were like two huge pools of darkness when they drank your blood they shared your mortality yes did they know that i smiled then i couldnt help it not until arzhul died with my dagger sticking out of him you must have put up a hard battle for him to try and change your form its a major spell for the sidhe if he didnt fear death then you must have hurt him badly i shook my head he was showing off it wasnt enough that he meant to kill me he wanted to humiliate me first for one sidhe to force a shapeshift on another is proof that they are the more powerful magician so he was showing off roane said it was the closest he would probably get to asking what happened next i stabbed him just hoping to distract him but my father always told me never to waste a strike even if you know you face an immortal strike as if they could die because deathblows hurt more even if they wont kill did you kill the one who scarred you here his hand came from behind to trace my ribs i shuddered at his touch and not because it hurt no rozenwyn is still alive then why didnt she crush your heart his hands slid around my waist holding me against his body cradling me i let myself rest in the curve of his arms the solid warmth of his body because her duel was after arzhul and when i stabbed her she panicked i think she called the duel won without making the kill he rubbed his cheek along mine and we both watched the colors mingle as our skins touched it was the last duel then he said no i said he kissed my cheek very softly no no there was one more i turned my face to him his lips brushed not quite a kiss what happened he spoke the words in a warm breath against my mouth bleddyn had been one of the seelie court once before he did something so awful that no one will speak of it and he was cast out but he was so powerful that the unseelie court took him in his true name was lost and he became bleddyn it means wolf or outlaw or did once very long ago it meant he was an outlaw even among the dark court roane kissed the side of my neck where my pulse beat just under the skin my pulse sped at that light touch he raised his face enough to ask how was he an outlaw then he began to kiss his way down my neck he was subject to horrible rages for no reason if he hadnt been surrounded by immortals hed have killed people friends as well as enemies roanes kisses had worked down to my shoulder then my arm he stopped just long enough to say just rages then lowered his head and kissed until he found the bend in my arm he lifted my arm so that he could lock his mouth around the fragile skin at the bend he sucked sudden and sharp on the skin teeth sinking into my arm enough to hurt enough to make me gasp roane didnt care for pain but he was an attentive lover and he knew what i liked as i knew what he liked but i suddenly couldnt concentrate on what i was saying he raised his face from my arm leaving a round nearly perfect imprint of his small sharp teeth he hadnt broken the skin id never been able to persuade him to go that far but the mark against my flesh pleased me made me bend toward him he stopped me asking was it just rages or were there other things that marked bleddyn as dangerous it took me a second to remember i had to sit back from him if you want to hear the story behave yourself he lay on his side one arm flung underneath his head for a pillow he stretched his body so that i had to notice the way the muscles moved under that gleaming skin i thought i was behaving myself i shook my head youll make me forget myself roane you dont want that i want you tonight merry i want all of you no glamour no hiding no holding back he sat up suddenly peering so close to my face that i started to move back but he grabbed my arm i want to be what you need tonight merry i shook my head you dont understand what youre asking no i dont but if youre ever going to have everything tonight is the night he grabbed my other arm pulling us both to our knees his fingers digging in enough that i knew id be bruised tomorrow that one forceful movement made my heart beat faster ive lived for centuries merry if either of us is a child its you not me his words were fierce and id never seen him like this so forceful so demanding i could have said youre hurting me roane but i was enjoying that part so instead i said you dont sound like yourself i knew you held your glamour in place even when we lay together but i never dreamed how much you were hiding he shook me twice hard enough that i almost told him it did hurt dont hide merry he kissed me then bruising his lips against mine forcing his mouth against mine until if i hadnt opened my mouth he might have cut either his lips or mine on our teeth he forced me back on the bed and i wasnt having a good time i liked pain not rape i stopped him with a hand on his chest pushing him away from me he was still above me eyes strangely fierce but he was listening what are you trying to do roane what happened in your last duel the change of subject was too fast for me what your last duel what happened his voice his face was all seriousness while his naked body pressed against mine i killed him how somehow i knew he wasnt asking about the mechanics of the kill he underestimated me i have never underestimated you merry dont do less for me dont treat me as less just because im not sidhe i am a thing of faerie with not a drop of mortal blood in my veins do not fear for me his voice was normal again but there was still an undercurrent of fierceness i stared up into his face and saw the pride there not a masculine pride but the pride of the fey i was treating him as less than fey and he deserved better but what if i hurt you without meaning to ill heal he said it made me smile because in that moment i loved him not the kind of love that the bards sing of but it was love all the same all right but lets pick a position that puts you dominant not me a thought filled his eyes you dont trust yourself no i said then trust me i wont break promise i said he smiled and kissed my forehead gently like youd kiss a child promise i took him at his word i ended with my hands gripping the cool metal rods of the headboard roanes body pinned mine to the bed his groin cupped against my buttocks it was a position that gave him a great deal of control and kept most of my body turned away from him i couldnt touch him with my hands there were so many things i couldnt do from this position and it was why id chosen it short of being tied up it was the safest thing i could think of and roane didnt like bondage besides the real dangers had nothing to do with hands or teeth or anything purely physical bonds wouldnt really have helped except to serve as a reminder for me to be careful i was very afraid that somewhere in the welter of power and flesh i would forget everything but pleasure and roane would suffer for it and i didnt mean suffer in a good way the moment he slid inside me i knew i was in trouble he was a fearsome thing holding himself up on his hands so that he could force himself into me with all the strength of his back and hips id once seen roane punch his fist through a car door to impress a wouldbe mugger that we werent worth the trouble it was like he was trying to push his way into my body and out the other side i realized something i hadnt before roane had thought i was human with fey blood but still human hed been as careful of me as i had of him the difference was that i feared my magic would harm him and hed feared his physical strength tonight there would be no holding back no true safety net for either of us for the first time i realized that i might be the one injured not roane sex with an edge of true danger theres nothing like it add magic that could melt your skin and it was going to be a very good night his body caught a harsh rhythm coming in and out of mine there was the sound of flesh hitting flesh every time he thrust into me this this was what id wanted for so very long he took my body and i felt the first wave of pleasure i suddenly worried that hed bring me before the magic had time to build i opened my metaphysical skin as id opened my legs but instead of letting him enter me i reached up to him i opened his aura his magic like hed unzipped my dress earlier his body began to sink into mine not physically but the effect is surprisingly similar he hesitated with his body sheathed inside mine stopping i could feel his pulse speeding speeding not from physical exertion but from fear he drew himself out of me completely and for one heartrending moment i thought he was going to stop that it would all stop then he entered me again and it was as if he gave himself completely to me to us to the night the amber and moonlight glow of our skins expanded until we moved in a cocoon of light of warmth of power every thrust of his body raised the power every writhe of my body underneath him drew the magic like a choking shield around us close and suffocating i knew that i was trying to draw him inside me not his organ but him like my magic was trying to drink him up i dug my fingers into the metal rods of the bed until the metal bit into my skin and made me think again roane collapsed his body on top of mine so that the line of his chest and stomach molded against my back while his groin thrust between my legs he couldnt get as much power from this angle but the magic flared between us at the touch of so much skin our bodies melded as our hands had earlier and i could feel him sinking into my back until our hearts touched fluttering together in a dance more intimate than anything wed known before our hearts began to beat together closer and closer until the rhythm was identical and it was one heart one body one being and i no longer knew where i stopped and roane began it was in that moment of near perfect unison that i first heard the sea a soft murmuring rush of waves on the shore i floated bodiless formless in a shining place of light with nothing but the beating of our joined hearts to let me know i was still flesh and not pure magic and in that shining formless place with no bodies to hold us there was a hurrying flowing spilling sound of water the sound of the ocean chased our heartbeats filled that bright place our heartbeats sank into the waves we sank deeper and deeper in a blinding circle of light under the water and there was no fear we had come home we were surrounded by water on every side and i could feel the pressure of the depth pushing against our hearts as if it would crush us but i knew it wouldnt roane knew it wouldnt the thought a separate thought sent us rising up and up toward the surface of the invisible ocean that held us i was aware of how frighteningly cold it was and i was afraid and roane wasnt he was joyous we surfaced and though i knew we were still pressed to the bed in his apartment i felt the air hit my face i drew a great breath of air and i was suddenly aware that the sea was warm the water was so warm warmer than blood warm enough to be almost hot i was suddenly aware of my body again i could feel roanes body inside mine but the swirl and rush of warm ocean flowed over us my eyes told me i was still on the bed hands holding to the headboard but i could feel the warm warm water swirling over us the invisible ocean filled the glowing light of our two mingled bodies like water inside a goldfish bowl the ocean held by our power like metaphysical glass our bodies were like the wicks of some floating candle caught in the water and the glass fire water and flesh our bodies began to be more real more solid the feel of invisible ocean began to fade the light of our skins began to shrink back inside the shields of our skins then the pleasure took us and the warmth that had been in the water in the light crashed over us we cried out the warmth became heat and it filled me up spilled out my skin my hands sounds tore from my mouth too primitive to be screams roanes body bucked against mine and the magic held us both drawing out the orgasm until i felt the metal of the bed begin to melt under my hands roane screamed and it wasnt a scream of pleasure finally finally we were free he rolled off of me and i heard him fall onto the floor i turned still lying on my stomach he was lying on his side one hand flung up reaching for me i had one quick glimpse of his face eyes wide and terrified before fur spilled over that face and he collapsed in a roil of sleek fur i sat up on the bed reaching for him knowing there was nothing i could do then there was a seal lying on the apartment floor a large reddishfurred seal staring at me with roanes brown eyes all i could do was stare there were no words the seal moved clumsily toward the bed then a seam that hadnt been there opened up the front of the animal and roane crawled out he stood up holding the new skin in his arms he stared at me a look of soft wonder on his face he was crying but i dont think he knew it i went to him touching the skin touching him as if neither one was real i hugged him and my hands found his back was whole untouched the skin as smooth and perfect as the rest of him the burn scars were gone he slipped the skin back on before i could find words the seal stared up at me moving around the room in awkward almost snakelike movements then roane stepped out of the skin again he turned to me and began to laugh he picked me up around the thighs lifting me up above his head wrapping us both in the sealskin he danced us around the room laughing while the tears hadnt even dried on his face i was crying too and laughing roane collapsed on the bed spilling me across it lying on top of his sealskin i was suddenly so tired horribly tired i needed to shower and leave i wasnt glowing anymore i was almost sure i could do glamour again but i couldnt keep my eyes open id been drunk only once in my life and id passed out that was what was happening i was about to pass out from branwyns tears or just too much magic we fell asleep curled in each others arms with the skin wrapped around us the last thing i thought before we fell into a sleep deeper than anything natural wasnt a thought for my safety the skin was warm as warm as roanes arms around me and i knew that the skin was just as alive just as much a part of him i fell into darkness curled between pieces of roanes warmth roanes magic roanes love chapter a voice was saying softly merry merry a hand stroked the side of my face smoothing back my hair i turned cuddling against the hand opening my eyes but the overhead light was on and i was blinded for a second i flung a hand up to guard my eyes and turned on my side burying my face in the pillow i managed to say turn off the light i felt the bed move and a second later the rim of brightness under the pillow was gone i raised my head from the pillow and found the room in near perfect darkness it had been nearly dawn when roane and i fell asleep it should have been light outside i sat up and looked around the darkened room somehow i wasnt surprised that jeremy was standing by the light switch i didnt bother looking for roane i knew where he was he was in the ocean with his new skin he hadnt left me unprotected but he had left me maybe it should have hurt my feelings but it didnt id given roane back his first love the sea there is an old saying never come between a faerie and his magic roane was in the arms of his beloved and it wasnt me we might never see each other again and he hadnt said goodbye but i knew that if ever i needed something he could give me i could go down to the sea and call him and he would come but he couldnt give me love i loved roane but i wasnt in love with him lucky me i knelt naked in the wrinkled sheets staring out at the black windows how long did we sleep its eight oclock friday night i slid off the bed and stood oh my god i take it that means that you still being in town after dark is a bad thing i looked at him he stood near the door and the light switch it was hard to tell in the dark but he seemed dressed in one of his usual suits impeccably tailored compact and elegant but there was an underlying tension to him as if he wanted to say other things more direct things or maybe he knew something already something bad whats happened nothing yet he said i stared at him what do you think is going to happen i couldnt quite keep the suspicion out of my voice jeremy laughed dont worry i havent made any calls but im sure the police have by now i dont know why youve been hiding all this time but if youre hiding from the sluagh the host then youre in deep trouble sluagh was a rude name for the lesser unseelie fey the host was the polite phrase rude first polite was an afterthought oh well only another unseelie could say sluagh and not have it be a mortal insult im an unseelie princess why should i be hiding from them he leaned back against the wall that is the question isnt it even across the room in the dark i could feel the weight of his gaze the intensity of it it was impolite for a fey to ask another direct questions but oh he wanted to ask you could feel the unasked questions like something touchable in the air between us jump in the shower like a good girl he lifted a bag from the floor near his feet i brought you clothes the van is downstairs with ringo and uther in it well get you to the airport helping me could be very dangerous jeremy then hurry i dont have my passport he tossed a small paperwrapped packet onto the bed it was the packet of papers that stayed taped under the seat of my car hed brought my new identity how did you know youve hidden from the human authorities your relatives and their henchmen for three years youre not stupid you knew youd be found thus you had a plan to cover yourself i will say that the next time id hide the secret papers in a different spot it was one of the first places i looked i stared at the packet then at him that wasnt all that was under the seat he opened his jacket like a model on the runway showing off the smooth line of his shirt and tie but he was flashing the gun tucked into the waistband of his pants it was just a darker shape against the paleness of his shirt but i knew it was a mm ladysmith because it was my gun he took an extra clip out of one pocket the box of extra ammo is in the sack with your clothes he laid the gun on top of the taped packet and stepped back around the bed so that it stood between us you seem nervous jeremy shouldnt i be nervous of me i didnt think youd be impressed with royalty i watched his face tried to read what lay underneath and couldnt he was hiding something he raised his left hand in the air lets just say that branwyns tears has a long shelf life take the shower i dont feel the power of the spell anymore good for you but trust me about the shower i looked at him its bothering you to see me nude he nodded my apologies for that but its why ringo and uther are down in the van just as a precaution i smiled at him and i found myself wanting to step closer to him to close a little of that careful distance i didnt want jeremy in that way but the urge to see just how much of a hold i could have on him was there like a dark thought it wasnt like me to want to push the envelope with a friend an enemy maybe but not a friend was it a leftover urge from last night or were the tears still affecting me more than i realized i didnt think about it again i just turned and walked to the bathroom a quick shower and wed be on our way to the airport twenty minutes later i was ready my hair still soaking wet i was dressed in a pair of navy blue dress slacks an emerald green silk blouse and a navy suit jacket that matched the pants jeremy had also chosen a pair of black lowheeled pumps and included a pair of black thighhighs since i didnt own any other kind of hose that i didnt mind but the rest of it next time you pick out clothes for me to run for my life in include some jogging shoes pumps no matter how lowheeled just arent made for it i never have any problem in dress shoes he said he was reclining in one of the stiffbacked kitchen chairs he made the chair look comfortable and he looked graceful as he reclined in it jeremy was too in control in a tight modern sort of way to ever be called catlike but cat was what came to mind as i watched him curled around the chair except that cats didnt pose they just were jeremy was definitely posed and trying to appear at ease and failing i am sorry that i forgot your brown contact lenses not that it seems to be a problem i like the eyes as jade green striking matches the blouse but very human though id have kept more red in the hair and made it less auburn red hair stands out at a glance even in a crowd glamour is supposed to help you hide not single you out i know a lot of fey that use glamour for nothing but attracting attention being more beautiful more exotic i shrugged thats their problem i dont need to advertise he stood all this time and i never guessed you were sidhe i thought you were fey true fey and hiding that for some reason but i never guessed the truth he stood away from the table hands at his sides the tension that had been in him since he woke me vibrated from him that bothers you doesnt it i said he nodded im this great magician i should have seen through the illusion or is that an illusion too are you a better magician than i am merry have you hidden your magic too for the first time i felt the power growing around him it could be just a shield then again it could be the beginnings of something more i faced him feet apart hands at my side mirroring him i called my own power slowly carefully if wed been gunslingers hed have had his gun out but not pointed i was still trying to keep my gun in its holster youd think after all this time i wouldnt trust anyone but i just couldnt believe that jeremy was my enemy we dont have time for this jeremy i thought i could treat you like nothing had changed but i cant i have to know know what jeremy i want to know how much of the last three years has been a lie i felt his power breathe out around him fill up that small tight space that was his personal aura he was pumping a lot of power into his shields a lot of power my shields were always in place tight and loaded for bear it was automatic for me so automatic that most people even very sensitive ones mistook the shielding for my normal power level it meant that i faced jeremy with shields at full strength i didnt have to do anything to add to it my shielding was better than his just a fact my offensive spells on the other hand well id seen jeremy work magic hed never get through my shields but id never be able to hurt him magically it would come down to blows or weapons i was hoping it wouldnt have to come to anything is the ride to the airport still open or did you change your mind while i was in the shower the ride to the airport is still on he said most of the sidhe can see magic in colors or shapes but ive never been able to do that i can feel it though and jeremy was crowding the room with all the energy he was pouring into his shields then whats with the power trip youre sidhe youre unseelie sidhe thats just a step above being a member of the sluagh jeremys highland accent leaked through onto the phrases id never heard him lose his allamericanfromthemiddleofnowhere accent made me nervous because many of the sidhe pride themselves on retaining their original accents whatever they may be and your point is what but i had a sinking feeling that i knew where he was going with it id almost have rather had a fight the unseelie thrive on deception they are not to be trusted am i not to be trusted jeremy does three years of friendship mean less to you than old stories some bitter thought crossed his face it is not stories and again his accent thickened i was cast out as a boy from the trow lands the seelie court would not deign to notice a trow boy but the unseelie court they take in everyone i smiled before i could stop myself not everyone i dont think jeremy got the sarcasm no not everyone he was so angry that a fine trembling had started in his hands i was about to pay the bill for a centuriesold grievance it wouldnt be the first time it probably wouldnt be the last but it still pissed me off we didnt have time for his temper tantrum let alone one of mine im sorry that my ancestors abused you jeremy but it was before my time the unseelie court has had a publicist for most of my lifetime to spread the lies he said in a brogue so thick it was guttural you want to compare scars i lifted my shirt out of my pants and let him see the handprint scar on my ribs illusion he said but he sounded doubtful you can touch it if you want glamour fools vision but not touch not for another fey this was a partial truth at best because i could use glamour to fool every sense even of another fey but it wasnt a common ability even among the sidhe and i was betting that jeremy would believe me sometimes a plausible lie is quicker than an unwanted truth he walked toward me slowly distrust clear on his face it made my chest tight to see that look on jeremys face he peered at the scar but stayed out of touching range he knew that the sidhes most powerful personal magic was touchactivated which meant he knew the sidhe more intimately than id thought i sighed and laced my fingers on top of my head the shirt slid down over the scar but i figured jeremy could move the cloth he kept peering up at me as he moved forward into arms reach he touched the green silk but stared into my eyes for a long time before he raised it as if he were trying to read my thoughts but my face had gone back to that familiar polite slightly bored empty look that id perfected at court i could watch a friend be tortured or put a knife into someones gut with the same look on my face you dont survive at the court if your face betrays your feelings jeremy lifted the cloth slowly never taking his eyes from my face he finally had to look down and i was very careful to make no move however small to spook him i hated that jeremy grey my friend and boss was treating me like a very dangerous person if he only knew how very undangerous i was he ran fingertips over the raised slightly roughened flesh theres more scars on my back but i just got dressed so if you dont mind this is as far as im going why didnt i see them when you were naked or in my office being fitted for the wire i didnt want you to see them but i dont bother hiding them when theyre under my clothes never waste magical energy he said as if to himself he shook his head as if he were hearing something i couldnt hear he looked at me and his eyes were puzzled we dont have time to stand here and argue do we ive been saying that shit he said its a spell of discontent distrust discord its means theyre coming now fear flowed over his face they could still be miles away jeremy or they could be just outside he said he had a point if they were just outside the door then a safer bet might be calling the police and waiting for help to arrive i wouldnt say that unseelie bad guys were hiding in the bushes but i was pretty sure that if i called up detective alvera and said that princess meredith was about to be killed on his turf theyd send help but if i could my preference was sneaking away i needed to know what was out there jeremy was looking at me strangely youve thought of something what is it the host isnt made up of sidhe except for one or two sent along as keepers masters of the hunt its part of the horror of being chased by them i may not be able to find the sidhe if they dont want to be found but the rest of the host them i can find he made a sweeping motion with his hands then by all means he didnt argue didnt ask if i could do it or if it was safe he just accepted it he wasnt acting like my boss anymore i was princess meredith nicessus and if i said i could search the night for the host he believed me he would never have believed merry gentry not without proof i cast outward keeping my shields in place but flinging my power wide it was dangerous because if they were on top of us then that opening might be all they needed to overwhelm me but it was the only way to know how close they were i felt uther and ringo outside felt their beings their magic there was the force of the sea and a thrumming to the land the magic of all living things but nothing else i cast farther and farther outward mile after mile and there was nothing then there almost at the edge of my limit something pressed on the air like a storm moving this way but it wasnt a storm or at least not a storm of wind and rain it was too far away for me to get a clear sense of what creatures of faerie rode with the sidhe but it was enough we had some time i pulled sack inside my shields squeezing them tight theyre miles from here then how did they do the spell of discord my aunt could whisper it on the night wind and it would find its target from illinois it might take a day or three but yes from illinois but dont look so worried she would never dirty her hands personally with fetchandcarry duties she may want me dead but not from a distance shell want to make an example of me and for that theyll need to get me home how much time do we have i shook my head an hour maybe two we can get you to the airport in time then getting you out of town is the only thing i can offer one sidhe magician one not even on the spot kept me out of alistair nortons house i cant break sidhe magic and that means im not going to be any help to you you sent the spiders through the warding at nortons house you warned me to hide under the bed you did great he gave me a strange look i thought you did the spiders there was a moment when we stared at each other it wasnt me i said it wasnt me either he said softly i know this is a cliché but if it wasnt you and it wasnt me i left the rest unsaid uther isnt capable of something like that roane doesnt do active magic i said i was suddenly cold and it had nothing to do with the temperature one of us had to say it out loud then who was it who saved me jeremy shook his head i dont know sometimes the unseelie can befriend you before they break you dont believe all the stories you hear jeremy its not a story anger made those simple words hot and unpleasant i realized suddenly just how afraid he was the anger was a shield for the fear his reactions all had a personal taste to them he wasnt just afraid in a general way it was specific based on something besides stories or legends have you been up close and personal with the host he nodded and unlocked the door we may only have an hour lets get out of here i pressed my hands to the door stopped him from opening it this is important jeremy if youve been in thrall to one of them then that sidhe will have power over you i need to know what was done then he did something i hadnt expected he started unbuttoning his shirt i raised eyebrows youre not still being affected by branwyns tears are you he smiled then not his usual smile but still an improvement i was befriended once before by a member of the host he left the tie and collar tight but unbuttoned the rest slipped his jacket off folded it over one arm and gave me his back lift the shirt i didnt want to lift the shirt id seen what my relatives could do when they got creative there were so many awful possibilities none of which i wanted to see carved into jeremys flesh but i lifted the crisp grey cloth because i had to know i didnt gasp because i was prepared screaming was overkill his back was covered in burn scars as if someone had pressed a redhot brand into his flesh again and again except this brand was in the shape of a hand i touched his scars as he had mine lightly fingers tracing them i started to put my hand over one of the hand marks then hesitated and warned him i want to place my hand over one of the scars to see the size he nodded the hand was much bigger than mine bigger than the mark on my own body a mans hand the fingers thicker than most of the sidhe do you know the name of the one who did this tamlyn he said he sounded embarrassed and he should have tamlyn was the john smith of faerie aliases tamlyn along with robin goodfellow and a handful of others were favorite false identities when true names were to be hidden you must have been very young not to suspect something when he gave that name i said he nodded i was that may i check your aura he smiled back at me over his shoulder the movement wrinkled the skin on his back making the scars form shapes aura is a new age word the fey dont use it personal power then i said but i was staring at his back i pushed the cloth of his shirt over his shoulders were you tied while this was done yes why can you put your hands in the position they were tied in he took a breath as if hed ask why but he finally just raised his hands above his head and moved into the door so that his body was flush against it he raised his arms until they were held extended as far as they would go slightly out from his body until he formed a y shape the shirt had slipped back into place and i had to raise it again but when i did i saw what i thought id find the handshaped burns had formed a picture it was the image of a dragon or maybe more accurately a wyrm long and serpentine it was vaguely orientallooking because of the hand shape but it was most definitely a dragon but the burns only formed the picture if jeremy was in exactly the same position as when he was tortured when he lowered his arms the skin separated and it was just scars you can lower your arms i said he did turning so that he could look at me he started tucking in his shirt i dont think he even realized he was doing it you look grim what did you see in the burns that no one else has seen dont tuck your shirt in yet jeremy i need to lay a warding on your back what did you see merry he stopped fussing with his shirt but didnt untuck it for me i shook my head jeremy had carried the scars for centuries and had never known that the sidhe had played a little game upon his flesh it showed such disdain for the victim a callousness that was hard to wrap your mind around of course it might be very practical cruelty with a purpose as it were the sidhe whoever it was could have laid a spell on the burns they might be able to call a dragon out of his flesh or shapeshift him into one probably not but better safe than sorry let me ward your back then ill tell you on the way down to the van do we have time he asked sure hold the shirt out of the way so the burns are bare he looked like he didnt believe me but when i turned him to face the door he didnt argue he held the silk shirt out of the way so i could work i spilled power into my hands like holding warmth cupped between my palms i slowly opened my hands palms facing jeremys bare back i placed my hands just above his skin that trembling warmth caressed his back and jeremy shivered under its touch what runes are you using he asked voice just a touch breathless im not i said i spread that warm power across the scars down his back he started to turn dont move what do you mean youre not using runes what else can you use i had to kneel to make sure the power covered every scar when i was sure that everything had been covered i sealed it visualizing the power like a coating of glowing yellow light just above his skin i sealed the edges of that glow so that it clung tight to his skin like a shield jeremys breath came out in a shivering gasp what are you using merry magic i said and stood can i let the shirt down yes the grey silk slid into place and the warding was so solid in my minds eye that i felt like the cloth should bunch over the magic but it didnt the silk slid over his back as if id done nothing to it but i never doubted that id done my job he began to tuck the shirt in before he even turned to face me you used just your own personal magic for that yes why not use runes they help empower our magic many runes are actually ancient symbols for longforgotten deities or creatures who knows i might be invoking the very sidhe that injured you i couldnt risk it he slipped his jacket on straightened his tie now tell me what scared you about the scars on my back i opened the apartment door while we go to the van i went out into the hallway before he had time to argue wed used up too much time but not to ward his back would have been too careless for words we clattered down the stairs in our dress shoes what was it merry a dragon a wyrm actually since it didnt have legs you saw a vision in the scars he got to the outside door before me and held it open out of long habit i drew the gun from behind my back clicking the safety off i thought the host was miles away jeremy said one lone sidhe could hide from me i held the gun down at my side so it wouldnt be immediately noticeable i wont be taken back jeremy whatever it takes i stepped into the soft california night before he could say anything a lot of the fey especially the sidhe considered modern weapons cheating there was no written rule against using guns but it was still considered bad form unless you were a member of the queens or the princes elite guard they got to carry guns if they were protecting the royal body from harm well i was a royal body a wee disowned royal body but still royal whether the rest of them liked it or not i had no guard to protect me so id do it myself whatever that took the night was never truly dark herethere were too many electric lights too many people i searched that gentle darkness for a lone figure i searched with eyes and energy casting outward in a straining circle as we hurried to the waiting van there were people in the other houses i could feel them moving vibrating a line of seagulls moved along one of the roofs halfasleep moving in protest aware of my magic sweeping over them there was a party on the beach i could feel the energy rising higher excitement fear but the normal fear should i do it should i not is it safe there was nothing else unless you count the shivering energy of the sea that was constantly with you near the shore it got to be like white noise something ignored like the crush of so many people but it was always there roane was somewhere in that huge rolling power i hoped he was having a good time i knew i wasnt the sliding door of the van opened and i got a glimpse of uther crouched in the dimness he held his hand out to me and i gave him my left hand his hand engulfed mine pulling me into the vans interior he slid the door closed behind me ringo looked back over the drivers seat at me he barely fit in the drivers seat all that muscle those inhumanly long arms that huge chest squeezed down into a seat made for humans he smiled revealing a mouth of some of the sharpest teeth id ever seen outside of a wolf the face was slightly elongated to accommodate the teeth which made the rest of his more human face seem out of proportion the teeth flashed out of a solid brown of skin once upon a time ringo had been a fully human gang member then a group of visiting sidhe from the seelie court had gotten lost in the wilds of deepest darkest los angeles a group of gang members had found them cultural interaction at its best the sidhe got the worst end of the fight who knows how it happened maybe they were too arrogant to fight a bunch of innercity teenagers maybe the innercity teenagers were just a hell of a lot more vicious than the visiting royals had expected however it happened they were losing but one of the gang members got a bright idea he switched sides on condition that he get his wish the sidhe agreed and ringo shot his fellow gang members to death his wish was to be one of the fey the sidhe had given their word to grant his wish they couldnt go back on their word to make a full human into a part fey you have to pour wild magic pure power into them and it is the humans will or desire that chooses the shape of that magic ringo had been in his early teens when it happened hed probably wanted to appear fierce frightening to be the toughest son of a bitch around so the magic had given him his wish by human standards he was a monster by sidhe standards ditto by fey standards he was just one of the gang i dont know why ringo left the gangs maybe they turned on him maybe he got wise by the time i met him hed been an upstanding citizen for years he was married to his childhood sweetheart and had three kids he specialized in bodyguard work and did a lot of celebrities that just wanted some exotic muscle to follow them around for a while easy work no real danger and he got to rub elbows with the stars not bad for a kid whose mother had been a fifteenyearold junkie father unknown ringo keeps a picture of his mom on his desk shes thirteen brighteyed well groomed pretty with the world in front of her by the next year she was on drugs she died at seventeen overdose there are no pictures of his mother after age thirteen in his office or in his home its as if for ringo everything after that wasnt real wasnt his mother his oldest daughter amira looks eerily like that smiling picture i dont think shed survive if he found her doing drugs ringo says that being on drugs is worse than dead i think he believes it neither of them remarked on the gun as i slipped it back into the waistband of my pants theyd probably been with jeremy when he found the gun and the papers jeremy got in the passengerside seat lets get to the airport was all he said ringo put the car in gear and away we went chapter the back of the van was empty except for carpet and a modified seatbelt harness that jeremy had had installed on one side uthers seat i started to crawl into the middle row of seats but uther touched my arm jeremy has suggested that if you sit with me my aura may serve to overlap yours thus confusing our pursuers each word was carefully enunciated because the tusks may have looked like they came out of the skin over the mouth out of the face but in reality the tusks were modified teeth attached inside the mouth it meant if he were careless he had a tendency to slur his speech hed worked with one of hollywoods leading speech coaches to learn his midwestern college professor voice it did not match a face that was more pig than human with a double set of tusks curling out of it wed had one client faint after he spoke to her for the first time always fun to shock the humans i glanced up at jeremy he nodded i may be the better magician but uthers got that olderthangod energy whirling around him i think itll help them overlook you it was a great idea and a simple one gee jeremy i knew there was a reason you were the boss he grinned at me then turned to ringo its a straight shot up sepulveda to the airport at least we wont hit rush hour ringo said i settled into the back of the van next to uther the van came out on sepulveda a little too fast and uther caught me before i had time to fall his big arms pulled me against him cradling me against a chest nearly as big as my entire body even with my shields firmly in place he was like a large warm vibrating thing id met other fey who had no real magic to speak of just the very barest of glamour but they were so old and had been around so much magic all their lives that it was as if theyd absorbed the power into the very pores of their skin even the sidhe wouldnt find me caught within uthers arms theyd sense him not me probably initially i relaxed against uthers broad chest the warm safety of his arms i dont know what it was about him but he always made me feel safe it wasnt just the sheer physical size it was uther he had a center of calm like a fire that you could huddle around in the dark jeremy turned in his seat as far as the seat belt would allow wrinkling his suit which meant what he had to say was serious why did you ward my back merry what uther said jeremy waved the question away i had an old sidhe injury on my back merry put a ward on it i want to know why you are persistent i said tell me i sighed cuddling uthers arms around me like a blanket its possible that the sidhe that injured you could call the dragon out of your back or force you to shapeshift into one jeremys eyes widened you can do that i cant but im not a fullblooded sidhe ive seen similar things done will the warding hold id have liked to have simply said yes but it was too close to a lie it will hold for a while but if the sidhe that did the spell is here he may be powerful enough to breech my magic or he could simply keep hitting the ward with his own power until he wears the magic away the chances of the same sidhe being on this hunt are very slim jeremy but i couldnt let you help me and not ward it just in case he said i nodded just in case i was very young when this was done merry i can protect myself now youre a powerful magician but youre not sidhe it makes that big a difference he asked it can jeremy fell silent and turned in his seat to help ringo find the quickest way to the airport uther said you are tense i smiled up at him and youre surprised he smiled that very human mouth under the curved bone of the tusks the piggish snout it was like part of his face was a mask and underneath was just a man a big one but just a man he ran thick fingers through my stillwet hair i take it branwyns tears were still active when jeremy went up id have never taken time for a shower otherwise and uther knew that so jeremy told me i sat up so that i wasnt soaking his shirt with my hair didnt mean to get you wet just forgot sorry he pressed my head gently back to his chest with a hand as big as my head i was not complaining just remarking i settled back against him my cheek resting on his upper arm roane left just after we arrived did he go for help i explained about roane and his newfound skin you didnt know you could heal him uther asked no interesting he said very interesting i looked up at him do you know something i dont about what happened he gazed down at me small eyes almost lost in his face i know that roane is a fool that made me stare at him searching his face trying to read what lay behind those eyes hes a roane and ive given him back the ocean its his calling his heart of hearts youre not angry with him i frowned shrugging awkwardly in his arms roane is what he is i cant blame him for that it would be like yelling at the rain for being wet it just is so it does not bother you at all i shrugged again and his arms settled around me cradling me almost like a baby so i could gaze up at him more comfortably ill admit to being disappointed but not surprised very understanding i might as well be understanding utheri cant change things i rubbed my cheek against the warmth of his arm and realized what part of uthers charm was he was so large and i was so small it was like being a child again that feeling that if someone could hold you in their arms completely nothing could hurt you it hadnt been true when i believed it as a very little girl and it certainly wasnt true now but it was still nice sometimes false comfort is better than no comfort at all damn jeremy said raising his voice for our benefit theres a wreck up aheadlooks like sepulveda is completely blocked off well try to take side streets around it i rolled my head back against uthers arm to see jeremy let me guess everyone else is trying to exit here too of course he said settle in its going to take a while i moved my head so i was looking up at uther again heard any good jokes lately he gave a small smile no but my legs are going to fall asleep if i must keep them tucked under like this for long sorry i started to move away so he could adjust no need to move he put one arm under my thighs kept the other arm behind my back and picked me up he held me like a baby effortlessly while he straightened his legs out in front of him he settled me onto his lap one arm behind my back the other lying loosely across my legs and his i laughed sometimes i wonder what it would be like to be big and i wonder what it would be like to be small but you were a child once you remember what that was like he gazed into the distance childhood was a very long time ago for me but yes i do remember but that is not the kind of small that i mean he looked down at me and there was something in his eyes something lonely needy something that pierced that calmness in him that i valued so much whats wrong uther my voice was soft there was something very private about us being back there alone with no one in the middle seats his hand rested lightly on my thigh and i was finally able to read the look in his eyes it wasnt a look id ever seen in uthers face i remembered his comment when i was getting fitted for the wire how hed wait in the other room because it had been so long since hed seen a naked woman the surprise must have shone on my face because he turned his face away from me im sorry merry if this is completely unwelcome tell me so and i will never mention it again i didnt know what to say but i tried its not that uther im about to get on a plane and go goddess knows where we may never see each other again which was partially true i mean i was leaving town i couldnt think of any way to finish this in this short drive without hurting his feelings or lying to him i wanted to avoid both he spoke without looking at me i thought you were human with some fey blood in you i would never have suggested this to someone who was raised human but your reaction to roanes desertion is proof that you dont think like a human he turned almost shyly back to me the look in his eyes was so open so trusting it wasnt that he thought id say yes he didnt know but he was trusting me not to react badly it had just been yesterday that id first thought of how very alone uther must be out here on the coast how many times had i cuddled against him like this thinking of him as some kind of big brother a father substitute too many it had been unfair and hed always been the perfect gentleman because he thought i was human now he knew the truth and it had changed things even if i said no and he took it well id never be able to treat him this casually again id never be able to cuddle in his big arms in innocence that was gone i mourned that but there was no recovering it all i could do now was try and keep uther from getting hurt the trouble was i didnt know how to do that because i didnt have a clue what to say my thinking had taken too long he closed his eyes and moved his hand off my thigh im sorry merry i reached up and touched his chin no uther im flattered he opened his eyes looked at me but the hurt was there plain to see hed put his heart on his sleeve and id put a knife through it dammit i was about to get on a plane and never see these people again i didnt want to leave him like this he was too good a friend for that i am part human uther i cant there was no delicate way to put it i cant take the damage that a fullblooded fey could take damage so much for being coy youre too large for my body uther if you were smaller i could have sex with you for an afternoon but i dont see us dating youre my friend he looked at me gaze searching my face you could truly sleep with me and not be repulsed repulsed uther you have been too long among the humans you are a jackinirons and you look exactly as you are supposed to look there are others of your kind you are not a freak he shook his head i am exiled merry i can never go back to faerie and here among the humans i am a freak it made my chest tight to hear him say that uther dont let other peoples eyes make you hate yourself how can it not he asked i laid a hand over his chest feeling the sure thick beat of his heart inside is uther my friend and i love you as a friend ive been among humans long enough to know what the friend speech means he said again he turned away from me his body growing stiff and uncomfortable as if he couldnt bear for me to touch him i got to my knees i would have said i straddled his legs but the best i could do was to put a knee on each thigh i touched his face with my hands exploring the slope of his forehead the thick eyebrows i had to lower my arms and come from underneath to trace his cheeks i ran my thumb along his mouth rubbing my hands along the smooth bone of the tusks you are a handsome jackinirons the double tusk is highly prized and that curve in the endthe jacks consider it a sign of virility how do you know that his voice was soft a whisper when i was a teenager the queen took a jack named yannick as her lover she said after shed been with him that no sidhe could fill her as her jack of hearts could in the end shed called him her jack of fools and hed fallen out of favor hed gotten away with his life which was more than most of the queens nonsidhe lovers managed the humans usually ended up committing suicide uther stared at me with me kneeling on his legs we were almost eye to eye what did you think of yannick he asked voice low and lower so that i had to lean in to hear him i thought he was a fool i leaned in to kiss him and he turned away i put a hand on either side of his face and brought him back to face me but i thought that all the queens lovers were fools i had to sit on uthers lap a leg to either side of his waist to get an angle to kiss him the tusks got in the way for kissing but if it would take that hurt from his eyes it would be worth the effort i kissed him as my friend i kissed him because i didnt find him ugly id grown up around fey that made uther look like a gq cover boy by human standards one thing the unseelie teaches is the love of every form of fey there is beauty in all of us ugly is simply not a word you use at the unseelie court at the seelie court i was considered ugly not tall enough not slender enough and my hair was the blood auburn of the unseelie court not the more human red of the seelie court among the unseelie i hadnt had many boyfriends either not because they didnt find me attractive but because i was mortal a sidhe that was mortal frightened them i think they treated it like a contagious disease only griffin had been willing to try and in the end i hadnt been sidhe enough for him either i knew what it was to be forever the outsider the freak i put all that into the kiss closing my eyes cupping his chin in my hands i kissed him hard enough to feel how the bones of his upper jaw widened before they curled upward uther kissed like he spoke carefully each movement like each syllable well thought out his hands kneaded my lower back and i could feel the amazing strength in them the potential in his body to break me like some fragile doll only trust would take you to his bed and let you expect to come out the other side unharmed but i did trust uther and i wanted him to believe in himself again i hate to interrupt jeremy said but theres another wreck up ahead theres a wreck at every side street weve tried i drew back from the kiss what did you say were two wrecks for two side roads jeremy said coincidence does not stretch so large uther said he kissed me gently on the cheek and let me slide out of the embrace to sit beside him still staying in the shadow of his energy the hurt look in his eyes had vanished leaving something more solid more sure of itself behind it had been worth a kiss they know i was at roanes apartment but they dont know where i am now theyre trying to cut off all the escape routes jeremy nodded why havent you sensed them shes been too busy ringo said no i said but as uthers aura keeps them from spotting me so his aura interferes with me sensing them if you move away from him youll be able to sense them jeremy said and they me i said what do you want me to do ringo asked we seem to be stuck in traffic i dont think theres anything you can do i said theyve blocked all the roads jeremy said theyll start searching among the cars now eventually they will find us we need a plan if uther will move up with me ill look and see if my eyes can sense something that the rest of me cant my pleasure uther said and smiled we were both smiling as i crawled into the second row of seats uther hovered over the back of the seats one big hand on my shoulder there were cars parked on one side of the street and two lanes of traffic trailing from the streetlight the reason we werent moving was a threecar pileup at the light one car was upside down on the pavement the second car had smashed into it and a third into both so the three cars formed a pile of twisted metal and broken glass i could visualize how the second and third car smashed into the first what i couldnt figure out was how that first car had gotten on its side upside down in the middle of the road no scenario that i could come up with would have flipped the car dead center into the middle of the road flipped it so that it formed as large a barrier across the street as possible i was betting that someone or some things had turned the car over and let the other cars hit it theyd formed a dam of machines and bleeding people as long as they could use glamour to hide themselves and not be blamed they wouldnt give a damn about injured bystanders my familyhow i hate them sometimes there were people gathering on the sidewalks people getting out of their cars standing in the open doors there were two police cars parked in the middle of the intersection stopping the traffic that was still trying to drive on the cross street the lights on the police cars cut the night in splashes of colored light competing with the signs and lighted windows of the businesses and clubs that were on either side of the street i could hear the wail of an ambulance coming closer probably what the police were clearing the traffic for i searched the crowd with my eyes and there was nothing unusual to see i cast out with that other sense id be limited with uthers energy leaking all over me but not completely helpless i might be able to spot how close they were before i revealed myself the air wavered two cars ahead of us like a ripple of heat except it wasnt heat and you never got that effect after dark something large was moving between the cars something that didnt want to be seen i cast out farther and found three more ripples four shapes moving out there all bigger than a human closest one is only two cars up from us can you see shapes jeremy asked no just ripples to be able to hold glamour in place when youre tipping over cars is more than most fey can manage jeremy said apparently none of us believed the first car had gotten on its roof by itself even most of the sidhe couldnt do it but some of them can so four larger than human and at least one sidhe close by uther said yes whats the plan ringo asked a good question that unfortunately i didnt have a good answer weve got four policemen at the intersection are they going to be a help or a hindrance if we could break their glamour make them visible to the police and they didnt know it right away jeremy said if they did something harmful in full sight of the police i said merry my girl i think youve grasped my plan ringo looked back at me i dont know much about sidhe magic but if merry isnt a fullblooded one is she powerful enough to break their glamour they all looked at me well jeremy said we dont have to break the spell all we have to do is overload it i said were listening jeremy said the first car was turned over but the rest just crashed theyre peering in the cars looking for me but not touching anyone if we get out and fight them the sidhe wont be able to keep them unseen i thought we wanted to avoid a direct fight if possible ringo said the ripple was almost here if anyones got a better idea youve got about sixty seconds to share it were about to be searched hide uther said what merry hides he said it was a good idea i slipped behind the secondary seats and uther moved away from the wall just enough for me to worm behind him i didnt think it would work but it was better than nothing we could fight later if they found me but if i could hide i pressed myself against the cool metal wall and uthers warm back and tried not to think too hard some sidhe can hear you thinking if youre agitated enough i was completely hidden from sight even if they opened the big sliding door which i didnt think they would risk they wouldnt see me but it wasnt really their eyes i was worried about there are all types of fey and not all of them have a humans reliance on their vision that wasnt even counting the sidhe who was doing the glamour if we were the only car with fey occupants the sidhe would come to investigate before they left this area he or she would have to see for themselves i wanted badly to watch that wavering in the air peer in all the windows but that would have defeated the purpose of hiding so i crouched behind uther and tried to be very still i heard felt something brush against the metal wall at my back something large was pressed against the metal then i heard it a loud sniffing like of some gigantic hound i had a heartbeat to think it smells me then something smashed through the metal inches from me i screamed scrambling out from behind uther before my mind had fully registered the fist large as my head stuck through the side of the van a sound of shattering glass whirled me around an arm big as a tree trunk and a chest wider than the car window was pressed through the driversside window ringo beat at the arm but it grabbed the front of his shirt and started pulling him through the broken window the gun was in my hand but there wasnt a clear shot jeremy moved across the seats and i saw the flash of a blade in his hand metal screamed as giant fists pulled the side of the van apart until a huge leering face peered into the hole he looked past uther like he wasnt there yellow eyes on me princess the ogre hissed weve been looking for you uther smashed his fist into the huge face blood sprayed from the ogres nose and the face fell back from the hole there were screams from outside human screams the glamour had collapsed under the violence the ogres had simply appeared to the humans like magic i heard a mans voice yelling police stop where you are the police were coming yeah i put the gun back in my waistband i didnt want to explain it i turned back to the front seat ringo was still in the drivers seat jeremy was leaning over him and there was blood on his hands i moved through the middle seats to them i started to ask if ringo was hurt but the moment i saw his chest i didnt have to ask the front of his shirt was soaked with blood a piece of glass as wide as my hand stuck out of his chest ringo i said his name softly sorry he said im not going to be much help to you he coughed and i could see it hurt i touched his face dont talk i could hear the police talking to the ogres telling them things like hands on top of your heads on your knees dont fucking move then i heard another mans voice a smooth masculine voice with just a touch of accent i knew the voice i scrambled to the big sliding door while jeremy was still saying what what is it sholto i said his face remained puzzled the name meant nothing to him i tried again sholto lord of that which passes between lord of shadows king of the sluagh it was the last title that widened his eyes and drove fear sharp in his face oh my god he said uther said shadowspawn is here i glanced at him never say that to his face i could hear the voices through the broken window so very clearly i felt like i was moving in slow motion the door didnt want to open or id grown clumsy with fear that voice was saying thank you so much officers well wait for transport for the ogres the policeman said the door slid open and i had a frozen moment to see everything three of the ogres were on their knees on the sidewalk hands clasped on their heads two policemen had their guns out one officer was on the sidewalk in front of the ogres the other one separated from them by the line of parked cars a tall figure though only human tall stood by the cars and that policeman the figure was dressed in a grey leather trench coat with his white hair trailing down the back of it the last time id seen sholto hed been wearing a grey cloak but the effect was surprisingly similar as he turned as if he felt me standing there even from yards away in the electrickissed darkness i could see that his eyes were three different shades of gold metallic gold around the pupil then amber and last a circle the color of yellow autumn leaves i was afraid of sholto always had been but when i saw those eyes i realized how homesick i was for the sidhe because for a second i was glad to see another person with a triple iris then the look in those familiar eyes sent a chill across my neck and the moment of connectedness was gone he turned smiling back to the police i will attend the princess he started walking toward the van and they didnt stop him i realized why as he moved closer he had the queens emblem a badge that her guard carried hanging from his neck it looks surprisingly like a police badge and it had been well publicized that to use one of the emblems if you didnt deserve it came with a curse a curse that not even a sidhe would risk i didnt know what hed told them but i could guess hed been sent to stop the attack on me hed see me safely home all so very reasonable sholto moved toward me in a longlegged graceful stride he was handsome not the heartbreaking beauty of some of the sidhe but striking i knew that the humans watched him as he walked because they could not help themselves the grey coat blew back and there was the faintest bulk around his middle sholto had the hair the eyes the skin the face the shoulders everythingexcept that from just below his nipples to vanish into his pants was a nest of tentacles things with mouths his mother had been sidhe his father had not something touched my shoulder and i jerked screaming it was jeremy close the door uther uther slid the door shut almost in sholtos face he leaned against it so that it couldnt be opened from the outside without some effort run uther said run jeremy said i understood outside of a war the sluagh hunted one prey at a time and i was it sholto wouldnt hurt them if i werent here i slipped out the jagged metal hole that the ogres had made on the other side managing to worm through without cutting myself i could hear sholto knocking oh so politely on the vans big door princess meredith ive come to take you home i dropped low to the ground and used the parked cars to hide me as i made it to the sidewalk and the crowd that had gathered to watch the show i threw another coating of glamour over me hair a nondescript brown skin darker tanned i moved through the crowd changing my appearance a little at a time so that no one would point and draw attention to me by the time i made it out the other side and started down the side street the only thing that still looked the same was the clothes i slipped the suit jacket off took the gun in my hand and rolled the jacket around my hand and arm sholto had seen an auburnhaired woman with pale skin in a navy jacket now i was a brownhaired woman with a tan and a green shirt i walked calmly down the street though there was a place between my shoulder blades that itched as if he were staring a hole through me i wanted to turn around and glance back but i forced myself to keep walking i made it to the corner without anyone yelling there she is when i got to the corner i stopped for a second dear goddess i wanted to look back over my shoulder i fought the urge and stepped around the corner of the building when i was safely out of sight i let out a breath i hadnt known i was holding i wasnt out of danger not with sholto on this coast but it was a start a noise came from overhead a high thin sound almost too high to hear but it pierced through the normal sounds of the city like an arrow through the heart i scanned the night sky but it was empty except for the distant trail of an airplane glowing against the darkness the sound came again almost painfully high like the sounds of bats there was nothing there i started walking backward slowly still scanning the sky when a movement caught my eye i followed that flicker to the top of the nearest building a line of black shapes huddled on the buildings edge they were like a line of inkblack hoods the size of small men one of the hoods shook itself like a bird settling its feathers the blackness raised its head to flash a pale flat face a slit of a mouth opened and that highpitched cry sounded they could fly faster than i could run i knew that but i turned and ran anyway i heard their wings unfurl with a sharp sound like thick clean sheets snapping in the wind i ran their highpitched calls chased me into the night i ran faster chapter they came like a wind at my back their sound melding into a rush of wind like a chasing storm thats what humans would hear wind storm or a flight of birds if thered been humans to hear anything the street stretched deserted to the end of the block eight oclock on a saturday night in a prime shopping district and there was no one it almost seemed arranged and maybe it was if i could run out of the spell area there would be people the wind buffeted against my back and i threw myself onto the sidewalk rolling with the impact i kept rolling over and over getting dizzying glimpses of the nightflyers spilling over me less than a yard off the sidewalk like a run of airborne fish moving too fast after their leader to change direction i rolled into the nearest doorway surrounded by a roof and glass on three sides the flyers only took from above they wouldnt come down on the ground for me i lay there for a few heartbeats listening to the thud of my own blood in my ears when i realized i wasnt alone i sat up my back against the window display of books trying to think of any excuse good enough to explain to a human what id just done the man had his back to me he was short about my height wearing a loud hawaiian shirt and one of those softrimmed caps that come down over the eyes not something you see at night much i pushed to my feet using the glass of the window why was he wearing a hat to keep the sun out of his eyes at night some wind he said i eased around the window keeping the shop awning over me i still had the gun in my hand the jacket was loose flapping like a matadors cape but it still shielded the gun the man turned and the light from the shop fell upon his face the skin was black eyes like dark shiny jewels he grinned flashing a mouthful of razorsharp teeth our master wants to speak with you princess i felt movement behind me and turned my head to see but i was afraid to turn completely around and give my back to the grinning figure three figures emerged from the next shop it was dark no lights to hide from the figures were taller than me cloaked and hooded weve been waiting for you corr one of the cloaked figures said it was a female voice corr i made it a question slut a second female voice jealous i said they rushed me and i spilled the jacket to the ground pointing the gun twohanded at them either they didnt know what a gun was or they didnt care i shot one of them the figure collapsed in a pile of cloth the two others huddled back clawed hands extended as if to ward off a blow i pressed my back to the window spared a glance for the grinning man behind me but he was standing in the doorway with his small hands clasped on top of his hat as if hed done it before i kept the gun and most of my attention on the women though that was a loose term for them they were hags i wasnt being mean it was what they were night hags the one id shot struggled to sit cradled in the second ones arms you shot her so happy you noticed i said the wounded ones hood had fallen back to reveal a huge beaked nose small glittering eyes skin the color of yellowed snow her hair was a dry ragged mass like black straw coming barely to her shoulders she hissed as the second hag spread the cloak enough to see the wound there was a bloody hole between her sagging breasts she was nude except for a heavy golden torc around her neck and a jeweled belt that rode low on her thin hips i caught a glimpse of the dagger that hung from the belt and was tied to her thigh with a golden chain she writhed unable to get enough air to curse me id hit her heart and maybe a lung it wouldnt kill her but it hurt the second hag raised her face into the light her skin was a dirty grey with huge pockmarks covering her face tracing along the sharp nose like craters her lips were almost too thin to cover the mouth full of sharp carnivorous teeth i wonder if hed still want you if you didnt have all that smooth white flesh the last hag was still standing hooded hidden her voice was better than theirs more cultured somehow we could make you one of us our sister i sighted at the grey ones face the second someone starts a curse ill shoot her through the face it wont kill me grey said no but it wont help your looks either she hissed at me like some great crooked cat bitch ditto i said it was the one still standing that i was worried about she hadnt panicked or let anger get the better of her shed suggested using magic against me when she was still partially hidden by shadows and night smarter more cautious more dangerous i had purposefully not used glamour to hide i was standing in front of a lighted bookstore window with a gun in plain sight obviously pointed at someone the gunshot alone should have sent someone to the door or to call the police i gave a quick flare of power searching and found the thick folds of the glamour heavy and well made i was good at glamour but not this kind sholto had covered the entire street with it like an invisible wall the humans in the shops would just want to stay inside no one would see or hear anything to alarm them their minds would explain the gunshot as some ordinary noise if i screamed for help it would be the wind short of throwing someone through the window in back of me into the shop itself no one would see anything id have been willing to throw any and all of them through the glass but i didnt trust them up close the hands that clasped at the wound had black claws like the talons of some great bird the teeth that bared when she hissed were made for tearing flesh i would never win a oneonone battle i needed them at bay and the gun kept them there but sholto would come and i needed to be gone before that happened once he arrived id lose come to think of it i wasnt doing too well now they couldnt hurt me but i was trapped if i moved out from under the awning the nightflyers would get me or at least mob me then the hags and the grinning man could take me id be disarmed or worse before sholto showed up i had no offensive magic the gun wouldnt kill any of them only hurt and slow them i needed a better idea and i couldnt think of anything i tried talking when in doubt talk you never know what the enemy might let slip nerys the grey segna the gold and black agnes i presume who are you stanley nerys said i had to smile and they say you have no sense of humor whore they she asked the sidhe i said you are sidhe black agnes said if i were truly sidhe would i be here on the shores of the western sea hiding from my queen the fact that you and your aunt are enemies makes you suicidally foolish but it doesnt make you one ounce less sidhe agnes stood so straight and tall like a black pillar of cloth no but the brownie blood on my mothers side does i think the queen would forgive the human taint but she cant forget the other youre mortal segna said thats the unforgivable sin for a sidhe my hands were starting to cramp my arms would start to tremble soon i had to either shoot something or lower the gun even a twohanded stance isnt meant to be held indefinitely there are other sins my aunt finds just as unforgivable i said a mans voice said like having a nest of tentacles in the middle of all that perfect sidhe flesh i turned the gun toward the voice keeping my vision on the three hags i was soon going to have so many targets in so many different directions that id never be able to shoot them all in time at least the movement and the fresh rush of adrenaline had helped chase away the muscle fatigue i was suddenly sure i could hold the shooting stance forever sholto was standing on the sidewalk hands at his side i think he was trying to appear harmless he failed the queen said that to me once that it was a shame that i had a nest of tentacles in the middle of one of the most perfect sidhe bodies shed ever seen great my aunts a bitch we all knew that what do you want sholto give him his title agnes said that cultured voice holding an edge of anger it never hurts to be polite so i did what she asked what do you want sholto lord of that which passes between he is king sholto segna spat the words at me almost literally hes not my king i said that could change agnes said the implied threat nicely subtle enough sholto said the queen wants you dead meredith weve never been friends lord sholto use my title it was an insult for him to have omitted my title after id used his it was also an insult to insist on it from someone who was king of another people but sholto had always complicated his life by trying to play lord of the sidhe and king of the sluagh a look passed over the strong bones of his faceanger i think though i didnt know him well enough to be sure the queen wants you dead princess meredith daughter of essus and she sent you to fetch me home for the execution i figured that much out you couldnt be more wrong agnes said silence sholto put the bite of command in that one word the hags seemed to shrink in upon themselves not bowing but like they thought about it the grinning man to my right stepped closer i didnt take the gun off sholto but i said take two big steps back or i shoot your king i dont know what the man would have done because sholto said gethin do what she asks gethin didnt argue just stepped back though i noticed out of the corner of my eyes that his hands were folded across his chest he wasnt doing the hands on top of your head routine anymore fine as long as he stayed out of immediate reach they were all too close if everyone rushed me at once it was over but sholto didnt want me crowded he wanted to talk fine with me i dont want you dead princess meredith sholto said i couldnt keep the suspicion off my face youd go up against the queen and all her sidhe to save me much has happened in the last three years princess the queen relies more and more on the sluagh for her threat i do not think she would start a war over you being alive if you were safely out of her sight im as out of her sight as i can get and still be on dry land i said ah but perhaps there are others at court that whisper in her ear and remind her of you who i asked he smiled and it made that handsome face almost pleasant we have many things to discuss princess i have a room in one of the better hotels shall we retire to it and discuss the future something about the way he worded that bothered me but it was the best offer i was going to get tonight i lowered the gun swear by your honor and the darkness that eats all things that you mean all of what you just said i swear on my honor and by the darkness that eats all things that every word i have spoken on this street to you is the truth i clicked the safety on the gun and tucked it at the small of my back i picked my jacket up off the ground shook it out and slipped it on it was a little wrinkled but it would do how far is your hotel the smile this time was wider it made him less perfect but more human more real you should smile more often lord sholto it becomes you i hope to have reason to smile more often in the near future he offered me his arm even though he was yards away i went to him because hed sworn the unseelies most solemn oath he could not break it without risking a curse i slipped my hand in the crook of his arm he flexed under my hand sometimes a male is a male is a male no matter what flavor they are which hotel are you staying at i smiled at him it never hurts to be pleasant i could always be unpleasant later if i needed to be he told me it was a very nice hotel thats a little far to walk i said if you like we can get a taxi i raised eyebrows at that because once inside the metal of a car he wouldnt be able to do major magic too much refined metal interfered with it i could do major spells inside solid lead if i had to my human blood was good for a few things wont you be uncomfortable i asked its not that far and its our mutual comfort ive come to see to again i felt there were shades of meaning in his words that i was missing a taxi would be lovely agnes called after us what are we to do with nerys sholto looked back at them and his face was cold again that carved handsomeness that made him seem distant make your way back to your rooms any way you can if nerys had not tried to attack the princess she wouldnt have been wounded we have served you for more centuries than that piece of white flesh will ever see and this is the treatment you give us agnes said you get the treatment that you earn agnes remember that he turned patting my hand on his arm smiling at me but his triplegolden eyes still held the edge of that coldness gethin appeared at sholtos side floppy hat in his hands a bow curving him toward the sidewalk he had impossibly long ears like those of a donkey what would you have of me master help them get nerys to the rooms happily gethin flashed another toothy grin as he stood ears flapping down to frame his face almost like a dogs or maybe a lopeared rabbits he turned and almost skipped back toward the hags i feel like im missing something i said his hand wrapped over my hand warm strong fingers sliding over mine i will explain all when we get to the hotel there was a look in his eyes that id seen in other mens but it couldnt mean the same thing sholto was one of the queens guard which meant he couldnt sleep with any sidhe except her she didnt share her men not with anyone the punishment for breaking the taboo was death by torture even if sholto was willing to risk that i was not my aunt might execute me but shed make it quick if i broke her most strict taboo shed still kill me but it would not be quick id been tortured before it was hard to avoid it if you lived at the unseelie court but id never been tortured at the queens own hand i had seen her handiwork though she was creative very very creative id promised myself years ago that i would never give her an excuse to be creative on me im already under a death sentence sholto i wont risk torture on top of it if i could keep you alive and safe what would you risk alive and safe how he just smiled held his hand up and yelled taxi three of them appeared within minutes on the empty street sholto just meant to call a taxi he had no idea how impressive it was in los angeles to be able to call three taxis within minutes to an empty street he could also reanimate corpses that hadnt grown cold yet and that was impressive but id lived for three years in the city and a taxi when you wanted it was more impressive than a walking corpse after all id seen walking corpses before a convenient taxi was a completely new animal chapter an hour later sholto and i were sitting in two lovely but uncomfortable chairs around a small white table the room was elegant if a little too pink and gold for my tastes thered been wine and a tray of hors doeuvres waiting on the table the wine was a very sweet dessert wine it complemented the cheese on the tray but clashed with the caviar of course id never tasted anything that could make caviar palatable no matter how expensive it was it still tasted like fish eggs sholto seemed to like the caviar and the wine champagne would have been more appropriate but ive never liked it he said are we celebrating something i asked an alliance i hope i took a minute sip of the toosweet wine and looked at him what sort of alliance between the two of us that much id assumed the big question sholto is why would you want an alliance with me youre third in line to the throne his face had become very closed very careful as if he didnt want me to know what he was thinking and i said he blinked those triplegolden eyes at me why wouldnt a sidhe want to join himself to the woman who is only two steps away from the throne normally that would be fine reasoning but you and i both know that the only reason im still third in line for the throne is that my father got the queens oath before he died shed have had me disqualified on the grounds of my mortality alone except for that i have no standing at the court sholto i am the first princess of the line who has no magic he sat his wineglass carefully on the table you are one of the best of all of us at personal glamour he said true but its the greatest of my powers for goddess sake i am still called nicessus daughter of essus a title that i should have lost after childhood when i came into my power except i didnt come into my power i may never come into my power sholto that alone could have gotten me removed from the line of succession except for the oath the queen made to your father sholto said yes i am aware how much your aunt loathes you meredith much the same way she loathes me i sat the wineglass down tired of pretending to enjoy it you have magic enough for a court title youre not mortal he looked at me and it was a long hard almost harsh look dont be coy meredith you know exactly why the queen cant stand the sight of me i met that hard glance but it was uncomfortable i did know all the court knew say it meredith say it out loud the queen disapproves of your mixed blood he nodded yes he seemed almost relieved the harshness in his eyes had been uneasy to see but at least it had been genuine for all i knew everything else was false i wanted to see what truly lay behind that handsome face but thats not why sholto theres more mixed blood among the sidhe royals now than pure fine he said she disapproves of my fathers bloodline its not the fact that your father is a nightflyer sholto he frowned if you have a point make it except for the odd pointy ear until you came along sidhe genetics won out no matter what we mated with genetics he said i forget that you are our first modern college graduate i smiled father was hoping id be a doctor you cant heal with your touch what kind of doctor is that he took a big drink of wine as if he were still agitated someday i must take you on a tour of a modern hospital i said whatever you wish to show me would be a pleasure whatever real emotion had almost peeked through vanished in a wave of double entendre i ignored the double meaning and went back to digging id seen real emotion i wanted to see more of it if i was going to risk my life i needed to see sholto without the masks that the court taught us to wear until you all the sidhe looked like sidhe no matter what we mated with i think the queen sees you as proof that the sidhe blood is growing weak just as my mortality shows the blood is thinning that handsome face grew tight with anger the unseelie preach that all fey are beautiful but some of us are only beautiful for a night we are diversions but nothing more i watched the anger eat across his shoulders down his arms his muscles tightened as the anger flowed over him my mother and he spat that last word out thought she would have a night of pleasure and pay no price i was that price he bit off the words rage intensifying the light in his eyes so that the rings of color in them blazed like yellow flame and molten running gold id broken through that so careful exterior and found a nerve i would say that youre the one that paid the price not your mother i said once she gave birth to you she went back to the court to her life he looked at me the rage still naked on his face i talked carefully to that anger because i didnt want it to spill over on me but i liked the anger it was real not some mood calculated to get him something he hadnt planned this mood it had just come over him i liked that i liked that a lot one of the things id loved about roane had been that his emotions were so close to the surface he never pretended anything he did not feel of course that was the same trait that had allowed him to go off to the sea with his new sealskin and never bother to say goodbye no one was perfect and she left me with my father sholto said he looked down at the table then slowly raised those extraordinary eyes to me do you know how old i was before i saw another sidhe i shook my head i was five five years old before i saw anyone with skin and eyes like mine he stopped talking eyes distant with remembering tell me i said softly his voice came soft as if he were talking to himself agnes had taken me into the woods to play on a dark moonless night i wanted to ask if agnes was the hag black agnes that id met tonight but i let him talk thered be time for questions when his mood had changed and he stopped telling his secrets it had been surprisingly easy to get him to open up to me usually when its this easy to peel away someones protections they want to talk need to talk i saw something shining through the trees as if the moon had come down to earth i asked agnes what is that she wouldnt tell me just took my hand and led me closer to the light at first i thought they were human except humans didnt glow like they had fire beneath their skins then the woman turned her face toward us and her eyes his voice trailed off and there was such a mixture of wonder and pain in him that i almost let it go but i didnt i wanted to know if he wanted to tell me her eyes i prompted her eyes glowed burned blue darker blue then green i was five so it wasnt her nakedness or his body on top of hers but the wonderment of that white skin and those swirling eyes like my eyes like my skin he stared past me as if i werent there agnes dragged me away before they saw us i was full of questions she told me to ask my father he blinked and took a deep breath as if he were literally coming back from someplace else my father explained about the sidhe and that i was one of them my father raised me to believe i was sidhe i could not be what he was sholto gave a harsh laugh i cried the first time i realized i would never have wings he looked at me frowning ive never told anyone at court that story is this some kind of magic that you have over me he didnt actually believe it was a spell or hed be more upset maybe even frightened who else at the court but me would understand what the story meant i asked he looked at me for a long moment then slowly nodded yes though your body is not marred as mine you too do not belong they wont let you belong that last was said for both of us i think his hands lay on the table so tightly clasped that they were mottled i touched his hands and he jerked away as if id hurt him hed slid his hands out of reach but stopped in midmotion i watched the effort it took for him to put his hands back within my reach he acted like someone who expected to be hurt i covered his large hands with one of mine or covered as much as i could he smiled and it was the first real smile id seen because this one was uncertain not sure of its welcome i dont know what he saw on my face but whatever it was it reassured him because he opened his hands and took my hand in his raising it slowly to his lips he didnt so much kiss my hand as press his mouth to it it was a surprisingly tender gesture loneliness can be a bond stronger than most who else at either court understood our hearts better than each other not love or friendship but a bond nonetheless his gaze rose to meet mine as he raised his face from my hand the look in his eyes was one i rarely saw among the sidhe open raw there was a need in his eyes so large it was like staring into an endless void a deep yawning pit of some missing thing it made his eyes wild like some creatures or a feral childs something untamed but badly wounded did my eyes ever look like that i hoped not he let go of my hand slowly reluctantly i have never been with another sidhe meredith do you understand what that means i understood probably better than he did because the only thing worse than never was to have had it and be denied it but i kept my voice neutral because i was beginning to fear where we were heading and no matter how much sympathy i had with him it wasnt worth being tortured to death you wonder what it would be like he shook his head no i crave the sight of pale flesh stretched underneath me i want my shine matched by another i want that meredith and you can give it to me he was heading where id feared i told you sholto i wont risk death by torture for any pleasure no one nothing is worth that i meant it the queen joys in making her guards watch her with her lovers some refuse to watch but most of us stay on the off chance that she may beckon us to join you are my bodyguardsdont you want to guard my body he did a fair imitation of her voice even when it is meant for cruelty the love of two sidhe is still a wondrous thing i would give my soul for it i gave him my best blank face i dont have any use for your soul sholto what else can you offer me that would be worth risking death by torture if you are my sidhe lover meredith then the queen will know what you mean to me i will make sure she understands that if anything happens to you that she will lose the sluaghs loyalty she cant afford that right now why not make this deal with other more powerful sidhe women the women of prince cels guard have him to have sex with and unlike the queen cel keeps them busy when i left some of the women were beginning to refuse cels bed sholto smiled happily the movement has become quite popular i raised eyebrows are you saying that cels little harem is turning him down more and more of them sholto still looked pleased then why not make this invitation to one of them theyre all more powerful than i am perhaps its what you said earlier meredith none of them would understand me as you do i think you underestimate them but what could cel possibly be doing to them thats making them leave him in droves the queen herself is a sexual sadist but her guardsmen would crawl over broken glass to bed her what is cel offering that is worse than that i didnt expect an answer but i couldnt even begin to think of anything that bad the smile faded from sholtos face the queen did that once he said what i asked frowning made one of us strip and crawl over broken glass if he made it without showing pain then shed fuck him i blinked id heard worse hell id seen worse but part of me wanted to know who it was so i asked who was it he shook his head we of the guard have sworn to keep the humiliations among ourselves our pride if not our bodies survives the better for it his eyes looked lost again again i wondered what cel could be doing that was worse than the queens games why not make this offer to a more powerful sidhe woman who isnt a member of the princes guard i asked he gave a faint smile there are women at court who are not members of the princes guard meredith they would not touch me before i joined the guard they fear bringing more perverse creatures into the world he laughed and it had a wild sound to it almost like crying it hurt to hear it thats what the queen calls me her perverse creaturesometimes simply creature in a few centuries i will be like frost and her darkness i will be her creature he gave that painful laugh again i will risk much to keep that from happening does she really need the sluaghs backing that much so much that shed give up my death give up punishing us for going against her strictest taboo i shook my head no sholto she cant let this stand if we find a way around her celibacy taboo then others will try it will be like the first crack in a dam eventually it breaks she is losing control meredith losing her hold on the court these three years have not been good ones for her the court is splitting under the weight of her erratic behavior and prince cels growing he seemed at a loss for words then finally said when he comes into power cel is going to make andais look sane it will be like caligula after tiberius are you saying if we think its bad now we aint seen nothing yet i tried to make him smile and failed he turned haunted eyes to me the queen cannot afford to lose the support of the sluagh trust me on this meredith i have no desire to end up at the queens mercy any more than you do the queens mercy had become a saying among us if you feared something you said id rather be at the queens mercy than do that it meant that nothing scared you more what do you want of me sholto i want you he said his gaze very direct i had to smile you dont want me you want a sidhe in your bed remember that griffin rejected me because i was not sidhe enough for him griffin was a fool i smiled and it made me think of uthers words earlier that night that roane was a fool if everyone was a fool for leaving me why did they keep doing it i looked at him and tried to be just as direct ive never been with a nightflyer it is considered perverted by those that consider nothing perverse sholto said and his voice was bitter i would not expect you to have experience with us us an interesting pronoun if you asked me what i was i was sidhe not human not brownie i was sidhe and if you pushed me i was unseelie for better or worse even though i could claim the blood of both courts but i would never have said us when speaking of anything but unseelie sidhe after my aunt our beloved queen tried to drown me when i was six father made sure i had my own sidhe bodyguards one of them was a crippled nightflyer bhatar sholto nodded he lost a wing in the last real battle we fought on american soil we can grow back most of our body parts so it was a grave wound bhatar stayed in my room at night he never left my side when i was a child father taught me chess but bhatar taught me how to beat father it made me smile he still speaks well of you sholto said i started to ask then shook my head no he would never have suggested that you do this he would never have risked my safety or yours you see he spoke well of you too king sholto the best king the sluagh had had in two hundred years thats what he used to say im flattered you know what your people think of you i tried to read that face the need was there but need could mask so many things what of the hags your little harem what of them he asked but there was a look in his eyes that gave lie to his casual words they wanted to hurt me to keep me from you what do you think theyll do if you actually bed me i am their king they will do as they are told i laughed then but it wasnt bitter just ironic you are a king of a fey people sholto they never do quite what you tell them or quite what you think they will from sidhe to pixie they are free things take for granted their obedience and you do so at your peril like the queen has done for a millennium he made it half question half statement i smiled nodding as the king of the seelie court has done for even longer i am a new king compared to them and not quite so arrogant then tell me truly what will your hag lovers do if you desert them for me he seemed to think about it for a minute long and slow then he looked at me his face was serious i dont know i almost laughed you are new at being king ive never heard one of them admit ignorance before not knowing a thing is not ignorance feigning knowledge you dont have can be he said wise as well as modest how terribly unique for fey royalty i remembered a question id wanted to ask the agnes that took you into the woods as a boy your nanny is she black agnes yes he said i fought not to frown your exnanny is now your lover she has not aged he said and i am all grown up now growing up around immortal beings is confusing i admit but there are still fey that helped raise me that i dont think of in that way as there are among the sluagh for me but agnes is not one of them i wanted to ask why but didnt first it was none of my business second i might not understand the answer even if he gave it to me how do you know the queen intends to execute me for certain back to the important topic because i was sent to los angeles to kill you he said it like it meant nothingno emotion no regret just fact my heart beat a little faster my breath catching in my throat i had to concentrate to ease the air out without making it noticeable if i dont agree to sleep with you then you carry out the sentence i gave my oath that i meant you no harm i meant it you would go against the queen for my sake the same reasoning that keeps us safe if we bed each other keeps me safe if i leave you alive she needs my sluagh more than she needs to be vindictive he seemed so certain of that last part certain of what he was certain of uncertain of everything else like most of us if were honest i looked at that strong face the jaw a little wide for my taste the bones of the cheek at little too sculpted i liked a softer look to my men but he was undeniably handsome his hair was a perfect white thick and straight held back in a loose ponytail the hair fell to his knees like one of the older sidhe even though sholto was only about two hundred years give or take the shoulders were broad the chest looked good under the white buttondown shirt the shirt fell absolutely smooth and i wondered if he were using some sort of glamour to make it so because i knew that what lay under the shirt was not smooth the offer is very unexpected sholto id like some time to think about it if i may until tomorrow night he said i nodded and stood he stood as well i found myself staring at his chest and stomach trying to see that movement id noticed on the street nothing showed he was wasting glamour on keeping it hidden i dont know if i can do this i said what he asked i motioned at him i saw you once without a shirt when i was much younger the sight stayed with me his face paled eyes hardening he was throwing his walls back in place i understand the thought of touching me frightens you i do understand meredith he let out a long breath it was a pretty thought while it lasted he turned away from me gathering his long coat from the back of the chair where hed laid it the heavy tail of hair lay like a white furred stripe down his body sholto i said he didnt turn around just held the length of hair over one shoulder while he put on his coat i didnt say no sholto he turned then his face was still closed careful all the emotions id worked so hard to find buried again then what are you saying im saying no sex tonight but i cant say yes ill have sex with you until i see everything everything he made it a question again now whos being coy i said i watched the idea take shape on his face in his eyes a strange little smile played on his lips are you asking to see me naked not all of you i had to smile at the look on his face but down to your thighs yes please i have to see how i truly feel about your extras he smiled and it was warm with an edge of uncertainty it was his real smile that edge of charm and fear that is the kindest way anyone has ever described them if i cant be with you in joy and shared pleasure then your dream of matching your glow with another falls apart a sidhe does not glow for things that are duty and not pleasure he nodded i understand i hope so because its more than seeing you nude i need to touch and be touched to see if i spread my hands wide if i can do this but no sex tonight his voice was as close to playful as id ever heard it you dream of sidhe flesh and have never had it i have had it and for three nearly four years ive gone without i miss home sholto strange and perverse as it is i miss it if i agree to this then i get a sidhe lover and home not to mention im escaping a death sentence you are not a fate worse than death sholto some have thought so over the years he tried to make it a joke but his eyes gave him away thats why i need to see what im getting myself into do i raise the question of love or is that too naive for a king and a princess he asked i smiled but this time it was sad i tried love once it betrayed me griffin is a worthless thing meredith unworthy of such depth of emotion and certainly incapable of returning it i found that out eventually i said love is grand while it lasts sholto but it doesnt last we looked at each other i wondered if my eyes were as tired and full of regret as his am i supposed to argue with you and tell you some love does last sholto asked are you going to he smiled and shook his head no i held my hand out to him no lies sholto not even the pretty ones his hand was very warm wrapped around mine let me take you to bed and see what im bargaining for he let me lead him toward the bed do i get to see what im bargaining for i pulled him backward toward the bed so i could watch his face if you like a look passed through his eyes that was neither sidhe nor human nor sluagh but simply male i like he said chapter i let go of his hand so i could crawl onto the bed still working backward so i could watch him i took the gun out of my waistband and slid it under one of the pillows then lay back in the middle of the bed propping myself up on my elbows sholto stood beside the bed looking at me he had a strange halfsmile on his face his eyes looked uncertain not unhappy just uncertain you look terribly pleased with yourself he said its never a bad thing to see a handsome man naked for the first time his smile vanished handsome ive never had anyone who knew what lay under the shirt call me that before i let my gaze speak for me i lingered over his face the eyes the strong nearly perfect nose the thin wide mouth the rest of the body looked wonderful but i knew at least part of what i was looking at was magically enhanced i just didnt know how much but i kept my gaze on the parts that i was pretty sure were real like the slender width of his hips the strong length of legs until i saw him without the pants i wasnt sure what the bulge in the pants was so i passed that by in mind as well as by eye the queen was right it was a shame he truly was magnificent ive fantasized about a sidhe woman looking at me like that he still looked too solemn like what i asked i made the question low sexual teasing that made him smile like im something to eat i smiled and made it everything he wanted it to be everything he needed it to be eat eh lose the coat and the shirt and maybe well get to that no sex tonight remember he said how about just no orgasm he threw back his head and laughed a loud joyous sound he looked at me with shining eyes and it wasnt magic that made them glitter just laughter he looked younger more relaxed i realized that with his white hair and skin those gold eyes that hed be welcomed at the seelie court if he could keep his shirt on theyd never suspect the laughter faded round the edges now you look solemn he said i was just thinking that you look more seelie court than i do he frowned you mean the blood auburn hair and my lack of height and the breasts are a little too plentiful for sidhe style he grinned then wide and sudden it has to be the women who are complaining about the breasts no man would dream of it that made me smile youre right my mother my aunt my cousins theyre just jealous he said pretty to think so i said he let the grey overcoat fall to the floor then undid a button of his cuff he watched my face while he did it he undid the other sleeve and moved to the first shirt button the second fanning the cloth to expose a triangle of white gleaming skin a third button and the first swell of chest muscle came into view his fingers went to the fourth button but he didnt undo it i would ask for a kiss now before you see i would have asked why but i thought i knew he was afraid that once i saw all of him he wouldnt get his kiss i crawled across the bed toward him sholto put his hands on the bed and lowered himself to his knees he moved down until his chin was nearly touching the bed his hands flat on the bedspread i stayed on all fours above him he gazed up at me and i lowered my face toward his in a sort of pushup position i gave him his kiss a soft brush of lips and sholto started to pull away i touched his face gently not yet i said sholto was right once i saw all his extras he might not get another kiss if it was the only touch of sidhe hands that he would ever know i wanted it to be memorable a kiss couldnt make up for not having ever felt the touch of sidhe flesh but it was all i could offer in his own way he was as alone as uther sholto laid his chin back on the bed rolling his eyes up at me he waited for me patiently totally passive waiting for me to do whatever i was going to do in that instant i had another question answered if i was going to tie myself to any one person for a lifetime wed have to have more in common than just sidhe blood hed have to share my love of pain i lay flat on the bed so that our faces were even open your mouth just a little i said he did it without question i liked that i kissed his upper lip softly gently i used my tongue to open his mouth wider then used lips and tongue to explore his mouth he was completely passive at first letting me feed softly at his mouth then he began to kiss me back he kissed slowly almost hesitantly as if it were his first time and i knew it wasnt then his mouth pressed against mine harder more demanding i bit his lower lip gently but firmly he made a small noise in his throat and rose to his knees pulling me with him hands on my arms his kiss mashed against my lips the kiss was hard enough it hurt and i had to open my mouth wider letting his lips his tongue his mouth inside mine completely as deeply as he wanted to probe and lick and feed just to keep from being bruised he pushed me back against the bed and i let him but i noticed that he kept his body above mine using his hands to prop himself up so only our mouths touched i drew back from the kiss enough to look down the line of his body i could feel his body above mine like a trembling line of energy it was as if the weight of his body was already pressed against mine as if i could already feel the heaviness of him against me his aura his magic had substance like a second body pressing outward from him the press of power trapped my breath in my throat brought my pulse racing his magic drew the blood in my body like a magnet draws metal even with roane covered in branwyns tears it hadnt been like this it had been wondrous but it hadnt been this and this was what i wanted needed craved sholto stared down at me with a kind of soft wonder on his face what is that i realized he could feel my power as i felt his i could have simply said magic but the last time id been with another sidhe had been griffin and he had explained to me how my power was a lesser glow a paltry thing once id believed him now i didnt i had to ask because i might never be with another sidhe i might never be able to answer the doubts that griffin had put in my mind what does it feel like i asked warm like heat rising off your body pressing against my skin he balanced on one arm using his free hand to caress the air between us like he was stroking something that had shape weight the feel of him stroking his hand along my aura made me close my eyes my body writhing under that nottouch he pushed his hand through the energy and even with closed eyes i knew where his hand was it clings to my hand like its a bowl of something that sucks against my skin as i reach into it sholto said voice breathy filled with the wonder his face had shown i felt his hand thrust through the power as if my body were underwater and his hand brought cool air with it his hand didnt just touch my side it breeched my shields forced his magic inside me it brought my eyes wide open froze my breath in my throat it forced me to lash out with my own power to cover it like holding a hand over a wound his body jerked at the touch of my magic he looked at me with halfparted lips his pulse thudding like a trapped thing against the fragile skin of his throat i had no idea what i was missing i nodded staring up at him flat on the bed his hand like a throbbing weight over my ribs this is only the beginning i said and my voice had fallen to a hoarse whisper i wasnt trying to sound sexy it was all the voice left me with the press of him above me in that moment i couldnt think of any deformity that would keep me from saying yes i reached for his shirt he moved his hand off of me so he could support his weight on both hands and i could reach the buttons of his shirt i undid the next button nothing popped out i undid another button the power wavered like heat rising from pavement let go of the illusion sholto let me see his voice was a whisper im afraid i stared up at him do you really think i want to lose a chance at this i want to end this exile sholto im tired of pretending of settling i want it all back i caressed a hand over the front of his throat and the mix of our power flowed behind my hand like an invisible veil sidhe flesh pleasure to equal mine to walk into the hollow hills and be welcome i want to go home sholto drop your glamour and let me see what you look like he did what i asked the tentacles spilled out of the shirt and analogies like nest of snakes or the spill of intestines when you open someones gut came to mind i froze and this time when my breath caught in my throat it wasnt from passion sholto started to back away immediately standing turning so i couldnt see i had to grab his arm to stop him my reaction had shut down the magic between us or rather his reaction to my reaction had his arm was just an arm under my hand warm and alive but nothing more i gripped his arm tight with both my hands i tried to turn him back toward me but he resisted i rose on my knees keeping one hand on his arm but reached across his body to grab the far side of his shirt nothing touched me as i reached across his body and there should have been a lot of things touching me hed called the glamour back in place i wasnt feeling what was really there i dragged him back around to face me the shirt was open to midstomach the chest and stomach were pale muscular smooth perfect i undid another button and the stomach that showed was cobblestone like an ad for the after shot in a gym commercial sholto let me unbutton the shirt and pull it out enough that he was exposed down to the leather of his belt but he wouldnt look at me i guess if youre going to hide behind glamour it might as well be handsome he did look at me then and he looked angry if this was my true appearance you wouldnt turn from me if this was your real appearance youd have never become king of the host something passed through his eyes something i couldnt read but anything was better than the anger tinged with bitterness i would have been a noble of the sidhe court he said a lord nothing betteryour mothers bloodline isnt good enough for a greater title i am a lord he said i nodded yes on your own power your own merit the queen could not let such a power walk away from our court without a title he smiled but it was bitter and that anger crept back into his eyes are you saying its better to rule in hell than serve in heaven i shook my head never but i am saying that you have everything your mothers blood could have given you and you are a king he stared down at me his face that arrogant mask again the one i saw so often at court my mothers blood could have given me you i havent turned you down i said i saw the look on your face felt the reluctance in your body you dont have to say it out loud for it to be true i started to pull his shirt out of his pants he grabbed my hands dont if you walk away now then its finished drop your illusions sholto let me see i did that he jerked the shirt out of my hands so hard that he almost dragged me off the bed as he moved away itd be nice if i could have embraced you without flinching i am sorry that i couldnt but give a girl a chance the first look is a little overwhelming he shook his head youre right i am king of the sluagh i will not be humiliated i sat on the edge of the bed and looked at him he looked perfect if a little sulky but it wasnt real and id spent the last few years hiding pretending pretense no matter how pretty can grow very old though they rejected him there was no one that epitomized the unseelie court better than sholto did a combination of unbelievable beauty and horror not just side by side but entwined one could not exist without the other in his way sholto was the perfect marriage of all the court stood for and they rejected him because they feared that he was indeed the ultimate unseelie sidhe i doubted they thought of it that clearly not in so many words but that was what frightened them about sholtonot that he was alien but that he wasnt alien i cant give my word that i wont turn away a second time but i can give my word that i will try he looked at me arrogance like a shield in his eyes thats not good enough its the best i have to offer is fear of rejection really worth losing your first touch of sidhe flesh so quickly doubt flickered in his eyes if you cant stomach it something about the phrase amused him but not in a happy way then can i call glamour and i finished when his voice trailed off yes we can he nodded that is the closest i have ever come to begging i laughed lucky you he looked puzzled then and it was almost a relief to see the real sholto peeking through that careful mask i dont understand your magic is powerful enough that you probably dont it was my voice that held bitterness now i shook it off literally shaking my head sending my hair sliding around my face i held my hands out to him come here distrust showed on his face i guess i couldnt blame him but i was getting tired of holding his emotional hand i didnt want to hurt him but i wasnt sure i wanted to tie myself to him forever it wasnt the tentacles it was the heavy emotions that seemed to swing back and forth so quickly he was going to be a highmaintenance partner when it came to his feelings men like that are so damned exhausting that i usually avoid them but sholto could offer me things that the others couldnt he could give me back my homefor that i could shovel emotional shit for a while but truthfully it was almost a bigger mark against him than his extras drop the shirt and come here or dont its your choice you sound impatient he said i shrugged a little i motioned him closer with my hands he slid the shirt off his shoulders to spill to the floor a flurry of emotions crossed his face he finally settled on defiance fine with me because i knew that whatever was on his face wasnt how he really felt hed use a mask until he was sure of his welcome he dropped the glamour chapter i tried to watch all of him as he walked toward me but finally gave up and stared the tentacles were the same gleaming white as the rest of him there was the faintest marbling effect in the thickest tentacles and i knew from bhatar that those were the muscular arms the tentacles that did the heavy work there were longer thinner tentacles in groupings around the ribs and upper stomach they were the fingers but a hundred times more sensitive than a sidhes then just above the belly button was a fringe of shorter tentacles with slightly darker tips that he had those made me wonder even more if what lay in his pants was sidhe or not i sat on the bed and stared until he was standing in front of me he kept his face turned away hands elapsed behind his back as if he didnt want to see or touch me i reached out and touched one of those smooth muscular tentacles it jerked away at my touch i stroked it and i felt sholtos gaze before i looked up to meet it i stroked the outer skin of the tentacle again these are for hard work lifting capturing prey or prisoners i traced my finger on the underside of the tentacle feeling the slightly different texture it wasnt unpleasant but it was thicker than human skin almost rubbery like the skin on a dolphin i suppose bhatar told you that his voice was angry yes i grabbed the base of the tentacle where it melded into his body i pulled gently but firmly down the length of it it wrapped around my hand holding it moving it away from him dont he said it felt good didnt it i asked he looked at me so angry so scared how do you know what feels good to a nightflyer i asked he looked startled then and i was able to pull my hand free of him i touched one of the groupings of thinner tentacles they retracted like sea fans when a diver brushes them below a coral sea bhatar could do the most intricate needlework with his fingers i moved my hand lower not quite touching the last visible line of tentacles these are very sensitivethey can be used for the finest tactile work but theyre actually a secondary sexual organ he looked startled we do not usually share that bit of information with outsiders i know i smiled bhatar used to caress visiting ladies with them they were often afraid to tell him to go away for fear of offending him and offending my father i noticed when i finally went back to court that the host often caressed nonsluagh with the lower tentacles its a sort of injoke that you all have on us you touch us with what amounts to a breast and were none the wiser but you know he said i like a good injoke when im not the butt of it i ran my hand in a long movement over that last line of organs his breath went out in a sigh his eyes stayed defiant protective i didnt even blame him for it i had enough mixed genetics in my own ancestors that there but for the grace of deity go i i touched them gently and they began to weave around my fingers the ends were slightly prehensile not nearly as much so as the upper ones but there was a slight depression on one side of each of the tentacles i stroked a finger into one of the depressions it made him shudder i take it that has a specific job if youre with a female nightflyer he nodded wordlessly what can they do for me i asked the question for several reasons first i was curious second i had to know if i could stand for him to touch me intimately with them i was touching him in almost a detached scientific way you do x and y happens detachment might allow me to touch him but it wouldnt get me through sex he reached down with his hands but that put the thicker tentacles in a mass against my face it made me jerk back sholto instantly straightened maybe he would have stepped away again but i grabbed a handful of the lower tentacles it froze him in place and his breath caught in his throat the reaction reminded me of what happens when you touch a mans penis when hes not expecting it he reached down with his hands and jerked my shirt out of my pants the movement put the thick muscular limbs against my face this time i didnt pull away but it was an effort he pulled the shirt over my head and let it drop to the floor the defiance was tinged with something else something darker and more real he used two of the muscular tentacles to gently move my hands away from the lower organs then the long thin tentacles grew stretching longer and thinner like muscular clay the tips caressed the mounds of my breasts in quick teasing movements it made me both startle and gasp the tips plunged inside my bra and it was like a snake crawling against my skin i was about to tell him no i couldnt do it when those reddened tips found my nipples and i discovered what the depressions on the underside were for they had suction and the touch was expert my nipples hardened under the sucking squeezing sensation a second organ played low on my belly tickling along the top of my pants he asked without asking i pushed him gently away enough please he pulled away from me but this time he wasnt hurt the look on his face was almost not quite but almost triumphant the look on your face just now that alone is worth much to me i took a shaking breath and tried to think glad to hear it but theres one more thing i have to check before i know for sure he looked at me lose the belt please i said i didnt have to ask twice he took the belt out but left the pants buttoned i liked that he had done exactly what i asked no more no less i undid the pants exposing the line of his briefs the bulge in them was straight and firm and looked very human but after what id just seen i had to be sure i pulled the underwear carefully over that bulge and saw him nude for the first time he was as straight and perfect as his face had promised like a carved alabaster sculpture i wrapped my hand around him and he cried out i wasnt teasing i was looking for something bhatar had had a spine inside his penis nearly as long as my hand something no human woman would survive only the royals of their kind had it and it meant they were fertile maleswithout the spine the females didnt ovulate during sex sholto watched me eyes eager a mans control is only so good thats why my pants are staying on he was like thick muscled velvet in my hands but there was nothing there but flesh no nasty surprises your father wasnt royal youre looking for the spine his voice was low hoarse yes my father was not one of the royal drones he whispered those reasonable words in a voice that was growing less reasonable after every touch then how did you get to be king my voice was calm i hadnt stayed excited once the tentacles stopped touching me it hadnt lasted because i wasnt aroused by the sight of him lord and lady forgive me but i saw the extras as a deformity king of the sluagh is not an inherited title it is earned earned i said how earned he shook his head i am having trouble thinking i wonder why that is i made it teasing but i didnt mean it i wished i did i could have taken him a piece at a time maybe if hed had just one or two tentacles but he had over a dozen the thought of pressing my naked body against him of being embraced by the nest of tentacles the thought made me shudder sholto mistook my reaction and one of the muscular tentacles brushed my hair like another man would use his hand i closed my eyes raised my face to the touch tried to enjoy the caress but i couldnt for a night maybe but not night after night i just couldnt i lowered my face and the tentacle moved away i held him in my hand as solid and lovely as any man id been with and because of what lay writhing just above i couldnt take the pleasure in it that i should have sholto was watching me expectantly as if id already said yes the logical thing would have been to stand up kiss him and bow out but if i kissed him the mass of tentacles would wrap around me and sholto would know how i truly felt i didnt want him to see me pull away in horror i wanted perhaps his last touch of sidhe flesh to be something pleasant not humiliating if i couldnt stand to go higher up his body well there was only one way to go lower i slid off the bed to my knees in front of him the movement forced him to take a step back from the bed and put my face even with that length of solid silken flesh he drew breath to say something but i stopped his words by taking him into my mouth i ran my hands up the backs of his thighs to cup his buttocks digging my fingernails into his flesh he cried out his body thrusting a little to meet my mouth normally i liked to watch up the line of a mans body to see his reaction but not this time i didnt want to see i fed at him sucking him using tongue mouth lips and gently teeth his breathing took on that quick panting rhythm that said i would have to stop soon or break the queens taboo the power too was back like a solid hum of energy against my body and where i touched him the energy thrummed inside my mouth it was as if he vibrated and i had a sudden vision of what it might feel like to have this warm powerfilled thing between my legs the image was so strong i had to pull away i opened my eyes and found his skin white nearly translucent with power i looked up slowly and every inch of him was a shimmering glowing thing the ends of the smaller tentacles glowed like red embers and the higher tentacles showed a play of marbled color like colored lightning under the skin the play of soft red softer violet bands of gold like the color of his eyes pulsing against the whitewhite light of his skin was beautiful i stared up at him and in that moment all i could see was beauty he was as he was meant to be a thing carved from light filled with color and magic that power rose off of him in a skincaressing bodyvibrating roll embracing me like some invisible living silken blanket i wanted to step into it to feel it enfold me undo your hair my voice sounded strange like someone else was speaking sholto undid the clasp of his hair and shook it out around his body the hair fell past his knees in a glittering fall like new snow i grabbed two handfuls of it and pulled gently it had been so long since id had hair that could cascade over my body like this it was like holding heavy living satin i pushed the cups of my bra down so that my breasts spilled out and i could brush his hair across them that one touch made me shudder and this time it was passion i looked up at him still on my knees do you think we could behave ourselves if you ran all this lovely hair over my nude body each color in his irises was glowing the rings seemed almost to be whirling like the eye of a storm the heat in his face changed to laughter shall i lie and say yes i raised a hand gone shining nearly translucent to stroke along his body yes lie to me if it will keep us from stopping dangerous talk he said softly dangerous times i said and licked him making his body react from legs to shoulders head going back breath coming in a shuddering sigh meredith he said in that tone that a man saves for only the most intimate of occasions the sound of it made my body tighten in places he hadnt seen let alone touched the door burst open with a crack of tearing wood and a roil of power that slammed into us like a giant hand sholto staggered but stayed on his feet i ended on my butt on the floor peering around his legs i had an image of a dark figure moving in a blur then sholto was gone over the bed and onto the floor beyond nerys the grey stood framed in the doorway for a heartbeat then she was moving like a blur of mist toward me i went for the bed and the gun under the pillow and knew id never make it in time chapter i had to turn my back on the hag to have any chance of reaching the gun i gave her my back my hand was under the pillow and claws slashed my bare back i screamed still reaching for the gun clawed hands wrapped around my arms and flung me to the floor i hit the floor hard unarmed and nerys was on me before i could catch my breath i kicked at her and she slashed my legs through the slacks i kept trying to kick at her and get to my feet but she never gave me the chance she attacked slashing the air my slacks the flesh underneath until i crawled to the wall and there was nowhere else to run she was shrieking at me hes ours ours ours each word was punctuated with a slash i had my arms in front of my body but she was going to strip the flesh from my arms and it wouldnt stop her id expected the glow to be gone in a wash of terror and pain but i was still a shining thing blood spilled out of my arms in a wash of glittering crimson as if my very blood glowed i felt power like a warm fist rising up inside my body spreading out but not like any magic id ever felt before the power flared through me and my body shone so brightly that the hag hesitated then she yelled ill eat your skin off girl and you wont glow anymore she slashed my arms until i cried out and i saw that blacktaloned hand coming at my face my eyes i pushed my hand into her bony chest between her breasts and power spilled up my arm out my hand i felt it smash into the hag she stopped trying to slash me and just knelt frozen above me the power flowing through me hurt it felt like every fiber of my body was being burned all at once i screamed and tried to stop it but the pain grew grew until i looked at nerys through vision gone grey and spotted i was close to passing out from the pain and if i did that nerys would kill me my body felt like it was being pulled apart with redhot knives i finally found voice to scream again and nerys joined me she pulled away from me crawling to lean against the side of the bed she watched me with wide eyes a look of disbelief on her twisted face her skin began to flowit was the only word i had for it her skin began to flow like thick water spilling over her hand like a glove nerys was screaming no no her body began to fold upon itself the bones sliding out of place the muscles sliding to the surface like logs rising in water blood spilled onto the carpet then thicker darker fluids burst in an acrid wash from her i watched her heart move to the surface of her body and draw the rest of her internal organs with it like a string of fish she screamed for a very long time and even when she was reduced to a large round ball of flesh you could still hear her screams muffled distant but alive nerys was immortalbeing turned inside out didnt stop that my pain was fading now like an amputated limb that still hurt id seen my father do similar things it had been one of his hands of power the one that earned him the title prince of flesh i started crawling for the door watching that pulsing moving thing that i had made when i cleared the end of the bed i could see black agnes straddling sholto shed taken that shining piece of him inside the dull black of her body he was struggling but she held his arms down pinning his body as she rode him there are things among the fey physically stronger than the sidhe the hags are one of them i went for the splintered door and heard agness voice chase me down the hall nerys kill that white bitch the last thing i heard was a plaintive nerys i was in the elevators before the next round of screaming started if black agnes had wanted me dead before what id done to her sister wouldnt make her change her mind it seemed to take a long time to ride down to the lobby i was shaking cold i raised my arms in front of my face both arms were bloodied hurting with that sharp pain that only slash cuts give but my left arm was the worst i could see bone in the cut on the side of my left forearm blood flowed from it to run in a steady red stream from my elbow to the elevator floor my slacks were soaked nearly purple with blood i was hurt enough for shock but i didnt think that was it it was the magic id done what could only be a hand of power id done something my father could have done it was his most terrible power one that even he used with regret because they dont die nerys wouldnt die she would be trapped in a prison of her own flesh and fluids forever blind unable to feed or breathe but never dying never dying a scream built at the back of my throat and i knew that if it came out that i would just keep screaming until agnes found me and pulled out my eyes id left my shirt my jacket and the gun in the room i didnt even have anything to bind my wounds with i did rearrange my bra so that my breasts were covered the elevator doors opened and a couple almost got in then saw me shock fear showed on their faces and they let the doors slide shut id forgotten my glamour i couldnt go through the lobby looking like this personal glamour is my very best spell yet i struggled struggled as never before to throw a veil of it over me the best i could do was make people not see me as hurt and not notice i was wearing nothing above the waist but a bra i couldnt seem to concentrate on changing my appearance i needed to use glamour to hide myself from the sluagh and i couldnt see myself in my head i couldnt visualize it and without that i couldnt do glamour the doors opened to the lobby and i walked out no one screamed or pointed so the glamour was working i was all right i was going to be all right then i saw segna the gold sitting on the plush oval couch in the center of the lobby she watched me with narrowed yellow eyes i turned on my heel and went for the back entrance and found gethin of the hawaiian shirt and the baseball cap a few yards away in front of the other doors i searched that bright busy lobby all the smiling people the line for checking in and checking out and knew that they could kill me here on this flowered carpet and no one would know until my body hit the ground and my murderers had fled the ladies room was visible from where i stood i didnt question it just walked calmly to it when the door shushed behind me i turned and wrote the symbols for protection and strength on the door i had enough blood coming out of my body that i could have written a letter i pressed my hands to the door and i called power i might have feared doing it so soon after what id accidentally done in the room but i had no choice i poured my power into that door those runes and i knew that no one of the blood would be able to pass i knew it because i willed it so and i was sidhe and i had warded the door with my own blood no one uses bloodits too powerful to waste on small things not to mention unsanitarybut a little overkill wasnt a bad thing tonight i needed time to think i walked through the small lounge area with its sofa and line of mirrors to the real bathroom beyond what i saw in the far wall made me realize i didnt need time to think i was leaving there was a window set high in the wall all i had to do was get to it i grabbed a handful of paper towels to shove against the worst of the arm wounds while i looked for something to stand on once outside i was going to have to find medical help but i had to survive first or the only medical help id be getting was from the medical examiner gethins voiceor i assumed it was him as it wasnt the hagsaid little sidhe little sidhe let me come in i didnt give the next line if he wanted to quote childrens stories he was welcome to it i was getting out of here i finally dragged one of the curvebacked chairs from the lounge to the stall closest to the window i had to jump to grab the metal top bar above the stall which knocked the chair over i hung there by my arms for a second then started using my feet to climb up the wall and get the rest of my body close to my hands the wounds that had been slowing down bled faster i slipped twice in my own blood before i could perch on top of the stall and look at the small window it was a very small window and it was one of those moments when i was glad i was small i was balanced between the bathroom stall and the window sill when something slammed into the window i had a glimpse of tentacles and a razored mouth snapping at the glass as i fell to the floor i had to climb back to the windownot to escape through it but to ward it they couldnt get in but now i couldnt get out i was trapped losing more blood than my body could handle and out of ideas if i couldnt do anything else i could at least try to slow the bleeding on my arms i got a pile of paper towels and went to the sink what i really needed was a cloth or strong thread to hold the towels in place i was using the mirror to see how deep the wound on my left arm was when i noticed something in the mirror down down in the depths of the reflection something small and dark was moving i turned paper towels pressed to the wound to search the room the stalls were pale pink and plain the walls pale pink even the few pipes that peeked out of the walls and ceiling had been painted pale pink to match there was nothing dark in the room except my slacks and bra and that wasnt what i was seeing i turned back to the mirror and it was still there it was like a dark shadowy figure walking down some crystal hall coming closer growing minutely larger i didnt instantly think it was the sidhe that had tried to kill me at alistair nortons because a lot of sidhe can do mirror magic for all i knew it was the sluagh coming through the mirror to spill over me i couldnt ward the mirrorit wasnt a door or a window not as i understood it to come through the mirror meant they had better magic than i did and i couldnt stop them the door opened and my heart almost stopped beating but it was just two women two ordinary human women who couldnt have been the least bit sensitive or they would never have been willing to come through the door they came in laughing gave me some strange looks but went into adjoining stalls still laughing and talking they saw me dressed and not bleeding because it was the image id projected good to know something was working i didnt know what to do then i noticed something new in the mirror there was a tiny spider crawling over it no not over itinside it the spider was inside the mirror crawling on the other side of the glass it was just like the spiders that had helped save me at nortons house it was the fey who had saved me he or she had saved me once if i ever needed saving again this was it i tore off a piece of paper towel and wrote in blood help me i waited until the blood had dried a little then i crumbled the paper into a hard tight ball the toilet flushed behind me i was running out of time i passed my fingertips just above the surface of the mirror careful not to touch it i didnt want to touch the mirror directly until i had a sense of exactly what spell it was i could feel the trembling line of power where the magic pulled like a string against the solidness of it the magic was like a weak spot a metaphysical crack whether the practitioner had found a weakness in the mirror and exploited it or made the weakness i didnt know i pressed my fingers against the cool glass and thought of the heat that had forged the mirror i spread my fingers apart and the glass fell to pieces like cotton candy on a summer day a hole opened in the mirror and a line of white dazzling light spilled out of it like a distant flash of diamonds i threw the ball of paper into that melted hole i smoothed the mirror back into place like molding clay i spread it even with my bare hand the door opened behind me i was out of time there was a lump in the glass not perfect i leaned into the mirror pretending to check my nonexistent lipstick blocking the view the first woman had opened a tiny purse and was really fixing her lipstick but i wasnt looking at my lips i was watching that shadowy figure low in the mirror i could see tiny shadow arms moving unwrapping my message i heard a male voice ring like a bell in the room done the woman froze in front of the mirror did you hear that she asked what i asked julie did you hear that the other woman still in the stall said hear what the toilet flushed and julie joined her friend at the sink to my horror the shadowy figure started growing larger he was going to come out of the mirror he was going to walk out of the freaking mirror i didnt have enough glamour left in me to cover this dammit i tried to think of some way to distract the women when i realized exactly what to do i crossed the room to the light switch and flipped it off as the darkness slammed around us like a black wall i felt the pressure in the room change i knew someone was crawling through the mirror as if pulling aside a thick crystalline curtain i swallowed to clear my ears and wondered what to do with the two yelling women chapter i stood in the dark feeling someone something moving in the dark and knew it wasnt the women and it wasnt me one woman said what the hell is going on lights are out in the ladies room i said brilliant the other woman said lets get out of here julie i heard the two of them stumbling toward the door in the dark they slid out into the hallway a flash of brightness against the pitch black before the door closed behind them a wavering yellowgreen flame sprang to life in the dark the flames cast flickering shadows on a dark dark face doyles skin wasnt brownit was black he looked as if hed been carved from ebony his cheekbones were high and sculpted the chin a little too sharp for my taste he was all angles and darkness those angles looked deceptively delicate like the bones of a bird but id seen him be hit full in the face with a war hammer once hed bled but he hadnt broken the moment i saw him fear rushed through me in a wave of coldness that left my fingertips tingling if he hadnt saved my life once already id have been sure he meant my death now he was the queens right hand she would say where is my darkness bring me my darkness and someone would die or bleed or both it was doyle that should have been given the task of my death not sholto had he saved me earlier to kill me now i mean you no harm princess meredith the moment he said it out loud i could breathe again doyle didnt play word games he said what he meant meant what he said the problem was that most of the time he said things like ive come to kill you but this time he meant me no harm why or rather why not i was standing trapped in a ladies room with wards that would not hold on the door and window eventually the sluagh would break through and i didnt trust sholto to save me from them if it had been almost anyone but doyle id have fallen into his arms with relief or just let myself faint from blood loss and shock but it was doyle and he simply wasnt a person that you fell into the arms of not without checking for knives first what do you want doyle the words came out harsher than i meant them to angry but i didnt take them back or apologize for the tone i was fighting not to shiver visibly and failing i was still bleeding from a half dozen wounds on my arms blood sliding inside my slacks like a warm worm working against my skin i needed help and i couldnt hide that fact from him it put me in a very weak bargaining position when dealing with the queen that was a bad place to be and make no mistake about it when dealing with doyle you were dealing with the queen unless things had changed drastically in the court in three short years to obey my queen in all things his voice was like his skin dark it made me think of molasses and other thick sweet things a voice so deep it could hit notes low enough to make my spine shiver thats not an answer i said his hair looked very short and clipped close to his head black but not as black as his skin but i knew the hair wasnt shortit was long his hair was always in a tight thick braid down his back i couldnt see it but i knew the braid reached to his ankles the braid left the tips of his pointed ears bare and visible the green flame glittered off the earrings in those fantastic ears two fine diamond studs graced each dark earlobe and two dark jewels almost the color of his skin sat beside the diamonds like dark stars small silver hoops climbed up the cartilage of both ears to the very top where the ear curled into a soft fleshy point the ears showed that he was not full high court but a bastard mix like myself only the ears betrayed him and he could have hidden them behind his hair but he almost never did i glanced down at the small silver necklace that was the only other jewelry he wore a small silver spider with its fat body in the shape of some dark jewel sat on the black cloth of his chest i should have remembered that your livery is a spider he gave a very small smile which for doyle was an outrageous amount of expression normally i would give you time to adjust to my presence our predicament but your wards will not hold forever we must act if you are to be saved lord sholto was sent here by the queen to kill me why send you to save me even for her that makes no sense the queen did not send sholto i stared up at him did i dare believe him we rarely lied outright to each other but someone was lying to me because they couldnt both be telling the truth sholto said i was under the queens order of execution think princess if queen andais truly desired your execution shed drag you home so that the court could see what happens to sidhe who flee the court against royal orders she would make an example of you he motioned at the room his hands spreading flame as he moved like afterimages she would not have you killed in hiding where no one would see the flame collected back upon itself like water droplets sliding over a plate but stayed dancing above his fingertips i put a hand on the edge of the sink if this conversation didnt end soon i was going to be on my knees because standing wasnt going to be an option how much blood had i lost how much blood was i still losing you mean that the queen would want to see me die i said yes he said something thudded into the window with enough force that the room seemed to shake doyle whirled toward the sound drawing a long knife or a small sword from behind his back the greenish flames hung floating in the air above one of his shoulders like an obedient pet the light played on the blade and the carvedbone hilt the hilt was a trio of crows their breasts meeting their wings entwined their beaks open bearing jewels for the pommel i sank to the floor one hand on the sink thats mortal dread it was one of the queens private weapons id never heard of her loaning it to anyone for any reason doyle turned slowly from the empty window the short sword caught the wavering light now do you believe that the queen sent me to save you either that or you killed her for the sword i said he looked down at me and the look on his face said he didnt see the humor in that last remark good because i wasnt being funny mortal dread was one of the treasures of the unseelie court the sword had mortal blood tied to its forging which meant that a death wound from mortal dread was truly a death wound for any fey even a sidhe i would have said that the only way to get the sword was to pry it from my aunts cold dead hands something large was hitting the window over and over again id hoped theyd try to break the wardings by magic which would take some time but they were going to simply destroy what id warded if the window was no longer there then the ward would no longer work brute force over magicsometimes it worked sometimes it didnt tonight it was going to work there was a sharp crumbling sound as the glass cracked around the wire that ran through it without the wire in the glass it would have already broken doyle knelt by me sword pointed tip down like youd hold a loaded gun for safety we are out of time princess i nodded im listening he reached his empty right hand toward me and i flinched falling back on my butt on the floor i must touch you princess why the glass cracked enough that wind oozed through the room i could hear something large rubbing against the wall and the high twittering calls of the nightflyers urging their beefy brethren on i can kill some of them my princess but not all of them i will lay my life down for you but it will not be enough not against the might of nearly the entire sluagh he leaned in close enough that i had to either let him touch me or lie on the floor and start crawling crabwise backward away from him i laid my hand against him touching the leather of his jacket he continued pushing forward and my hand slid off to the black tshirt underneath i felt something wet i jerked back and my hand was covered black in the eerie halflight youre bleeding i said the sluagh were most persistent that i did not find you tonight i had to put one hand behind me to keep from falling to the ground because he was that close close enough to kiss or to kill what do you want doyle the glass behind us shattered spraying the floor in a tinkling shower of shards like a sharp hard rain my apologies but there is no time for niceties he let the sword fall to the floor and grabbed my upper arms he pulled me against him and i had a second to realize that he meant to kiss me if hed tried to knife me id have been prepared or at least not surprised but a kiss i was lost his skin smelled like some exotic spice his lips were soft and the kiss gentle i was frozen in his arms too shocked to know what to do as if hed bespelled me he whispered against my lips she said it must be given to you as it was given to me there was a thread of anger in his whispered words i heard something fall through the window a heavy plop doyle released me so suddenly that i fell back to the floor in one fluid movement he picked up the sword turned and moved across the floor in a dancelike movement that never left his knees he drove the sword into a black tentacle as big as he was that had spilled through the crack in the window something screamed on the other side of the broken glass he pulled the sword from the tentacle and it began to retract through the window doyle stood moving just ahead of its motion he raised the sword above his head and brought it down with a force that made the blade a shining blur the tentacle fell in pieces in a wash of blood that spilled like black water in the greenishyellow light the rest of the tentacle retracted through the window to a sound like the wind howling doyle turned back to me that will make them hesitate but not for long he strode toward me bloody sword naked in his hand it had all happened in seconds hed even managed to stand to one side so the blood had missed him as if hed known where to stand or what the blood would do watching him move toward me i couldnt stay on the ground he was here to keep me alive but as he moved closer every instinct i had screamed out he was an elemental thing carved of darkness and halflight armed with a killing sword and moving toward me like death incarnate in that one moment i knew why humans had fallen down and worshiped us i used the sinks to pull myself to my feet because i could not meet him crouched like a hunted thing i had to stand before that dark grace or bow down before it like a human worshiper standing made the room waver in lines of color and darkness i was so lightheaded i was afraid id fall but i kept my feet with a death grip on the sinks when my vision cleared i was still upright and doyle was close enough that i could see green flames reflected in the dark mirrors of his eyes he was suddenly holding me so close that the blood on his shirt slapped cool against my skin his hands were so strong as they moved up my back pressing me against his body the queen put her mark within me to give to you once you have it all will know that to harm you is to risk the queens mercy the kiss i said he nodded she said i must give it to you as she gave it to me forgive me he kissed me before i could ask what he was seeking forgiveness for he kissed me like he was trying to climb inside me through my mouth i wasnt ready for it and hadnt given permission for it i tried to pull away and his arm locked against my back pressing the leather into my skin his other hand held my face fingers digging into my chin i couldnt pull away from the kiss i couldnt pull away from him struggling was getting me nowhere so i stopped and opened my mouth to him kissing him back a tension went out of his body as if he thought id given permission i hadnt i grabbed his black tshirt and began to pull it out of his pants it was so wet with blood that it clung to his skin but i pulled it free i ran my hands over the flatness of his stomach upward to the smooth swell of his chest he melted against me the hand on my back kneading against my bare skin my hands found the wound high up on his chest it was wide a deep slash three things happened at once i plunged my fingers into his wound his body stiffened and i felt him react to the pain i think he would have released me then but the third thing happened on the heels of his pain with my fingers plunged inside the meat of his body the queens mark filled his mouth and slid inside mine a sweet rush of power filled my mouth pouring from doyles body into mine and melting warm between our lips as if we were both sucking on the same piece of candy the power swelled inside us melting between us in long sweet strands it filled us to the brim with warmth like mulled wine poured into twin cups until power ran down our bodies through our bodies to finally pour in liquid warmth across our skin doyle broke the kiss pulling away from me i slid to the floor not from blood loss this time but because my knees wouldnt hold me i couldnt seem to focus on anything as if i were looking at the world through a haze doyle was leaning both hands on the sinks head down as if he was lightheaded too i heard him say consort save me i dont know what my snappy comeback would have been because the door burst open slamming into the far stalls sholto was silhouetted in the doorway hed thrown the grey overcoat across his bare chest but the nest of tentacles showed like some monster trying to pull itself from his skin i had a sense of movement behind me and turned to see doyle go for the sword that hed laid in the sink i felt sholtos power rise like a wind in the lighted doorway i realized suddenly that they both thought the other had come to kill me i had time to yell no doyles flame vanished swallowed into a darkness that was velvet and perfect and filled with the sounds of moving bodies chapter i screamed dont sholto doyle dont hurt each other i heard flesh hitting flesh the sliding footsteps as someone glided through the dark someone drew a hard breath then small noises dammit listen to me neither of you is here to harm me you both want me alive i dont know if they didnt hear me or didnt care there was at least one sword being used in the dark so i didnt get up and walk toward the light switchi crawled i kept the weight of the sinks to my right and searched the darkness just ahead with my left hand the fight continued in almost utter silence i could hear them straining against each other someone cried out and i said a silent prayer that no one was dead i almost crawled into the wall touching it at the last second i worked my way up until i found the light switch i hit the lights and the room was suddenly blindingly bright i was left blinking in the brilliance the two sidhe were locked together bodies straining against one another doyle was on his knees a tentacle wrapped around his neck sholto was covered in blood and it took my eyes a second to realize that one of his stomach tentacles had been severed and lay twitching next to doyles knee doyle still held the sword but sholtos hand and two tentacles held it away from the other sidhe their other hands were locked against each other as if they were engaged in a game of finger wrestling except this was no game i was actually surprised that sholto seemed to be holding his own doyle was the acknowledged champion of the unseelie court there were very few who could stand against him and almost none who would win sholto wasnt on that short list or so id thought then i caught something out of the corner of my eye a small glow when i looked straight at it nothing was there magic is like that sometimesonly visible through peripheral vision there was something glowing on sholtos hand a ring as i watched the sword slipped from doyles grip and he started to go limp in sholtos grasp sholto grabbed the sword in his hand before it could hit the ground the tentacles stayed around doyles arm i was moving forward before i had time to think of what id do when i got there sholto held doyles limp body in his tentacles and raised the sword in a twohanded overhead plunge like youd use to drive a knife into someones chest i was behind doyle as the sword started down i curled my body over his one hand upraised my gaze never leaving that glittering blade i had a heartbeat to wonder if sholto would stop in time then he reversed the sword and held it pointed at the ceiling what are you doing meredith hes here to save me not kill me he is the queens darkness if she desires your death he will be her instrument but he has mortal dread one of her personal weapons he carried her mark in his body to give to me if youll calm down long enough to look with more than just your eyes youll see it sholto blinked at me then frowned then why would she send me to kill you even for andais that makes no sense if youll stop strangling him maybe we can figure it out he looked down at doyles limp body still hanging from the tentacles and said oh as if hed forgotten he was still squeezing the life from the other man technically you couldnt strangle a sidhe to death but id never been comfortable testing the limits of immortality you never knew when youd find a chink in the armor big enough to die through sholto uncurled his limbs from doyle and the other man fell into my arms his weight driving me to my knees i wasnt losing enough blood for this much weakness it was either shock or something to do with using a hand of power for the first time whatever was causing it i wanted to close my eyes and rest and that just wasnt going to be happening i sat on the floor cradling doyles head in my lap the pulse in his neck was strong steady but he did not wake he took two quick breaths then his head threw back eyes wide and he took a great gasp of air he sat up coughing i saw him tense and sholto must have too because the sword was suddenly pointed at doyles face doyle froze staring up at the other man finish it no one is finishing anything i said neither man looked at me i couldnt see doyles expression but i could see sholtos and i did not like what i saw anger satisfactionhe wanted to kill doyle it was there on his face plain to see doyle saved me sholto he saved me from your sluagh if you had not warded the door i would have been here in time sholto said if i had not warded the door you would have been in time to mourn over my dead body but not in time to save me sholto still wouldnt take his gaze from doyle how did he get inside when i could not i am sidhe doyle said so am i sholto said the anger in his face hardened just a bit i slapped doyles shoulder hard enough to sting he didnt turn but he winced dont bait him doyle i was not baiting merely stating a fact this entire fight was beginning to feel very personal as if there was business between the two of them that had nothing to do with me look i dont know what you have against each other but call me selfish i dont care i want out of this damn bathroom alive and that takes priority over whatever personal vendetta the two of you have so stop acting like little boys and start behaving like members of the royal bodyguards get me out of here in one piece shes right doyle said softly the great darkness bowing out of a fight inconceivable or is it that im the one with the sword now sholto moved the sword a fraction forward touching the tip to the indentation in doyles upper lip a sword that can kill any fey even a sidhe nobleman oh i forget youre not afraid of anything there was a bitterness a mockery to sholtos voice that said without doubt that id stepped into an old grudge i fear many things doyle said his voice calm neutral death is not one of them but the ring on your finger is something that i am wary of how did you get beathalachd i have not seen it used in centuries sholto raised his hand so the dark bronze of the ring glimmered dully in the lights it was a heavy piece of jewelry and i would have noticed it on his hand if it had been there earlier it was the queens gift to show her blessing on this hunt the queen did not give you beathalachd not personally doyle sounded very sure of that what is beathalachd i asked vitality doyle said it steals the very life and skill of your opponent which is the only way that he bested me in a fight sholto flushed it was considered a sign of weakness to need more magic than you had in your own body to defeat another sidhe basically doyle had said that sholto couldnt win a fair fight and had had to cheat but it wasnt cheatingjust less than chivalrous fuck chivalry come back alive it was what id told any man id ever loved including my father before every duel the ring proves that i have the queens favor sholto said his face still colored by his anger the ring did not come from the queens own hand to yours doyle said any more than your order to kill the princess came from her mouth i know who speaks for the queen and who does not sholto said and it was his turn to sound certain really doyle said and if i had come to you and given you the queens orders would you have believed me sholto frowned but nodded you are the queens darkness when your mouth moves her words come out of it then hear these words the queen wants princess meredith alive and back home i couldnt read all the thoughts moving across sholtos face but there were a lot of them i tried to ask the question he would not answer for doyle did the queen herself tell you to come to los angeles and kill me sholto looked at me it was a long considering look but finally he shook his head no he said who told you to come to los angeles and slay the princess doyle asked sholto opened his mouth to answer then closed it the tension flowed out of him and he stepped back from doyle lowering the sword to his side no i will keep the name of the traitor to myself for now why i asked because doyles presence here can mean only one thing the queen wants you to return to court he looked at doyle im right arent i yes doyle said she wants me to return to court doyle moved so he could see both sholto and me his back to the empty bathroom stalls yes princess i shook my head i left because people were trying to kill me doyle the queen wasnt stopping them they were legal duels he said they were courtsanctioned assassination attempts i said i did mention this to her doyle said and she said what she gave me her mark to give to you if anyone kills you now even in a duel they will have to face our queens vengeance trust in this princess even those who desire your death greatly will not want to pay that high a price for it i looked up at sholto the movement made me slightly dizzy shock definitely shock fine im going back to court if the queen can guarantee my safety what does that have to do with you not giving us the name of the traitor who used the queens name to send you to execute me when she didnt want me dead i will keep that information to myself for now sholto said again his face was that arrogant mask that he wore so often at court why i asked because if the queen allows you back to court you dont need to bargain with me you will be able to return to faerie to the unseelie court and i would bet my kingdom that shell find you another sidhe lover so you see meredith you dont need me youll have everything i could have offered you and you wont be tied for a lifetime to a deformed monster youre not deformed sholto if your hags hadnt interrupted id have proved that to you something flickered over his face rippling on the surface of his arrogance yes my hags he turned those triyellow eyes on me i thought you had no hand of power meredith i dont i said i think nerys would argue with you on that i didnt know sholto i didnt mean to i had no words for what id done to nerys what has happened doyle asked black agnes lied to the sluagh she told them that if i mated with meredith that i would become pure sidhe and no longer be their king she convinced them that they were protecting me from myself protecting me from the wiles of the sidhe witch i raised eyebrows at that he looked at me but i have persuaded agnes and the rest that you are not a danger to them i met his eyes i saw the method of persuasion before i ran he nodded agnes said to thank youshes never had better from me she thinks it has something to do with your magic shes not angry about nerys i asked she wants you dead yes but shes afraid of you now meredith the hand of flesh like your fatherwho would have dreamed it there was something in his eyes besides careful arrogance i realized with a start that it was fear fear peeking through his mask it wasnt just black agnes who was afraid of what id done up in that room hand of flesh doyle repeated what are you saying sholto sholto held the sword out to doyle hilt first take this and come up to my room and see what our little princess has done nerys cannot be healed so i request that you grant her true death before you escort meredith home i will see you both safely to a taxi on the off chance that my sluagh are not perfectly obedient his words his body language all said that he was not happy with doyle with a small bow of his head doyle took the sword if it is a favor you need then i am happy to oblige for the name of the traitor that sent you to los angeles falsely in the queens name sholto shook his head i will not give up the name not now i will hold it until it is of use to me or until i decide to deal with the traitor personally if you told us the traitors name it would help us keep the princess safe at court sholto laughed then that strange bitter sound that passed for normal laughter for him i will not say who sent me here but i can guess who wanted the message given and so can you meredith fled the court because prince cels supporters kept challenging her to duels if it had been anyone else behind the attempts on merediths life the queen would have stepped in and stopped it such an insult to the royal family would not have been allowed not even to a mixedbreed magicless mortal but it was her precious baby boy who was behind it and we all knew it so meredith fled and hid herself away because she didnt trust the queen to keep her alive when cel wanted her dead doyle met those accusing eyes with a tranquil face i think you will find that our queen is no longer so tolerant of the princes eccentricities sholto laughed again and it was a painful sound when i left the court only days ago id say she was still very tolerant of cels eccentricities doyles face was still peaceful as if nothing the other man could do would upset him i think that bothered sholto more than any other reaction that doyle could have given him i think doyle knew that one problem at a time sholto for now i have the queens promise and her magic to ensure that the princess will not be harmed at court as you wish to believe doyle but for now i would ask you to aid me in bringing death to one that i valued doyle stood easily as if he hadnt been nearly strangled to death moments ago i wasnt even sure i could stand there is more than just immortality that i miss by taking after my human blood they both reached out to me at the same time and i took both hands they nearly pulled me off my feet easy does it boys i just need help standing not flying doyle looked at me you are pale how badly are you hurt i shook my head and pulled away from them both not that badly its mostly shock and it hurt when i did what i did to nerys what did you do he asked come see sholto said it is worth a look or three he looked at me then the news of what you have done will ride before you to the court meredith meredith princess of flesh no longer merely essuss daughter it is very rare for a child to receive the same gifts as the parent doyle said sholto walked toward the door tying the grey trench coat in place as he moved blood soaked into the cloth where the cut tentacle pressed against it come doyle bearer of the painful flame baron sweettongue come and see what you think of merediths gifts i was familiar with the first title but not the second i asked baron sweettongueive never heard you called that it is a very old nickname he said come doyle you are too modest it was the queens pet name for him once the two men looked at each other and again there was a weight of old grudge in the air the name is not for what you assume sholto doyle said i assume nothing but i think the sobriquet speaks for itself dont you meredith baron sweettongue does have a certain ambiance i said it is not for what you think doyle repeated well sholto said it is certainly not because of your honeyed words that was true doyle didnt go in for long speeches and he was not an accomplished flatterer if you say its not sexual then i believe you i said doyle made a small bow to me thank you the queen doesnt give out pet names except for sex sholto said yes she does i said when and for what when she thinks the nickname will bother the person bearing it and because she enjoys being irritating well the last is certainly true sholto said he had his hand on the door handle im surprised no one barged in on us i said i put a small spell of aversion on the door no mortal would want to pass it and few fey he started to open the door dont you want your limb they might be able to reattach it it will grow back he said i must have looked as disbelieving as i felt because he smiled in a halfsuperior halfapologetic way there are some benefits to being half nightflyernot many but a few i can regenerate any lost body part he seemed to think about that for a second then added so far anyway i didnt know what to say to that so i didnt try i think the princess needs to get some rest so if we could see your friend doyle said of course sholto held the door for us what about the mess i asked were just going to leave bits of tentacle and blood all over the floor the baron made the mess let him clean it up sholto said neither the body parts nor the blood belong to me doyle said if you want it cleaned up i suggest you do it yourself who knows what damage a talented witch could do with a body part left lying around sholto protested but in the end he slipped the severed tentacle in his coat pocket they left the bodysized one where it lay if i were sholto i would definitely be overtipping the cleaning staff just to make up for whoever had to do the bathroom we rode back up in the elevator and doyle knelt on the floor studying what was left of nerys the grey she was a ball of flesh about the size of a bushel basket nerves tendons muscles internal organs all glistened wetly on the outside of that ball they all seemed to be functioning normally that lump of flesh even rose and fell with breath the sound was the worst a high thin screaming muffled because her mouth was now on the inside of her body but still she screamed she shrieked the shivering that had been growing less grew more i was suddenly cold standing there in my bra and pants i got my shirt from the floor where id left it and slipped it on but knew that mere cloth wasnt going to take care of this particular kind of cold it was more a shivering of the soul than the body i could pile myself with blankets and it wouldnt help doyle looked up at me kneeling beside that pulsing screaming ball most impressive prince essus himself could not have done better the words were a compliment but his face was so empty i couldnt tell if he was pleased or not i actually thought it was one of the most horrible things id ever seen but i knew better than to share the observation it was a powerful weapon the hand of flesh if people believed id use it easily often it was more of a deterrent if they thought i feared it then the threat would be less i dont know doyle i saw my father turn a giant inside out once do you think i could do something that large my voice was dry interested but in an academic sort of way it was the voice id cultivated at court the voice i used when i was trying not to have hysterics or run screaming from a room i had learned to watch the most awful things and make dry urbane comments doyle took the question at face value i dont know princess but it will be interesting to discover the limits of your power i disagreed but i let the comment stand because i couldnt think of anything dry and urbane enough to cover the situation the muffled shrieks continued as fast as the ball of flesh could draw breath nerys was immortal my father had once done this to an enemy of the queens andais kept that ball of flesh in a trunk in her room periodically youd find it sitting around her bedchamber to my knowledge no one ever questioned what it was doing out of its trunk you just picked it up put it back locked it away and fought down any visuals that came to mind when you found it sitting in the queens bed sholto asked that you grant nerys death do it so we can get out of here i sounded disinterested even bored i thought if i had to stand there and hear that thing screaming for much longer id join it still on his knees doyle held the sword up to me hilt first the blade lying on his hands it is your magiclet it be your kill i stared at the bone hilt the three ravens and their jeweled eyes i didnt want to do it i stared at the blade for a minute more trying to think how to get out of this without appearing weak nothing came to mind if i got squeamish now then neryss torment was for nothing i would have gained a new title but not the reputation that went with it i took the sword and hated doyle for offering it to me it should have been easily done her heart was trapped and pulsing on the side of the ball i thrust the blade into it blood poured black and the heart stopped beating but that thin screaming didnt stop i glanced at the two men why isnt she dead the sluagh are harder to kill than the sidhe sholto said how much harder he shrugged its your kill in that instant i hated them both because i realized finally that it was a test it might be that if i refused the kill theyd leave her alive that was not acceptable i couldnt leave her like this knowing that shed never age or heal or die shed just continue death was mercy anything else was madness hers and mine i stabbed the sword into every vital organ i could find they bled shriveled ceased to function and still the screaming went on i finally raised the sword in a twohanded motion above my head and just started stabbing at first i paused between stabs or slices but every time the screams just went on and on trapped inside that ball of meat somewhere around the tenth blow or the fifteenth blow i stopped pausing stopped listening and just kept stabbing i had to make the screaming stop i had to make her die the world narrowed down to the pounding of the blade into the thick meat my arms raised and lowered raised and lowered the blade bit into the flesh blood sprayed across my face my shirt i ended on my knees beside something that was no longer round no longer whole id hacked the thing into pieces unrecognizable pieces the screaming had stopped my hands were soaked with blood crimson to the elbows the sword blade was scarlet the bone hilt was solid blood and still the hilt fit my hand well not slippery at all the green silk shirt id put back on was black with soaked blood my slacks had gone from purple to a violet black someone was breathing too fast too ragged and i realized it was me sometime during the butchering there had been a fierce satisfaction almost a joyfulness in the sheer destruction now i stared down at what i had done and felt nothing there wasnt enough of me left to feel anything about this so i felt nothing i was numb and it wasnt a bad way to be i got to my feet using the edge of the bed the bed was already spattered with bloodwhat was one more handprint my arms were sore the muscles shaking from too much exercise i offered the sword to doyle as hed offered it to me good sword the hilt never got slippery my voice sounded as empty of emotion as i felt i wondered if this was what it was like to be crazy if it was it wasnt so very bad doyle took the sword and dropped to his knees head bowed sholto echoed him kneeling bowing his head doyle saluted me with the bloody sword and said meredith princess of flesh true royal of the blood welcome to the inner circle of the sidhe i stared down at both of them still echoingly numb if there were ritual words to answer with i couldnt think of them either id never known them or i just couldnt make my mind work right now the only thing i could think to say was may i use your shower be my guest sholto said the carpet squished under my feet and when i walked off that section of carpet i left bloody footprints behind me i stripped and showered in the hottest water i could stand against my skin the blood wasnt red by the time it ran down the drain it was pink it was while i watched that pinkish water swirl down the drain that i realized two things first i was glad id had the courage to finish nerys rather than leave her in that horror second part of me had enjoyed killing her id have liked to think that the part that enjoyed the kill was motivated by the mercy of the first thought but i couldnt afford to be that generous to myself i had to wonder if the part of me that enjoyed sinking blade into flesh was the same part that made andais keep her own bit of flesh in a locked trunk in her room the second you stop questioning yourself is the second that you become the monster chapter i arrived back at my apartment with my hair still damp from the hotel shower doyle insisted on unlocking the door for me in case it had been magically boobytrapped he was taking his job of bodyguard seriously but from doyle i wouldnt have expected less when he pronounced it safe i walked onto the grey carpet barefoot i was wearing a hawaiian shirt and a pair of loose mens shorts clothes sholto had borrowed from gethin the only thing i couldnt borrow from the man was shoes my clothes were still in the hotel room so bloodsoaked that even the underwear had been unusable some of the blood had been neryss some of it mine i turned on the light switch by the door the overhead light blazed to life id paid extra to be able to paint the apartment a color other than white the walls of the front room were pale pink the couch was mauve purple and pink the overstuffed chair in the corner was pink the drapes were pink with ties of purple jeremy had said it was like being inside an expensively decorated easter egg the bookcase was white the entertainment center was white i turned on the standing lamp by the overstuffed chair the light over the small white kitchen table and chairs was next lacy white curtains framed the big window in front of the table the window glass was very black and somehow threatening i closed the drapes shutting the night out behind the white blind i stood for a moment in front of the only painting in the front room it was a print of the butterflies haunt by w scott miles the picture was mostly green and the butterflies were painted to nature so there was precious little pink or purple in the picture but you never choose a painting just because it matches a roomyou choose a painting because it speaks to you because it says something that you want to be reminded of daily the picture had always seemed peaceful idyllic but tonight it was just paint on a canvas tonight nothing was going to please me i turned on the kitchen lights and went for the bedroom doyle had stood quietly to one side as i moved around the room turning on all the lights like a child waking from a nightmare light to chase away the bad things the trouble was that the bad things were in my head now there was no light bright enough for that he followed me as i went into the bedroom i hit the overhead light as i moved through the door i like what youve done with the bedroom he said the comment made me turn and look at him what do you mean his face stayed impassive unreadable the living room was so very pink i feared the bedroom would be as well i looked around the room at the soft grey walls the burgundy wallpaper border with its mauve pink and white flowers the bed was a kingsized fourposter leaving almost no room between the foot of the bed and the closet doors the bedspread was a deep rich burgundy with a mound of pillows burgundy purple mauve pink and a few black just a few the mirrored dresser was cherry wood varnished so dark it was almost black the dresser near the window matched it jeremy said that my bedroom looked like a mans room with a few touches added by his girlfriend there was a black lacquer cabinet in the corner farthest away from the bathroom door the cabinet was oriental with cranes and stylized mountains the crane had been part of my fathers livery when i bought it i remembered thinking he would have liked it there was a philodendron plant on top of it grown so long that the vines fell like green hair around the beautiful wood i looked around the room and suddenly it felt like it wasnt mine and i didnt belong here i turned back to doyle as if it makes a difference to you what color my bedroom is he didnt flinch but his face became even more unreadable more passive a trace of arrogance creeping in and it reminded me of sholtos courtly mask the comment had been mean and meant to be i was angry with him angry with him for not killing nerys for me angry with him for forcing me to do what had to be done angry with him for everything even the things that werent his fault he watched me with cool eyes youre quite right princess meredith your bedroom is no concern of mine i am a court gelding i shook my head no thats the problem youre not a gelding none of you are she just wont share he shrugged making it look graceful the movement caused him to wince how is your wound i asked you were angry with me seconds ago now you are not why i tried to put it into words its not your fault what is not my fault you did not endanger me you saved my life you didnt send the sluagh after me you didnt cause the hand of flesh to manifest tonight its not your fault im angry and i want someone to blame but you shouldnt pay the price for other peoples shit he raised blackonblack eyebrows at that a most enlightened attitude for a princess i shook my head drop the title doyle im meredith just meredith the eyebrows went up even farther until his eyes looked impossibly wide and his expression actually made me laugh the laughter sounded normal felt good i sat down on the edge of the bed and shook my head i didnt think id be laughing tonight he knelt in front of me you have killed beforewhy is this different i looked at him surprised that hed understood exactly what was bothering me why was it so important that i kill nerys a sidhe comes into their power through ritual but that doesnt mean that the power will manifest itself after the first time the power is used then the sidhe must bloody themselves in combat he put a hand on the bed on either side of me but not touching it is a kind of blood sacrifice it will ensure that the powers do not go back to sleep but continue to grow blood makes the crops grow i said he nodded death magic is the oldest of all magics princess he gave that small smile meredith he said my name softly so you had me chop nerys up so that my powers wouldnt go dormant again he nodded again i looked into that serious face you said a sidhe comes into their power after a ritual i had no ritual the night you spent with the roane was your ritual i shook my head no doyle we did nothing ritualistic that night there are many rituals for awakening the power meredith combat sacrifice sex and many more it is not surprising that your power chose sex you are descended from three different fertility deities five actually but i still dont understand your roane was covered in branwyns tears for that one night he acted the part of a sidhe lover for you he brought on your secondary powers i knew it was magical but i didnt know my voice trailed off i frowned at him it seems like there should be more to it than just good sex why it is sex that makes the miracle of lifewhat could be greater than that the magic healed roane gave him back his sealskin i didnt try to heal him because i didnt know i could doyle sat down beside the bed his long legs curled up against the dresser healing one skinless roane is nothing i have seen sidhe raise mountains from the sea or flood entire cities when they came into their power you were lucky i was suddenly scared you mean my coming into my powers could have caused some great natural disaster yes youd think someone would have warned me i said no one knew you were leaving us so we could give you no parting advice and no one knew that you had secondary powers meredith the queen was convinced that if seven years with griffin in your bed and years of duels had not awakened your powers then they were not there to waken why now i asked why after all these years i do not know all i know is that you are princess of flesh and you have one more hand of power that has not manifested yet its rare for a sidhe to have more than one hand of power why would i have two your hands had melted two of the metal bars on the bed two bars melted one for each hand i stood and stepped away from him how did you know that i watched you sleep from the balcony i saw the headboard why didnt you make yourself known to me at that point you were in what amounted to a drugged sleep i doubt i could have wakened you why not the night you used the spiders the night at alistair nortons you mean the human who was worshiping the sidhe that stopped me i stared at him what are you talking about doyle when did norton worship the sidhe when he stole the power from the women using branwyns tears doyle said no i was there i was nearly a victim there was no ceremony invoking the sidhe every schoolchild in this country is taught the one thing that the sidhe were prohibited from doing when we were welcomed into this country we could not set ourselves up as gods we could not be worshiped i got the lecture at home from father and at school in history class government class you are the only one of us ever educated with the common humans i forget that sometimes the queen was livid when she discovered prince essus had enrolled you in a public school she tried to drown me when i was six doyle she tried to drown me like a purebred puppy that came out with the wrong markings i wouldnt think shed have given a damn what school i went to i dont think ive ever seen the queen so surprised as when prince essus took you and his entourage and set up housekeeping among the humans he smiled a brief flash of white in that dark face once she realized that the prince would not stand for your mistreatment then she began to try and lure him back to court she offered him much but he refused for ten years long enough for you to grow from child to woman out among the humans if she was so upset why did she allow so many of the unseelie court to visit us the queen and the prince feared that you would grow too human if you did not see your people though the queen did not approve of your fathers choices for his entourage you mean keelin i said he nodded the queen never understood why he insisted on choosing a fey who had no sidhe blood in her veins as your constant companion keelin is half brownie like my grandmother and half goblin doyle said which you do not have in your background the goblins are the foot soldiers of the unseelie army the sidhe declare war but the goblins begin it youre quoting your father now doyle said yes i am i was suddenly tired again the short burst of humor the amazing new possibilities of power a return to the courtnothing could keep me from a bonenumbing weariness but one thing i had to know you said alistair norton was worshiping the sidhe what did you mean by that i meant that he used ritual to invoke the sidhe when he set up the circle of power around his bed i recognized the symbols you saw no ritual because even the most uneducated human would know that he was not allowed to call on sidhe power for magic he did the preparation ritual before the women came i said exactly doyle said i saw a sidhe in the mirrors but i did not see a face could you sense who it was no but they were powerful enough that i could not break through all i could send you was my animal and my voice it takes a great deal to bar me from a room so one of the sidhe is allowing himself or herself doyle said i nodded or herself to be worshiped and they gave branwyns tears to a mortal to be used against other fey normally humans of fey descent would not qualify for full fey status but in this case yes to allow worship is a death sentence i said to allow the tears to be used against another fey is to be condemned to torture for an indefinite period some would choose death over that have you told the queen doyle pushed himself to his feet i have told her of the sidhe who is allowing him or herself to be worshiped and the tears i need to tell her that you have the hand of flesh and you are blooded she must also know that it is not sholto who is the traitor but one who spoke using the queens own name i widened eyes at him are you saying that she sent just you alone against sholto and the entire sluagh when she thought he had gone rogue doyle just looked at me nothing personal but you needed backup no she sent me to fetch you home before sholto left saint louis i arrived the night that i sent the spiders to help you it was the next day that sholto began traveling this way so someone found out the queen wanted me home and within twentyfour hours theyd made a plan to have me killed it would seem so doyle said you havent left the queens side inwhat six hundred eight hundred years except for assassinations one thousand and twentythree years to be exact so if she doesnt mean you to kill me then why send you there are other of her ravens that i trust more trust more or like more doyle asked i thought about that then nodded all right like more this is the longest conversation weve ever had doyle why did she send you her darkness the queen wants you home meredith but she feared you would not believe her i am her token to you her darkness sent with her personal weapon in hand with her magic in my body to prove that she is sincere why does she want me home doyle she sent you before i came into my powerwhich was a surprise to all of us so what changed her mind why am i suddenly worth keeping alive she never ordered your death she never stopped anyone from trying either he gave a small bow that i cannot argue then what has changed i do not know why meredith only that she wishes it you never did ask enough questions i said and you princess always asked too many maybe but i want an answer to this question before i go back to court which question is that i frowned at him why the change of heart doyle i need to know before i trust my life to the court again if she will not share this information i tried to think about giving up faerie forever because of one unanswered question it was too big a topic for me to wrap my mind around i dont know doyle i dont know all i do know is that im tired with your permission i will use the bathroom mirror to contact the queen and make my report i nodded help yourself he gave as much of a bow as the crowded bedroom would allow and moved toward the bathroom door which was around the corner out of sight from where we stood how did you know where the bathroom was i asked he glanced back at me face pleasant unreadable ive seen the rest of the apartment where else could it be i looked at him and didnt believe him either it didnt show on my face or he chose to ignore it because he walked around the corner i heard the bathroom door open and close i sat on the edge of the bed and tried to remember where id put the sleeping bags doyle had saved my life tonightthe least i could do was make him comfortable for my life i guess i could have offered him the bed but i was achingly tired and i wanted the bed besides until i knew exactly why hed saved me tonight i was holding off on the big gratitude there are things worse than death at the unseelie court nerys was a perfect example the queens mark would not be violated by such a spell so until i was certain down to the very fiber of my being that i was not being saved for some awful fate id hold on to my gratitude i found the sleeping bags in the small closet in the living room i had them unrolled on the foot of the bed airing when i heard the shouting from the bathroom doyles voice was raised in anger the queens darkness and the queen were having a fight or so it seemed i wondered if hed tell me what the fight was about or if it would be just one more secret to keep chapter i went to the closed bathroom door doyles raised voice was saying please my lady do not make me do this i dont know what else i would have heard because he came to the door then and opened it a crack yes princess if you could stay in there a few minutes longer im going to get dressed for bed he acknowledged it with a nod he did not invite me in to see my aunt through the mirror he did not try to explain the fight he simply closed the door i could hear their voices but faintly now no more yelling they didnt want me to know what the fight was about i was guessing it had something to do with me what did doyle not want to do so badly that hed argue with his queen he didnt mean to kill me and beyond that tonight i wasnt sure i cared i turned the overhead light off and switched on the small tiffanyshaded lamp beside the bed the overhead light always seemed too bright for a bedroom the fact that i was willing to turn off any light meant i was feeling better calmer at least my usual sleepwear runs high to lingerie i like the feel of silk and satin against my skin but it seemed almost cruel to doyle it was the royals privilege to sleep with her bodyguards her ravens until one of them made her pregnant then she wed that one and didnt sleep with the rest andais could have freed them to have other lovers but she chose not to unless they slept with her they slept with no one theyd been sleeping with no one for a very long time i finally settled for a silk nightshirt that fell to my knees it had short sleeves and revealed only a thin v of skin high up on my chest it covered more than anything else in the drawer but without a bra my breasts pressed against the thin material showing my nipples like thumbs pressed against the thin cloth the silk was a vibrant royal purple and looked very good against my skin and hair i was trying not to flash doyle but i was vain enough not to want to look frumpy i stared at myself in the mirror i looked like a woman waiting for her lover except for the cuts i raised my arms to the glass neryss claws had traced my forearms in angry red lines the gash on the left forearm was still seeping blood did it need stitches i usually healed without needing them but it should have stopped bleeding by now i raised the nightshirt up enough to see the wound on my thigh it was a puncture wound very high up shed been trying to pierce the femoral artery shed meant to kill me but id killed her instead i still felt nothing about her death it was a vast numb place maybe tomorrow id feel bad or maybe i wouldnt sometimes you just stayed numb because anything else was not helpful sanity relied on numbness sometimes i stared at myself in the mirror and even my face was empty my eyes held that dull startled look that had more to do with shock than anything else the last time id seen this look on my face had been after the last duel when i knew finally that the duels would never stop until i was dead the night id made my decision to run to hide the invitation to return to faerie was only hours old and already i looked like a shellshock victim i raised my arms again and stared at the claw marks in a way id paid the price for my return to faerie id paid in blood flesh pain the coin of the unseelie court the queen had invited me back and given me her promise of safety but i knew her shed still want to punish me for running for hiding for defeating her best efforts at hunting me down to say that my aunt is not a graceful loser is an understatement of universeshattering proportions there was a knock on the bathroom door may i come out doyle asked im trying to decide that now i said excuse me he asked fine come out i said doyle had draped the straps of the sword sheath over his bare chest the hilt rode upside down slightly to one side of his ribs like a gun in a shoulder holster the straps seemed loose as if hed taken off something that had been helping hold it in place id never seen doyle when he wasnt covered from neck to ankle even at high summer he rarely wore short sleeves just lighter cloth he had a silver ring in his left nipple it was a startling thing against the utter blackness of his skin the wound rode above the swell of his left pectoral muscle the scarlet of the wound looked almost decorative against his chest like some elaborate makeup meant to tease the eye how badly are you hurt he asked i could ask you the same thing i carry no mortal blood princess i will heal i ask you again how badly are you injured im wondering if i need stitches on the arm and i started to raise the nightshirt on the puncture wound but stopped in midmotion the sidhe are comfortable around nudity but id always tried to be more circumspect around the guards the puncture wound on my thigh im wondering how deep it is i let the purple silk fall back into place without pointing out the wound it was very high up on my thigh and i was still not wearing underwear i often didnt to bed habit now i wished i had put some on even though doyle couldnt tell what i was or wasnt wearing under the nightshirt i felt suddenly underdressed id have teased jeremy but i wouldnt have teased uther and i wouldnt tease doyle for very similar reasons they were both cut off from that part of themselves uther because hed been exiled and there were no women of his stature doyle on the whim of his queen he picked up the sleeping bags and laid them on the floor between the bed and the wall then he sat on the end of the bed may i see the wound princess i sat down on the edge of the bed beside him smoothing the nightshirt down around me i held my left arm out to him he used both his hands to raise the arm up bending it at the elbow so he could see the wound better his fingers felt larger than they should have more intimate than they were it is deep some of the muscles are torn it must hurt he looked at me when he said the last i cant seem to feel much of anything right now i said he laid his hand on my forehead his hand felt so warm it was almost hot you are cool to the touch princess he shook his head i should have noticed earlier you are in shock not severe but it was careless of me not to notice you need healing and warmth i took my hand back from him the feel of his fingers sliding along my skin as i drew away from him made me look away so he wouldnt see it in my face since neither of us can heal by touch i think ill have to settle for some bandages and the warmth i can heal by magic he said i looked at him his face was very careful unreadable ive never seen you do it at court it is a more intimate method than the touch of hands at court there are healers much more powerful than i my own small abilities in the area of healing are not needed he held his hands out toward me i can heal you princess or would you prefer a trip to the emergency room and stitches either way the bleeding must be stopped stitches are not my favorite thing i laid my hand in his he bent the arm at the elbow again clasping his hand in my hand entwining our fingers my skin looked shockingly white against his darkness like polished jet next to motherofpearl he placed his other hand just in back of my elbow my arm was held gently but firmly in place i realized that i couldnt move away from him and i didnt know how his healing worked will it hurt he looked at me around the edge of my arm it may a little he began to bend toward my arm as if to lay a kiss on the wound i put my free hand on his shoulder stopping his forward movement his skin was like warm silk waithow exactly are you going to heal me he gave that small smile if you would wait but moments you would see i dont like surprises i said hand still on his shoulder he smiled and shook his head very well but his hands stayed at my hand and arm i was still being held as if he were going to heal me whether i agreed or not sholto told you that one of my names is baron sweettongue i remember i said he implied that it was sexual but it is not i can heal your wound but not with my hands i stared at him for a few heartbeats are you saying youre going to lick the wound closed yes i kept staring at him some of the court dogs can do that but ive never heard of a sidhe having the ability as sholto said there are benefits to not being pure sidhe he can regrow a severed body part and i can lick your wound until it is healed i didnt try to keep the incredulity off my face if you were any other guard id accuse you of looking for an excuse to put your mouth on me he smiled and this time it was brighter more humor in it if my fellow ravens were trying to trick you into this it would not be your arm they were wanting to touch i had to smile youve made your point all right get the bleeding stopped if you can i really dont want to go to the emergency room tonight i dropped my arm from his shoulder proceed he bent toward my arm slowly talking as he moved i will try to make it as painless as possible his breath was almost burningly hot against my skin then his tongue licked lightly over the wound i jumped he rolled his eyes up to me without moving his face back from my arm did i hurt you princess i shook my head not sure i trusted my voice he bent back to the wound he licked the length of the wound twice very slowly then his tongue slid inside the wound the pain was sharp immediate and it brought a gasp to my throat he didnt pull away this time but pressed his mouth closer to my skin his eyes closed as his tongue probed the wound bringing small sharp pain sensations like tiny electric shocks with every small pain things low in my body tightened and released it was as if the nerves he touched were attached to other things that had nothing to do with my arm he began to lick the wound in long slow movements his eyes were still closed and i was near enough to see the black lashes black on black against his cheeks there was almost no pain now just the sensation of his tongue sliding over me the feel of his mouth against me sped my heart made my breath catch in my throat his earrings caught the light reflecting it in silver glitter as if the curve of his ears had been set in silver warmth began to gather at the wound it felt very like being healed by touch now that growing warmth the energy vibrating against my skin inside my skin was almost identical doyle drew back from my arm eyes halfclosed mouth slack he looked like he was waking from a dream or as if hed been interrupted in more intimate things he released my arm slowly almost reluctantly his voice came slow hoarse it has been long since i have done this id forgotten how it feels to heal i bent my arm back so i could see the wound and there was no wound i touched the skin with fingertips the skin was smooth untouched still damp from doyles tongue still warm to the touch as if some of that magic clung to the skin its perfect theres not even a scar you sound surprised pleased more like he gave a small bow still sitting on the edge of the bed so happy to have been of service to my princess i forgot the extra pillows i stood and started to move toward the closet he grabbed my wrist you are bleeding i glanced down at my arm and it was still healed your leg princess i looked down and found blood trickling down my right leg damn lie down on the bed and let me look at the wound he still held my wrist and tried to pull me down on the bed i resisted and he released me it should not still be bleeding princess meredith let me heal it as i did your arm its very high upon my thigh doyle the hag was trying to pierce your femoral artery yes i said i must insist on seeing the wound princess it is too vital an area to be ignored its very high up on my thigh i said again i understand that he said now please lie down and let me look at it im not wearing anything under this shirt i said oh he said emotions played across his face so quickly i couldnt read them like clouds passing over a field on a windy day finally he said perhaps you could put something on so that i might look at the wound good idea i said i opened the dresser drawer that held my unmentionables the panties like the sleepwear run high to satin silk and lace i finally picked a pair of plain black satin no frills no lace no peekaboo panels it was the closest to conservative that i owned i glanced back at doyle he had turned his back on me without being asked i slipped the underwear on made sure the shirt was in place and said you can look now he turned and his face was very solemn most of the court ladies would not have thought to warn me some to tease and some simply because it would not occur to them to tell me nudity is common enough in the courts why did you think to tell me some of the guards tease play slap and tickle and i wouldnt have warned one of them it would be just another part of the game but you never play the game doyle you are always apart from it to have just lain down on the bed and spread would have been cruel he nodded yes it would have been so many of the court treat those of us who remain aloof like eunuchs as if we feel nothing but i would rather have no touch of soft flesh than to be teased up to that point then have no release that is worse than nothing at all to me is the queen still refusing to even allow you to touch yourselves he looked down at the ground and i realized i had overstepped polite questioning my apologies doyle we are not close enough for such a question he spoke without looking up you are the most polite of all the unseelie royals the queen saw your niceties as a weakness he looked up at me eyes searching my face but those of us in the guard appreciated it it was always a relief to be given guard duty over you because we werent afraid of you i wasnt powerful enough for you to fear me i said no princess i dont mean your magic i mean we didnt fear your cruelty prince cel has inherited his mothers sense of humor hes a sadist you mean he nodded in every way now lie on the bed and let me look at your wound if i let you bleed to death for modestys sake the queen might make me a eunuch you are her darkness her right hand she would not lose you over me i think you undervalue yourself and overvalue me he held his hand out to me please princess lie down i took the offered hand and climbed onto the bed on my knees would you please call me meredith its been years since i heard princess this and princess that ill get my fill of it once im back in cahokia for tonight lets drop the titles he gave a small bow at the neck as you wish meredith i let him help me climb into the middle of the bed though i didnt need the help partly because the older sidhe liked helping and partly for the feel of his hand in mine i ended lying with my head cradled in the wealth of small pillows on the bed propped up i had a perfect view down the line of my body doyle knelt to one side of my leg if you please princess meredith i said he nodded if you please meredith i raised the dark purple silk until the wound showed the puncture was high enough that black panties showed under the raised nightshirt he used his hands to examine the wound pulling the skin pressing on it it hurt and not a good kind of hurt as if there was more damage than id realized blood flowed faster but it certainly wasnt enough for an artery id have bled to death long ago if the femoral had been punctured he raised up hands in his lap the wound is very deep and i think there is some muscle damage it didnt hurt that much until you started touching it if i do not heal it tonight youll be lame by tomorrow and well be going to that emergency room it might require surgery stitching on the inside of your leg or i can heal it now i vote for now i said he gave his smile good i would hate to have to explain to the queen why i brought you home limping when i could have healed you he started to lean over my leg then raised up this would be easier if i moved youre the healerdo what you need to do i said he moved between my legs and i had to open them just to give him room for his knees it took some maneuvering and some excuse me princess es but he finally ended lying flat on his stomach his hands cupping my thighs his gazed moved up along my body until he met my eyes just staring down at him in this position made my pulse jump in my throat i tried for it not to show on my face and think i failed he blew his breath like a warm wind against the skin of my thigh he looked at my face while he did it and i realized it had been deliberate and i dont think it had anything to do with healing me he raised back from my skin forgive me but it is not merely sex one misses but the small intimacies the look on a womans face when she reacts to your touch he flicked his tongue in a quick motion over my skin that small intake of breath as her body begins to rise to meet your touch he lay between my legs staring up at me i looked down the line of his body his hair lay in a thick black rope across the bare skin of his back trailing over the tight smoothness of his jeans when i met his eyes again they held that look that fills a mans eyes when he is sure that you will not tell him no no matter what he asks doyle hadnt earned that look not yet you arent supposed to tease remember he rubbed his chin back and forth over my thigh as he spoke i normally dont allow myself to be maneuvered into such a compromising position but i find that once i am here it is very difficult not take some advantage he bit my thigh gently and when that made me gasp he set his teeth in my skin harder it bowed my spine made me cry out when i could look again hed left a red imprint of his teeth in my thigh it had been so long since id had a lover that not only would but wanted to leave my body marked his voice came purringly deep that was wonderful tease me and ill tease back i tried for it to be a warning but my voice was too breathy but you are all the way up there and i am down here his grip tightened on my thighs the strength in his hands was immense i understood what he was implying he was strong enough to hold me in place with just his hands on my thighs i could sit up but i couldnt really get away a tension in my body that i hadnt even known was there eased i relaxed under his hands settling back against the bed there were things that id been missing that had little to do with orgasm doyle would never look up at me with slow horror on his face at something id asked him to do he would never make me feel like a monster because of the things my body craved i worked the silk of the nightshirt out from under my back then pulled it over my body over my head i raised up sitting above him that dark knowledge in his eyes was gone chased away by sheer need it was so raw on his face i knew id taken the game too far i held the nightshirt in front of my breasts not sure how to apologize without making things more awkward than they already were no he said dont cover them you surprised me thats all no doyle we cant finish this and for you especially im sorry i started to slip the shirt back on his fingers tightened painfully around my thighs fingertips digging into the skin he made me gasp and look at him with the shirt only on my arms his voice was dark with command a barely contained rage that made his eyes shine like black jewels no that one word froze me where i was left me staring down at him with wide eyes and my heart beating like a trapped thing in my throat no he said voice only a breath less severe no i want to see them im going to make you writhe my princess and i want to watch your body while i do it i let the shirt fall to the bed and sat up as close to him as i could get his grip on my thighs had passed the point of pleasure and become simply pain but that too under the right set of circumstances was a kind of pleasure his fingers eased back just a little and i saw that hed left the marks of his fingernails in my thighs the little halfmoon marks filled with blood as i watched he started to move his hands out from under my thighs but i shook my head no youre down there and im up here remember he didnt argue just settled his hands back around my thighs not hurting this time just solid enough that i couldnt move away i ran my hands over my stomach upward to cup my breasts then lay down propped against the pillows so he could see me he stared at me for long seconds as if hed memorize the way my body lay among the darkcolored pillows then his mouth settled against the wound he licked it with thick slow movements of his tongue then his mouth locked over the wound and he began to suck he drew on the skin so tightly that it hurt as if he were sucking some deep poison out or the wound the pain raised me up and he rolled his eyes to me full of that dark knowledge that he hadnt earned i laid back against the bed with the pressure of his mouth on my thigh his strong fingers digging into my thighs hard enough that i knew tomorrow id be bruised my skin had started to glow glimmering in the soft bedroom light i stared down at him but his eyes were turned downward concentrating on his work the warmth began to grow under the pressure of his mouth to fill the wound like warm water poured down the hole in my skin doyle began to glow his bare skin shone like moonlight on a puddle of water at night except this moonlight was coming from inside him to shimmer in black shapes of light and dark underneath his skin the warmth of the healing beat against my thigh like a second pulse his mouth locked against me pulling at that pulse as if hed suck me clean and empty a warmth grew in the center of my body and i realized that it was my own power but it had never been like this before the warmth in my thigh and the warmth in my body grew outward like two pools of heat out and out larger and larger until my body was eaten with heat and my skin glowed white and pure with a dance underneath like water the two powers flowed against each other and for a heartbeat doyles healing warmth floated on the surface of my heat then the two powers spilled into one another merging into one rush of spinebowing skindancing bodytightening magic doyle raised his face up from my thigh he cried out meredith no but it was too late the power poured through us both in a rush of warmth of heat that tightened things low in my body until there was no breath then the power spilled outward like a fist flinging open straining for something it could not grasp i cried out and the power flowed out of me in a glow that left shadows in the room from my skin i saw doyle as if through a haze he was on his knees he had one hand up as if to ward off a blow then the power smashed into him i saw his head snap back his body raise high on his knees as if the power had arms to lift him the dance of moonlight under his skin grew until i could see a nimbus of black light shining like a dark rainbow around his body he stayed for an impossible second lifted straining a shining thing so beautiful that you could only cry or go blind as you watched then a scream was torn from his mouth half of pain half of pleasure he sagged onto the bed catching himself with his arms that wondrous glow began to fade as if his skin were absorbing the light sucking it back into the depths from whence it came i sat up reached for him with a hand that still held a hint of that soft white light he jerked back from me fell off the bed in his haste looked over the edge of it at me with wide frightened eyes what have you done whats wrong doyle whats wrong he got to his feet leaning against the wall suddenly as if his legs werent quite steady i am not allowed a sexual release meredith not by my hand or anyone elses i never touched you there he closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall he spoke without looking at me your magic did it ran through me like a sword he opened his eyes stared at me do you understand now what youve done i finally did youre saying that the queen will count this as sex i never meant for it my power has never been like this before was it like this the night you were with the roane i thought about that for a moment then frowned yes and no it wasnt exactly like this but i stopped in midsentence and stared at his chest my look must have been astonished because it made him stare down at himself what what do you see your chest wound its gone my voice was soft with amazement he ran his hands over his chest searching the skin its healed i did not do this he came to the edge of the bed your arms i looked down and saw the claw marks were gone my arms were healed i ran my hands over my thighs and they werent healed the nail marks filled with their small bits of blood the red marks of his teeth the press of his mouth that had brought a red stain to my thigh where the wound had been why is everything else healed but these marks he shook his head i dont know i stared up at him you said that my initiation into power healed roane but what if its not just that first flush of power what if its part of my newfound magic i watched him try to make sense of it it could be but healing by sex is not a gift of the unseelie court it is of the seelie court i said you are of their bloodline he said softly i must tell the queen tell her what i asked everything i crawled forward on the bed still halfnaked reaching for him he moved out of reach clutching at the wall as if id threatened him no meredith no more the queen may forgive us because it was accidental and she will be pleased that you have more powers it may save us but if you touch me again he shook his head she will not have pity on us if we come together again this night i was just going to touch your arm doyle i think we should talk before you go tattling to the queen he moved back to the edge of the wall just before it turned the corner out of sight i have just had the first release in more centuries that you can imagine and you sit there like that he shook his head again you would just touch my arm but my selfcontrol is not limitlessweve proven that already no meredith one touch and i might fall upon you and do what ive been wanting to do since i saw your breasts trembling above me i can get dressed i said that would be good he said but i am still going to tell her what happened what does she dotake a sperm count we didnt have sex why tell her she is the queen of air and darkness she will know if we do not confess it and then she finds out the punishment will be a thousand times worse punishment it was an accident i know and that may save us you are not seriously saying that she will invoke the same penalty for this as if we had made deliberate love death by torture he said i hope not but she is within her rights to call for it i shook my head no she would not lose you after a thousand years for an accident i hope not princess i truly hope not he started around the corner toward the bathroom doyle i called he came back around the corner yes princess if she tells you that were going to be executed for this there is one bright spot he put his head to one side in a birdlike movement and that would be we can have sex real sex flesh into flesh if were going to be executed for something we might as well be guilty of it emotions chased across his faceagain i couldnt read themthen finally a smile i never thought i could face my queen with this news and have a divided mind on what i want her to say you are a tempting thing meredith a thing that a man might trade his life for i dont want your life doyle just your body that sent him laughing into the bathroom which was better than crying i had the nightshirt back on and was tucked under the covers by the time he came back out he was solemnfaced but said we are not going to be punished though she has made some hint that she would like to see you heal with this newfound power i dont do her little public sex shows i said i know that and so does she but she is curious about it let her be curious so we arent going to be executed either of us no he said why dont you look happier i asked i didnt bring a change of clothes it took me a second to realize what he meant i dug him out a pair of mens silk boxers they were a little snug through the hips because he and roane were not really the same size but they would fit he took the boxers and went back into the bathroom i thought hed be quick and come back out to sleep but i heard the shower turn on i finally tossed down some pillows on top of the sleeping bags and turned over to try and sleep i wasnt sure i would be able to sleep but doyle stayed in the bathroom a long time the last thing i heard before sleep rolled over me was the sound of the blow dryer i never heard him come out of the bathroom i simply woke up the next day and he was standing over me with hot tea in one hand and our plane tickets in the other i didnt know if doyle had used the sleeping bags or if he slept at all chapter doyle graciously let me take the window seat he sat very straight in his chair hands in a death grip on the arms seat belt buckled he closed his eyes when the plane took off normally i like watching the ground get farther away but today watching doyle turn grey around the edges was much more fun how can you possibly be afraid of flying i asked he kept his eyes closed but answered me i am not afraid of flying i am afraid of flying in airplanes his voice sounded very reasonable as if it all made perfect sense so you could ride a flying steed and not be afraid he nodded finally opening his eyes as the plane leveled off i have ridden the beasts of the air many times so why do planes bother you he looked at me as if i should have known the answer it is the metal princess meredith i am not comfortable surrounded by so much manmade metal it acts as a barrier between me and the earth and i am a creature of the earth as you said doyle there are benefits to not being pure sidhe i dont have a problem with metal he looked at me turning just his head you can do major arcana within such a metal tomb i nodded ive never found any magic that i cant perform just as well inside a metal tomb as i can outside of one that could be very useful princess the flight attendant a tall leggy blonde wearing nearly perfect makeup paused by doyles seat bending over enough to make sure he got a look at her cleavage if he wanted it shed made sure he had a chance at a view every time she came by his seat shed come by three times in the last twenty minutes to ask if he wanted anything anything at all he declined i asked for a red wine shed brought my wine this time because it was first class it was actually served in a longstemmed glass the better to spill it all over yourself when the plane hit turbulence which it did the plane bucked and swerved so badly that i gave the wine back to the flight attendant and she gave me a handful of napkins for my hand doyle closed his eyes again and kept repeating to all her questions no thank you im fine she didnt actually offer to throw off her clothes and have sex on the floor of the plane but the invitation was clear if doyle heard the invitation he managed to ignore it beautifully i dont know if he actually didnt realize she was hitting on him or if he was just accustomed to human women acting like fools she finally got the hint and wandered off she had to grip the backs of the seats as she moved down the plane or shed have fallen it was bad turbulence doyle looked greyish i think it was his version of turning green are you all right he squeezed his eyes more tightly shut i will be fine once we are safely on the ground is there anything i can do to help the time pass quicker he opened his eyes just a slit i think the stewardess made that offer already stewardess is a sexist term i said its flight attendant so you did pick up on her hints i dont think squeezing my thigh and brushing my shoulder with her breasts count as hintsmore invitations you ignored her beautifully i have had much practice the plane rocked violently enough that even i wasnt happy doyle squeezed his eyes shut again do you really want to help this flight pass more quickly i owe you at least that much after you flashed your official guard badge and we both got on the plane with our weapons i know legally were both allowed to carry in the u s but it doesnt usually go that smooth or that quick it helped that the police escorted us to the gates princess hed been very carefully calling me princess or princess meredith since i woke up this morning we were no longer on a firstname basis the cops seemed eager to get me on the plane they feared you might get assassinated on their turf they did not want the responsibility for your safety so thats how you got me on the plane armed he nodded eyes still closed i told them that with only one bodyguard it would be safer if you yourself were armed everyone agreed sholto had dropped off the ladysmith mm i actually had an inner pants holster for it that fit nicely for a front crossdraw i usually wore it at my back covered by a jacket but the police had given me carte blanche to carry weapons so i didnt have to worry about hiding it i had a teninch knife in a side sheath the tip of which was tied around my leg with a leather thong for a fast draw like an old west gunfighter the leather thong also made the sheath fit the movement of my leg better without a sheath tied off you ended up having to move it every time you shifted position or it tended to poke into your body or get caught on things i had a spyderco folding knife clipped over the underwire of my bra i always carried at least two blades at court just a rule the guns would only be allowed in certain parts of the sithen the faerie mounds but id be allowed to keep the knives before the banquet tonight in my honor so doyle informed me id add more blades a girl could never have too much jewelry or too much weaponry doyle had mortal dread in the back sheath the hilt sticking out from under his shoulder for a crossdraw like a gun shoulder holster he had his own gym bag full of weapons when id asked him why he hadnt used them against the sluagh hed said nothing else i had with me would bring them true death i wanted them to know that i was serious frankly ive always found that blowing a hole bigger than a fist out someones back lets them know youre serious but many of the guard feel that guns are inferior weapons they carry them out among the humans but guns are almost never used among ourselves except in times of war that doyle had even packed a gun meant that things were bad or maybe thered been a policy change while i was away if the other guards were carrying guns then id know the plane dipped so suddenly that even i gasped doyle moaned talk to me meredith about what anything he said voice tight we could talk about last night i said he opened his eyes just enough to glare at me the plane took another dive his eyes snapped shut and he almost whispered tell me a story im not very good at stories please meredith hed called me meredith an improvement i can tell you a story that you already know fine he said my grandfather on my mothers side is uar the cruel other than being a complete and utter bastard he earned the name because he fathered three sons that were monsters even by fey standards no blooded fey woman would sleep with him after the birth of his sons hed been told that he could father normal children if he found someone of fey blood who would willingly sleep with him i peered at doyles closed eyes and blank face please continue he said gran is half brownie and half human she was willing to sleep with him because she wanted more than anything to be a part of the seelie court silently because it wasnt part of the story i didnt blame gran she more than even myself understood what it was like to tread two very different worlds the plane had straightened but was still shuddering as wind buffeted it from every side a rough flight are you bored yet i asked anything you say will be most fascinating until we reach the ground in safety you know youre cute when youre scared he did the open eyes to slits glare close eyes again please continue gran bore two beautiful twin girls uars curse was ended and gran was one of the ladies of the courtuars wife as a matter of fact because shed borne him children to my knowledge my grandfather never touched his wife again he was one of the fine and shining gentlemen gran was a little too common for him now that he was cursefree he is a powerful warrior doyle said eyes still closed who uar thats right you must have fought against him in the wars in europe he was a very worthy opponent are you trying to make me feel better about him the plane had actually flown straight and relatively smoothly for about three minutes it was enough for doyle to open his eyes completely you sounded very bitter just now my grandfather beat my gran for years he thought if he hurt her enough hed drive her away from court because legally he couldnt divorce her without her permission he couldnt put her aside because shed given him children why did she not simply leave him because if she were no longer uars wife she would no longer be welcome at court they would never have allowed her to take her daughters with her she stayed to make sure her children would be safe the queen was most puzzled when your father invited your mothers mother to accompany the two of you into exile gran was his lady of the house she oversaw the household for him she was a servant then doyle said it was my turn to glare no she was she was his right hand they raised me together for those ten years when you left the court this last time so did your grandmother she opened a bedandbreakfast ive seen the writeups in the magazines victoria good housekeeping brownies bedandbreakfast where you can be waited on cooked for by an exmember of the royal court have you not spoken with her since you left three years ago he asked i havent contacted anyone doyle it would have endangered them i disappeared that means i left everything and everyone behind there were jewels heirlooms that were yours by right the queen was amazed that you left with nothing but the clothes on your back any of the jewels would have been impossible to sell without it getting back to the courts same with the heirlooms you had money that your father had put away for you he was watching me now trying to understand i think i have been on my own for three years a little over i have taken nothing from anyone i have been a woman on my own free of obligation to anyone of the fey which means you can invoke virgin rights when you return to court i nodded exactly virgin in the old celtic ideal was a woman who stood on her own owing nothing to anyone for a space of time three years was minimum for claiming it at court to be virgin meant that i was outside any old feuds or grudges i could not be forced to take sides on any issue because i stood apart from all of it it was a way of being in the court without being of the court very good princess very good you know the law and how to use it for your benefit you are wise as well as polite a true marvel for an unseelie royal being virgin allowed me to make hotel reservations without risking the queens anger i said she was puzzled as to why you did not wish to stay at the court after all you want to return to us do you not i nodded yes but i also want some distance until i see just how safe im going to be at court few would risk the queens anger he said i looked at him searching his eyes so i would catch whatever he thought of my next words prince cel would risk her anger because shes never seriously punished him for anything hes ever done doyles eyes tightened when i mentioned cels name but nothing more if i hadnt been watching for it i wouldnt have noticed any reaction at all cel is her only heir doyle she wont kill him he knows that doyle gave me empty eyes what the queen does or does not do with her son and heir is not for me to question dont give the party line doyle not to me we all know what cel is a powerful sidhe prince who has the ear of the queen his mother doyle said and the tone in his voice was a warning to match the words he has only one hand of power and his other abilities are not that great he is the prince of old blood and i for one would not want him using that ability on me on the dueling ground he could bring every bleeding wound i have had in over a thousand years of battles on me at once i didnt say it wasnt a frightening ability doyle but there are others with more powerful magic sidhe that can bring true death with a touch ive seen your flame eat over a sidhe seen it eat them alive and you killed the last two sidhe that challenged you to a duel princess meredith i cheated i said no you did not you merely used tactics that they were not prepared for it is the mark of a good soldier to use the weapons available to him or her we looked at each other does anyone but the queen know that i have the hand of flesh now sholto knows and his sluagh it will not be a secret by the time we land it may frighten any wouldbe challengers i said to be trapped forever as a shapeless ball of flesh never to die never to age merely to continue oh yes princess i think they will be afraid after griffin left you many became your enemy because they thought you powerless they will all be remembering the insults they heaped upon you theyll be wondering if you have come back holding a grudge im invoking virgin rightsthat means that i have a clean slate and so do they if i acknowledge an old vendetta then i lose my status as a virgin and ill be sucked right back into the middle of all this crap i shook my head no ill leave them alone if they leave me alone you are wise beyond your years princess im thirtythree doyle thats not a child by human years he laughed a small dark chuckle that made me think of what hed looked like last night with half his clothes gone i tried to keep the thought out of my face and i must have succeeded because his own expression didnt change i remember when rome was merely a wide spot in the road princess thirtythree years is a child to me i let what i was thinking into my eyes i dont remember you treating me like a child last night he looked away not meeting my eyes that was a mistake if you say so i looked out the window watching the clouds doyle was determined to pretend that last night never happened i was tired of trying to talk about it when he so obviously didnt want to discuss it the flight attendant came back this time she knelt skirt tight across her thighs she smiled up at doyle magazines spread in a fan across one arm would you like something to read she laid her free hand on his leg slid her hand along the inside of his thigh her hand was an inch from his groin when doyle grabbed her wrist and moved her hand madam please she knelt closer to him one hand on either of his knees the magazines partially hiding what she was doing she leaned in so that her breasts pressed against his legs please she whispered please its been so long since i was with one of you that got my attention how long has it been i asked she blinked as if she couldnt quite concentrate on me with doyle sitting so close six weeks who was it she shook her head i can keep a secret just dont deny me she looked up at doyle please please she was elfstruck if a sidhe has sex with a human and doesnt try to tone down the magic they can turn the human into a sort of addict humans that are elfstruck can actually wither and die from want of the touch of sidhe flesh i leaned close to doyles ear close enough that my lips brushed the edges of his earrings i had a horrible urge to lick one of the earrings but i didnt it was just one of those wicked urges you get occasionally i whispered take her name and phone number well need to report her to the bureau of human and fey affairs doyle did what i asked the flight attendant had tears of gratitude shining in her eyes when doyle took her name number and address she actually kissed his hand and might have done more if the male flight attendant hadnt ushered her away its illegal to have sex with humans without protecting their minds i said yes it is doyle said it would be interesting to know who her sidhe lover was lovers i think doyle said i wonder if she always flies the l a to st louis run doyle looked at me she might know whod been flying back and forth to los angeles often enough to set up the cult thats worshiping them one man doesnt constitute a cult i said you told me the woman mentioned a handful of others some of them with ear implants or perhaps even sidhe themselves thats still not a cultits a wizard with followers a sidheworshiping coven at best or a cult at worst we have no idea how many people were involved princess and the man who could have answered the question is dead funny how the police didnt mind me leaving the state with a murder investigation hanging over my head i would not at all be surprised if your aunt our queen made some phone calls she can be quite charming when she wants to be and when that fails shes scary as hell i said he nodded that too the male flight attendant took care of first class for the rest of the flight the woman never came near us again until we were getting off the plane then she took doyles hand and said voice urgent you will call me wont you doyle kissed her hand oh yes i will call and you will answer every question that i put to you honestly wont you she nodded tears trailing down her face anything you want i had to drag doyle away from her i whispered id take a chaperone with me when you go to question her i had not intended going alone he said he looked at me our faces very close because we were whispering i learned very recently that i am not unaccessible to sexual advances his look was very frank open the look id wanted on the plane i will have to be more careful in the future with that he raised up so that he was too tall for whispering and began to walk down the narrow hallway toward the airport proper i followed him we left the noise of engines behind and walked toward the sound of people chapter the people were a large murmurous noise that swelled toward me and over me as if i were being swallowed in a sea of noise as i walked down the concourse the crowd walked back and forth at the opening like bits of multicolored debris a wall of people doyle walked just ahead of me like an advance guard which was exactly what he was our gate was in line with the broad hallway that led deeper into the airport doyle was at the opening of the concourse standing to one side waiting for me then through the crowd i saw a tall figure come striding toward us galen was dressed in layers of green and white pale green sweater paler green pants and an anklelength white duster coat floating out behind him like a cape the sweater matched his hair which fell in short curls to just below his ear except for one long thin braid his father had been a pixie whom the queen had had killed for the audacious crime of seducing one of her handmaidens i dont believe the queen would have killed the pixie if shed known hed begotten a child children are precious and anything that breeds that passes the blood along is worth keeping around i was happy to see him but knew if he was here then a photographer wasnt far behind frankly id been surprised we hadnt stepped out into a barrage of media princess meredith had been missing for three years and now she was coming home alive well my face had been plastered across the supermarket tabloids for years sightings of the elven american princess had rivaled elvis sightings i didnt know what had been done to save me from the media frenzy but i was grateful i dropped my carryon bag beside doyle and ran to galen he swept me up in his arms and planted a kiss on my mouth merry good to see you girl his arms curved around my back holding me a foot above the ground with ease ive never liked my feet dangling helplessly i wrapped my legs around his waist and he transferred his hands from my waist to my thighs to support me id been running into galens arms since i could remember after my fathers death hed been my defender among the unseelie more than oncethough being a halfbreed like myself he didnt have much more clout than i did what he did have was six feet of muscle and trained warrior to back up his threat of course when he swept me up in his arms at age seven it was minus the kiss and other things at just a little over a hundred galen was one of the youngest of andaiss royal guard a mere seventy years between our agesamong the sidhe it was like growing up together the v neck of his sweater cut low over the swell of his chest showing a curl of chest hair that was a darker green than his hair almost black the sweater was pettably soft clinging to his body his skin was white but the sweater brought out the undercast of pale pale green so that his skin was either pearl white or a dreamlike green depending on how the light hit it his eyes were a green the color of new spring grass more human than the liquid emerald of my own but the rest of himthe rest of him was too unique for words id thought that since i was about fourteen except he wasnt who my father had promised me to because galen was too nice a guy he didnt play politics well enough for my father to feel confident that galen would live to see me grown no galen spoke when silence would be wiser it was one of the things id loved about him as a child and feared about him as i grew older he danced me around the hallway to some music that only he could hear but i could almost hear it as i looked into his eyes traced the curve of his lips with my gaze i am glad to see you merry i can tell i said he laughed and it was a very human laugh nothing but galens mirth to make it special but that had always been special enough for me he leaned in close whispering against my ear you cut your hair your beautiful hair i laid a gentle kiss on his cheek itll grow back there were only a few reporters because they hadnt had enough notice to plan a largescale assault but most of them had a camera pictures of sidhe royalty especially if they were doing anything unusual could always find a market we let them snap their pictures because we couldnt stop them using magic against them was infringement on freedom of the press so the supreme court had decreed reporters who routinely covered the sidhe were often psychics in their own right or witches they knew when you were using magic on them all it took was one report and you could be in civil court lets hear it for the first amendment the fey took two different tacks about the reporters some were very decorous in public never giving anything of interest to the paparazzi galen and i were of the school that you give them something to photograph something unimportant so that they wont dig for more sensational stuff give them something positive upbeat and interesting this was encouraged by queen andais shed been on a kick to give her court better more upbeat publicity for the last thirty years or so my lifetime id been paraded with my father on spring outings thered been a public engagement ceremony between myself and griffin there was no private life if the queen decreed it public someone cleared their throat and i looked past galen to find barinthus if galen looked unique barinthus looked alien his hair was the color of the sea the oceans the turquoise of the mediterranean the deeper medium blue of the pacific a stormy greyishblue like the ocean before a storm sliding into a blue that was nearly black where the water runs deep and thick like the blood of sleeping giants the colors moved with every touch of light melding into each other as if it wasnt hair at all his skin was the alabaster white of my own his eyes were blue but the pupils were slits of black i knew for a fact that he had a clear membrane like a second eyelid that came up over his eyes when he was underwater when i was five he taught me to swim and id loved the fact that he could blink twice with one eye he was taller than galen nearly seven feet tall as befit a god he was wearing a royal blue trench coat open over a black designer suit but the shirt was blue silk with one of those high round collars that the designers are trying to sell so men dont have to wear ties anymore barinthus looked splendid in it all hed left his hair loose and flowing free around him like a second cloak and i knew that someone else probably my aunt had picked his clothes for him left to his own devices barinthus was a jeansandtshirtorlessman galen and barinthus had been two of the most frequent visitors to my fathers house out among the humans barinthus was a power among the sidhe he was pure old court the sidhe still whispered about the last duel hed fought long before i was born in which a sidhe had drowned in a summer meadow miles from any water barinthus like my father never agreed to fight a duel unless mortality was invoked anything less was not worth his time galen let me slide to the ground i went to barinthus holding out both my hands in greeting he drew his hands out of his coat pockets carefully keeping them in loose fists until my own hands could be placed in his he had webbing between his fingers and he had been sensitive about it ever since a reporter in the fifties had called him the fish man hard to believe that someone once worshiped as a sea god could be embarrassed by a twentiethcentury hack but there it was barinthus had never forgotten that little bit of publicity the webbing was completely retractable just a thin extra line of skin between his fingers unless he chose to use it then he could expand the skin and swim like like a well um fish though this was not a compliment to be paid out loud ever he took my hands in his and leaned down from his great height to plant a civilized but wellmeant kiss on my cheek i returned the favor barinthus liked to be civilized in public his personal side was not for public consumption and he had the power to make sure that even the queen herself couldnt change his mind gods even fallen ones should be treated with a certain respect that reporter in the fifties the one who had plastered the fish man headline along the worldwide news service had died in a freak boating accident on the mississippi that summer the water just rose up and slapped the boat eyewitnesses said strangest thing theyd ever seen the cameras kept taking pictures we kept ignoring it it is good to have you back among us meredith its good to see you too barinthus i hope the court is safe enough for me to make this more than an extended visit the clear second eyelid blinked over his eyes when he wasnt swimming it was a sign of nervousness that you will have to discuss with your aunt i didnt like the sound of that the reporter shoved a tiny tape recorder in my face who are you that he had to ask meant he was on the job since i left home galen moved in smiling charming he opened his mouth to answer but another voice filled the bustling hush princess meredith nicessus child of peace the man whod spoken pushed away from the far windows where hed been leaning jenkins how unpleasant to see you i said he was a tall thin man though next to barinthus he wasnt that tall jenkins had a permanent fiveoclock shadow so heavy that id asked him once why he didnt just grow a beard hed replied that his wife didnt like facial hair id replied that i couldnt believe anyone would marry him jenkins had sold pictures of my fathers hacked body not in the united states of course were too civilized for that but there are other countries other newspapers other magazines people bought the pictures and published them he was also the one whod surprised me at the funeral and snapped pictures of me with tears trailing down my cheeks my eyes so angry they had a glow to them that one had been nominated for a prize of some kind it lost but my face and my fathers dead body were worldwide news thanks to jenkins i still hated him for that i heard a rumor that youd be coming back for a visit are you staying the whole month until halloween he asked i cant believe that anyone would risk my aunts displeasure talking to you i said ignoring his question id had lots of practice ignoring reporters questions he smiled youd be surprised who talks to me and about what i didnt like the phrasing on that it sounded vaguely threatening vaguely personal no i didnt like it one little bit welcome home meredith he said and gave a small but strangely stylish bow what i wanted to say to him wasnt fit for public consumption but there were too many tape recorders if jenkins was here then the television people couldnt be far behind if he couldnt have an exclusive hed make sure there was a crowd i said nothing i let it go hed been baiting me since i was a child he was only about ten years older than i was but he looked twenty years older because i still looked like i was in my early twenties maybe i wasnt going to live forever but i was going out well preserved i think that really bothered jenkins covering people who either didnt age or aged more slowly than he did there were moments when i was younger that it had been a comfort that he would probably die first you still smell like an ashtray jenkins dont you know that smoking will shorten your life expectancy his face went hard and thin with anger he lowered his voice and whispered still the little bitch of the west heh merry ive got a restraining order against you jenkins stay back fifty feet or ill call the cops barinthus came up to us and offered me his arm he didnt have to say it i knew better than to get into an insult match with a reporter in front of other reporters the restraining order had been put in place after jenkins plastered my picture all over the world the courts attorneys had found several judges who thought that jenkins had indeed exploited a minor and invaded my privacy after that he was forbidden to speak with me and had to stay back fifty feet i think the only reason that barinthus hadnt killed jenkins for me was that the sidhe would have seen that as a weakness too i wasnt just sidhe royalty i was two deaths away from the unseelie throne if i couldnt protect myself from overzealous reporters i didnt deserve to be in line for the throne so hed become my problem the queen had forbidden any of us from harming the press after barinthuss little boating accident unfortunately the only thing that would have rid me of barry jenkins was his death anything short of that and hed just heal and crawl back after me i blew jenkins a kiss and walked past him on barinthuss arm galen trailed behind us fielding questions from the press i caught parts of the story family reunion home for the coming holidays yaddayaddayadda barinthus and i outdistanced the reporters because they were hanging back with galen so i asked something serious why has the queen suddenly forgiven me for running away from home why does one usually call home the prodigal child he returned no riddles barinthus just tell me she has told no one what she plans but she was most insistent that you come home as an honored guest she wants something from you meredith something only you can give her or do for her or for the court what could i possibly do that the rest of you cant if i knew i would tell you i leaned into barinthus running a hand down his arm and calling a spell it was a small spell like wrapping a piece of air around us so that noise bounced off i didnt want to be overheard and if we were being spied on by the sidhe no one would wonder at me doing it with the reporters around what of cel does he mean to kill me the queen has been most insistent to everyone he emphasized the everyone that you are to be unmolested while at court she wants you back among us meredith and seems willing to enforce her wish with violence even against her son i asked i dont know but something has changed between her and her son she is not happy with him and no one knows quite why i wish i had more concrete information for you meredith but even the biggest gossips at court are lying low on this one everyones afraid to anger either the queen or the prince he touched my shoulder we are almost certainly being spied upon they will be suspicious if we keep up the spell of confusion for our words i nodded and withdrew the spell flinging it into the air with a thought the noise closed around us and i realized in the press of people that wed been lucky not to be bumped into which would have shattered the spell of course i was walking with a sevenfoottall bluehaired demigod which did tend to open a path for you some of the sidhe welcomed the faeriephiles the groupies but barinthus was not one of those and a mere glance from those eyes was enough to make almost anyone back up a step barinthus continued in a voice that was a little too cheerful for his normal words well drive you from here to your grandmothers he lowered his voice though how you got the queen to agree to you visiting relatives before paying your respects to her i do not know i invoked virgin rights which is why youre also taking me to my hotel to check in and get changed we were at the baggage carousel now watching the empty silver of it glide around and around no one has invoked virgin rights among the sidhe in centuries it doesnt matter how long its been barinthus its still our law barinthus smiled down at me you were always intelligent even as a young child but you have grown to be clever and cautious dont forget that because without caution all clever will do is get you killed so cynical so true have you really missed us meredith or did you enjoy being free of all this some of the politics i could do without but i hugged his arm ive missed you and galen and home isnt something you can pick and choose barinthus it is what it is he leaned down to whisper i want you home but i fear for you here i looked into those wonderful eyes and smiled me too galen came bounding up to us putting an arm across my shoulders and the other around barinthuss waist just one big happy family barinthus said do not be flippant galen wow galen said the mood has plummeted what were you two talking about behind my back wheres doyle i asked galens smile wilted a little round the edges hes gone to report to the queen his smile flashed back into place your safety is now our concern something must have passed on my face or barinthuss because galen asked what is wrong i glanced in the shiny mirrored surface in front of us jenkins was just outside the barrier for the carousel he was staying back his fifty feet more or less certainly far enough away that i couldnt have him arrested not here galen galen glanced too and saw jenkins he really hates you doesnt he yes i said ive never understood his animosity toward you barinthus said even when you were a child he seemed to despise you it does seem to have become personal doesnt it do you know why its so personal for him galen asked and there was something in the way he asked it that made me look away to avoid his eyes my aunt had decreed years before i was born that we could not use our darkest powers in front of a member of the press id broken that rule only once for jenkinss personal edification my only excuse was that id been eighteen when my father died eighteen when jenkins plastered my pain across the media of the world id pulled his darkest fears from his mind and paraded them before his eyes id made him shriek and beg id left him a quivering mass curled beside a lonely country road for a few months hed been kinder gentler then hed come back with a vengeance meaner harsher more willing to do anything to get a story than he was before hed told me that the only way i could stop him was to kill him i hadnt tamed him id made him worse jenkins was what helped me learn the lesson that you either kill your enemies or you leave them the fuck alone my suitcase was one of the first to come sliding along the carousel galen picked it up your chariot awaits my lady i looked at him if it had just been galen i might have believed it but barinthus wouldnt do the publicity stunts and a chariot was definitely a stunt queen andais sent her own personal car for you barinthus said i glanced from one to the other of them she sent the black coach of the wild hunt for me why until dark this evening barinthus said it is merely a car a limousine and that your aunt offered it to you with me as your driver is a great honor that should not easily be dismissed i stepped in close to him and lowered my voice as if the waiting reporters could hear us i couldnt keep calling magic to hide our words because though i couldnt sense it i couldnt be sure we werent observed its too great an honor barinthus whats going on i dont usually get the royal treatment from my relatives he looked down at me silent so long i thought he wouldnt answer i do not know meredith he said finally well talk in the car galen said smiling and waving for the reporters he shepherded us out to the automatic doors the limo was waiting like a sleek black shark even the windows were tinted black so that you could see nothing of what lay inside i stopped on the sidewalk the two men walked past me then stopped looking back at me whats wrong galen asked just wondering what might have crawled into the car while we were inside the airport they glanced at each other then back to me the car was empty when we left it here galen said barinthus was more practical i give my most solemn word that to my knowledge the car is empty i smiled at him but it wasnt a happy smile you always were cautious let us say that i do not give my word on things that i cannot control like my aunts whims i said he gave a small bow that swirled his hair like a multihued curtain indeed my aunt had chosen well there were three times three times three royal bodyguards twentyseven warriors dedicated to my aunts every wish of those the two i would have trusted most were standing beside me andais wanted me to feel secure why my security or lack thereof had never interested her before barinthuss words came back to me the queen wanted something from me something only i could give her or do for her or for the court the question was what was that one thing that only i could do off the top of my head i couldnt think of a single thing that only i could give her in the car children galen said through smiling gritted teeth there was a television news van in the distance caught in traffic but coming closer if they pulled in and blocked our escape which had happened in the past wed have other troubles than just my paranoia no matter how well justified that paranoia happened to be barinthus took keys out of his pocket and hit a button on the key chain the trunk popped open with a hiss of escaping air like it was hermetically sealed galen put my suitcase in it and held his hand out for my carryon bag i shook my head ill keep this with me galen didnt ask whyhe knew or could guess i wouldnt have come home without more than the weapons i was carrying barinthus held the rear door for me the news van will be here soon meredith if we are to make ahow do they say clean getaway we must do so now i took half a step toward that open door and stopped the upholstery was black everything was black the car had too long a history not to ring every psychic bell i had the power from that open door crept along my skin and raised the hair on my arms it was the dark coach of the wild hunt sometimes even if there were no tricks waiting inside it now it was an object of wild power and that power flowed over me by the lord and the lady merry galen said he moved past me and slid into the blackness of the car he slid all the way in out of sight then slid back out holding his pale hand out to me it wont bite merry promise i said promise he said smiling i took his hand and he drew me toward the open door of course i never promised that i wouldnt bite he pulled me into the car both of us laughing it was good to be home chapter the leather of the upholstery sighed with an almost human sound as i settled back against the seat a panel of black glass blocked our view of barinthus it was like being in a black space capsule there was a clothwrapped bottle of wine in a silver bucket in a small compartment across from us two crystal glasses sat in holes meant to cradle them waiting to be filled there was a small tray of crackers and what looked like caviar behind the wine did you do this i asked galen shook his head i wish i had though id have known to leave out the caviar peasant taste buds you dont like it either i said but im a peasant too i shook my head never he gave me his smile the one that warmed me down to my socks then the smile faded i peeked in back before we drove off he shrugged at my look i agree that the queen is acting strangely i wanted to make sure there were no surprises behind all that black glass and i said he picked up the wine and this was not here youre sure i asked he nodded sweeping the cloth aside enough to read the label on the wine he gave a low whistle its from her private stock he held the bottle carefully for me because it had been opened so it could breathe would you care to try some thousandyearold burgundy i shook my head im not eating or drinking anything that this car happened to put out for us thanks anyway i patted the cars leather seat no offense meant it could be the queens gift galen said an even better reason not to drink it i said not until i find out whats going on galen looked at me nodding and put the wine back in the bucket good point we settled back into the leather seats the silence seemed heavier than it should have as if someone were listening i always thought it was the car that was listening the black coach is one of the objects among the fey that has an energy a life of its own it was not created by any fey or ancient god that we knew of it has simply existed for as long as anyone among us can remember six thousand years and counting of course then it had been a black chariot pulled by four black horses the horses were not sidhe horses they didnt seem to exist at all until after dark then they were things of blackness with empty eye sockets that filled with leprous flame when they were hooked to the chariot it was a coacha coach and fourby the time i saw it one day no one remembers just when the chariot had vanished and a large black coach had appeared only the horses had remained the same the coach had changed when chariots were no longer in use it had updated itself then one night not even twenty years ago the black coach had vanished and the limo had appeared the horses never returned but ive seen what passes for an engine under the hood of this thing i swear that it burns with the same sickly fire that filled those horses eyes the car doesnt take gasoline i have no idea what it runs on but i know that chariot or coach or car sometimes vanishes all by itself itll drive away into the night on business of its own the black coach had been a death portent warning of impending doom there were beginning to be tales of a sinister black car sitting across from a persons home with its engine running and green fire dancing along its surface and then doom would fall on that person so forgive me if i was just a tad nervous riding in its ohsosoft leather seats i stared across the seats at galen i held my hand out to him he smiled and wrapped his hand around mine missed you he said me too he raised my hand to his lips and laid a gentle kiss across my knuckles he pulled me toward him and i didnt struggle i moved across the leather seats into the circle of his arm i loved the feel of his arm across my shoulders wrapping me against his body my head ended resting against the wonderful softness of the sweater the firm swell of his chest underneath and underneath that i could hear the beat of his heart like a thick clock i sighed and cuddled against him wrapping my leg across his so that we were entwined you always did cuddle better than anyone else i know i said thats mejust a big lovable teddy bear there was something in his voice that made me look up whats wrong you never told me you were leaving i sat up his arm still across my shoulders but the perfect comfort of a second before had been spoiled spoiled with accusations with probably more to come i couldnt risk telling anyone galen you know that if anyone had suspected that i was running away from the court id have been stopped or worse three years merry three years of not knowing if you were dead or alive i started to slide out from under his arm but he tightened his grip pulled me against him please merry just let me hold you let me know youre real i let him hold me but it wasnt comfortable now no one else would question why i had told no one why i had contacted no one barinthus gran no one no one but galen there were times when i understood why my father had not chosen galen for my consort he let emotion rule him and that was a very dangerous thing i finally pulled away galen you know why i didnt contact you he wouldnt meet my eyes i touched his chin and moved him to look at me those green eyes were hurt holding emotion like a cup of water you could see all the way to the bottom of galens eyes he was miserably bad at court politics if the queen had suspected that you knew where i was or anything about it she would have tortured you he grasped my hand holding it against his face i would never have betrayed you i know that and do you think i could have lived with the thought of you being tortured endlessly while i was safe somewhere else you had to know nothing so there would be no reason for her to question you i dont need you to protect me merry that made me smile we protect each other he smiled because he could never go long between smiles youre the brains and im the brawn i rose on my knees and kissed his forehead how have you stayed out of trouble without me to counsel you he wrapped his arms around my waist pulling me in against the line of his body with difficulty he looked at me frowning whats with the black turtleneck i thought we both agreed never to wear black it looks good with the charcoal grey dress pants and matching jacket i said he rested his chin just above the swell of my breasts and those honest green eyes wouldnt let me avoid the question im here to get along if i can galen if that means wearing black like most of the court then i can do that i smiled down at him besides i look good in black you do indeed those honest eyes held the first stirrings of that old feeling thered been tension between us since id been old enough to realize what that strange feeling low in my body was but no matter how much heat there was there could never be anything between us not physically at least he like so many others was one of the queens ravens and that meant he was hers and hers alone to command joining the queens guard had been the only smart political move that galen had ever made he wasnt powerful magically and he wasnt good at behindthescenes scheming the only thing he really had was a strong body a good arm and the ability to make people smile i meant that about the ability he exuded cheer from his body like some women leave behind perfume it was a wonderful ability but like many of my own not much help in a fight as a member of the queens ravens he had a measure of safety you did not challenge them lightly to a duel because you never knew if the queen would take it as a personal insult if galen had not been a guard he would probably have been dead long before i was born yet the fact that he was a guard kept us eternally separated always wanting never having id been furious with my father for not letting me be with galen it had been the only serious disagreement wed ever had it took me years to see what my father had seen that most of galens strengths are also his weaknesses bless his little heart but he was very close to being a political liability galen laid his cheek against the swell of my breasts and gave a small movement rubbing against me it made my breath stop for a second then roll out in a sigh i traced my fingers down the side of his face running a fingertip across the full soft mouth galen sshh he said he lifted me with his arms around my waist and brought me around in front of him i ended with my knees on his thighs staring down at him my pulse was thudding so hard in my throat that it almost hurt he lowered his hands slowly down the line of my body to end with his hands on my thighs it reminded me forcibly of doyle last night galen moved his hands so that my legs gradually parted sliding me slowly down his body until i sat facing him straddling him i kept back from his body putting just enough space between us that i wasnt actually riding him i didnt want the feel of his body that intimately against me not now his hands slid along my neck until he cradled the back of my head long fingers sliding underneath my hair until the unbelievable warmth of his hands stroked against my skin galen was one of the guards who believed that a little touch of flesh was better than nothing wed always danced the razors edge with each other its been a long time galen i said ten years since i could hold you like this he said seven years with griffin three years gone and now galen was trying to take up where we left off as if nothing had changed galen i dont think we should do this dont think he said he leaned in to me lips so close that a sigh would have brought him to me and power breathed from his mouth in a line of breathstealing warmth dont galen my voice sounded breathless but i meant it dont use magic he raised back enough to see my face weve always done it this way ten years ago i said what difference does that make he asked his hands had slid under my jacket and were massaging along the muscles in my back maybe ten years had not changed him but it had changed me galen no he looked at me clearly puzzled why not i wasnt sure how to explain without hurting him i was hoping the queen would give me permission to choose a guard as consort again as she had when shed given my father permission to choose griffin if i let things go back as they were with galen he would assume he would be the choice i loved him i would probably always love him but i couldnt afford to make him my consort i needed someone who would help me politically and magically galen was not that person my consort would no longer have the protection of the queen once he left the guard my threat was not enough to keep galen safe and his own threat was less because he was less ruthless than i was the day galen became my consort would be the day i signed his death warrant but id never be able to explain all that to him hed never accept how terribly dangerous he was to me and to himself id grown up and i was finally my fathers daughter some choices you make with your heart some with your head but when in doubt choose head over heartit will keep you alive i knelt over him starting to move off his lap his arms locked behind my back he looked so hurt so lost you really mean it i nodded i watched his eyes try to make sense of it finally he asked why i touched his face brushed my fingers through the edge of his curls oh galen his eyes held sorrow now the way they could hold happiness or puzzlement or any emotion that he was feeling he was the worlds worst actor a kiss merry to welcome you home we had a kiss in the airport i said no a real kiss just once more please merry i should have said no made him let me go but i couldnt i couldnt say no to the look in his eyes and truthfully if i was never going to let myself be with him again i wanted a last kiss he raised his face to mine and i lowered my mouth to his his lips were so soft my hands found the curve of his face and cradled him as we kissed his hands kneaded at my back spilled lightly over my buttocks slid along my thighs he pulled my legs gently so that i slid down the line of his body again this time he made sure there was no space between us i could feel him pressed tight and hard against his pants against me the feel of him pressed against me tore my mouth from his brought a gasp from my throat his hands spilled down my body cupping my buttocks pressing me harder against him can we get rid of the gun its digging into me the only way to get rid of the gun is to take off the belt i said and my voice held things that the words didnt i know he said i opened my mouth to say no but that wasnt what came out it was like a series of decisions each time i should have said no i should have stopped and each time i didnt stop we ended stretched across the long leather seat with most of our clothes and all of our weapons scattered on the floor my hands glided over the smooth expanse of galens chest the thin braid of green hair trailed across his shoulder curling across the dark skin of his nipple i traced my hand across the line of hair that ran down the center of his stomach to vanish into his pants i couldnt remember how wed gotten here like this i was wearing nothing but my bra and panties i didnt remember taking off my pants it was as if for minutes i was losing time then id wake up and wed be further along his pants were unzipped i caught a glimpse of green bikini briefs i wanted to plunge my hand down the front of his body i wanted it so badly that i could feel him in my hand as if i were already holding him neither of us had used powerit was just the feel of skin on skin our bodies touching wed gone further than this years ago but something was wrong i just couldnt remember what galen leaned over kissing my stomach he licked a thick wet line down my body i couldnt think and i needed to think his tongue played along the edge of my panties his face burying against the lace moving it aside with his chin and mouth working lower i grabbed a handful of his hair and pulled his face up away from my body no galen he spilled his hands up my body forced his fingers under the wire of my bra lifted it exposed my breasts say yes merry please say yes he rolled his hands over my breasts kneading them massaging them i couldnt think couldnt remember why we shouldnt be doing this i cant think i said out loud dont think galen said he lowered his face to my breasts kissed them gently licked the nipples i put a hand on his chest and pushed him away he stayed over me an arm on either side his legs out behind him half on top of mine somethings wrong we shouldnt be doing this nothings wrong merry he tried to lower his face back to my breasts but i kept both hands on his chest kept him pushed away from me yes there is what he asked thats just it i cant remember i cant remember galen do you understand i cant remember i should be able to remember he frowned down at me there is something he shook his head i cant remember why are we in the back of this car i asked galen eased back off of me sitting with his pants still undone hands in his lap youre going to see your grandmother i slid my bra back in place and sat up moving to my side of the car thats right what just happened he asked its a spell i think i said we didnt drink the wine or eat the food i looked at the black interior of the car its here somewhere i began running my hands along the edge of the seat someone put it in the car and it wasnt the car galen ran his hands over the ceiling searching if we had made love my aunt would have had us executed i didnt tell him about doyle but i doubted seriously if the queen would let me defile two of her guards in as many days without being punished for it i found a lump under the black cloth of the floorboard i raised it gently not wanting to hurt the car what i found was a woven cord tied with a silver ring the ring was the queens ringone of the magical items that the fey were allowed to take away from europe during the great exodus the ring was a thing of great power which is what had allowed the cords magic to work without touching either of our skins or being invoked i held the thing up so he could see it i found it and its wearing her ring galens eyes widened she never lets that ring off her hand he took the cord from me touching the differentcolored strands red for lust orange for reckless love but why the green thats usually reserved for finding a monogamous partner youd never mix those three colors even for andais this is psychotic why invite me home to be an honored guest but set me up for execution on the way to the court it makes absolutely no sense no one could have gotten that ring without her permission merry something white was sticking out from between the seat and the back i moved closer to it and found it was half an envelope this wasnt there before i said no it wasnt galen said he picked his sweater up off the floor and slipped it on i pulled at the envelope and it felt as if something was pushing from the other end it was a flexing as if of muscle it brought my pulse in my throat but i took the envelope it had my name written across it in beautiful handwritingthe queens handwriting i showed it to galen as he continued to dress youd better open it he said i turned it over and found her seal set in black wax unbroken i broke the seal and pulled out a single sheet of thick white stationary what does it say galen asked i read it aloud to him to princess meredith nicessus take this ring as a gift and a token of things to come i want to see it on your hand when we meet she even signed her name i looked at galen this makes less and less sense look he said i looked where he was pointing and there was a small velvet bag sticking out of the seat now it had not been there when i took the envelope out of the seat what is going on galen pulled the bag into sight carefully it was very small and the only thing in it was a piece of black silk let me see the ring he said i slipped the silver ring off the cord holding it in the palm of my hand the cold metal grew warm against my hand i waited tensely for it to grow hot but it was just a slight pulsing warmth either it was part of the rings enchantment or i held the ring out to galen hold it in the palm of your hand see what you feel he took the ring tentatively between two fingers and laid it in his opposite hand the heavy octagonal ring sat in his palm gleaming softly we sat and stared at the ring for a few seconds nothing happened is it warm i asked galen looked up at me eyebrows raised warm no is it supposed to be not for you apparently he wrapped the ring in the bit of silk and slipped it into the small velvet bag it fit perfectly but there was no room for the heavy cord he looked at me i dont think the queen did the spell i think she put this ring in here for you as a gift just like the note says then someone else added the spell i said he nodded it was a very subtle spell merry we almost didnt notice it yes i almost thought it was me making up my mind if it had been some outrageous lust spell wed have noticed something wrong much sooner there werent that many people in the unseelie court who were capable of such a sophisticated love spell love wasnt our specialty lust was galen echoed my thoughts there are only three maybe five people in the entire court that could do such a spell if youd asked me id have said none of them would willingly hurt you they may not all like you but they arent your enemies or they werent three years ago i said people change their minds new alliances form i havent noticed anything that different galen said i had to smile you say that like its a big surprise that you wouldnt notice political wheeling and dealing behind the scenes all right all right im not a political animal but barinthus is and he never mentioned any change of heart this severe among the neutral parties at court i held my hand out for the ring galen handed me the bag i took the ring out and laid it on my palm even before the ring touched my skin i could feel the small warmth i wrapped my hand around the ring squeezing it in my fist and the warmth grew the ring my aunts ring the queens ring answered to my flesh would that please our queen or anger her if she didnt want the ring to acknowledge me why would she have given it to me you look pleased galen said why youve just been the victim of an assassination attemptyou do remember that part right he was studying my face as if trying to read my expression the ring is warm to my touch galen its a relic of power and it knows me the seat underneath me twitched it made me jump did you feel that galen nodded yes the overhead light flashed on and i jumped again did you do that i asked no me either i said this time i watched the leather seat push out the object it was like watching something alive twitching it was tiny silver a piece of jewelry i was almost afraid to touch it but the seat kept moving until the item lay bare to the light and i could see at a glance that it was a cufflink galen picked it up his face darkened and he held it out to me the cufflink had the letter c in lovely flowing lines the queen had cuff links made for all the guards about a year ago they have our first initials on them so youre saying a guard put the spell in the car and tried to bury the letter and the bag in the seats galen nodded and the car kept the cuff link until it showed it to you th thanks car i whispered thankfully the car didnt seem to acknowledge the greeting my nerves were grateful for that but i knew that it had heard me i could feel it watching me like the sensation of eyes staring at the back of your head and when you turn around there is someone watching when you said all the guards did you mean the princes guards too i asked galen nodded she liked the look of the female guards in mens shirts said it was stylish that adds what five six more to the list of possible suspects six how long has it been known that the queen was going to send the black coach to meet me at the airport barinthus and i only found out two hours ago they had to act quickly maybe the love spell wasnt intended for me maybe it was just something they had lying about for some other purpose were lucky it wasnt meant especially for us we might not have come to our senses in time if it had been i put the ring back in the velvet bag and picked up my turtleneck from the floor for some reason i couldnt define i wanted to be dressed before i put the ring on i looked up at the cars black ceiling is that all you have to show me car the overhead light went out i jumped even though id hoped it would happen shit galen said he backed away from me or from the darkened light he stared at me eyes very wide ive never ridden in the car with the queen but ive heard that if it answers to anyone i said it answers to her and now you he said softly i shook my head the black coach is wild magic i am not so presumptuous as to assume i have control over it the car hears my voice if there is more to it than that i shrugged time will tell you havent been on the ground in saint louis an hour merry and theres been one attempt on your life its worse than when you left when did you become a pessimist galen when you left the court he replied there was a sorrowful look on his face i touched his cheek oh galen i have missed you but youve missed the court more he pressed my hand against his cheek i can see it in your eyes merry the old ambition rising i drew my hand away from him im not ambitious in the way that cel is i just want to be able to walk the court in relative safety and unfortunately that is going to take some political maneuvering i laid the velvet bag in my lap and slipped on the turtleneck i scrambled into my pants fitting the gun and the knives back in place i slipped the suit jacket over everything your lipstick is gone galen said actually you seem to be wearing most of it i said we used the mirror in my purse to reapply my lipstick and wipe it off of his mouth with a kleenex i ran a brush through my hair and i was dressed i couldnt put it off any longer i held the ring up in the dimness it was too large for my ring finger so i slipped the ring on my first finger id put it on my right hand without thinking about it the ring was warm against my skin like a comforting touch a reminder that it was there waiting for me to figure out what to do with it or maybe for it to figure out what to do with me but i trusted my own magic sense the ring wasnt actively evil though that didnt mean that accidents couldnt happen magic is like any tool it has to be treated with respect or it can turn on you most magic isnt overtly harmful any more than a buzz saw is harmful but they can both kill you i tried to take the ring off and it wouldnt come off my heart beat a little faster my breath caught in my throat i started pulling at it sort of desperately then stopped myself i took a few deep calming breaths the ring was a gift from the queenjust seeing it on my hand would make some people treat me with more respect the ring like the car had its own agenda it wanted to stay on my finger and there it would stay until it wanted to leave or until i figured out how to take it off it wasnt hurting me there was no need to panic i held my hand out to galen it wont come off it was the same on the queens hand once he said and i knew he meant that to be comforting he brought my hand to his face and kissed it lightly when his hands brushed the ring there was a shock of something like electricity but it wasnt that it was magic galen let me go and scooted away from me to the far side of the seat id like to know if barinthuss touch makes the ring jump like that so would i i said barinthuss voice came over the intercom well be at your grandmothers in about five minutes thanks barinthus i said i wondered what he was going to say when he saw the ring barinthus had been my fathers closest adviser his friend he was barinthus kingmaker and after my fathers death he became my friend and adviser some at court called him queenmaker but only behind his back never to his face barinthus was one of the few at court who could have defeated my wouldbe assassins with magic but if he had stepped in and destroyed my enemies i would have lost what little credibility i had among the sidhe barinthus had had to watch helplessly while i defended myself though he had counseled me to be ruthless sometimes its not how much power you wield but what you are willing to do with that power make your enemies fear you meredith he had said and i had done my best but i would never be as frightening as barinthus he could destroy entire armies with a thought it meant that his enemies gave him a wide berth it also meant that if you were going to swim with sharks a sixthousandyearold exgod was a good swimming partner i loved galen but i worried about him as an ally i worried that being my friend would get him killed i didnt worry about barinthus i figured that if anyone buried anyone it would be him burying me chapter gran had taken the rooms at the very top of the house for herself in olden times when this victorian monstrosity was new the rooms would have been servant quarters they would have been frigid in the winter and broiling in the summer but airconditioning and central heating are marvelous things shed knocked down some of the walls so that there was a cozy parlor area with a small full bathroom to one side a small room just for the hell of it beside it and a large bedroom that was all hers on the other side of the parlor the parlor was done in shades of white cream pink and rose we sat on a stiffbacked love seat done in a cabbagerose print with more laceedged pillows than i knew what to do with id made a little mound of them to one side like an impromptu mountain of flowers and lace we were drinking tea from a flowered tea set my second cup of tea complete with dainty saucer was floating from the small coffee table toward my hand the trick to catching something that is being levitated to you is to simply hold still dont grab at it or youll spill it wait and if the person doing the levitating is good the cup or whatever will touch your hand then you grab it sometimes i think my first lesson in patience was waiting for a cup to float to my hand id been concentrating very hard on the moment concentrating on not spilling the tea on how to get a sugar cube out of a floating sugar bowl concentrating on simply being with my grandmother after three years but the back of my mind was crowded with questions who had tried to kill us in the car was it cel why did the queen want me home so badly what did she want from me they call horse racing the sport of kings but thats not the true sport of kings the true sport is survival and ambition grans voice brought me back to the present with a jolt that made me jump the levitating tea cup moved a little away like a spaceship adjusting for docking sorry gran i didnt hear you dearie your nerves are wound so tight theyre like to snap i cant help it i do na think that the queen would drag you back just to watch your enemies kill you if she was ruled by logic id agree but we both know her too well for that gran sighed she was even tinier than i was inches under five feet i remembered a time when shed seemed huge and id believed that nothing could harm me when i was in her arms grans long wavy brown hair spilled around her delicate body like a silken curtainbut it didnt hide her face her skin was brown like a nut and somewhat wrinkled and it wasnt age her eyes were large and brown like her hair with lovely lashes but she had no nose and very little mouth it was almost as if her face were a brown skull you could see the dual holes where the nose should be as if the nose were cut away but this was the face she was born with her mother my greatgrandmother thought she was beautiful her human father my greatgrandfather had told her as a little girl that of course she was beautiful she looked just like her mother the woman he loved id have liked to have met my greatgrandfather but he was pure human and lived in the s it was a few centuries before my time i would have been able to meet my greatgrandmother if she hadnt gotten herself killed in one of the great wars between human and fey in europe killed for a war that as a brownie she had no reason to fight but if you refuse a call to battle then its treason treason is an executable offense the sidhe leaders get you coming and going the china saucer touched my hand and i carefully uncurled my fingers and took it out of the air it would have been easier to put my entire hand under the saucer to cradle it but that was not ladylike id learned to drink tea to rules of etiquette that were a hundred years or more out of date the next dangerous point with a hot beverage being levitated is that when the person takes the levitation away the cup gets heavier almost everyone sloshes a little tea over the side the first few times no shame in it i didnt slosh any tea gran and i had had our first tea party when i was five i wish i knew what to tell you about the queen child but i dont the best i can do is feed you have some pasties dear i know theyre a little heavy for tea time but theyre your favorites mutton filling i asked with turnips and potatoes just the way you like it i smiled theyll have food tonight at the banquet but will you want to eat it she asked she had a point i picked up one of the meatfilled pastries a small plate floated underneath the little handheld pie what do you think about the ring nothing what do you mean nothing i mean dearie that i dont have enough information to even hazard a guess was it cel that tried to kill me and galen i think im most angry about the fact that whoever put the spell in the car was willing to sacrifice galen to get to me as if galen had no importance the pastie smelled wonderful but suddenly i just wasnt hungry the tea id drunk was sloshing around in my stomach like it might come back up i was never good at eating when i was nervous i laid the pie on the floating plate and the plate floated back to the table gran gripped my hand shed painted her fingernails a deep rich burgundy that was almost the same color as her skin i dont know high magic merry my magic is more innate ability but if the assassin meant it as a death sentence why the green cord the color of faithfulness of a fruitful family life why add that the only thing i can come up with is that they had the spell for some other purpose and used it for this at the last moment because what other reason could the spell have been there for i do na know dearie i wish i did gran said i held my hand up so that the ring glistened in the thick autumn sunlight whoever put the spell in the car used this ring to fuel the magic they knew the ring would be there who would the queen trust with such information the list is small for those that she trusts but the list is long for those she knows are too afraid of her to go against her wishes she could have given the ring and the note to anyone and trusted that they would do as she asked with it it would ner occur to her that her guard would disobey her she squeezed my hand youre obviously not going to eat these good pasties im going to send them downstairs my guests will certainly appreciate them im sorry gran i just cant eat when im nervous im not offended merry just practical she gestured and the door opened to the small hallway and the stairs beyond the plates with food began trooping out the door what purpose would it serve to have galen and me executed i asked the plates were still making their uneven dance out the door but she turned to me without missing a beat or spilling anything you might rather ask what purpose would it serve if the queens ring were found wrapped around a love spell designed for you but it wasnt designed for me it could have been anyone in the backseat of the car i dont think so gran said she took my hand and traced the silver band it didnt respond to her touch as it had to galens this is the queens ring and you are the queens blood but for an accident of birth order essus might have been king you would already be queen and not andais it would be your cousin cel who was second in line to the throne and not you father never approved of how andais ran the court i know there were those who urged him to kill his sister and take the throne gran said i didnt try and hide the surprise i didnt think that was commonly known why do you think he was killed merry someone got nervous that essus might take the advice and start a civil war i gripped her hand do you know who ordered him killed she shook her head if i did child i would have told you by now i was not a part of either courts machinations i was tolerated nothing much more father did more than tolerate you i said ah that he did he gave me the great gift of being allowed to watch you grow from child to woman i will always be grateful for that i smiled so will i gran sat up straighter hands clasped in her lapa sure sign she was uncomfortable if your mother could only have seen his goodness but she was blinded by the fact that he was unseelie i knew it would come to grief allowing herself to be part of a peace treaty king taranis used besaba as chattel it wasnt right mother wanted to wed a prince of the seelie court none of them would touch her because no matter how tall and beautiful she was they were afraid to take her to their beds afraid theyd mingle their so pure blood with hers they wouldnt sully themselves with her not after her twin sister eluned got pregnant after just one night with artagan trapping him in a marriage gran nodded your mother always thought that eluned had ruined her chances for a seelie marriage she did i said especially after their daughter was born and she i looked at grans face looked like you i reached out to her as i said it she took my hand i know what the seelie think of my looks child i know what my other granddaughter thinks of the family likeness mother went with my father because king taranis promised her a royal lover when she returned three years among the unclean unholy unseelie court and she could come back and claim a seelie lover i dont think she expected to get pregnant in the first year which made the temporary arrangement permanent gran said i nodded thats why im besabas bane at the seelie court my birth tied her to the unseelie court she always resented me for that gran shook her head your mother is my daughter and i love her but she is very confused at times about who she loves and why i was actually thinking that maybe my mother loved no one but her own ambition but i didnt say it out loud gran was after all her mother the afternoon sun was low and heavy i need to check into my hotel and get dressed for the festivities gran touched my arm you should be staying here no and you know why ive put wards on my house and my grounds wards that can withstand the queen of air and darkness or whoever else may be trying to kill me i dont think so i hugged gran and her thin arms wrapped around me pressing me against her with a strength that should never have been held in such a delicate body have a care tonight merry i could not bear to lose you i stroked a hand through that wonderful hair and saw over her shoulder a photograph it was a picture of her and uar the cruel her onetime husband he was tall and muscular theyd had to sit him in a chair and had her stand beside him she had a hand on his shoulder his hair fell around him like golden waves his suit was black with a white shirt nothing remarkable nothing remarkable but his face he was very fair of face his eyes were circles of blue within blue he was outwardly everything a woman fey or human could want but he wasnt called the cruel just because hed fathered three monstrous sons hed beaten my grandmother because she was ugly because she wasnt royal because she bore him twin daughters and that meant that unless she agreed to end it their marriage was forever with gran and uar they werent kidding about forever she had only granted him a fey version of a divorce three years ago when i left the court id wondered at the time if gran had given him the divorce in exchange for him intervening on my behalf with andais he was powerful and andais respected that power im not saying uar threatened her no that would have been unwise but he might have suggested that they let me go my own way for a time id never asked i drew away from her and looked into those large brown eyes so like my mothers why did you grant him the divorce three years ago why then because it was time child time to let him go he didnt talk to andais on my behalf did he that wasnt the price of his freedom from you was it she laughed loud and long child child do you really think that old stuffed bucket would talk to the queen of air and darkness hes still not recovered from the embarrassment that his three sons were kicked out of his court and forced to become andaiss people i nodded my cousins are really not that bad modern surgical gloves are so thin its almost like wearing nothing at all they dont accidentally poison people by their touch anymore gran hugged me again but poison coming from your hands does prevent you from being a blooded royal guard doesnt it well yeah but as long as you avoid the blood royal there are women who are willing in the unseelie court i could believe it i looked at her she had the grace to look embarrassed im sorry merry that was quite uncalled for on my part i apologize i should know better than most that there isnt that much to choose from between the two courts i need to get to the hotel gran she walked me to the door arm around my waist you be careful tonight child very careful i will be we stood staring at each other for a second or two but what could we say what can you ever say i love you gran and i you child there were tears in those lovely brown eyes she kissed me with those thin lips that had always touched me with more gentleness and love than my mothers beautiful face or lily white hands her tears were hot against my cheek her hands clung to me as i began to walk down the stairs we tore away from each other fingertips trembling in a last touch i glanced back many times to watch that small brown figure at the top of the stairs they say not to look back but if youre not sure what lies ahead what else is there but looking back chapter the hotel had all the charm of a freshly opened box of kleenex functional somewhat decorative but it was still a generic hotel with all the sameness that that implied we stepped through the lobby doors barinthus and galen carrying my suitcases i had the carryon bag i preferred to carry my own weapons not that i thought id be able to get them out in time to use them if the gun and knife failed me but it was good to have them close id been on the ground in st louis only for a few hours and thered already been an attempt on my life and galens it was not a comforting trend the trend went downhill when i saw who was waiting in the lobby barry jenkins had beat us to the hotel id made reservations in the name of merry gentry it was not an alias id ever used in st louis which meant jenkins knew it was me damn hed make sure that the rest of the newshounds found me and nothing i could say would help if i asked him to keep it quiet hed just enjoy it more galen touched my arm gently hed seen jenkins too he led me to the desk as if afraid of what id do because there was something in jenkinss face as he rose from the comfortable lobby chairsomething personal hed hurt me if he could oh i dont mean hed shoot me or stab me but if something he could write could hurt me hed be happy to print it the woman behind the desk was smiling up at barinthus she had a good smile and had turned it up to about watts but barinthus was all business id never seen him be other than business he never teased or tested the limits of the geas that the queen had placed upon him he seemed simply to accept the womans hand brushed mine as i took my key i had a vivid glimpse of what she was thinking barinthus lying on white sheets with all that multihued hair spread around his naked body like a bed of silk my fist clenched at not just the image but the strength of her lust i could feel her body clenched tight as my fist she watched barinthus with hungry eyes and i spoke without thinking using words to acknowledge and break the connection with the girl i leaned in close and said the picture you have in your mind of him nude she started to protest then let her words die eyes large licking her lower lip she finally just nodded youre not doing him justice her eyes got even bigger and she stared at barinthus as he stood by the elevators i was still picking up her emotions it happened sometimes like picking up random bits of television or radio signal but my bandwidth was narrow lust images mostly random lust images and only from humansid never gotten a flash from any other fey i never understood why want me to ask him to take off his coat so you can see better that made her blush and the image shed built up in her mind crumbled under her embarrassment her mind was just a series of jumbles now i was freed from her thoughts her emotions id been told by one of the old fertility gods at the seelie court that being able to see other peoples lust images was a useful tool if you were seeking priests and priestesses for your temple people with strong lust could be used in ceremonies the sexual energy harnessed and magnified so that their lust could be imparted to others it had once been assumed that lust equated fertility unfortunately not if lust equaled reproduction the fey would have populated the world by now or so the old stories go the desk clerk would be so disappointed to discover that barinthus was celibate if hed been staying in the hotel i might have warned him about her she struck me as the type who just might surprise him in his room after hours but barinthus would be back at the mound by nightfall no worries jenkins was now standing by the elevators leaning his back against the wall smiling he was trying to talk to barinthus as galen and i walked up to them barinthus was ignoring him as only a deity can with a total disregard as if jenkinss voice was the buzzing of some unimportant insect it was beyond disdain it was as if for barinthus the reporter truly did not exist this was an ability i lacked and envied well meredith fancy meeting you here jenkins managed to make his voice both cheerful and cruel i tried ignoring him as barinthus was but knew that if the elevator didnt come soon id lose merry gentry couldnt you do better than that the gentry has been a euphemism for the fey for centuries maybe he was still guessing but i didnt think so i had an idea i turned to him smiling sweetly do you really think id use such an obvious pseudonym if i cared a tinkers dam whether someone found out doubt crossed his face he straightened moving within touching distance of me you mean you dont care if i print your alias barry i dont care what you print but id say youre less than two feet away from me i looked at the lobby in fact i dont think theres anywhere in this lobby that is more than fifty feet away from me i turned to galen can you please have the desk clerk call the police i looked at jenkinsand tell them im being harassed my pleasure galen said he walked back toward the desk barinthus and i stood there with my luggage jenkins looked from me to galen they wont do anything to me well see wont we i said galen was speaking with the same desk clerk who had eyed barinthus was she picturing galen naked now it was good to be across the lobby and out of accidental touching range maybe being able to sense peoples lust at random intervals was useful for picking out priestesses for your temple but since i didnt have a temple it was just irritating jenkins was staring at me im so glad youre home meredith so very very glad the words were mild but the tone was pure venom his hatred of me was an almost touchable thing he and i watched the desk clerk use the phone two young men one with a badge that said asst manager the other with a badge that just said his name walked very purposefully toward us i think barry that youre about to get your walking papers enjoy waiting for the police no court order is going to keep me away from you meredith my hands itch when im near a story the bigger the story the more they itch im just about to scratch my skin off every time im near you meredith something big is coming and it revolves around you gee barry when did you become a prophet one afternoon by a quiet country road he said he leaned in so close i could smell his aftershave under the odor of cigarettes i had what you might call an epiphany and ive had the gift ever since the hotel men were almost upon us jenkins leaned in close enough that from a distance it must have looked like a kiss he whispered those that the gods would destroy they first make mad the men grabbed his arms and pulled him away from me jenkins didnt struggle he went quietly galen said theyll hold him in the managers office until the police come they wont arrest him merry you know that no missouri doesnt have stalker laws yet i had an amusing idea if i could get jenkins to follow me out to california the laws are different there are very strict stalker laws in l a county if jenkins made too big a pest of himself maybe id see if hed follow me somewhere where he could get jail time for what hed just done hed forced a kiss on me in publicor so i could claim in front of impartial witnesses under the right set of laws that made him a very bad boy the elevator doors opened great now that i didnt need the rescue the elevator doors closed leaving us alone in a mirrored box we all watched our own reflections but galen spoke jenkins never learns youd think after what you did to him hed be afraid of you i watched my reflection show surprise eyes widening by the time i recovered it was too late that was a guess i said but a good one galen said what did you do to him meredith barinthus said you know the rules i know the rules i said i started to step into the hallway but galen stopped me a hand on my shoulder were the bodyguards let one of us go first sorry ive gotten out of the habit i said barinthus said get back into the habit quickly i dont want you hurt because you didnt hide behind us its our job to take the risks and keep you safe he pressed the hold door open button i know that barinthus and yet you would have stepped into the hall he said galen very cautiously peeked out of the elevator then stepped into the hallway clear he swept a low bow the small braid spilled over his shoulder to touch the floor i remembered when his hair spilled like a green waterfall to pool onto the floor there was a part of me that thought that was what a mans hair should look like long enough to drag the floor long enough to cover my body in a silken sheet when we made love id mourned when he cut it but it hadnt been any of my business get up galen i started walking down the hallway key in hand he stood and half ran half danced down the hallway to get ahead of me oh no my lady i must needs open the lock stop it galen i mean it barinthus just followed us quietly suitcase in hand like a father watching grown children misbehave no no he was ignoring us the way hed ignored jenkins almost i glanced back at him and could read nothing on that pale face he was selfcontained unreadable there had been a time when hed smiled more laughed more hadnt there i remembered his arms lifting me from the water with a great shout of laughter his hair floating around his body like a slow cloud id swum in that cloud wrapped it around tiny hands wed laughed together the first time i swam in the pacific ocean i thought of barinthus i wanted to show him this vast new ocean to my knowledge hed never seen it galen was waiting in front of the door i stopped and waited for barinthus to catch up with me you seem solemn today barinthus he looked at me with those eyes and the invisible eyelid flicked over them nervous he was nervous was he afraid for me hed been pleased about the ring displeased about the spell in the car but not too displeased not too distressed as if it were all normal business in a way it was whats wrong barinthus what havent you told me trust me meredith i took his free hand in mine fingers sliding around his my hand was lost in his i do trust you barinthus he held my hand delicately as if afraid i would break meredith little meredith his face softened as he spoke you were always a mixture of directness coyness and tenderness im not as tender as i used to be barinthus he nodded the world does tend to beat such things out of you unfortunately he brought my hand to his lips and laid a gentle kiss against my fingers his lips brushed the ring and sent a tingling wave through both of us he looked solemn again face closing down as he dropped my hand what barinthus what i grabbed his arm he shook his head it has been a very long time since that ring has come to life in such a manner what does the ring have to do with anything i asked it had become just another piece of metal and now it lives again and i asked he looked past me to galen lets get her to the room the queen does not like to be kept waiting galen took the key from me and unlocked the door he checked the room for spells and hidden dangers while barinthus and i waited in the hall tell me what it means that the ring reacts to you and galen but not my grandmother he sighed the queen once used the ring to choose her consorts i raised eyebrows at him which means what it reacts to men that the ring deems worthy of you i stared up at him searching that handsome exotic face what does that mean worthy of me the queen is the only one who knows the complete powers of the ring i know only that it has been centuries since the ring has been alive on her hand that it lives for you is both good and dangerous the queen might be jealous that the ring is yours now she gave it to mewhy would she be jealous because she is the queen of air and darkness he said it as if that explained it all in a way it did in a way did not like so much about our queen it was a paradox galen came to the door all clear barinthus walked past him forcing galen to step back out of the way of the big man and the suitcase whats his problem galen asked the ring i think i stepped into the room it was a typical box room done in shades of blue barinthus had put the suitcase on one of the dark blue bedspreads please make haste meredith galen and i still have to dress for dinner i looked at him standing in the blueonblue room he matched the decor if the room had been green galen would have matched you could color code your bodyguards to your room i laughed what barinthus asked i motioned at him you match the room he looked around as if hed just noticed the blue print wallpaper the dark blue bedspreads the powder blue carpet so i do now please get dressed he unzipped the suitcase to emphasize the request though it had the taste of an order no matter how it was worded is there a deadline im not aware of i asked galen sat down on the other bed i agree with the big guy on this one the queens planning a welcome home event for you and she wont like waiting for us to get dressed and if were not dressed in the outfits she had made for us shell be angry with us are the two of you going to be in trouble i asked not if you hurry galen said i went into the bathroom with the carryon bag id packed my outfit for tonight in the bag just in case the suitcase went missing i didnt want to have to do emergency shopping for an outfit that would meet with my aunts approval for court fashion slacks were not appropriate dinner wear for women sexist but true dinner was formal attire always if you didnt want to dress up you could eat in your room i slipped into black satin and lace panties the bra was underwire firm hold with lace the hose were black and thigh high the old human saying about wearing clean underwear in case you get hit by a bus applied to the unseelie court sort of here you wore nice underwear because the queen might see it though truthfully i liked knowing that everything i wore was pretty even the things that touched my skin where no one else would see i darkened the eye shadow and mascara to shades of grey and white i applied enough eyeliner that my eyes stood out in shocking relief like emeralds and gold set in ebony i chose a shade of lipstick that was a dark dark wine burgundy i had two spyderco folding knives i flipped one of them open it was a sixinch blade long slender gleaming silver but it was steeltheir military model steel or iron was what you needed against my relatives the other knife was much smallera delica each knife had a clipon so you just slipped them over your clothing i checked both knives for ease of release then closed them and put them on the delica fit down the center of the bra on the underwire i slipped a black garter over my left leg not to hold up the hosethey didnt need itbut to hold the military blade i slipped the dress out of the garment bag the dress was a deep rich burgundy it had just enough strap to hide the bra the bodice was satin tight and fitted the rest of the dress was a softer more naturallooking cloth falling in a soft clinging line to the floor the matching jacket was made of the same soft burgundy cloth except for the satin lapels i had an ankle holster complete with a beretta tomcat their newest auto pistol the thing weighed nearly a pound there were guns out there that were smaller but if i had to shoot someone tonight i wanted more than a backing me up the real trouble with ankle holsters is that they make you walk funny there is a tendency to drag the foot that the holsters on to widen your step in an odd little movement the added problem was i was wearing hose and the chances of not snagging them on the holster as i walked were pretty much nil but it was the only place i could think to hide a gun that wasnt obvious just by glancing at me id sacrifice the hose to keep the gun i walked back and forth in the burgundy high heels they were only twoinch heels the better to move quickly in and with a skirt this long most people wouldnt be noticing how high or how low my heels were id had the shop where i bought the dress hem it for the shoes at five foot even you dont buy offtherack formals wear twoinch heels and not have to hem the dress i added the jewelry last the necklace was antique metal darkened until it was almost black with only hidden glimpses of the true silver color the stones were garnets i purposefully hadnt cleaned the metal so that it would keep that dark color i thought the stain set the garnets off nicely id gone to the trouble of curling under the ends of my hair so that it brushed my shoulders it gleamed a red so dark it was the color of the garnets the burgundy dress brought out a matching burgundy sheen in my hair my aunt might let me keep my weapons or she might not i probably wouldnt be challenged to a duel my first night back with a special request from the queen herself for my presence but it was always better to be armed there are things at the court that arent royal and dont fight duels they are the things that have always been of the hostthe monsters of our race our kindand they do not reason as we do sometimes for no reason that anyone can explain one of the monsters will attack people can die before it can be stopped so why keep such unstable horrors around because the only rule that has always been in the unseelie court is that all are welcome no one nothing may be turned away we are the dark dumping ground of nightmares too wicked too twisted for the light of the seelie court so it is so it has always been so it will always be though being accepted into the court doesnt mean youre accepted as one of the sidhe sholto and i both could attest to that i looked in the mirror one more time added a touch more lip pencil and that was it i put the lip pencil in the small beaded purse that matched the dress what did the queen want of me why had she insisted i come home why now i let out a long breath watching the satin across my chest rise and fall everything about me gleamed my skin my eyes my hair the deep gleam of the garnets at my throat i looked lovely even i could admit that the only thing that said i was not pure sidhe was my height i was just too short to be one of them i added a small brush to the lipstick in my small purse then had to decide whether i was going to take more makeup to use to freshen up throughout the evening or a small sleek canister of mace i chose the mace if you have a choice between extra makeup or extra weapons always take the weapons just the fact that youre debating between those two choices proves that youre going to need the weapons more chapter the sithin the faerie mounds rose out of the dying light small mountains of velvet against an orange melt of sky the moon was already high smooth and shining silver i took several deep breaths of the chill crisp air sometimes in california youd wake to a morning where the air felt like autumn youd wear pants and a light sweater before noon some leaves would fall to the ground sporadically with no pattern to it and there would be small pools of dried brown leaves that on certain mornings would dance in a dry skittering dance pushed by a wind that felt like october then by noon youd need to switch to shorts and it would feel like june but this was the real thing the air was chill but not quite cold the wind that trailed at our backs smelled like dried cornfields and the dark crisp scent of dying leaves if i could have come home to october and seen only the people i wanted to see id have enjoyed it fall was my favorite time of year october my favorite month i stopped on the path and the men stopped with me barinthus looked down at me eyebrows raised galen asked whats wrong nothing i said absolutely nothing i took another deep breath of the autumn air the air never smells like this in california you always did love october barinthus said galen grinned i took you and keelin trick o treating almost every year until you got too old for it i shook my head i didnt get too old for it my own glamour just got powerful enough to hide what i was keelin and i went alone when i was fifteen you had enough glamour at fifteen to hide keelin from the sight of mortals barinthus asked i looked at him nodding yes he opened his mouth as if to speak but we were interrupted a smooth male voice said well isnt this touching the voice whirled us all around to face a spot farther down the path galen moved in front of me putting me behind the shield of his body barinthus was searching the darkness behind us for others the near darkness spread behind us empty but what was in front was enough my cousin cel stood in the middle of the path he wore his midnight hair like a long straight cloak so that it was hard to tell where hair ended and his black duster coat began he was dressed all in black except for a gleam of white shirt that shone like a star among all the blackness he wasnt alone standing to one side of him ready to move in front of him if the need arose was siobhan the captain of his guard and his favorite assassin she was small not much taller than me but id seen her pick up a volkswagen and crush someone with it her hair shone white in the dark but i knew the hair was white and silvery grey like spiderwebs her skin was a pale dull white not the shining white of cels and mine her eyes were a dull grey filmed over like the blind eyes of a dead fish she was wearing black armor her helmet tucked under one arm it was a bad sign that siobhan was in full battle armor full body armor siobhan galen said whats the occasion preparation is all in battle galen her voice matched the rest of her a dry whispering sibilance are we about to do battle galen asked cel laughed and it was the same laugh that had helped make my childhood hellish no battle tonight galen just siobhans paranoia she feared that meredith would have gained powers in her trip to the lands of the west i see that siobhans fears were groundless barinthus put his hands on my shoulders pulling me against him why are you here cel the queen sent us to bring meredith to her presence cel glided down the path tugging on the leash that went from his hand to a small figure crouched at his feet the figure had been hidden behind the sweep of cels coat and siobhans body at first i didnt realize who it was the figure unfolded from the ground to a crouch that put her head no taller than cels lower chest she was brown of skin as gran but the hair on her head was thick and fell in straight brown folds to her ankles she looked human or close to it in the near dark but i knew that in good light one would see that her skin was covered in thick soft downy hair her face was flat and featureless like something halfformed and never finished her thin delicate body held several extra arms and one extra set of legs so that she moved in a strange rocking motion clothing could hide the extra appendages but not the movement of her walk keelins father had been a durig a goblin of a very dark sense of humorthe kind of humor that could get a human killed her mother had been a brownie keelin had been chosen as my companion almost from birth it had been my fathers choice and i had never had cause to complain of it wed been best friends growing up maybe it was the brownie blood that we both carried whatever caused it there had been an instant connection between us wed been friends since the first time i looked into her brown eyes seeing keelin on the end of cels leash left me wordless there were a variety of ways to end up as cels pet one was to be punished by the queen and given to cel the other was to volunteer it had always amazed me how many of the lesser fey women would allow cel to abuse them in the most base manner possible because if they got pregnant they would be members of the court just like my gran though gran would have put an iron spike through my grandfathers heart before she let him treat her like an abused dog i stepped away from barinthus until his hands fell away and i stood alone on the path galen and barinthus stood behind me one to either side like good royal guards keelin i said what are you doing here it wasnt exactly the question i wanted to ask my voice sounded calm reasonable ordinary what i wanted to do was shoutscream cel drew her to him stroking her hair pressing her face against his chest his hand slid down her shoulder lower and lower until he cupped one of her breasts kneading it keelin turned her head so her hair hid her face from me the sun was almost down true dark only minutes away she was just a thicker shadow against cels darkness keelin keelin talk to me she wants to be part of the court cel said my pleasure in her makes her part of all the festivities he pulled her closer into his body his hand sliding out of sight down the round neck of her dress if she gets with child she will be a princess and her babe heir to the throne her child could push you back to fourth from the throne instead of third he said voice smooth and even as he reached farther and farther down her body i took a step forward hand half reaching keelin merry she said turning to face me for a moment her voice the same small sweet sound it had always been no no my pet cel said dont speak i will speak for us keelin fell silent hiding her face again i stood there and until barinthus touched my shoulder and made me jump i didnt realize my hands were in tight fists i was shaking again but not from fear from anger the queen put a geas on us all not to tell you merry i should have warned you anyway galen said moving up on the other side it was almost as if the two of them expected to have to grab me and keep me from doing something foolish but i wasnt going to be foolishthats what cel wanted hed come here to show off keelin to enrage me with siobhan at his back to kill me im sure he could have concocted some story about me attacking him and his guard having to defend him the queen had believed thinner stories than that over the years he had every reason to be confident where the queen was concerned i could be calm because i could do nothing here and now but die cel i might have considered taking on he was one of the few people that i would use the hand of flesh on and not lose sleep over it but siobhan she was different she would kill me how long has keelin been with him i asked cel started to answer and i raised a hand no dont speak cousin i asked the question of galen cel smiled at me a flash of white in the moonlit dark strangely he stayed silent i hadnt really expected him to but i also knew that if i had to hear his voice one more time i was going to start screaming just to drown out his voice answer me galen almost since you left my chest was tight eyes hot this was my punishment my punishment for escaping the court even though i hadnt told keelin that i was leaving even though she was innocent theyd hurt her to hurt me cel had kept her as a pet for nearly three years waiting for me to come home enjoying himself no doubt and if there was a child all the better but it wasnt a desire for children that had motivated the choice of keelin i looked into cels smug face and even by moonlight i could read his expression shed been chosen out of revenge to punish me and id been thousands of miles away unknowing cel and my aunt had waited patiently to show me their surprise three years of keelins torment and no one told me my aunt knew me better than id thought because the knowledge that keelin had suffered the entire time id been gone would eat at me and if she held out keelins freedom to me as a prize for whatever it was she wanted from me she might have me i needed to speak with keelin alone as much as i hated cel this was one of the very few ways that keelin could enter the court shed been one of my ladies in waitingmy companion but being my friend and my servant had allowed her to see the inner workings of the court id known she had a great hunger to be accepted in that darkling throng hunger enough maybe to endure cel and resent if i put a stop to it just because i saw it as a rescue didnt mean keelin would until i knew exactly how she felt i could do nothing cels hand finally slid back into sight seeing his pale hand on keelins shoulder instead of deep in her dress made it easier to just stand and watch the queen has sent me to escort my fair cousin to her private chambers the two of you have an appointment at the throne room i am aware of what i am expected to do barinthus said how can we trust you not to harm her galen asked me harm my fair cousin cel laughed again we shall not leave barinthuss voice was very low and steady you had to know his voice well to hear the anger in it you fear that i will harm her too barinthus no barinthus said i am afraid she will harm you prince cel the life of her only heir means a great deal to our queen cel laughed loud and long he laughed until either tears actually crept from his eyes or he merely pretended to wipe them away you mean barinthus that youre afraid she will try to harm me and i will put her in her place barinthus leaned over me and whispered you cannot afford to appear weak before cel i did not expect him to meet us it is a bold move if you have gained power in the lands to the west show it now meredith i turned staring up into his face he was so close to me that his hair trailed against my cheek smelling of the ocean and something herbal and clean i whispered back to him if i show him my powers now it will take away all element of surprise later on his voice was the soft murmur of water over round stones he was using his own power to quietly make sure that cel could not overhear us if cel insists that we leave and we refuse it will go badly for us since when has the queens guard answered to her son i asked since the queen has decreed it so cel called to us i order you barinthus and you galen to go to your overdue appointment we will escort my cousin to the queens presence make him afraid of you meredith barinthus said make him wish for us to remain cel would have access to his mothers ring i stared up at him i didnt bother to ask if barinthus really thought that cel had tried to kill me in the car if he didnt believe it possible he wouldnt have said it i gave you both a direct order cel said his voice rose riding on the growing wind the wind picked up rushing through the mens long coats whispering in the dried leaves of the trees at the edge of the field to our left i turned to those whispering trees i could almost understand the wind and the trees almost hear the trees sighing of winters coming and the long cold wait ahead the wind rushed and hurried sending a small herd of newly fallen leaves skittering down the rock path past cel and his women to brush up against my feet and legs the wind picked the leaves up in a swirl like tiny hands playing against my legs the leaves were carried up and past us in a sudden burst of sweet autumn wind i closed my eyes and breathed in that wind i stepped away from the men at my back a few steps closer to cel but it wasnt him i was moving toward it was the call of the land the land was happy that i was back and in a way that it had never done before the power in that land welcomed me i spread my arms to either side and opened myself to the night i felt the wind blow not against my body but through it as if i were the trees above not an obstacle to the wind but part of it i felt the movement of the night the rushing hurrying pulse of it all underneath my feet the ground went down and down below me to unimaginable depths and i could feel them all and for a moment i felt the world turning under my feet i felt that slow ponderous swing around the sun i stood with my feet planted solidly like the roots of a tree going down and down to cool living earth but that was all that was solid about me the wind swept through me as if i were not there and i knew i could have wrapped the night around me and walked invisible among the mortals but it wasnt mortals i was dealing with i opened my eyes with a smile the anger the confusion it was all gone washed away in the wind that smelled like dried leaves and somehow spicy as if i could smell things on the wind that were only half remembered or half dreamed it was a wild night and there was wild magic to be had from it if you could ken to it earth magic can be ripped from the world by someone powerful enough to do it but the earth is a stubborn thing and resents being used you always pay for force against the elements but on some nights or even days the earth offers herself up like a woman willing her lover to come to her arms i accepted her invitation i left my barriers down and felt the wind blow little bits of me like dust upon the night but for every bit that left more was pouring in i gave of myself to the night and the right filled me the earth beneath my feet embraced me sliding up through the soles of my feet up up like a tree is fed deep and quiet and cool for a moment i wasnt sure if i wanted to move my feet enough to walk afraid to break that contact the wind swirled around me chasing my hair across my face bringing the scent of burned leaves and i laughed i walked down the stone path and with each slap of my heels the earth moved with me i moved through the night as if i were swimming swimming on currents of power i walked toward my cousin smiling siobhan stepped in front of him her cobweb hair vanished under the unrelieved black of her helmet only her white hands showed like ghosts floating in the dark she could injure or kill with a touch of that pallid skin barinthus came up behind me i knew without seeing that he reached for mei could feel him moving through the power at my back i could almost see him standing there as if i had other eyes all the magic id ever possessed had been very personal this was not personal i felt how tiny i was how vast the world but it wasnt a lonely feeling i felt for that moment embraced whole wanted barinthuss hand fell back without touching me his voice hissed and slurred like water over sand if id known you could do this i would not have feared for you i laughed and the sound was joyous free i opened further like a door thrown wide open no as if the door the wall it sat on and the house it was held inside of melted into the power barinthus caught his breath sharply by the earths grace what have you done merry he never used my nickname sharing i whispered galen came up to us and the power opened to him without any thought from me the three of us stood there filled with the night it was a generous power a laughing welcoming presence the power moved outward from me or maybe i moved forward through something that was always there but tonight i could sense it siobhan moved forward and the power did not fill her the power rejected her siobhans magic was an insult to the earth and that slow cycle of life because siobhan stole that life rushed death to the door of someone or something before their time for the first time i understood that somehow siobhan stood outside the cyclethat she was a thing of death that still moved as if it lived but the earth did not know her the power would have welcomed cel but he thought that first brush was my doing and he guarded himself against it i felt his shields crash into place holding him behind the metaphysical walls safe and unable to share in the bounty offered but keelin did not close herself away from it perhaps she didnt have shields enough to build her walls or perhaps she didnt wish to but i felt her in the power felt her open to it and heard her voice spill out in a sigh that mingled with the wind keelin walked to the end of her leash raising each of her four arms wide to the welcoming night cel jerked her back by the leather leash she stumbled and i felt her spirit crumble i reached a hand toward her and the power though it wasnt mine to control spilled outward surrounded keelin it pushed at cel like water pushes at a rock in the center of a stream something to go around to ignore the push made him stumble back the leash fell from his hand his pale face raised to the rising moon and stark terror showed on that handsome face the sight pleased me and it was a petty pleasure the generous run of power flexed around me like a mothers hand tugging on the arm of a naughty child there was no place for pettiness in the midst of such life keelin stood in the center of the path arms wide head thrown back so that the moonlight shone full upon her halfformed face it was a rare and treasured moment for keelin to show her face clearly in any light siobhan came for me in a dark flash of white hands and the dark gleam of armor i reacted without thought pushing my hand forward as if that great sluggish power would respond to my gesture but it did siobhan stopped as if shed come against a wall her white hands glowed with a pale flame that was not flame at all her power flared against something that not even i could see but i felt her coldness trying to eat the warm moving night and she had no power here if she had been among the truly living if her touch had brought ordinary death the earth would not have stopped her the power was more neutral than that it loved me in a way welcomed me back but it would welcome my decaying body to its warm wormfilled embrace just as readily it would take my spirit on the wind and send it elsewhere but siobhans magic was not natural and she could not pass understanding even that much mightmight give me the key to her destruction but it was going to take someone more adept at offensive spells than i to unravel the key there was movement beyond our little group cel and siobhan turned to see this latest threat and when they saw it was doyle their bodies didnt relax the prince and heir to the dark throne and his personal guard were afraid of the queens darkness that was interesting three years ago cel had not feared doyle he had feared no one except his mother even there he did not fear death because he was all she had to pass her blood along her only child her only heir no one challenged cel to a duel ever because you dared not win and to lose might mean your own death hed passed through the last three centuries untouched unchallenged unafraid until now now i saw almost felt cels unease he was afraid why doyle was dressed in a black hooded cape that swept around his ankles and hid all of him his face was so dark that the whites of his eyes seemed to float in the black circle of his hood what goes on here prince cel cel moved off the path so he could keep doyle and the rest of us in sight siobhan moved with him keelin remained on the path but the power was folding away as if the power moved on the wind and was sweeping past us to travel elsewhere it gave a last cool spiceladen caress and slipped away i was suddenly solid once more inside my own skin there was a price for all magic but not this it had offered itself to me i had not asked maybe that was why i felt strong and whole instead of exhausted keelin came down the path toward me her primary hands held out toward me she must have felt renewed as i did because she was smiling and that awful pinched fear was gone washed away in the sweet wind i took her hands in mine we kissed each other twice on both cheeks then i drew her into the circle of my arms and she hugged me across the shoulders with her upper arms around the waist with the smaller lower ones we held each other so tightly that i could feel the press of her small breasts all four of them the thought came had cel enjoyed being with someone with that many breasts an image came on the heels of the thought i squeezed my eyes tight as if i could rid myself of the image i ran my hand down her back through her thick furlike hair and realized i was already crying keelins sweet almost birdlike voice was comforting me its all right merry its all right i shook my head and pulled back so i could see her face its not all right she touched my face catching my tears on her fingers she couldnt cry some trick of genetics had left her without tear ducts you always cried my tears for me but dont cry now how can i not i glanced back at cel who was talking in low whispers to doyle siobhan was looking at me staring at me i could feel her dead gaze through the helmet she wore even if i couldnt see her eyes she would not forget that i had used magic against her and won or rather not lost she would neither forget nor forgive it but that was a problem for another night i turned back to keelin one disaster at a time please my hands went to the hardened leather collar around her neck she touched my wrists what are you doing merry taking this off of you she pulled my hands down gently no i shook my head how can you how could you dont cry again keelin said you know why i did it i only have a few more weeks just until samhain three years to the day if im not with child then i am free of him if i am with child hell have to treat me as a wife should be treated or not touch me at all she was so calm about it a terrible solid calm as if it were quite ordinary i do not understand this i said i know but youve always been of royal blood merry she reached up a free hand to touch my lips before i could protest her other hands still holding my hands i know you have been treated like a poor relation merry but you are a part of them their blood flows in your veins and they she hung her head dropping her hand from my mouth but gripped my hands all the tighter you are a member of the club merry youre inside the great house while we wait outside in the cold and the snow with our faces pressed to the glass i looked away from those tender brown eyes youre using my own metaphor against me she touched my face with her left upper hand her dominant hand i heard you use it often enough as we were growing up if i had asked would you have come with me she smiled but even by moonlight it was bitter unless you could be with me every hour of the day or night you couldnt use your glamour to protect me she shook her head i am far too hideous for human eyes you are not she stopped me this time with only a glance i am like you merry i am neither durig nor brownie what of kurag he cared for you she lowered her face it is true that among a certain type of goblin i am considered quite striking having extra limbs especially extra breasts is a mark of great beauty among them i smiled i remember the year you took me to the goblins ball they considered me plain keelin smiled but shook her head but they all tried to dance with you ugly or not she looked up gathering my gaze into hers they all wanted to touch the skin of a blooded royal princess because they knew that short of rape it was as close as they would ever get to that sweet body of yours i didnt know how to react to the bitterness in her voice its not your fault that you look as you do and i look as i do its no ones fault we are what we are through you i saw the court and all the gleaming throng i couldnt go back to kurag and his goblins after the life youd shown me i would have been content to stand behind your chair at banquets for the rest of my days but to have it suddenly gone she dropped my hands and moved back from me i could not bear to lose everything when you left she laughed the laughter was still birdlike but it was mocking now and i heard cels echo in it besides cel likes a fourbreasted woman and says hes never slept with anyone that could wrap two sets of legs around his white body keelin made a small dry sobbing sound and i knew that she was crying simply because she had no tears didnt mean she could not weep she turned and walked back toward cel i let her go she blamed me for showing her the moon when she could not have it maybe keelin was right maybe i had used her ill but i had not meant to of course not meaning to did not make it hurt less i took some very slow deep breaths of the autumn air trying not to cry again the air was still as sweet as before but some of the pleasure had gone out of it i am sorry meredith barinthus said dont be sorry for me barinthus im not the one at the end of cels leash galen touched my shoulder and started to hug me but i held him away with one arm dont please if you comfort me ill cry he gave a quick smile ill try to remember that for future reference doyle glided toward us hed pushed the cloak hood back but it was almost impossible to tell where his black hair ended and the black cloak began what i could see was that the front part of his hair had been gathered in a small bun in the center of his head leaving his exotic pointed ears bare the silver earrings gleamed in the moonlight hed changed some of them to larger hoops so that they brushed together as he moved making a small chiming music when he was standing in front of us i could see that he had hoops graced by feathers so long they brushed his shoulders barinthus galen i believe our prince gave you orders barinthus moved forward to stand towering over the smaller man if doyle was intimidated by the others sheer physical presence it didnt show prince cel said he would escort meredith to the queen i thought that unwise doyle nodded i will escort meredith to the queen he looked past barinthus to me it was hard to tell in the dark but i think he gave that small small smile of his i believe that our royal prince has had quite enough of his cousin for one meeting i did not know you could call the earth i did not call it it offered itself to me i said i heard him draw a long breath and let it out ah that is different in some ways not as powerful as those who can wrest the earth from her course in some ways more unsettling because the land welcomed you home it acknowledges you interesting he turned back to barinthus i believe you are wanted elsewhere both of you his voice was very quiet but underneath the ordinary words was something dark and threatening doyle had always been able to control his men with his voice inflicting the mildest words with the most ominous threats do i have your word that she will come to no harm barinthus asked galen moved up beside barinthus he touched the taller mans arm asking such a thing was almost the same as questioning orders that could get you flayed alive barinthus galen said i give you my word that she will arrive in the queens presence unharmed that is not what i asked barinthus said doyle stepped close enough to barinthus that his cloak mingled with the taller mans coat have a care sea god that you do not ask more than you should which means that you fear for her safety at the queens hand as do i barinthus said voice neutral doyle raised a hand that was outlined with green fire i was walking toward them before i had time to think of anything good to say when i got there barinthus kept his attention on doyle and that burning hand but doyle watched me stride toward them galen stood near them obviously unsure what to do he started to reach for me to stop me i think stand aside galen i dont plan to do anything foolish he hesitated then stepped back and left me to face the other two men the fire on doyles hand painted them both with greenishyellow light shadows doyles eyes didnt so much reflect the fire as seem to burn in sympathy with it this close i could feel not just his power like a march of insects down my skin but the slow rise of barinthuss power like the sea pulling toward the shore i shook my head stop it both of you what did you say doyle asked i pushed barinthus back hard enough for him to stumble maybe i couldnt lift small cars and beat people to death with them but i could put my fist through a car door all the way through and not break my hand i pushed him again and again until there was enough distance that i wasnt afraid they were about to come to blows you have been ordered once by the royal heir and once by the captain of your guard obey your orders and go doyle has given you his word that i will come to the queen in safety barinthus looked at me his face was neutral but his eyes were not doyle had always been one of the obstacles between the queen and an untimely death for a moment i wondered if barinthus was looking for an excuse to try the queens darkness if so i wasnt going to give it to him to kill doyle would be the beginning of a revolution i stared into barinthuss face and tried to understand what he was thinking had it been the lands welcome to me or was there some new tension between the two men that i had not been told about it didnt matter no i said i kept our gazes locked and said again no barinthus looked past me to set those eyes on doyle doyle turned his free hand so that it came together with the burning one to form a single wick of both hands i stepped between him and barinthus stop the theatrics doyle im coming i could feel the two of them watching each other like a weight pressing in the air thered always been tension between them but not like this i walked to doyle until the colored fire cast sickly shadows on my face and clothes i stood close enough that i could feel that the fire gave nothing no heat no life nothing but it was not illusion id seen what doyles fire could do as with siobhans hands it could kill i had to do something to break the tension between them id seen too many duels start over less too much blood too much death over such stupid things i touched each of doyles elbows and moved my hands slowly up his forearms seeing keelin has taken some of the heart from me as andais knew it would so take me to her my hands slid slowly up his arms and i realized that his black skin was bare he was wearing short sleeves under that long cloak the land welcomes you little one and you grow bold doyle said that wasnt bold doyle my hands were almost at his wrists almost inside the sickly flames there was no heat to warn me off only my own memories of watching a man writhe and die covered in crawling green flame this is bold i did two things simultaneously i brought my hands sliding upward into where the flame was and blew a breath out like blowing out a candle the flames vanished as if id snuffed them out which i had not doyle had killed them a fraction of a heartbeat before my skin touched them i was close enough that by moonlight i could see he was shaken frightened at what id almost done you are mad you gave your word i would reach the queen unharmed you always keep your word doyle you trusted me to not harm you i trusted your sense of honor yes he glanced back at cel and siobhan keelin had joined them again cel was staring at us there was a look on his face that said he almost believed id done exactly what it looked like id doneblown out doyles flame i kept one hand on doyles wrist and blew my cousin a kiss with my free hand he actually jumped as if that windblown kiss had struck him keelin had cuddled close to him and was staring back at me with what i knew now were not entirely friendly eyes siobhan stepped in front of them and this time she drew her sword in a shining line of cold steel i knew the handle was carved bone and the armor was bronze but for killing we used steel or iron she had a bronze short sword at her side but shed drawn the steel blade that rested against her back for defense shed have drawn the bronze but she had drawn steel she drew to kill nice to know she was being honest doyle grabbed me by both arms and turned me to face him i do not want to fight siobhan tonight because you have frightened your cousin his fingers dug into my skin and i knew id be bruised but i laughed and it had a bitter edge that reminded me of someonesomeone with tearless brown eyes dont forget ive frightened siobhan too thats much more impressive than frightening cel he shook me once hard and more dangerous he let me go so suddenly i stumbled nearly falling only his hand on my elbow saved me from a fall he looked behind me barinthus galen go now there was real anger in his voice and he rarely let such raw emotion show through i was unsettling everyone and a small dark part of me was pleased doyle kept his grip on my arm and began leading me up the path i didnt look back to see barinthus and galen going or to give siobhan another worry it wasnt caution i didnt want to see keelin holding cel in her arms again i stumbled and doyle had to catch me again youre going too fast for the shoes im wearing i said truthfully it was the ankle holster combined with the long hem but id blame it on the shoes if i could i was walking beside the person whod take the gun away if he found it he slowed you should have worn something more sensible ive seen the queen force sidhe to strip and go naked to the banquet when she didnt like their clothes so forgive me but i want her to like the outfit i knew i couldnt break his grip on my elbow without an actual fight even then i might lose i tried reason give me your arm doyle escort me like a princess not a prisoner he slowed further looking at me out of the corners of his eyes are you quite through with your own theatrics princess meredith quite through i said he stopped and offered me his arm i slipped my arm under and over his to rest my hand lightly on his wrist i could feel the small hairs on his arm under my fingers a little cold for short sleeves isnt it i asked he glanced at me gaze traveling down my body well at least you chose well for yourself i put my free hand on top of the hand i had resting on his arm giving a sort of double hug but nothing that wasnt allowed do you like it he looked down at my hand he stopped walking and grabbed my right hand and the moment his skin touched the ring it flared to life washing us both with that electric dance whatever magic was in the ring it recognized doyle as it had recognized barinthus and galen he jerked his hand back as if it had hurt rubbing it where did you get that ring his voice sounded strained it was left in the car for me he shook his head i knew it had gone missing but i did not expect to find it on your hand he looked at me and if it had been anyone else id have said he was afraid the look vanished as i was still trying to puzzle it out his face became smooth and dark and unreadable he gave a formal bow and offered me his arm as any gentleman would i took his arm encircling it with both my hands but as my right hand rested on top of my left it didnt touch his skin i thought about touching him accidentally on purpose but i didnt know exactly what the ring did i didnt know what it was for and until i did it was probably not a good idea to keep invoking its magic we walked down the path arm in arm at a sedate but steady pace my heels made a sharp sound on the stones doyle paced beside me silent as a shadow only the solidness of his arm the sweep of his cloak against my body let me know he was there i knew that if i let go of his arm he could melt into the darkness that was his namesakei would never see the blow that killed me unless he wished it no unless my aunt wished it i would have liked to fill the silence with talk but doyle had never been much for small talk and tonight neither was i chapter the stone path met the main avenue which was wide enough for a cart and horse or a small car if cars had been allowed which they were not once upon a time so i was told there had hung torches then lanterns to light the avenue modern fire laws frowned on allnight torches so now the poles that rested every eighteen feet or so held willothewisps one of the craftsfolk had fashioned wooden and glass cages for the lights the lights were palest blue ghostly white a yellow so pale it was almost another shade of white and a green leeched to a dim color barely distinguishable from the faint glow of the yellow lights it was like walking through pools of colored phantoms as we passed from one dim light to the next when jefferson had invited the fey into this country hed also offered them land of their choice theyd chosen the mounds at cahokia there are tales whispered on long winter nights about what lived in the mounds before we came what we evicted from the mounds the things that lived inside the land were chased away or destroyed but magic is a hardier thing there was a feel to the place as you walked down the avenue with the great hulking mounds to either side the largest mound in the city proper was at the end of the avenue i went to washington d c during college and when i came home it was almost unnerving how forcibly the mound city reminded me of being in washington standing on the plaza surrounded by those monuments to american glory now walking down the center and only street i had the sense of great time passing this place had once been a great city as washington was now a center of culture and power and now it lay quiet cleansed of its original inhabitants the humans had thought the mounds were empty when they offered them up to us just bones and some pots buried here and there but the magic had still been there deep and slumbering it had fought and then embraced the fey the conquering or winning over of that alien magic had been one of the last times the two courts worked together against a common foe of course the very last time had been world war ii hitler had at first embraced the fey of europe hed wanted to add them to the genetic mix of his master race then hed met a few of the less human members of the fey among ourselves there is a class structure as rigid and unbreakable as it is foolish the seelie court especially looks down on those who do not look like blood hitler mistook this arrogance for lack of caring but it was like a family with siblings among themselves they could fight and beat each other bloody but let anyone turn on one of them and they became a united force against the common enemy hitler used the wizards hed gathered to trap and destroy the lesser fey his fey allies didnt desert him they turned on him without warning humans would have felt the need to distance themselves from him to warn him of their change of heart or maybe that was an american ideal it certainly wasnt a fey ideal the allies found hitler and all the wizards hanging up by their feet in his underground bunker they never found his mistress eva braun every once in a while the tabloids say that hitlers grandson has been found none of my direct relatives were involved in hitlers death so i dont know for sure but i suspect strongly that something simply ate her my father had gotten two silver stars in the war hed been a spy i never remembered being particularly proud of the medals mainly because my father never seemed to care about them but when he died he left them to me in their satinlined box id carried them around in a carved wooden box along with the rest of my childhood treasures colored bird feathers rocks that sparkled in the sun the tiny plastic ballerinas that had graced my sixthbirthday cake a dried bit of lavender a toy cat with fake jewel eyes and two silver stars given to my dead father now the medals were back in their satin box in a drawer in my dresser the rest of my treasures were scattered to the winds your thoughts are far away meredith doyle said i was still walking at his side hands on his arm but for a moment only my body had been there it startled me to realize how far away id been im sorry doyle were you speaking to me i shook my head what were you thinking about so very hard he asked the lights played over his face painting colored shadows against his black skin it was almost as if his skin reflected the lights like carved and polished wood i was touching his arm so i could feel the warmth the muscles underneath the softness of his skin his skin felt like anyones skin but light didnt reflect off skin not like that i was thinking about my father i said what of him doyle turned his head to look at me as we walked the long feathers brushed his neck mingling with the spill of black hair that was only partially trapped down the back of the cloak i realized that except for the small knot that captured the front pieces of his hair the rest of his hair was spilling out underneath the cloak loose i was thinking about his medals that he won in world war ii he kept walking but turned his face full to me never missing a step he looked bemused why would you be thinking of that now i shook my head i dont know thinking about faded glory i guess the mounds remind me of the plaza in washington d c all that energy and purpose it must have been like that here once doyle looked up at the mounds and now it is quiet almost deserted i smiled i know better than that theres hundreds thousands under our feet but yet the comparison of the two cities saddens you why i looked up at him and he looked down at me we were standing in a pool of yellow light but there were pinpricks of every color of willothewisp in his eyes swirling like a tiny cloud of colored fireflies except the colors in his eyes were rich and pure not ghostly and there were reds and purples and colors that shone nowhere near us i closed my eyes suddenly dizzy and nauseated i answered with my eyes still shut sad to think that washington may someday be a tired ruin sad to know that the glory days passed this place by long before we arrived i opened my eyes and looked up at him his eyes were just black mirrors once more sad to think that the feys glory days are passed and us being here in this place is proof of that would you prefer that we be out among the humans working with them mating with them like the fey that stayed behind in europe they are no longer fey just another minority am i just a part of the minority doyle a look passed over his face some serious thought that i couldnt read id never been around a man whose face reflected so many emotions and yet been able to read so few of them you are meredith princess of flesh and as sidhe as i am that i will stake my oath on i take that as a great compliment coming from you doyle i know how much store you set by your oath his head cocked to one side studying me the movement pulled some of his hair farther out of his cloak to fold under but not fall free as he straightened his neck i have felt your power princess i cannot deny it ive never seen your hair when it wasnt braided or tied in a club ive never seen it loose i said do you like it i hadnt expected him to ask my opinion id never heard him ask anyones opinion of anything i think so but id need to see the hair without the cloak to be sure easily done he said and undid the cloak at his neck he let the cloak slide off his shoulders spilling it over one arm he was wearing what looked like a leatherandmetal harness from the waist up though if it had been meant to be armor it would have covered more the colored lights played over the muscles in his body as if he were indeed carved of some black marble his waist and hips were slender long legs encased in leather the pants clung to him and spilled into black boots that came up over his knees where the loose tops of the leather were held in place by straps with small silver buckles the buckles were echoed in the straps that covered his upper body the silver glittered against the blackness of him his hair hung like a second black cloak boiling in the wind tangling in long strands around his ankles and calves the wind sent the feathers that edged his face across his mouth my look what youre not wearing i said trying for flippant and failing the wind rushed past us flinging my hair back from my face it rustled the tall dried grass in the near field and beyond that i could hear the cornstalks whispering to each other the wind blew down the avenue channeled between the mounds so that it swirled around us like eager hands it was an echo of that welcoming earth magic that had greeted me when i first stepped on sidhe land tonight do you like my hair unbound princess what i said you said you needed to see it without the cloak do you like it i nodded wordlessly oh yes i liked it doyle stared at me and all i could see were his eyes the rest of his face was lost to the wind and the feathers and the dark i shook my head and looked away thats twice youve tried to bespell me with your eyes doyle whats going on the queen wanted me to test you with my eyes she has always said they were my best feature i let my gaze linger over the strong curves of his body the wind gusted and he was suddenly caught in a cloud of his own hair black and soft with the nearbare flesh almost lost black on black my gaze rose up to meet his eyes once more if my aunt thinks that your eyes are your best feature then i shook my head and let out a breath lets just say she and i must have different criteria he laughed doyle laughed id heard him laugh in l a but not like this this was a rumbling belly laugh like a peal of thunder it was a good laugh hearty and deep it echoed off the mounds and filled the windy night with a joyous sound so why was my heart thudding in my throat until i couldnt breathe my fingertips tingled with the shock of it doyle did not laugh not like that not ever the wind died the laughter stopped but the glow of it stayed in his face making him smile wide enough to show perfect white teeth doyle slipped the cloak back over his shoulders if he had been cold in the october night without it he never showed a sign of it he left the cloak flipped back over one shoulder and offered me his bare arm he was flirting with me i frowned at him i thought we had our little talk and we were going to pretend last night never happened i have not mentioned it he said voice very bland youre flirting i said if it were galen standing here you would not hesitate the humor was fading to a dim glow that filled his eyes he was still amused with me and i didnt know why galen and i have been teasing each other ever since i hit puberty ive never seen you tease anyone doyle until last night there are wonders yet to behold tonight meredith wonders much more surprising than me with my hair loose and no shirt on a cold october evening now there was that note to his voice that so many of the old ones had a condescending tone that said i was a child and no matter how old i got to be i would still be a child compared to them a foolish child doyle had been condescending to me before it was almost comforting what could be more wondrous than the queens darkness flirting with another woman he shook his head still offering me his hand i think the queen will have news that will make anything i could say seem tame what news doyle i asked that is the queens pleasure to tell not mine then stop hinting i said it isnt like you he shook his head and a smile crept across his face no i suppose it isnt after the queen gives you her news i will explain the change in my behavior his face sobered slowly almost its usual ebony mask is that fair enough i looked at him studying his face until every vestige of humor faded away i nodded i suppose so he offered me his arm put the body away and ill take the arm i said why does it bother you so much to see me like this you were adamant that last night never happened never to be spoken of again now suddenly youre back to flirting whats changed if i said the ring upon your finger would you understand no i said he smiled gently this time almost his usual slight twitch of lips he flipped the cloak back over his shoulder so that his hand was all that showed out of that thick cloth better i nodded yes thank you now take my arm princess and allow me the pleasure of escorting you before our queen his voice was flat unemotional empty of meaning id almost have preferred to hear the thick emotion of the moment before now his words just sat there they could have meant many things or nothing at all the words without emotion to color them were almost useless do you have a tone of voice somewhere between utter emptiness and joyous condescension i asked that tiny smile quirked his lips i will try to find a middle ground between the two i slid my arms carefully around his arm the cloak bunched between our bodies thank you i said you are welcome the voice was still empty but there was the faintest hint of warmth in it doyle had said hed try to find a middle ground and he was already working on it how terribly prompt of him chapter the stone road ended abruptly in the grass the road like the paths stops short of any mound we stood at the end of the road and there was nothing but grass beyond grass trampled down by many feet but trampled down evenly so that no one way was more traveled than any other one of our old nicknames is the hidden ones we may be a tourist attraction now but old habits die hard sometimes feywatchers will camp outside the area using binoculars and see nothing for days nights if anyone was watching in the chill dark they were about to see something i didnt try to find the doorway doyle would get us inside without any effort from me the door rotated on some schedule of its own or perhaps the queens schedule whatever caused it to move sometimes the door faced the road and sometimes it did not as a teenager if i wanted to sneak out at night and come home late i could only hope that the door hadnt moved while i was out the small magic needed to search for the opening would alert the guards within and the jig as they say would be up id thought more than once as a teenager that that damned door moved on purpose doyle led me out onto the grass my heels sank in the soft earth and i was forced to walk almost tiptoe to keep the heels free of dirt the gun in its ankle holster made it a very awkward way to walk i was glad i hadnt chosen higher heels as doyle led me away from the avenue and the ghostly lights the darkness seemed thicker than it had before the lights had been dim but any light gives the darkness weight and substance i clung a little harder to doyles arm as we left the light behind us and walked into the starfilled dark doyle must have noticed because he offered do you wish a light i can conjure my own willothewisp thank you very much my eyes will adjust in a minute he shrugged and i could feel the movement as his arm raised in my grasp as you like his voice had fallen into its usual neutral tone either he was having trouble finding a middle ground for his voice or it was simply habit i was betting the latter by the time doyle stopped halfway around the mound my eyes had adjusted to the dim cold light of stars and the rising moon doyle stared at the earth his magic gave a small warm breath along my body as he concentrated on the mound i stared up at the grasscovered earth without some effort of concentration this grassy spot looked just like every other grassy spot the wind blew through the grass like fingers ruffling a box of lace the night was full of the dry rustling of autumn grass but faintly oh so faintly you could hear music on the wind not enough to recognize the tune or even be a hundred percent sure that youd heard anything but the wind but that phantom music was a hint you were standing near the entrance sort of like a spectral doorbell or a magical game of hot and cold no music meant you were cold doyle drew his arm out of my hold and passed his hand over the grass of the mound i was never sure whether the grass melted away or the door appeared over the grass and the grass was still there underneath the door in some metaphysical space however it worked a rounded doorway appeared in the side of the mound the doorway was exactly the right size to admit us both light filled the opening if needed the doorway could be big enough to have a tank driven through as if the doorway sensed how big it needed to be the light appeared brighter than i knew it was because my eyes were accustomed to the dark now the light was white but not harsh a soft white light that breathed from the doorway like a luminous fog after you my princess doyle said bowing as he said it i wanted to come back to court but looking at that glowing hill i was reminded that a hole in the ground is a hole in the ground whether it be a sithen or a grave i dont know why i suddenly thought of that particular analogy maybe it was the assassination attempt maybe it was just nerves i went through the door i stood in a huge stone hallway large enough for that tank to have driven through comfortably or for a small giant to pass without bumping his head the hallway was always large no matter how small the doorway happened to be doyle joined me and the doorway vanished behind him just another grey stone wall just as the outside of the mound hid its entrance so the inside did as well if the queen wished it the door wouldnt appear from this side at all it was very easy to go from guest to prisoner here the thought was less than comforting the white light that filled the hallway was sourceless coming from everywhere and nowhere the grey stone looked like granite which means it wasnt native to st louis if you want stone here its red or reddish tan not grey even our stone is imported from some alien shore im told once upon a time there were entire worlds under the ground meadows and orchards and a sun and moon of our very own ive seen the dying orchards and flower gardens with a few straggling blossoms but no underground moon or sun the rooms are bigger and more square than they should be and the blueprint of the interior seems to change at random sometimes with you walking through it like walking through a fun house made of stone instead of mirrors but there are no meadows or none that ive seen im more than willing to believe that the others are keeping secrets from me that wouldnt surprise me in the least but to my knowledge there are no worlds under the ground just stone and rooms doyle offered me his arm very formally i took his arm lightly out of habit mostly there was a sharp bend to the corridor i heard footsteps coming toward us doyle pulled gently on my arm i stopped and looked at him what is it i asked doyle led me back down the corridor i walked backward with him and he stopped abruptly he grabbed a handful of my dress and raised the skirt enough to bare my ankles and the gun it wasnt your heels setting you off balance on the stones princess he sounded angry with me im allowed weapons no guns inside the mound he said since when since you killed bleddyn with one we looked at each other for a frozen second then i tried to move away but his hand closed over my wrist with footsteps coming ever closer doyle jerked me off balance so that i fell against him he pinned me to his body with an arm across my back he opened his mouth to speak and the footsteps turned the corner we were left standing in full sight doyle pinning me to his body the other hand on my wrist it looked like an interrupted fight or the beginning of one the two men that stepped around the corner fanned out so that they covered as much of the corridor as possible with space to spare for fighting i looked up into doyles face and tried to put the request into one glance i begged him with my eyes not to tell about the gun and not to take it he put his mouth against my cheek and whispered you will not need it i just looked up at him will you give me your oath on that the anger tightened the muscles in his jaw thrummed down his arms i will not give my oath on the queens whim then let me keep the gun i whispered he moved to stand between me and the other guards he still had the grip on my arm all the others could see was the sweep of doyles cape whats wrong doyle one of the men asked nothing he said but he forced my other hand behind my back until he could grip both my wrists in one of his hands his hands were not that large and to get a firm grip meant my wrists were ground together bruising id have struggled more if id thought i could get away but even if i escaped doyle hed seen the gun there was nothing i could do about it so i didnt struggle but i was not happy doyle used his other arm to pick me up and lower me to the ground in a sitting position except for my wrists it was all done gently enough he knelt his cloaked back still hiding us from the other men as his hand hovered over my leg moving toward the gun i thought about kicking him being difficult but there was no point he could have crushed my wrists with no effort i might get the gun back tonight if he crushed my arms my options were over he slid the gun out of the ankle holster i sat on the floor and let him do it i stayed passive in his grip let him move my body as he wanted only my eyes werent passivei couldnt keep the anger out of them no i wanted him to see the anger he let me go and slid the gun behind his own back though the leather pants were tight enough that it couldnt have been comfortable i hoped it dug into his back until he bled he took one of my hands helping me stand then he turned with a flourish of his cape to present me to the other guards one hand holding mine as if we were about to make a grand entrance down a long marble staircase it was an odd gesture for the grey hallway and what had just happened i realized that doyle was uneasy about the gun or his choice of taking it or maybe wondering if i had other weapons he was ill at ease and he was covering a small disagreement nothing more he said a disagreement about what the voice belonged to frost doyles second in command other than the fact that they were both tall physically they were almost opposites the hair that fell in a glimmering curtain to frosts ankles was silver a shimmering metallic silver like christmas tree tinsel the skin was as white as my own the eyes were a soft grey like a winter sky before a storm his face was angular and arrogantly handsome his shoulders were a touch broader than doyles but other than that they were both very alike and very unalike he wore a silver jerkin that hit him just above the knees to meet the silver cloth of his pants tucked into silver boots the jeweled belt at his waist was silver studded with pearls and diamonds it matched the heavy necklace that graced his chest he gleamed as if hed been carved all of one great silver piece more statue than man but the sword at his side with its silverandbone hilt was real enough and if you could see one weapon thered be more because he was frost the queen called him her killing frost if hed ever had another name i did not know it he wasnt wearing any magical or bespelled weaponsfor frost it was almost the same thing as being unarmed he stared at me with those grey eyes clearly suspicious i found my voice anything to fill the silence distraction was what was needed i let go of doyles hand and took a step forward frost was vain about his appearance and his clothes frost what a bold fashion statement my voice came out strong somewhere between teasing and mockery his fingers went to the edge of the tunic before he could stop himself he frowned at me princess meredith a pleasure as always a slight change in tone made mockery of his polite words i didnt care he wasnt wondering about what doyle was hiding that was all i had wanted to accomplish what about me rhys said i turned to find my thirdfavorite guard i didnt trust him as i did barinthus or galen there was something weak about rhys a sense that he wouldnt exactly die for your honor but right up to that point you could depend on him he put his cape and the waistlength spill of white wavy hair over one arm so id have an unobstructed view of his body rhys was a full half foot under six feet short for a guard to my knowledge he was fullblooded court he just happened to be short his body was encased in a white bodysuit so tight that you knew at a glance that there was nothing under it but him there was whiteonwhite embroidery on the cloth edging the round collar and the slight flare of the long sleeves and encircling the cutout over his stomach which revealed his cobblestone abs like a woman showing off her cleavage he let the cape and his hair fall back into place he smiled his full cupidbow lips at me they matched the round boyishly handsome face and the one pale blue eye his eye was a tricircle of blue cornflower blue around the pupil sky blue then a circle of winter sky the other eye was lost forever under a furrow of scars claw marks cut across the upper right quarter of his face one single claw mark parted an inch from the rest cutting across otherwise perfect skin to cross from his upper right forehead to cut down the bridge of his nose and the lower left cheek hed told me a dozen different stories about how he lost his eye great battles giants i think i remember a dragon or two i think it was the scars that made him work so very hard on his body he was small but every inch of him was muscled i shook my head i dont know whether you look like the top of a pornographic wedding cake or a superhero you could be ab boy or abdominal man i grinned happily a thousand situps a day does wonders for your abs he said running a hand over them everyone needs a hobby i guess where is your sword doyle asked rhys looked at him the same place yours is the queen says we do not need them tonight doyle glanced at frost what of you frost rhys answered with a quick smile that made his lovely blue eye gleam the queens weaning him a weapon at a time shes decreed he has to be unarmed by the time she dresses to go to the throne room i do not think it wise to have her entire guard unarmed frost said nor i doyle said but she is the queen and we will follow her orders frosts handsome face closed down into tight lines if hed been human hed have had frown wrinkles by now but his face was unlined and always would be frosts clothes are fine for a welcome home banquet but why are you and rhys dressed so i spread my hands helplessly trying to find a phrase that wasnt an insult the queen designed my outfit personally rhys said its lovely i said he grinned just keep saying that as you meet the rest of the guard tonight my eyes widened oh please she isnt taking hormones again is she rhys nodded baby hormones and her sex drive goes into overtime he looked down at his clothes a shame to be dressed up with no place to go very punny i said he looked up at me with a genuinely unhappy face he hadnt meant the play on words to be funny his sad face made the smile fade from mine the queen is our sovereign she knows best frost said i laughed before i could stop myself the look on frosts face when he turned made me regret the laugh i saw those grey eyes unguarded for a split second and what i saw in them was pain i watched him rebuild his walls watched his eyes close down so that nothing showed again but id seen what lay beyond his careful facade his expensive clothes his fastidious attention to detailhis rigorous morality and his arrogance some of it was real but some of it was a mask to keep things locked away id never liked frost but having that one glimpse meant i couldnt dislike him anymore damn we will speak no more of this he said he turned and moved down the hallway back the way theyd come the queen awaits your presence he walked away without looking back to see if we were following rhys came up beside me he slid an arm across my shoulders and hugged me im glad youre back i leaned into him briefly thanks rhys he gave me a small shake i missed you greeneyes rhys even more than galen spoke modern english he loved slang his favorite author was dashiell hammett his favorite movie the maltese falcon with humphrey bogart rhys had a house outside the mound city he had electricity and a television set id spent quite a few weekends at his house hed introduced me to old films and when i was sixteen wed gone to a film noir festival at the tivoli in st louis hed dressed in a fedora and a trench coat hed even found me period clothes so i could hang on his arm like a femme fatale rhys had made it clear on that trip that he thought of me as more than a little sister nothing we could get killed over but enough that it was a real date after that my aunt made sure we didnt spend much time together galen and i teased each other unmercifully in a very sexual way but the queen seemed to trust galen as did i neither of us quite trusted rhys rhys offered me his arm doyle stepped up to my other side i thought he would offer his own arm so that i would be wedged between them instead he said go down the hallway and wait for us frost would have argued or even refused but not rhys you are the captain of the guard he said it was the answer of a good soldier he walked around the corner and doyle moved moving me with him a hand on my arm to watch him move far enough away not to overhear us then doyle edged us back out of sight of rhys his hand tightened on my upper arm what else are you carrying you trust me to just tell you i asked if you give me your word i will take it he said i left in danger of my life doyle i need to be able to protect myself his hand tightened and he gave a small shake it is my job to protect the court especially the queen and its my job to protect myself i said he lowered his voice even further no that is my job the job of all the guard i shook my head no you are the queens guard the kings guard protects cel there is no guard for the princess doyle i was raised very aware of that you always had your contingent of bodyguards as did your father and look how much that helped him i said he grabbed my other arm drawing me to tiptoe i want you to survive meredith take what she gives you tonight do not try to harm her or what youll kill me his hands relaxed and he set me down flatfooted on the stones give me your word that that was your only weapon and i will believe you staring up into his so sincere face i couldnt do it i couldnt lie to him not if i had to give my word about it i looked at the floor then back up at his face ferghuss balls he smiled i take it that means you have other weapons yes but i cant be here unarmed doyle i cant you will have one of us with you at all times tonightthat i can guarantee the queen has been very careful tonight doyle i may not like frost but to an extent i trust him shes made sure every guard i meet is one i either trust or like but there are twentyseven queens guardsmen another twentyseven kings guardsmen i trust maybe half a dozen of them ten at the outside the rest of them frighten me or have in the past actively hurt me i am not walking around here unarmed you know i can take them from you he said i nodded i know tell me what you have meredith well go from there i told him everything i was carrying i half expected him to insist on searching me himself but he didnt he took me at my word it made me glad i hadnt held anything back understand this meredith i am the queens bodyguard before i am yours if you try to harm her i will take action am i allowed to defend myself i asked he thought about that for a moment i i would not have you killed simply because you stayed your hand for fear of me you are mortal and our queen is not you are the more fragile of the two he licked his lips shook his head let us hope that it does not come down to a choice between the two of you i do not think that she plans you violence tonight what my dear aunt plans and what comes to pass isnt always the same thing we all know that he shook his head again perhaps he offered me his arm shall we go i took his arm lightly and he led me around the corner to the patiently waiting rhys rhys watched us walk toward him and there was a seriousness to his face that i didnt like he was thinking about something youll hurt yourself thinking that hard rhys i said he smiled lowering his eye but when his gaze came back up it was still serious what are you up to merry the question startled me i didnt try to keep the surprise off my face my only plan for the evening is to survive and not get hurt thats all his eyes narrowed i believe you but his voice sounded uncertain as if he really wasnt sure he believed me at all then he smiled and said i offered her my arm first doyle youre cutting in on my action doyle started to say something but i got there first ive got two arms rhys his smile widened to a grin he offered me his arm and i took it as i slid my hand over his sleeve i realized it was my rightthe one the ring was on but the ring didnt react to rhys it lay quiet just a pretty piece of silver rhys saw it eyes widening thats yes it is doyle said quietly but rhys began yes doyle said what i asked all in the queens good time doyle said mysteries make my head hurt i said rhys did his best bogart impression then buy a bottle of aspirin baby because the night is young i looked at him bogart never said that in a movie no rhys said in his normal voice i was adlibbing i gave his arm a little squeeze i think i missed you i know i missed you no one else at court knows what the hell film noir means i most certainly do said doyle we both looked at him it means dark film correct rhys and i looked at each other and started to laugh we walked down the hallway to the echoes of our own laughter doyle didnt join in he kept saying things like it means dark film doesnt it it made the last few yards to my aunts private chambers almost fun chapter once the double doors opened the stone changed my aunts chamber my queens chamber was formed of black stone a shiny nearly glasslike stone that looked as if it should shatter at a heavy touch you could strike it with steel and all you got were colored sparks it looked like obsidian but it was infinitely stronger frost stood as close to the door leading into the room as he could and as far away from the queen he stood very straight a shining silver figure in all that blackness but there was something about the way he held himself that said he was near the door for a reasona quick getaway maybe the bed was against the far wall though it was so covered in sheets blankets and even furs that it was hard to say whether it was a bed or merely a gigantic pile of covers there was a man in the bed a young man his hair was summer blond cut long on top and short half way down a skaters cut his body was tanned a soft gold from the summer or maybe a tanning bed one slender arm was flung outward into space hand limp he seemed deeply asleep and terribly young if he was under eighteen it was illegal in any state because my aunt was fey and the humans didnt trust us with their children the queen rose from the far side of him emerging slowly from the nest of covers and a spill of black fur that was only a little blacker than the hair that swept back from her pale face shed pulled the hair atop her head until it seemed to form a black crown except for three long curls trailing down her back the bodice of the dress looked very much like a black vinyl merry widow with two thin lines of sheer black cloth that graced her white shoulders more than covered them the skirt was full and thick spilling behind her in a short train it looked like shiny leather but moved like cloth her arms were encased in leather gloves that went the entire length of her arm her lips were red her eye makeup dark and perfect her eyes were three different shades of grey from charcoal to storm cloud to a pale winters sky the last color was a grey so pale that it looked white set in the dark makeup her eyes were extraordinary once upon a time the queen had been able to dress herself in spiderwebs darkness shadowsbits and pieces of things she governed over would form clothing at her will but now she was stuck with designer clothes and her own personal tailor it was just one more sign of how far wed fallen in power my uncle the king of the seelie court could still clothe himself in light and illusion some thought it proved the seelie court was stronger than the unseelie court anyone who thought that was careful not to say it in front of aunt andais her standing had revealed a second man though he was sidhe and not mortal it was eamon the royal consort his hair was black and fell in soft thick waves around his white face his eyes were heavylidded either from sleep or other things frost and rhys hurried to the queens side they each took a leatherclad hand they braced her at hand and elbow and lifted her over the blond man the black skirt swirled around her giving a glimpse of layers of black petticoats and a pair of black patent leather sandals that left most of her foot bare as they lifted her and set her gracefully on the floor i half expected music to begin and dancers to appear from nowhere my aunt was certainly capable of the illusion i dropped to one knee and my dress had enough give to make the gesture look graceful the material would spring back into place once i stood which was one of the reasons id chosen it the garter was pressed in outline against the material but all you could tell under the burgundy cloth was that i was wearing at least one garterthe knife didnt show i didnt bow my head yet the queen was putting on a show she wanted to be watched queen andais was a tall woman even by todays standards six feet her skin glowed like polished alabaster the perfect black line of eyebrows and the thick black of her lashes were an almost startling contrast i bowed my head at last because it was expected i kept my head bowed low so that all i could see was the floor and my own leg i heard her skirt slither across the floor her heels made sharp sounds as they passed from throw rug to stone floor why she didnt get walltowall carpet escaped me the petticoats crinkled and hissed together as she walked toward me and i knew they were crinoline scratchy and uncomfortable next to the skin finally a spill of black skirt showed on the floor at my foot her voice was a low rich contralto greetings princess meredith nicessus child of peace besabas bane my brothers child i kept my head bowed and would until told otherwise she had not called me niece though she had acknowledged our kinship it was a slight insult not to name my familial relationship to her but until she named me niece i couldnt name her my aunt greetings queen andais queen of air and darkness lover of white flesh sister of essus my father i have come from the lands to the west at your request what would you have of me ive never understood how you do that she said i kept my gaze on the floor what my queen how you can say exactly the right words with exactly the right tone of voice and still sound insincere as if you find it all terribly terribly tiresome my apologies if i offend you my queen that was as safe an answer to the charge as i could make because i did find it all terribly terribly tiresome i just hadnt meant for it to show so clearly in my voice i stayed kneeling head bowed waiting for her to tell me i could stand even twoinch heels were not meant for prolonged kneeling in this position they made it hard not to wobble if andais wished she could leave me just as i was for hours until my entire leg fell asleep except for a point of agony on the knee where nearly all my weight rested my record for kneeling had been six hours after id broken curfew when i was seventeen it would have been longer but i either fell asleep or fainted i really wasnt sure which you cut your hair she said i was starting to memorize the texture of the floor yes my queen why did you cut it having hair nearly to your ankles marks you as high court sidhe ive been passing as human i felt her lean over me her hand lifting my hair running her fingers through it so you sacrificed your hair it is much easier to care for at this length i said voice as neutral as i could make it get up niece of mine i rose slowly carefully in the high heels thank you aunt andais standing i was woefully short compared to her tall slender presence with the heels she was over a foot taller than me most of the time im not that aware that im short but my aunt tried to make me aware of it she tried to make me feel small i looked up at her and fought not to shake my head and sigh next to cel andais was my least favorite part of the unseelie court i looked up at her with calm eyes and fought very hard not to sigh out loud am i boring you she asked no aunt andais of course not my expression had not betrayed me id had years to practice the polite blank expression but andais had had centuries to perfect her study of people she couldnt truly read our minds but her awareness of the slightest change in body language breath was almost as good as true telepathy andais stared down at me a small frown forming between her perfect brows eamon take our pet and have him dress you for the banquet in the other room the royal consort pulled a purple brocade robe from the tangle of bed clothes slipping it over his body before he climbed out of the bed the sash had been tied behind the back of the robe so it no longer closed over his body his hair fell in a tangle of black waves nearly to his ankles the dark purple of the robe didnt so much hide his body as act as a frame for the pale glimpses you got as he moved across the floor he gave a small nod as he passed me i nodded back he laid a gentle kiss on andaiss cheek and walked toward the small door that led into the smaller bedroom and bathroom beyond one modern convenience that the court had adopted was indoor plumbing the blonde sat on the edge of the bed naked as well he stood stretching his body in a long tanned line of flesh his eyes flicked to me as he did it when he realized i was watching he smiled the smile was predatory lascivious aggressive the human pets always misunderstood the casual nudity of the guards the blonde stalked toward us putting a swing in his step the pun was intended it wasnt the nudity that made me uncomfortable it was the look in his eyes i take it hes new i said andais watched the man with cool eyes he had to be very new not to realize what that look meant she was not happy with him not happy at all tell him what you think of his display niece her voice was very quiet but there was an undertone to it that you could almost taste on your tongue like something bitter in among the sweet i looked him over from his bare feet to his fresh haircut and every inch in between he grinned as i did it drifting closer to me as if the look were an invitation i decided to take the smile out of his step hes young hes pretty but eamon is better endowed that stopped the mortal and made him frown the smile returning to his face but uncertain now i dont believe he knows what endowed means andais said i looked at her you never did choose them for their intellect i said one does not talk to ones pet meredith you should know that by now if i want a pet ill get a dog this i motioned at the man is a little too highmaintenance for me the man was frowning looking from one to the other of us obviously not happy and also confused andais had broken one of my cardinal rules for sex no matter how careful you are you can end up pregnant thats what sex is designed to do after all so never sleep with someone whos mean or stupid and ugly is a judgment call because all three may breed true the blonde was cute but not cute enough to make up for the frowning puzzlement on his face go with eamon help him dress for the banquet andais said may i come to the ball tonight my lady he asked no she said she turned back to me as if he ceased to exist he looked at me again and there was a sullen anger there he knew id insulted him but wasnt quite sure how the look made me shiver there were people at court a lot less pretty than her new pet that id have slept with first you disapprove she said it would be presumptuous of me to approve or disapprove of the actions of my queen i said she laughed there you go again saying exactly what you should say but making it sound like an insult all the same forgive me i said and started to drop back to one knee she stopped me with a hand on my arm dont meredith dont the night will not last forever and you are staying at a hotel tonight so we havent much time she withdrew her hand without hurting me we certainly dont have time to play games do we i looked at her studied her smiling face and tried to decide if she were sincere or if it was a trap of some kind i finally said if you wish to play games my queen then i am honored to be included if there is business to be done then i am honored to be included in that as well aunt andais she laughed again oh good girl to remind me that you are my niece my blood kin you fear my mood distrust it so you remind me of your value to me very good it didnt seem to be a question so i said nothing because she was absolutely right she looked at my face but said frost he came to her head bowed my queen go to your room and change into the clothes that i had made for you to wear tonight he dropped to one knee the clothes did not fit my queen i watched the light die in her eyes leaving them as cold and empty as a white winter sky yes she said they did they were literally tailormade for you she grabbed a handful of his silver hair and jerked his face up to meet her gaze why are you not wearing them he licked his lips my queen i found the other clothing uncomfortable she put her head to one side the way a crow looks at a hanging mans eyes before it plucks them out uncomfortable uncomfortable do you hear that meredith he found the clothes i had made for him uncomfortable she pulled his head backward until his neck was a long exposed line of flesh i could see the pulse in his neck jump against his skin i heard you aunt andais i said and this time my voice was as neutral as i could make it bland and empty as a new penny someone was about to get hurt and i didnt want it to be me frost was a fool id have worn the clothes what do you think we should do with our disobedient frost she asked have him go to his room and change into the clothes i said she pulled his head back until his spine bowed and i knew she could snap his neck with just a little more pressure that is hardly punishment enough niece he disobeyed a direct order of mine that is not allowed i tried to think of something andais would find amusing but wouldnt actually be painful for frost my mind went blank id never been good at this particular game then i had an idea you said we wouldnt be playing any more games tonight aunt andais the night is short she released frost so abruptly that he fell to the floor on all fours he stayed kneeling head bowed silver hair hiding his face like a convenient curtain so i did andais said doyle doyle came to her side bowing his head mlady she looked at him and the look was enough he dropped to the floor onto one knee the cloak spilled out around him like black water he stayed kneeling beside frost so close their bodies nearly touched she put a hand on both their heads a light touch this time such a pretty pair dont you think yes i said yes what she said yes they are a pretty pair aunt andais i said she nodded as if pleased i charge you doyle to take frost to his room and see that he puts on the clothes i had made for him bring him to the banquet in those clothes or deliver him over to ezekial for torture as mlady wishes so shall it be done doyle said he stood drawing frost to his feet a hand on the taller mans arm they both began to back toward the door heads bowed doyle flashed me a look as they moved away he might have been apologizing for leaving me with her without him or warning against something i couldnt decipher the look but he left the room with my gun still in his waistband id have liked to have had the gun rhys moved so hed be by the door like a good guard andais watched him move the way cats watch birds but what she said was mild enough wait outside the door rhys i wish to speak with my niece in private the surprise showed on his face he glanced at me the look on his face almost asking my permission do as you are toldor do you wish to join the others in ezekials workplace rhys bowed his head no my lady i will do as i am told get out she said he left with one more quick glance for me but he closed the door behind him the room was suddenly very very quiet the sound of my aunts dress moving along the floor was loud in the stillness like the dry rustling scales of some great serpent she walked to the far end of the room where steps led to a heavy black curtain she flicked the curtain aside to reveal a heavy wooden table with a carved chair at one side and a backless stool at the other there was a chess game laid out on the round table the heavy pieces worn smooth from centuries of hands shifting them across the marble surface there were literally grooves worn in the marble board like paths worn by tramping feet against the rounded wall of the large alcove was a wooden gun case full of rifles and handguns there were two crossbows on the wall above the gun case i knew the arrows were underneath in the closed doors of the bottom of the case along with the ammunition there was a morning star like a heavy spiked ball on a chain and a mace mounted to one side of the gun case they were crossed like the crossed swords on the other side of the case a huge shield with andaiss livery of raven owl and red rose on its surface was underneath the mace and morning star eamons shield was underneath the crossed swords there were chains in the wall set for wrist and ankle on either side there were hooks above the chains where a whip lay coiled like a waiting snake a smaller whip hung above the righthand sides chains i would have called it a catoninetails but it had many more tails than that each one weighted with a small iron ball or a steel hook i see your hobbies havent changed i said i tried for neutral but my voice betrayed me sometimes when she swept back that curtain you played chess sometimes you didnt come meredith sit let us talk she sat in the highbacked chair spilling the train of her dress over one arm so it wouldnt wrinkle she motioned me to the stool sit down niece i wont bite she smiled then gave an abrupt laugh not yet anyway it was as close as i was going to get to a promise that she wouldnt hurt meyet i perched on the high backless stool the heels of my shoes through one of the spindles to help keep my balance sometimes i think andais won chess matches simply because the other persons back gave out i touched the edge of the heavy marble board my father taught me to play chess on the twin of this board i said you do not have to remind me yet again that you are my brothers daughter i mean you no harm tonight i caressed the board and glanced up at her meeting those pleasant unreliable eyes perhaps i would be less cautious if you didnt say things like i mean you no harm tonight perhaps if you simply said you meant me no harm i made it half question half statement oh no meredith to say that would be too close to lying and we do not lie not outright we may talk until you think that black is white and the moon is made of green cheese but we do not lie i said as evenly as i could so you do mean me harm just not tonight i will not harm you if you dont force it upon me i looked at her then frowning i dont understand aunt andais have you ever wondered why i made my beautiful men celibate the question was so unexpected that i simply stared at her for a second or two i finally closed my mouth and found my voice yes aunt i have wondered actually it had been the great debate for centuries why had she done it for centuries the men of our court spread their seed far and wide there were many halfbreeds but fewer and fewer fullblooded fey so i forced them to conserve their energies i looked at her then why not allow them access to the women of the high court she settled back against her chair leatherclad hands caressing the carved arms because i wanted my bloodline to continue not theirs there was a time when i would have preferred you dead than risk you inheriting my throne i met her pale eyes yes aunt andais yes what yes i knew i saw the mongrels taking over the entire court the humans had chased us underground and now their very blood was corrupting our court we were being outbred by them it is my understanding aunt that humans have always outbred us something to do with the fact that theyre mortal essus told me that you were his daughter that he loved you he also told me that you would make a fine queen someday i laughed at him she watched my face i am not laughing now niece i blinked at her i dont understand aunt you have essuss blood in your veins the blood of my family i would rather have some of my blood continue than none of it i want our bloodline to continue meredith im not sure what you mean by ours aunt though i had a frightening feeling that i did ours ours meredith yours mine cels the addition of my cousin in the mix made my stomach clench tight it was not unknown among the fey to marry close relatives if that was what she had in mind i was in very deep trouble sex was not a fate worse than death sex with my cousin cel just might be i looked down at the chess pieces because i didnt trust myself to guard my expression i would not sleep with cel i want our bloodline to continue meredith at any cost i finally looked up face blank what would that cost be aunt andais nothing so unpleasant as you seem to be thinking really meredith i am not your enemy if i may be so bold my aunt neither are you my friend she nodded that is very true you mean nothing to me but a vessel to continue our line with i couldnt keep the smile off my face was that funny she asked no aunt andais it was most certainly not funny fine let me speak plainly i gave you the ring on your finger from my own hand i stared at her her face seemed innocent of evil intent she really didnt seem to know anything about the assassination attempt in the car the gift is most appreciated i said but even to me the words sounded less than sincere either she didnt hear it or she ignored it galen and barinthus told me the ring lives once more upon your hand i am more pleased by that than you can know meredith why i asked because if the ring had remained quiet on your hand it would mean you were barren that the ring lives is a sign that you are fruitful why does it react to everyone that i touch who else has it reacted to besides galen and barinthus she asked doyle frost not rhys she asked i shook my head no did you touch the silver to his bare skin i started to say yes then thought about it i dont think so i think i touched only his clothing it must be bare skin andais said even a small piece of cloth may stop it she leaned forward placing her hands on the tabletop picking up a captured rook turning it in her gloved hands if it had been anyone else id have said she was nervous i am going to rescind my geas of celibacy for my guard my lady i said voice soft with the breath id taken that is wonderful news i had better adjectives but i stopped with wonderful it was never good to appear too pleased in front of the queen though in my head i wondered why she was telling me first the geas will be lifted for you and you alone meredith she concentrated on the chess piece not meeting my eyes excuse me my lady i didnt even try to keep the shock off my face she looked up i want our bloodline to continue meredith the ring reacts to the guards that are still able to father children if the ring remains quiet then do not bother with them but if the ring reacts then you may sleep with them i want you to pick several of the guard to sleep with i dont really care who but within three years i want a child from you a child of the blood she set the chess piece down with a thick scraping sound and met my eyes i licked my lips and tried to think of a polite way to ask questions this is a most generous offer my queen but when you say several what exactly do you mean i mean that you should pick more than two three or more at a time i stayed quiet for a few seconds because again i was left with needing information and not wanting to be rude three at a time in what way my lady she frowned at me oh danus titties just ask your questions meredith fine i said when you say three or more at one time do you mean literally in the bed with me at one time or just like dating three of them at the same time any way you wish to interpret it she said take them into your bed one at a time or all together as long as you take them why must it be three or more at once is it such an awful prospect to choose among some of the most beautiful men in the world to bear a child to one of them and continue our line how is this so terrible i looked at her trying to read that beautiful face and failing i approve of letting the men out of their celibacy but auntie dearest do not make me their only avenue i beg you they will fall upon each other like starving wolves not because i am such a prize but because anyone is better than no one that is why i am insisting that you sleep with more than one at a time you must sleep with most of them before making your choice that way theyll all feel theyve had a chance otherwise you are right there will be duels until no one is left standing make them work at seducing you instead of killing each other i like sex my queen and i have no designs upon monogamy but there are some among your guard that i cant even speak a civil word to and sex is a step up from polite small talk i will make you my heir she said voice very quiet i stared at her so careful unreadable face i didnt trust what id heard could you repeat that please my queen i will make you my heir she said i stared at her and what does my cousin cel think of that whichever one of you gives me a child first that one shall inherit my throne does that not sweeten the pot i stood up too abruptly and the stool clanged to the floor i stared at her for a space of heartbeats i wasnt sure what to say because it didnt seem real may i humbly point out aunt andais that i am mortal and you are not you will surely outlive me by centuries even if i bore a child i would never see the throne i will step down she said now i knew she was toying with me it was all some game it had to be you once told my father that being queen was your entire existence that you loved being queen more than you loved anyone or anything my you do have a long memory for eavesdropped conversations you always spoke freely in front of me aunt as if i were one of your dogs you nearly drowned me when i was six now youre telling me that you would abdicate the throne for me what in the land of the blessed could have changed your mind so completely do you remember what essuss answer to me was that night she asked i shook my head no my queen essus said even if merry never takes the throne she will be more queen than cel will ever be a king you hit him that night i said i never remembered why andais nodded that was why so youre unhappy with your son that is my business she said if i let you elevate me to coheir with cel it will become my business i had the cufflink in my purse i thought about showing it to her but i didnt andais had lived in denial of what cel was and what he was capable of for centuries you spoke against cel to the queen at your peril besides the cufflink could belong to one of the guards though i couldnt fathom why without cels urging any of the guard would want me dead what do you want meredith what do you want that i can give you that would be worth you doing what i ask she was offering me the throne barinthus would be so pleased was i pleased are you so sure that the court will accept me as queen i will announce you princess of flesh tonight they will be impressed if they believe it i said they will if i tell them to she said i looked at her studied her face she believed what she said andais overestimated herself but such absolute arrogance was typical of the sidhe come home meredith you dont belong out there among the humans as you reminded me so very often aunt i am part human three years ago you were content happy you had no plans to leave us she settled back in her chair watching me letting me stand over her i know what griffin did i met her pale gaze for a heartbeat but couldnt sustain the look it wasnt pity in her glance it was the coldness in it as if she simply wanted to see my reaction nothing more do you really think i left the court because of griffin i didnt try and keep the astonishment out of my voice she couldnt honestly believe id left the court over a broken heart the last fight the two of you had was very public i remember the fight auntie dearest but that is not why i left the court i left because i wasnt going to survive the next duel she ignored me in that moment i realized that she would never believe the worst of her son not unless forced to beyond any shadow of doubt i couldnt give her that absolute proof and without it i couldnt tell her my suspicions not without risking myself she kept talking about griffin as if he were the true reason id left but it was griffin who began that fight he the one who was demanding to know why he wasnt in your bed in your heart as before youd been chasing him around the court for nights and now he pursued you how did you effect such a quick change in him i refused him my bed i met her eyes but there was no amusement in them just a steady intensity and that was enough to make him pursue you in public like an enraged fishwife i think he truly believed that id forgive him that i would punish him for a while and then take him back that last night he finally believed that i meant what i said what did you say she asked that he would never be with me again this side of the grave andais looked at me very steadily do you still love him i shook my head no but you still have feelings for him it was not a question i shook my head feelings yes but nothing good if you still want griffin you may have him for another year if at that time you are not with child i would ask that you choose someone else i dont want griffin not anymore i hear a regret in your voice meredith are you sure that he is not what you want i sighed and leaned my hands against the tabletop staring down at them i felt hunched and tired id tried very hard not to think about griff and the fact that id see him tonight if he could feel for me what i felt for him if he could truly be as in love with me as i was with him then i would want him but he cant he cant be other than what he is and neither can i i looked at her across the small table you may include him in the contest to win your heart or you may exclude him from the running it is your decision i nodded and stood up straight no hunching like some kind of wounded rabbit thank you for that auntie dearest why does that fall from your lips like the vilest of insults i mean no insult she waved me to silence do not bother meredith there is little affection lost between us we both know that she looked me up and down your clothing is acceptable though not what i would have chosen i smiled but it wasnt a happy smile if id known i was going to be named heir tonight id have worn the tommy hilfiger original she laughed and stood with a swish of skirts you can purchase an entire new wardrobe if you like or you can have the court tailors design one for you im fine as i am i said but thank you for the offer you are an independent thing meredith ive never liked that about you i know i said if doyle had told you in the western lands what i planned for you tonight would you have come willingly or would you have tried to run i stared at her youre naming me heir youre letting me date the guard its not a fate worse than death aunt andais or is there something else you havent told me about tonight pick up the stool meredith lets leave the room neat shall we she glided down the stone steps to walk toward the door in the opposite wall i picked up the stool but didnt like that she hadnt answered my question there was more to come i called after her before she got to the small door aunt andais she turned yes niece there was a faintly amused condescending look on her face if the lust charm that you placed in the car had worked and galen and i had made love would you have still killed him and me she blinked the slight smile fading from her face lust charm what are you talking about i told her she shook her head it was not my spell i held my hand up so the silver ring glinted but the spell used your ring to power itself i give you my word meredith i did not put a spell of any kind in the coach i merely left the ring in there for you to find that was all did you leave the ring or did you give it to someone to put in the coach i asked she would not meet my eyes i put it there and i knew shed lied does anyone else know that you plan to rescind the order of celibacy where im concerned she shook her head one long black curl sliding over her shoulder eamon knows but that is all and he knows how to keep his own counsel i nodded yes he does my aunt and i looked at each other from across the room and i watched the idea form in her eyes and spill across her face someone tried to assassinate you she said i nodded if galen and i had made love and you hadnt lifted the geas you could have killed me for it galens fate seems to be incidental to it all anger played across her face like candlelight inside glass you know who did it i said i do not but i do know who knew that you were going to be named coheir cel i said i had to prepare him she said yes i said he did not do this she said and for the first time there was something in her voicethe same protest youll hear in any mothers voice when defending her child i simply looked at her and kept my face blank it was the best i could do because i knew cel he would not simply give up his birthright on the whim of his mother queen or no what did cel do to anger you i asked i tell you as i told him i am not angry with him but there was too much protest to her voice for the first time tonight andais was on the defensive i liked it cel didnt believe that did he he knows what my motives are she said would you care to share those motives with me i asked she smiled and it was the first genuine smile id seen on her tonight an almost embarrassed movement of lips she wagged a gloved finger at me no my motives are my own i want you to choose someone for your bed tonight take them back to the hotel with you i dont care who but i want it to begin tonight the smile was gone she was her royal self once more unreadable selfcontained mysterious and absolutely obvious all at the same time you never have understood me aunt and what pray does that mean it means auntie dearest that if you had left off that last order i would probably have taken someone to my bed tonight but being commanded to do it makes me feel like a royal whore i dont like it she settled her skirts so the train glided behind her and walked toward me as she moved her power began to unfold flitting around the room like invisible sparks to bite along my skin the first two times i jumped then i stood there and let her power eat over my skin i was wearing steel but a few knives had never been enough for me to withstand her magic it had to be my own newfound powers that kept it from being so much worse her eyes narrowed as she came to stand in front of me with me standing on the small raised platform we were eyetoeye her magic pushed out from her like a moving wall of force i had to brace my feet as if i were standing against wind the small burning bites had turned into a constant ache like standing just inside an oven not quite touching the glowing surface but knowing that one tiny shove and your skin would burn and crisp doyle said your powers had grown but i didnt quite believe it but there you stand before me and i must accept that you are true sidhe at last she put her foot on the lowest step but never forget that i am queen here meredith not you no matter how powerful you become you will never rival me i would never presume otherwise my lady i said my voice was just a touch shaky her magic pushed at me i couldnt draw a good breath my eyes blinked as if i were looking into the sun i fought to stand and not to give ground my lady tell me what you wish me to do and i will do it i have not offered challenge in any way she came up another step and this time i did give ground i did not want her to touch me simply by standing in the face of my power you challenge me if you wish me to kneel i will kneel tell me what you want my queen and i will give it to you i did not want to get into a contest of magic with her i would lose i knew that it left me with nothing to prove make the ring have life on my finger niece i didnt know what to say to that i finally held my hand out to her do you want the ring back more than you will ever know but it is yours now niece i wish you joy of it that last sounded more like a curse than a blessing i went to the far edge of the table gripping it to steady myself against the growing pressure of her magic what do you want from me she never answered me andais made a gesture with both hands toward me and that pressure became a force that shoved me backward i was airborne for a second until my back met the wall and my head hit a heartbeat later i kept my feet through a shower of grey and white flowers on the edge of my vision when my vision cleared andais was standing in front of me with a knife in her hand she pressed the tip of it against the small hollow at the base of my throat pressed the tip of the blade until i felt it bite into my skin she put her finger against the wound and came away with a trembling drop of my blood clinging to her leatherclad finger she held her finger upside down so the drop fell quivering to the floor know this niece of mine your blood is my blood and that is the only reason i care what happens to you i do not care if you like what i have planned for you or not i need you to continue our bloodline but if you will not help do that then i do not need you she withdrew the knife very slowly drawing it back an inch or two she laid the flat of the blade against my face the point dangerously close to my eye i could taste my pulse on my tongue and id forgotten to breathe looking into her face i knew that she would kill me just like that that which is not useful to me is discarded meredith she pressed the flat of the blade into my flesh so that when i blinked the tip of the knife brushed my eyelashes you will pick someone to sleep with tonight i dont care who since you have invoked virgin right you are free to go back to los angeles but you will have to pick some of my guard to take with you so look at them tonight meredith with those emeraldgreenandgold eyes of yours those seelie eyes of yours and choose she put her face next to mine so close that she could have kissed me she whispered the last words into my mouth fuck one of them tonight meredith because if you dont tomorrow night you will entertain the court with a group of my choosing she smiled and it was the smile that touched her face when she had thought of something wicked and painful at least one that you choose must be enough my creature to spy for me against you if you go back to los angeles my voice came out the barest of whispers must i sleep with your spy yes she said the blade point moved a fraction closer so close it blurred in my vision and i fought not to blink because if i did the point would pierce my eyelid is that all right with you niece is it all right with you that i make you sleep with my spy i said the only thing i could say yes aunt andais youll choose your little harem tonight at the banquet my eyes werent fluttering they were twitching with the need to blink yes aunt andais youll sleep with someone tonight before you fly back to your western lands i widened my eyes and concentrated on her face on looking at her face the knife was a blur of steel taking up most of my right eyes vision but i could still see still see her face looming above me like a painted moon yes i whispered she drew the knife from my face and said there was that so difficult i sagged against the wall eyes shut i kept them closed because i couldnt keep the rage out of them and i didnt want andais to see it i wanted out of this room just out of this room and away from her ill call rhys to escort you to the banquet you look a bit shaken she laughed i opened my eyes blinking to clear the tears that had gathered from being forced not to blink she was walking down the steps ill send rhys to you though perhaps with the spell in the coach you might need another guard i will think on who to send to your side she was nearly to the outer door when she turned and said and who shall my spy be i shall try to pick someone beautiful someone who is good in bed so that the chore may not be too onerous i dont sleep with stupid men or meanspirited ones i said the first does not limit the field too terribly much but the last someone generous of spirit that is a tall order her smile brightenedobviously shed thought of someone he might do who i asked dont you love surprises meredith not particularly well i do i like surprises a great deal he will be my treat to you hes scrumptious in bed or was sixtyor is it ninety years ago yes i think hell do nicely i didnt bother to ask who again how can you be sure that hell spy for you once hes in los angeles she paused with her hand on the door handle because he knows me meredith he knows what im capable of both of pleasure and of pain with that she swung open the double doors and had rhys come back in the room he glanced from her to me his eyes widened just a touch but that was all his face was carefully blank as he walked to me and offered me his arm i took it gratefully it seemed to take a very long time to walk across that floor to the open door i wanted to run to it and keep running rhys patted my hand as if he felt the tension in my body i knew hed seen the small wound on my neck he could make his own guesses as to how it got there we made it to the door then out into the hallway beyond my shoulders relaxed just a touch andais called after us have fun children well see you at the banquet she closed the doors behind us with a sharp bang that made me jump rhys started to stop are you all right i clutched his arm and pulled him into a walk again get me away from here rhys just get me away from here he didnt ask questions he just led me down the hallway away from there chapter we walked back the way we had come but the hall was straight now and narrowera different hallway all together i glanced behind us and there was no double door the queens rooms were elsewhere for a moment i was safe i started to shiver and couldnt stop rhys hugged me with both his arms pressing me to his chest i sank against him arms sliding around his waist under his cloak he stroked my hair from my face your skin is cold to the touch what did she do merry he raised my head back gently so he could see my face while i clung to him talk to me he said voice soft i shook my head she offered me everything rhys everything a little sidhe could want the trouble is i dont trust it what are you talking about he asked i pulled away from him then this i touched my throat where the blood was drying i am mortal rhys just because im offered the moon doesnt mean ill survive to put it in my pocket there was a look on his face that was gentle but i was also suddenly aware of how very much older he was than i his face was still young but the look in his eye was not is that the worst of the injuries i nodded he reached out and touched the spot of blood it didnt even hurt when he touched it it really wasnt much of a wound it was so hard to explain that what was hurting didnt show on my skin the queen was living in denial about what cel was but i wasnt hed never share the throne with me one of us would have to be dead before the other sat on the throne did she threaten you rhys asked i nodded again you look totally spooked merry what did she say to you in there i stared at him and didnt want to tell him it was as if saying it out loud would make it more real but it was more than that it was the fact that if rhys knew he wouldnt be totally displeased its sort of good news bad news i said whats the good news i told him about being named coheir he hugged me tight and hard thats wonderful news merry what could possibly be bad news after that i pulled back from the hug do you really think cel will let me live long enough to displace him he was behind the attempts on my life three years ago and he didnt have nearly this good a reason for wanting me dead the smile faded from his face you bear the queens mark noweven cel would not dare kill you its death by the queens mercy if anyone harms you now she stood in there and told me that i left the court because of griffin i tried to tell her that i hadnt left because of a broken heart that id left because of the duels i shook my head she talked over me rhys like i wasnt saying anything she is in very major denial and i dont think my death would change that you mean her baby boy would never do such a thing he said exactly besides do you really think hed risk his own lilywhite neck hell have someone else do it if he canthen theyll be the ones in danger not him its our job to protect you merry were good at our job i laughed but it wasnt a good laugh more stress than humor aunt andais has changed your job description rhys what do you mean lets walk while i tell you i feel the need for more distance between myself and our queen he offered me his arm again as my lady wishes he smiled when he said it and i went to him but i slid my arm around his waist instead of taking his arm he stiffened surprised for a second then slid his arm across my shoulders we walked down the hallway arms wrapped around each other i was still cold as if some inner warmth had been extinguished there are men that i cant walk arm in arm with as if our bodies have different rhythms rhys and i moved down the hallway like two halves of a whole i realized that i simply couldnt believe that i had permission to touch him it didnt seem real to suddenly be given the keys to the kingdom rhys stopped turning me in his arms until he could rub his hands up and down my arms youre still shivering not as badly as before i said he planted a soft kiss on my forehead come on honey bun tell me what the wicked witch of the east did to you i smiled honey bun he grinned honey bear honey child snookums i laughed worse and worse his smile faded he glanced at the ring lying against the whiteness of his sleeve doyle said the ring came to life for him is that true i glanced at the heavy silver octagonal band and nodded it lies quiet against my arm i looked up into his face he looked forlorn the queen used to let the ring choose her consort he said its reacted to almost every guard ive touched tonight except me his voice was so thick with regret that i couldnt let it stand it has to touch bare skin i said he started to reach for my hand and the ring i pulled away from him please dont whats wrong merry he asked the light had faded to a dim twilight glow cobwebs draped the hallway like great shining silver curtains pale white spiders larger than my two hands together hid in the webs like round bloated ghosts because even at sixteen i was the one who said stop you should have known better a little slap and tickle and im exiled from the game forever baby that is cruel no its practical i dont want to end my life nailed to a saint andrews cross of course now that didnt apply i could tell rhys and we could do it up against a wall right this minute and there would be no penalties or so andais said but i didnt trust my aunt shed told only me that the celibacy had been lifted i only had her word that eamon knew and he was her consort her creature what if i threw rhys up against a wall and then she changed her mind it wasnt going to be real to be safe until she announced it in public then and only then would i really believe it a large white spider came to the edge of the webbing the head was at least three inches across i was going to have to pass right under the thing you see one mortal woman tortured to death for seducing a guard and you remember it for the rest of your life long memory rhys said i saw what she had her pet torturer do to the guard who transgressed rhys i think your memory is too short i stopped him pulling on his arm just short of the heavybodied spider i could call willothewisps but the spiders werent impressed by them can you call something stronger than a willothewisp i asked i stared at that waiting spider its body bigger around than my fist the spiderwebs above my head seemed suddenly heavier weighed down with the round bloated bodies like a net full of fish about to spill on my head rhys looked at me face puzzled then he looked up as if just seeing the thick webs the scurrying sense of movement you never did like the spiders no i said i never did like the spiders rhys moved toward the spider that seemed to be lying in wait for me he left me standing in the middle of the hall listening to the heavy scurrying and watching the webs waver above my head he did nothing that i could see he simply touched a finger to the spiders abdomen the spider started to scurry away then it stopped abruptly and started to shake legs spasming frantically it writhed and jerked tearing a partial hole in the webbing and it dangled helplessly half in and half out of the webbing i could hear dozens of the things running for safety in a soft clattering retreat the webs swayed like an upsidedown ocean with the rush of their flight lord and lady there had to be hundreds of them the spiders white body began to shrivel falling in upon itself as if some great hand were crushing it that fat white body turned to a black dry husk until i wouldnt have been sure what it was if i hadnt seen it alive there was no sense of movement in the spider webs now the hallway was utterly still except for rhyss smiling figure the dim dim light seemed to collect around his white curls and the white suit until he glowed against the grey cobwebs and the greyer stone he was smiling at me cheerful normal for him good enough he asked i nodded i only saw you do that once before and that was in battle but that was when your life was in danger do you mourn the insect its an arachnid not an insect and no i dont mourn it ive never had the right kind of power to walk safely through this place but id really meant for him to call fire to his hands or brighter lights and frighten them away i hadnt meant for him to he held his hand out to me still smiling i stared at the black husk swaying gently in the webbing as our movement caused tiny air currents to pass through the hallway rhyss smile didnt change but his eyes grew gentle i am a death god or was once merry what did you think i was going to do light a match and yell boo no but i stared at his offered hand i stared at it for longer than was polite but finally tentatively i reached toward him our fingertips touched and his breath came out with a sigh he gazed down at the silver band on my hand his gaze came up to meet mine merry may i please i looked into his pale blue eye why is it so important to you i wondered if the rumor had already spread about what she planned to announce tonight were all hoping she called you back to choose another wouldbe consort for yourself im assuming that if the ring doesnt recognize someone theyre out of the running thats closer than you know i said then may i he asked he tried to keep the eagerness off his face but failed i guess i couldnt blame him it was going to be like this all night once word got out no it was going to be worse much worse i nodded he began to bring my hand to his lips as he spoke you know i would never willingly hurt you merry he kissed my hand and his lips brushed the ring it quickenedthat was the only word i had for it it flared through me through us both the sensation seemed to squeeze my heart chase it into my throat like a trapped thing rhys stayed bent over my hand but i heard him breathe out an oh yes he raised up and his eye looked unfocused it was the strongest reaction yet and that sort of worried me did the strength of the reaction say something about how strong the mans virility was sort of a supernatural sperm count nothing personal to rhys but if i had to sleep with anyone tonight it was probably going to be galen the ring could pulse away to its carved little heart i would decide who shared my bed until auntie dearest sent her spy to me of course i pushed that thought awayi couldnt deal with it right now there were sidhe in her guard that id sooner kill than kiss let alone anything more rhys wrapped his fingers through mine pressing the palm of his hand against the ring the second pulse was stronger bringing an involuntary gasp from my throat it felt like things deep inside my body were being caressed things that no hand should ever touchbut power power wasnt constrained by the bounds of flesh oh i like it rhys said i pulled my hand out of his dont do that again it felt good and you know it i looked into his eager face and said she doesnt just want me to find another fiancé she wants me to have sex with several or all of the guard that this ring recognizes its a race to see who gives her an heir of the blood royal first cel or me he stared at me studying my face as if trying to read my expression i know you wouldnt make a joke of this but it seems too good to be true it made me feel better that rhys didnt trust it either exactly right now shes told me the celibacy is off for little ol me but i have no witnesses i think shes sincere but until she announces it in full court ill just pretend that sex is still taboo he nodded whats a few hours more of waiting after a thousand years i raised eyebrows at him i cant do everybody tonight rhys so its going to be more than a few hours wait as long as im first in line what does it matter he tried to make it a joke but i didnt laugh im afraid that this is exactly how everyone else is going to feel theres only one of me and what twentyseven of you do you have to sleep with all of us she didnt say so but she is going to insist on me sleeping with her spy whoever he turns out to be you hate some of the guard merry and they hate you back she cannot expect you to take them to your bed lord and lady if one that you hated got you pregnant he didnt finish the thought id be trapped into marriage with a man i despised and he would be king rhys blinked at me the white eyepatch catching the light as he moved his head i hadnt thought about that truthfully all i was seeing was the sex but youre rightone of us is going to be king i glanced up at the grey sheet of webs they were empty but should we be talking about this here with this above us he looked up at the spiderwebs good point he offered me his arm may i escort you to the banquet my lady i slid my hand over his arm with pleasure he patted my hand i hope so merry i certainly do hope so i laughed and the sound echoed strangely in the hallway making the cobwebs drift and float it was almost as if the ceiling stretched far far overhead into some vast darkness that only the spiderwebs hid from our view my laughter faded long before we stepped out from under the webs thank you rhys for understanding why im afraid instead of just concentrating on the fact that you may be about to end several hundred years of celibacy he pressed my left hand to his lips i live only to serve under you or above you or any way you want me i punched him in the shoulder stop it he grinned rhys isnt the name of any known death god i researched you in college and you werent there he was suddenly very busy staring down the evernarrowing hallway rhys is my name now merry it doesnt matter who i was before of course it matters i said why he asked and suddenly he was all serious asking a very grownup question watching him glow white and shining in the grey light i didnt feel grownup i felt tired but there was a weight to his gaze a demand in his face that i had to answer i just want to know who im dealing with rhys youve known me all your life merry then tell me i said i dont want to talk about the longago days merry what if i invited you into my bed would you tell me all your secrets then he studied my face youre teasing me i touched the scarred edge of his face tracing with my fingers from the roughened skin to pass a fingertip over the full softness of his lips no teasing rhys youre beautiful youve been a friend to me for years you protected me when i was younger it would be poor repayment if i left you celibate when i could put an end to itbesides the fact that running my mouth down that washboard stomach of yours has been a recurring sexual fantasy funny ive had the same fantasy he said he wiggled his eyebrows at me and did a miserably bad groucho marx impression maybe you can come up to my place and look at my etchings i smiled and shook my head dont you watch any movies made after color came into the cinema not often he held out his hand and i took it we walked down the hallway hand in hand and it was companionable of all the guards i liked id have thought rhys would have been the most obnoxious about the possibility of sex but hed been the perfect gentlemen proof once again that i didnt really understand men chapter the doors at the end of the hallway were small tonight man height sometimes the doors were big enough for an elephant to pass through they were a pale grey with gold edgings very louis the something i didnt bother asking rhys if the queen had redecorated the sithen like the black coach did its own redecorating rhys opened the elegant double doors but we never got to step into the room beyond because frost stopped us it wasnt that he was physically blocking the doorthough he was hed changed into the queens outfit and the sight of him in it stopped me cold i think rhys stopped moving because i did the shirt was completely seethrough to the point where i wasnt sure if the cloth was actually white or if it was clear and it was his skin that made it look white the shirt was cut like a second skin to his chest but the sleeves had a large puff of diaphanous material cut tight just above the bend of his elbow by a broad appliqué of glittering silver the rest of the sleeves fell in a long full tube like a crystal morning glory the thread that kept the shirt together was silver and gleamed at every seam the pants were silver satin cut so low around the waist that his hip bones showed through the cloth of his shirt if hed tried to wear underwear they would have shown at the waist of the pants the only thing that kept the pants up was that they were unbelievably tight a series of white strings over the groin like the ties on the back of a merry widow took the place of a zipper his hair had been divided into three sections the upper part was pulled up through a white carved piece of bone so that the silver hair fell like the water of some fountain around his head the second section of hair was simply pulled back on either side and held in place with bone barrettes the lower section hung loose and free but so little was left that it was like a thin silver veil emphasizing his body instead of hiding it frost youre almost too beautiful to be real she treats us like dolls to be dressed at her whim it was the closest thing to an overt criticism of the queen that id ever heard him say i like it frost rhys said its you he scowled at rhys it is not me id never seen the tall guard so angry about something so small its just clothes frost it wont hurt you to wear them with grace showing your displeasure in them could hurt you very much i have obeyed my queen if she knows how much you hate the clothes shell order more of the same for you you know that the scowl deepened until he managed to put lines across that perfect face then a scream came from the room behind him even wordless i recognized that voice it was galen i stepped forward frost stood his ground get out of my way frost i said the prince has ordered this punishment but has graciously allowed privacy no one may enter until it is complete i stared up at frost i couldnt fight my way past him and i wasnt going to kill him it used up my options merry is being named coheir tonight rhys said frosts eyes flicked from one to the other of us i do not believe it galen screamed again and the sound raised the flesh on my arms clenched my hands into fists i will be coheir tonight frost he shook his head that changes nothing what if she told you that our celibacy will be lifted for merry and merry alone rhys asked frost managed to look arrogant and disbelieving what if is not a game i will play with you galen gave another sharp scream the queens ravens do not scream easily i moved toward frost and he tensed i think he was expecting a fight i ran my fingers lightly over the front of his shirt he jumped as if id hurt him the queen will announce tonight that i am to have my pick of the guards shes ordered me to sleep with one of you tonight or tomorrow i will have a starring role in one of her little orgies i wrapped my arms around his waist pressing myself lightly against his body trust me frost i will have one of you tonight and tomorrow and the night after that it would be a shame if you were not among those i bedded the arrogance was gone replaced by something eager and afraid i didnt understand the fear but the eagerness that i understood he looked to rhys your oath that this is true you have it rhys said let her pass frost he stared down at me he still hadnt touched me backmy caress had been like a kiss against unresponsive lipsbut he moved out of the way sliding from the circle of my arms he watched me like youd watch a coiled rattlesnake no sudden movements and no trust that it wouldnt bite you anyway he was afraid of what was happening in that room i walked past him i felt rhys at my back but all i could see was what lay in the center of the room there was a small water garden in the center of the room with a large decorative rock in the center of it steppingstones led to the rock in which were embedded permanent chains galen was chained to the rock his body was almost lost to sight under the slowly fanning butterfly wings of the demifey they looked like true butterflies on the edge of a puddle sipping liquid wings moving slowly to the rhythm of their feeding but they werent sipping water they were drinking his blood he screamed again and it sent me rushing forward doyle was suddenly in front of me he must have been guarding the other doors you cannot stop them once they have begun to feed why is he screaming it shouldnt hurt that much i tried to get past him and he grabbed my arm no meredith no galen shrieked long and loud his body arching against the chains the movement dislodged some of the demifey and i glimpsed why he was screaming his groin was a bloody mess they were taking flesh as well as blood rhys hissed bloody beasts doyle tightened his grip on my arm theyre mutilating him i protested he will heal i tried to pull away but his fingers were like something welded to my skin doyle please i am sorry princess galen shrieked and the rock strained under the pull of his body but the chains held this is excessive and you know it the prince is within his rights to punish galen for disobeying him he tried to pull me farther away as if that would make it better no doyle if galen has to endure it i wont look away now let go of me you promise not to do anything rash my word i said he released me and when i touched his shoulder he moved to one side so my view was unobstructed the wings were every color of the rainbow and some that the rainbow could only dream ofhuge wings bigger than my hands flexing slowly in and out above brief glimpses of galens nearly nude body his pants were down around his ankles and there was no other clothing that i could see there was a terrible beauty to the scene like a very pretty slice of hell one set of wings was larger than the others like huge pale swallowtailed kites it was queen niceven herself feasting just above his groin i had an idea queen niceven i said it does not become a queen to do the dirty work of a prince she raised her small pale face and hissed at me her lips and chin red with galens blood the front of her white gown splattered with crimson i held up the hand with the ring on it i am to be named coheir tonight what is that to me her voice was like evil bells sweet and disturbing a queen deserves better than the blood of a sidhe lord she watched me with tiny pale eyes she was all leprous in her paleness like a tiny ghost what do you offer that is more tender than this not more tender but more powerful the blood of a sidhe princess for the queen of the demifey she stared at me one dainty hand wiping at the blood on her mouth she rose on huge lunamoth wings to fly toward me the others continued to feed niceven hovered in front of my face her wings making a small current of air against my skin you would take his place doyle said no princess i silenced him with a gesture i offer queen niceven of the demifey my blood the blood of a sidhe princess is too fine a prize to be shared frost and rhys moved up beside doyle they watched us as if theyd never seen such a show before niceven licked her lips with a tiny tongue like the petal of a flower you would let me take blood from you i held up a finger to her let him go and you may pierce my skin and drink prince cel petitioned that we ruin this ones manhood as doyle said it will heal why would the prince ask a favor of the demifey for something that is not permanent damage she hovered near my finger for all the world like a butterfly inspecting a flower that you have to ask prince cel she turned her gaze from my finger to my face you should have heard what he wanted us to do at first wanted us to ruin him for life but the queen does not allow her lovers to be damaged goods niceven hovered close to my face her tiny hand touching the tip of my nose prince cel reminded me that he will be king someday she touched my lips lightly with those diminutive fingers i reminded him that he does not rule here yet and that i would not risk queen andaiss anger for him what did he say to that he took the compromise we taste royal blood and flesh both precious and for tonight this one will be useless in the queens bed she frowned arms crossing over her tiny chest i do not know why he is jealous of this one and not the others it is not the queens bed he was trying to keep galen out of i said she cocked her head to one side long spiderweb hair trailing around her you i waggled the ring at her i have been ordered to sleep with a guard tonight and this one would have been your choice i nodded niceven smiled cel is jealous of you not in the way you mean queen niceven do we have a bargain my blood for your sweet mouth and galen goes free she stayed hovering near my face for a few seconds more then nodded we have a bargain extend your arm and give me a place to land free galen first then by all means feed as you like she flew back to the others and whatever she said to them scattered them ceilingward in a bright colored cloud galens pale pale green skin was covered in tiny red bites thin lines of blood began to trail across his skin like an invisible red pen trying to connect the dots unchain him and see to his wounds i said rhys and frost moved to obey me only doyle stayed nearby as if he didnt trust one of us or any of us i extended my arm outward my hand cupping slightly upward niceven landed on my forearm she was heavier than she appeared but still light and strangely brittle as if her tiny bare feet were made of dried bones she wrapped both her hands around my index finger then lowered her face toward my fingertip as if she meant to bestow a kiss tiny razor teeth bit into my finger the pain was sharp and immediate her tiny petal tongue began to lap the blood tickling against my skin she curved her body around my hand until every inch of her small being was insinuated against my skin it was a strangely sexual movement as if she gained more than mere blood from the feeding the rest of the demifey hovered in the air around me like colored wind moving gently their tiny mouths were bloodstained miniature hands red with galens blood niceven caressed my hand with her hands her bare feet a tiny knee beat against my palm she raised her head and took a breath i am full of flesh and blood from your lover i can hold no more she sat up in my hand her head resting against my finger i would give much for a longer drink someday princess meredith you taste of high magic and sex she stood and slowly lifted herself from my hand with slow beats of her wings she hovered near my face just looking at me as if she saw something i did not or was trying to find something in me that was not there finally she nodded and said we will see you at the banquet princess with that she rose higher into the air the others following her in a multicolored cloud the huge doors at the end of the room opened without anyone touching them and once the bright flying crowd had vanished inside the doors closed slowly behind them a small sound brought my attention back to the room galen was leaning up against the far wall his pants in place though not fastened rhys was dabbing at the small bites with a bottle of clear liquid until galens naked upper body gleamed in the lights he gazed up at me is it true about the celibacy being lifted its true i said and crouched on my heels by him he smiled but it left his eyes painfilled i wont be much use to you tonight there will be other nights i said the smile widened but he winced as rhys cleaned more of the wounds why did cel care if i in particular came to your bed i think cel believes that if i cannot sleep with you tonight that i will sleep alone galen looked at me i didnt wait for him to say something that would make all this even more uncomfortable i dont know if you heard what i told the others but if i dont have sex tonight with someone of my choosing tomorrow i entertain the court with a group of the queens choosing youll have to take someone to your bed tonight merry i know i touched his face and found it cool to the touch and lightly dewed with sweat hed lost a lot of blood nothing fatal for a sidhe but he would be weak tonight for many things not just for sex if this was your punishment for disobeying cel then what was barinthuss punishment he was forbidden to attend tonights banquet frost said i raised my eyebrows at that galen gets cut up and barinthus just misses supper cel is afraid of barinthus but he does not fear galen frost said im just too nice a guy yes frost said you are that was supposed to be a joke galen said unfortunately doyle said it isnt funny we cant keep the queen waiting rhys said can you walk get me on my feet and ill walk doyle and frost helped him stand he moved slowly arthritically as if things hurt a great deal but by the time theyd helped him to the far doors he was moving on his own power he was healing before our eyes his skin absorbing the bites it was like watching reverse film of flowers blooming the oil helped speed the process but mostly it was just his own body the amazing flesh machine of a sidhe warrior within hours the bites would be healed within days the rest of the damage would be gone as well in a few days galen and i could finally quench the heat between us but for tonight there would have to be someone else i looked at the other three guards in an almost proprietary way like going into your kitchen and knowing the shelves are well stocked with your favorite things none of them was a fate worse than torture it was just a question of which one how do you decide between one perfect flower and another if love is not an issue i didnt have the faintest idea maybe i could toss a coin chapter the doors that open from the fountain of pain lead to a large antechamber it is a dark room the sourceless white light seemed very dim and very grey here something crunched under my feet and i looked down to find leaves dried leaves everywhere i looked up and found that the vines that entwined above our heads were dry and lifeless the leaves had folded in upon themselves or dropped completely i touched the vines near the door and there was no sense of life to them i turned to doyle the roses are dead i whispered it as if it were some great secret he nodded they have been dying for years meredith frost said dying frost but not dead the roses were a last defense for the court if enemies penetrated this far the roses would come to life and kill them or try to either by strangling or by the thorns the newer lower growth had thorns like any other climbing rose but there were vines deep in the tangle that held thorns the size of small daggers but they werent merely a defense they were a symbol that there had once been magical gardens under the ground the fruiting vines and trees had died first so im told then the herbs and now the last of the flowers i searched the vines with my eyes for any sign of life they were dry and lifeless i sent a flash of power into the vines and felt an answering pulse of power strong still but faint nothing like the warm pressing presence it should have been i touched the nearest vines gently with my fingers the thorns were small here but dry like straight pins stop petting the roses frost said we have more pressing problems i turned to him hand still on the roses if the roses die truly die do you understand what this means most likely better than you do he said but i also understand that we can do nothing for the roses or the fact that the sidhes power is dying but if we are careful we may save ourselves this night without our magic we are not sidhe i said i pulled my hand back without looking spearing my finger on the thorns i jerked back which broke a thorn off in my skin the small dark thorn was easy to see and easy to remove with an edge of fingernail it didnt even hurt that much just a small dot of crimson on my finger how bad is it rhys asked not bad i said a thick dry hiss ran through the room like some great serpent gliding through the dark the sound came from above us and we all looked upward a shudder ran through the vines and dried leaves fell like a crumbling rain onto the floor catching in our hair our clothes whats happening i asked doyle answered i dont know then shouldnt we get to the other room rhys said his hand went for a sword that was not there but his other hand went for my arm and he pulled me toward the closest door back into the hallway none of them were armed unless doyle still had my gun and somehow i didnt think a gun was what we needed the others closed around me like a wall of flesh rhyss hand touched the door handle and vines spilled over the door like dry rushing water he jumped back pushing me away from the door and the reaching vines doyle grabbed my other arm and we were suddenly running for the far door they were moving too fast for my high heels i stumbled but their hands kept me upright and moving my feet barely touching the floor frost was ahead of us going for the doors he called back hurry rhys muttered under his breath we are i glanced back to see galen he was facing away from me guarding my back with nothing in his hands but his own skin but the thorns were not touching him there was a sense of movement everywhere like a nest of snakes but the thin dry tendrils dangled above me like an octopusreaching just for me as doyle and rhys carried me farther into the room the thorns receded behind me and fell above my head brushing my hair pulling at us when doyle turned his head to look upward i caught a scarlet flash on his face fresh blood the thorns wrapped in my hair trying to pull me away i screamed jerking my head down rhys grabbed the handful of my hair and together we pulled it free of the thorns leaving strands of hair behind frost had the far doors open there was a glimpse of brighter lights and faces turned toward us some human some not frost was yelling a sword give me a sword a guard started to move forward hand on his sword i heard a voice yell no keep your sword it was cels voice doyle barked out an order sithney give us your sword the guard at the door started to lift his sword from its sheath frost held his hand out for it the vines poured over the opening in a dry rushing wave there was a moment when frost could have dived through the door could have saved himself but he turned back into the room the door vanished behind a reaching slashing wave of thorns rhys and doyle took me to the floor doyle pushed rhys on top of me i was suddenly under a pile of bodies rhys hair spilled past my face like curly silk i had a glimpse through his hair and someones arm of a black cloak i was pressed so hard against the floor i not only couldnt move i could barely breathe if it had been anyone but doyle and frost on top id have been waiting for screams instead i waited for the pile to grow lighter as the men were dragged away by the thorns but the pile didnt grow lighter i lay flat on my stomach pressed to the cool stone floor staring out through rhyss hair the arm that was braced outside the curtain was bare of cloth and slightly less purely white so it was galen my blood had been pounding in my ears until all i could hear was the beat of my own body but minutes passed and nothing happened my pulse quieted i pressed my hands to the stones underneath me the grey stone was almost as smooth as marble worn away from centuries of passing feet i could hear rhyss breathing next to my ear the shift of cloth as someone above us moved but over all was the sound of the thorns a low continuous murmur like the sound of the sea rhys whispered against my hair may i have a kiss before i die we dont seem to be dying i said easy for you to say youre on the bottom of the pile this from galen whats happening up there i cant see a thing i said be happy you cannot frost said what is happening i asked again putting more force into my voice nothing doyles deep voice rumbled down through the pile of men as if the other bodies carried the low tone of his words like a tuning fork straight down my spine and i find that surprising he said you sound disappointed galen said not disappointed doyle said curious doyles cloak slid out of sight the weight above me was suddenly less doyle i shouted have no fear princess i am fine he said the pressure above me lightened once more but not by much it took me a few seconds to figure out that frost was raising up but not moving his body from the pile this is singular he said galens arm vanished from my sight what is it doing he asked i couldnt hear anyone walking around but i could see galen to one side kneeling i parted rhyss hair from my face like two edges of a curtain frost was kneeling beside galen doyle was the only one standing alone on the other side of us i could see his black cloak rhys raised upward bracing with his arms like half a pushup strange he said that was it i had to see get off of me rhys i want to see he lowered his head over my face so he was looking at me upside down still supporting his upper body with his arms but pinning my lower body with his under other circumstances id have said he was doing it on purpose but the material of my dress was thin enough and his clothing light enough that i could tell he wasnt happy to see me staring into his triblue eye from inches away but upside down was almost dizzying and somehow strangely intimate im the last body between you and the great bad thing he said ill move when doyle tells me to move watching his small round mouth move upside down made my head hurt i closed my eyes dont talk upside down i said of course rhys said you could just look up he drew his face back pulling back until he was on all fours above me like a mare shielding her foal i stayed flat on the ground but craned my neck backward all i could see was the snaking tendrils of the roses they hung above us like thin fuzzy brown ropes waving gently back and forth almost as if there was wind but there was no wind and the fuzziness was thorns other than the fact that the roses are alive again what am i supposed to be seeing doyle answered it is only the small thorns that are reaching for you merry and i said his black cloak came closer as he stood above us it means i dont believe the roses mean you harm what else could they want i asked it should have felt silly talking from the ground with rhys perched over me on all fours but it didnt i wanted something someone between me and the rustling of the thorns i believe i think it may want a drink of royal blood doyle said what do you mean a drink galen asked it before i could he sat back on the floor moving so i could see most of his upper body blood had dried in spots and small trails down his upper body but the bites were almost gone leaving only the blood as proof that hed been injured the front of his pants was bloodsoaked but he moved better less painfilled everything was healing i would not heal if the thorns tore into my body id simply die the roses once drank from the queen every time she passed this way doyle said that was centuries ago frost said before we ever dreamed of traveling to the lands to the west i propped myself up on my elbows i have passed under the roses a thousand times in my life and theyve never reacted to me not even when they still had a few blooms left you have come into your power meredith the land recognized that when it welcomed you tonight doyle said what do you mean the land welcomed her frost asked doyle told him rhys bent over to stare into my face again in that awkward upsidedown movement cool he said it made me smile but i pushed his head up out of my face anyway the land recognizes me as a power now not merely the land doyle said he sat down on the far side of me from galen spreading the black cloak around his body in a familiar gesture as if he wore a lot of anklelength cloaks he did i could see his face now he looked thoughtful as if contemplating some weighty philosophy this is all fascinating rhys said but we can discuss whether merry is the chosen whatever later we need to get her out of here before the roses try to eat her doyle looked at me dark face impassive without swords we have very little chance of making either door with merry alive we would survive the roses worst attentions but she would not since it is her safety that is paramount and not our own we must think of a way out of this that does not require violence if you offer the roses violence they will return the favor he waved his hand upward vaguely including the trailing vines they seem to be quite patient with us so i suggest we use their patience to think the land has never welcomed cel nor have the roses reached for him frost said he crawled around me to sit near doyle he didnt seem to trust the roses patience as much as doyle did i agreed with frost on this one i had never seen the roses move before not so much as a twitch id heard the stories but never thought to see the reality of it for myself id often wished to see the room covered in sweet fragrant roses be careful what you wish for of course there were no blooms just thorns that wasnt exactly what id wished for just because you put a crown on someones head doesnt make them fit to rule doyle said in olden days it was the magic the land that chose our queen or king if the magic rejected them if the land didnt accept them then bloodline or no bloodline a new heir had to be chosen i was suddenly very aware of all of them looking at me i looked from one to the other of them they had almost identical expressions on their faces and i was half afraid i knew what they were thinking the target on my back just kept getting bigger and bigger i am not the heir apparent the queen will make you so tonight doyle said i looked into his dark face and tried to read those ravenblack eyes what do you want of me doyle first let us see what happens when rhys opens the way for the thorns if they react violently then we will go no farther eventually the other guards will rescue us rhys asked do you want me to move now doyle nodded please i wrapped a hand around both of rhyss arms keeping him above me what happens if the roses pour over me and try tearing me limb from limb then we throw ourselves on your body and let the thorns rend us before they touch your white flesh doyles voice was bland empty of meaning but still interested it was the voice he used in public at court when he didnt want anyone to guess his motives a voice honed by centuries of answering to royals that were often not quite sane why is that less than comforting i asked rhys flipped his head upside down to peer into my face again how do you think i feel ill be sacrificing all this toned and muscled flesh just when i thought someone else might get to appreciate it it made me smile he smiled at me upside down like the cheshire cat if youll let go of my arms he said i promise to throw myself on top of you at the first hint of danger his smile widened to a grin in fact with your permission ill throw myself on top of your body at every opportunity it was almost impossible not to smile at him if i was about to be torn limb from limb i might as well go smiling as frowning i let go of his arms get off of me rhys he kissed me lightly on the forehead and stood i was left lying on the floor all by myself i rolled onto one side gazing upward the men had all gotten to their feet they stood above me but only rhys was looking at me the others were looking up at the thorns the thorns swayed gently above us as if they were dancing to some music that we could not hear they dont seem to be doing anything i said try standing doyle held his hand down to me i looked at that perfectly black hand with its pale almost milkywhite nails i looked from the hand to rhys youll throw yourself on top of me at the first hint of danger quick as a little bunny he said i caught galen giving rhys a look it was not a friendly look i heard that about you galen said that you were quick if you want on bottom next time help yourself rhys said im more of an ontop man myself his teasing had a bite to it and he didnt look happy either children doyle said a soft warning in his voice i sighed the proclamation hasnt even been formally announced and the bickering has already begun and rhys and galen are two of the more reasonable ones doyle made a small bow putting his hand just inches above me let us take our problems one at a time princess to do it any other way is to be overwhelmed i stared into his dark eyes and slid my hand into his his grip was firm and unbelievably strong as he lifted me to my feet almost faster than i could stand it left me off center and wobbling forced to catch his hand tight to keep from falling his other hand came out to catch my arm for a moment it was very close to an embrace i glanced up at him there was no hint on his face that hed done it deliberately the thorns gave a furious hiss above our heads i was suddenly looking upward hands on doyles arms but not for supporti was frightened perhaps you should give us the knives you carry before we go farther he said i glanced at him how much farther are we going the roses desire a drink of your blood they must touch you at the wrist or elsewhere but usually the wrist he said i did not like the sound of that i dont remember offering to donate blood again the knives first meredith please he asked i looked up at the quivering thorns one thin strand seemed lower than the rest now i let go of doyle and reached a hand inside my bodice for the knife within the bra i brought it out flicking it open frost looked surprised and not happy about it rhys looked surprised but pleased i did not know that you could hide such a weapon under such a small piece of clothing frost said maybe we wont have to do nearly as much protecting as i thought rhys said galen knew me well enough to know i always went armed at court i handed the knife to doyle and raised my skirt by the time the skirt was to my knees i could feel the mens attention like a weight on my skin i looked up at them frost looked away as if embarrassed but the others either looked at my leg or my face i know theyd seen more skin than this on longer legs if you keep watching me this closely youre going to make me selfconscious my apologies doyle said why the sudden attention gentlemen youve seen the court ladies in much less than this i kept lifting the skirt until i bared the garter they watched each movement the way that cats watch birds in a cage but the court ladies are off limits to us you are not doyle said ah i lifted the knife hilt and all from around the garter i let the skirt fall back into place and watched their eyes following the movement of the cloth i enjoy being noticed by men but this level of scrutiny was almost unnerving if i survived the night id have a talk with them about it but as doyle said one problem at a time or you are overwhelmed who gets this knife three pale hands reached out for it i looked at doyle he was after all captain of the guard he nodded as if he approved of my looking to him for the choice rather than making it myself i knew who i liked the best of the three but i wasnt sure who was the best with a blade give it to frost doyle said i handed the knife to him handle first he took it with a small bow i noticed for the first time that there were faint blood stains on his pretty shirt hed been pressed against galens back wounds hed need to soak the shirt or the bloodstains would set i realize that frost is worth a stare or two tonight meredith but you are stalling doyle said i nodded i suppose i am i looked up at the dangling thorns my stomach was tight my hands cold i was afraid hold your wrist out to the vine that is the lowest we will protect you to the last breath in our bodies you know that i nodded i know that i did know that i even believed it but still i watched the thorns and my gaze slid upward into the dimness vines as wide as my leg twisted and turned upon themselves like a knot of sea serpents some of the thorns were as big as my hand catching the light in a dull black gleam i brought my gaze back down to the thin tiny thorns on the vines directly over my head they were small but there were a lot of them like a bristling armor of tiny pins i took a deep breath and blew it out i started raising my hand slowly upward hand balled into a tight fist my hand was barely even with my forehead when the vine poured downward like a snake down a hole the brown thing wrapped around my wrist and the thorns set in my skin like hooks in a fishs mouth the pain was sharp and immediate coming a second before the first trickle of blood slid onto my wrist the blood tickled down my skin like tiny fingers caressing the skin a fine crimson rain began to glide down my wrist thick and slow galen hovered by me hands fluttering around me as if he wanted to touch me but was afraid to isnt that enough he asked apparently not doyle said i looked where his gaze was fixed and found a second thin tendril hanging above my head it stopped as the first one had stoppedwaiting waiting for my invitation to come closer i looked at doyle you must be joking it has been long since it fed meredith youve endured more pain than a few thorns rhys said you even enjoyed it galen said the context was different i said the context is everything he said softly there was something in his voice but i didnt have time to decipher it i would give my wrist in your place but i am not heir doyle said neither yet am i the vine moved lower tickling against my hair like a lover trying to caress his way to the promised land i offered my other arm fist closed the vine wrapped around my wrist with an eager speed the thorns sank into my flesh the vine pulled tight it brought a gasp from my throat rhys was right id endured greater pain but every pain is singular a unique torture the vines pulled themselves taut raising my hands tight above my head there were so many thorns that it felt like some small animal was trying to bite through my wrists blood ran down my arms in a fine continuous rain id been able to feel each individual line of blood at first but my skin grew dead to so much sensation the pain in my wrists drew all my attention the vines raised me up on tiptoe until their grip was all that kept me from falling the sharp biting pain began to fade into a burning it wasnt poison it was just my body reacting to the damage i heard galens voice as if from a distance thats enough doyle it wasnt until he spoke that i realized id closed my eyes closed my eyes and given myself to the pain because only by embracing it could i rise above it travel through it to the place where there was no pain and i floated on a sea of blackness his voice brought me back wrenched into the kiss of thorns and the spill of my own blood my body jerked with the suddenness of it and the thorns answered that movement by jerking me into the air free of ground i cried out someone grabbed my legs supporting my weight i blinked down to find galen holding me its enough doyle he said they never drank so long from the queen frost said hed moved up to us my knife in his hand if we cut the vines they will attack us doyle said we have to do something rhys said doyle nodded the sleeves of my jacket were bloodsoaked i thought vaguely that i wished id worn black it didnt show blood as badly the thought made me giggle the grey light seemed to be swimming around us i was dizzy lightheaded i wanted the blood loss stopped before i got nauseated there was nothing like nausea induced by blood loss you felt too weak to move and still wanted to spill your stomach onto the floor my fear was fading into a light almost shining sensation as if the world were edged with fog i was perilously close to passing out id had enough of the thorns i tried to say enough but no sound came out i concentrated on my lips and they moved forming the word but there was no sound then there was a sound but it wasnt my voice the vines hissed and shivered above me i looked upward my head falling back bonelessly the vines rolled above me like a black sea made of rope the thorns around my wrist pulled upward with a sharp hiss only galens arms on my legs kept me from being lifted into the nest of thorns the vines at my wrists pulled and galen held and my wrists bled i screamed i screamed one word enough the vines shuddered trembling against my skin the room was suddenly thick with falling leaves a dry brown snow filled the air there was a crisp sharp smell like autumn leaves and under that like a second wave of scent was the rich smell of fresh earth the thorns lowered me toward the ground galen cradled me picking me up in his arms as the vines let me down slowly both galens arms and the vines themselves seemed strangely gentle if teeth could be gentle while they tried to bite your arm off the sound of the door banging back against the wall was the first hint i had that the vines had pulled back from the door galen was holding me in his arms with the vines still pulling my wrists above my head when we all turned to the spill of light from the open doors the light seemed brilliant dazzling with an edge of soft mist i knew the light only appeared bright after the dimness and i thought the edge of mist was just my ruined visionuntil a woman stepped out of that light with smoke rising from her fingertips as if each pale yellow finger were a snuffedout candle fflur moved into the room dressed in a gown of unrelieved black that made her yellow skin the bright color of daffodils her yellow hair fanned around her dress like a shining cloak twisting in a wind of her own power the guards spilled out to either side of her a handful had weapons the rest came into the room barehanded there were twentyseven men in the queens guard and the same number of women in the kings guard which now answered to cel because there was no king fiftyfour warriors and less than thirty came through the doors even through the faintness i tried to memorize each face tried to remember who came to our aid and who stayed behind in safety any guard that hadnt come through those doors had lost any chance they had at my body but i couldnt focus on all the faces a flood of new forms swept in behind the guard most of them shorter and much less human the goblins had come the goblins were not cels creatures that was my last thought before darkness spilled over my vision and ate the mist across my eyes i sank into that blissful darkness like a stone thrown in deep water that could only fall and fall because there was no bottom chapter there was a light in the darkness a pinpoint of whiteness that floated toward me growing larger and larger and i could see that it wasnt light but white flames a ball of white fire swept through the darkness swept toward me and i could not escape it because i had no body i was just something floating in the cool dark the fire washed over me and i had a body i had bones and muscles and skin and a voice the heat ate over my skin and i felt my muscles cooking popping from the heat the fire ate into my bones filled my veins with molten metal and began to peel me apart from the inside out i woke shrieking galen was bending over me his face was all that kept me from total panic he was cradling my head and upper body against his thighs stroking my forehead smoothing my hair back from my face its all right merry its all right his eyes glittered with unshed tears gleaming like green glass fflur leaned over me poor greeting i bring princess meredith but answer to our queen i must translated that meant she had called me out of the darkness forced me awake and at the queens bidding fflur was one of those who tried very hard to live as if the year had never gone to four digits her tapestries had been displayed in the st louis art museum theyd been photographed and written up in at least two major magazines fflur had refused to look at the articles and under no circumstances could she be persuaded to go to the museum shed turned down interviews from television newspaper and the aforementioned magazines it took two tries to get my voice to work in something other than a scream did you clear the door of roses i did she said i tried to smile at her and didnt quite make it you risked much to aid me fflur you have no apologies to make she glanced up and around at the crowding faces she placed a fingertip on my forehead and thought one word later she wanted to speak to me later but wanted no one to know she was a healer among other talents she could have checked my health with the same gesture so no one was the wiser i didnt even dare risk a nod the best i could do was stare into her black eyes a startling contrast to all that yellow so that they looked like the eyes of a doll i looked into her eyes and tried to tell her with a glance that id understood i hadnt even seen the throne room yet and i was already neck deep and rising in court intrigue typical my aunt knelt beside me in a cloud of leather and vinyl she took my right hand in hers petting it getting blood all over her leather gloves doyle tells me that you pricked your finger on a thorn and the roses sprang to life i looked up at her tried to read her face and failed my wrists ached with a sharp burning that seemed to go all the way down to the bone her fingers kept playing over the fresh wounds and every time the leather passed over it it made me twitch i pricked my finger yes what caused the roses to come to life is anyones guess she cradled my hand in both of hers gently now gazing down at the wounds with a look of wonderment on her face i had given up hope of our roses one more loss in a sea of loss she smiled and it seemed genuine but id seen her use the same smile while torturing someone in her bedchamber just because the smile was real didnt mean you could trust it im glad youre pleased i said my voice as empty as i could make it she laughed then pressing her hands together over the wounds i was suddenly very aware of every seam in the leather gloves as they pressed into my flesh she pressed with a slow steady pressure until i made a small pain sound that seemed to make her happy and she let me go she stood with a swish of skirts when fflur has bound your wounds you may join us in the throne room i am eager for your presence at my side she turned and the crowd parted before her forming a tunnel of light that led into the throne room beyond eamon moved from the crowd like a black leather shadow to take her arm a small goblin with a ring of eyes like a necklace across its forehead knelt beside me crowding the edge of fflurs black skirts the goblins eyes flicked to me flicked to her to me to her but what it was really looking at was the blood it was a small goblin barely two feet tall the ring of eyes marked it as handsome among the goblins they literally called such a marking a necklace of eyes and said it in tones that humans reserved for large breasts or a tight ass the queen could think what she wanted about the roses i didnt believe that one drop of my blood had inspired the dying roses i did believe that my royal blood had saved me but the initial attack i suspected another spell hidden somewhere in the thorns it was doable if someone were powerful enough i had enemies what i needed was friendsallies i let my hand slide down my hip as if i were faint the fresh wound was only inches from the little goblins mouth he darted forward and licked a rough tongue like a cats across the wound it brought a small sound from my throat and he cringed galen swung at him the way youd chase an unwanted dog away but fflur grabbed the goblin by the scruff of the neck greedy gut what mean you with such impertinence she started to cast him away i stopped her no he has tasted my blood uninvited i demand recompense for such abuse recompense galen made it a question fflur kept her grip on the little goblin his row of eyes flicked back and forth meant nothin by it sorry so sorry he had two main arms and two tiny uselesslooking ones all four arms writhed clasping and unclasping tiny clawed fingers frost took the goblin from fflur raising the small figure in two hands skyward his hands were empty of my knife id have to remember to ask for it back but at the moment i had other business i need to bind the wounds fflur said or you will lose more blood i have given you some of my strength but you did not find it pleasant and would find it less so a second time i shook my head not yet merry galen said let her treat your wounds i looked at his face so full of concern hed been raised in the court as had i he should have known that now was not a time to tend our wounds now was a time for action i looked into his face not at his handsome open face or his pale green curls or the way his laugh made his entire face glowi looked at him as my father must have looked at him once when he decided to give me to someone else i didnt have time to explain things that galen should already have been thinking of i searched the crowd peering down at me like gawkers at a car wreck simply better dressed and more exotic where is doyle there was movement in the crowd to my right doyle stepped forward he looked very tall from where i lay on the floor a blackcloaked pillar to loom above me only the peacockfeathered earrings framing his face softened the unrelieved intimidation of his figure the look on his face the set of his shoulders under the cloak all of it was the old doyle the queens darkness stood beside me and the colorful feathers looked out of place hed been dressed for a party and found himself in the middle of a fight his expression told nothing but the very lack of expression said he was not happy i suddenly felt six again and vaguely frightened of this tall dark man who had stood at my aunts side but he wasnt at her side now he was at mine i settled back in galens lap and found comfort in his touch but it was doyle i turned to for help bring kurag to me if he wishes to ransom this thief i said doyle arched a line of black eyebrow thief he drank my blood without invitation the only greater theft among the goblins is a theft of flesh rhys knelt on the other side of me i heard that goblins lose a lot of flesh during sex only if its agreed on beforehand i said galen leaned over me whispering against my skin if you are so weakened by blood loss that you cant bed anyone tonight he touched his lips to my face i dont think i could stand to watch you in one of her sex shows you must be well enough to bed someone tonight merry let fflur bind your wounds his face loomed at the corner of my eye like a pale blur his lips like a pink cloud next to my cheek it wasnt that he was wrong it was that he wasnt thinking far enough ahead i have better use for my blood than soaking into bandages what are you talking about galen asked doyle answered the goblins consider anything that comes from the body more valuable than jewels or weapons galen stared up at him he reached down toward my wrist i felt his chest move against my head as he sighed and what does that have to do with merry but there was something in his voice that said he knew the answer doyles dark eyes went from me to galen he stared at the younger guard you are too young to remember the goblin wars so is merry galen said those black eyes turned back to me young but she knows her history he flicked his gaze back to galen do you know your history young raven galen nodded he pulled me farther into his lap away from fflur away from everyone he held me against him holding my arms close so that my blood stained his skin i remember my history i just dont like it ill be all right galen i said he stared down at me nodding but not like he believed me fetch me kurag i said to doyle he looked at the waiting crowd sithney nicca fetch the goblin king sithney turned with a swirl of long brown hair i didnt see niccas dark purple hair the pale flash of his lilac skin would have been noticeable among the white and black skin of the court but if doyle called him he was there the crowd parted and kurag came forward with his queen at his side the goblins like all of the sidhe considered the royal consort to be a member in arms not someone to be hidden away in safety she had so many eyes scattered across her face that she looked like a spider done large the wide lipless mouth held fangs large enough to make any spider proud some goblins held venom in their bodies i was betting that kurags new queen was one of those the eyes the poison and a nest of arms around her body like a collection of snakes made her almost the perfection of goblin beauty though she could only boast one set of strong bowed legs extra legs were the rarest beauty among the goblins keelin did not appreciate her good fortune there was an air of contentment about the goblin queen that said here was a woman who understood her worth and had made it work for her that nest of arms clung to kurags body stroking caressing one pair of arms had slid between his legs stroking both shaft and balls through his thin pants the fact that she felt compelled to do something so overtly sexual when introduced to me was a sign that she considered me a rival my father had felt it important that i know the goblin court well wed visited their court many times as they had visited our home he had said the goblins do most of the fighting in our wars they are the backbone of our armies not the sidhe this had been true since the last goblin war when wed made a treaty that had lasted between us kurag had been so comfortable with my father that he had asked for my hand as consort the rest of the sidhe were mortally offended some talked of going to war over the insult the goblins considered his desire for such a humanlooking bride to be the height of perversity and talked behind his back of finding a new king but other goblins saw the benefit to sidhe blood in a queen it took some very serious diplomacy to keep us from either war or my wedding a goblin it was soon after that that my engagement to griffin was announced kurag loomed over me his skin was a shade of yellow similar to fflurs skin but where hers was smooth like the perfection of aged ivory kurags skin was covered in warts and lumps each imperfection in his skin was a beauty mark one large lump on his right shoulder spouted an eye a wandering eye the goblins called it because it wandered away from the face id loved the eye when i was a child loved the way it moved independently of his face the three eyes that graced his broad strong features the eye on his shoulder was the color of violets with long black lashes there was a mouth just above his right nipple that had full red lips and tiny white teeth a thin pink tongue would lick those lips and air breathed from that mouth if you put a feather in front of that second mouth it would blow the feather upward again and again while my father and kurag talked i entertained myself with watching that eye and that mouth and the two thin arms that poked awkwardly from kurags right side on either side of his ribs we played cards that eye that mouth and those arms i thought kurag very clever to be able to concentrate on such disparate things all at once what i hadnt known until i was a teenager was that there were two thin legs below kurags belt on the right side complete with a small but completely functional penis a goblins idea of courtship was crude sexual prowess counted for a great deal among them when id seemed unenthusiastic about kurags proposal hed dropped his pants and shown off both his own equipment and that of his parasitic twin i was sixteen and i still remember the dawning horror of the realization that there was another being trapped within kurags body another being with enough mind to play card games with a child while kurag paid no attention there was an entire person trapped inside there an entire person who if genetics had been kinder might have matched that lovely lavender eye i had never been comfortable around kurag after that it hadnt been the proposal or the sight of his rather formidable manhood come to full quivering attention it had been the sight of that second penis large and swollen independent of kurag and eager for me when i had turned them down for them it was that one lavender eye had shed a single tear i had had nightmares for weeks extra limbs were dandy but entire extra people in pieces trapped inside someone else there were no words for that kind of horror the second mouth could breathe so it obviously had access to the lungs but it lacked vocal cords i wasnt sure if that was a blessing or one last curse kurag goblin king greetings twin of kurag goblin kings flesh greetings as well the thin arms on the side of the kings bare chest waved at me i had greeted both of them from the night i realized that the person with whom id been playing cards and stupid games like featherblowing had actually not been kurag at all to my knowledge i was the only one who ever greeted both of them meredith sidhe princess greetings from both of us his orange eyes stared down at me the largest one perched like a cyclops eye slightly above and in the middle of the other two the look he gave me was the look any man would give a woman he desired a look so baldfaced so obvious that i felt galens body stiffen rhys rose to his feet to stand beside doyle you honor me with your attentions king kurag i said it was an insult among the goblins if the men did not leer at your woman it implied that she was ugly and infertile unworthy of lust the queen kept her hands on kurag but moved one hand to his side where i knew the other set of genitalia hung her maze of eyes glared at me as her hands worked them kurags breath came out in a rush from both mouths if we didnt hurry wed be here when the queen brought him them to a climax the goblins saw nothing wrong with public sex it was a mark of prowess among the men to be brought many times at one banquet and the woman that could do it was prized of course the goblin male who could sustain a females attentions for a lengthy time was prized among the females if a goblin had any sex problems like premature ejaculation or impotency or for a female frigidness then everyone knew it nothing was hidden kurags eyes went to frost and the small goblin in the guards grasp for all the goblin kings attention his queen might have been in another room why do you hold one of my men this is not a battlefield and i am not carrion i said kurag blinked the eye on his shoulder blinked a second or two later than the three main eyes he turned to the little goblin what have you done the little goblin babbled nothing nothing kurag turned back to me tell me merry this one lies like he breathes he drank my blood without my permission the eyes blinked again that is a grave charge i want recompense for the stolen blood kurag drew a large knife from his belt do you want his blood he drank from a royal princess of the high court of the sidhe do you really think his lowly blood is a fair trade for that kurag looked down at me what would be a fair trade he sounded suspicious your blood for mine i said kurag pushed his queens hands away from his body she made a small cry and he was forced to shove her hard enough for her to fall on her butt to the ground he never looked at her to see how she had fallen or if she was all right sharing blood means something among the goblins princess i know what it means i said kurag stared at me with his yellow eyes i could simply wait until you have lost enough blood to be carrion he said his queen crowded next to him i could speed the process along she held up a knife that was longer than my forearm the blade gleamed dully in the light kurag turned on her with a snarl this is not your concern you would share blood with her who is not a queen it is my business she stabbed the knife straight up toward his body the knife was a blur of silver the movement almost too quick to follow with the eye kurag had time only to sweep an arm in an effort to keep the blade from his body the blade opened his arm in a splash of crimson his other main arm hit her full in the face there was a sharp crunch of breaking bone and she sat down on her butt for a second time her nose had exploded like a ripe tomato two of the teeth between her fangs had broken off if there was blood coming from her mouth it was lost in the blood gushing from her nose the eye nearest the nose had spilled from its cracked socket and lay on her cheek like a balloon on a string kurag trapped her knife under his foot he hit her again and this time she fell over on her side and lay still there had been more than one reason that i did not want to marry kurag he bent over the fallen queen his thick fingers checked to see that she was still breathing that her heart still beat he nodded to himself and scooped her up in his arms he cradled her gently tenderly he barked out an order and a huge goblin squeezed through the crowd take her back to our hill see her wounds are tended if she dies i will have your head on a pike the goblins eyes flashed up to the kings face then down but there had been that one moment of pure fear on the goblins face the king had beaten the queen nearly killed her but it would be the goblin guards fault if she died that way the king would be blameless and would be able to find a new queen all the quicker if he had outright killed her in front of so many royal witnesses he could have been forced to give up either his throne or his life but she had been very much alive when hed lifted her tenderly into the arms of the redcap the kings hands were metaphorically clean if she died now though it was doubtful the goblin queen would die goblins were a tough lot a second goblin guard shorter and more barrelchested than the first took the queens knife from kurag and followed the first goblin guard back through the crowd kurag would be within his rights to have both of them killed if the queen died one of the things that most royals learn early is how to spread the blame spread the blame and keep your head it was like a complicated game with the red queen from alice in wonderland say the wrong thing dont say the right thing and it could be off with your head metaphorically speaking or not so metaphorically speaking he held his arm out to me blood flowed down it in a thick red wash the wound he offered in front of my face was deeper than it had looked a red gaping thing like a third mouth your queen meant to kill you i said he looked down at the wound still grinning aye she did you sound pleased i said and you princess sound like youre delaying the moment when you must place that clean white mouth on my body sidhe blood may be sweet galen said but goblin blood is bitter it was an old saying among us it was also untrue as long as the blood is red it all tastes pretty much the same i said i lowered my mouth to the open wound i couldnt come close to wrapping my mouth around kurags arm as he had mine but the taking of his blood had to be more than a mere kiss of my lips to treat the bloodtaking as less than the passionate sharing it was meant to be the honor it was meant to be was an insult theres an art to sucking blood from a wound thats bleeding this deeply you have to start slowly work into it i licked the skin near the shallowest end of the wound with long sure strokes of my tongue one of the tricks to drinking a lot of blood is to swallow often the other trick is to concentrate on each task separately i concentrated on how rough kurags skin was on the large roughened lump that edged the wound like a knot in the skin i paid attention to that knot rolling it around in my mouth for a second which was more than i had to do but i was working my courage up for the wound i like a little blood a little pain but this wound was deep and fresh and a little too much of a good thing i gave two more quick licks to the shallow end of the wound and then locked my mouth over it the blood flowed too quickly and i was forced to swallow convulsively breathing through my nose and still there was too much of the sweet metallic liquid too much to breathe around too much to swallow i fought the urge to gag and tried to concentrate on something else anything else the edges of the wound were very clean and smooth by that alone i knew how sharp the knife had been it would have helped if i could have touched my hands to him had some other sensory input i was aware that my hands were straining in the air as if trying to find something to hold on to but i couldnt help it i had to do something a hand brushed my fingertips and i grabbed that hand tight in my own squeezing it my other hand swept the air until it too was taken i thought it was galen for the smooth perfection of the tops of his hands but the palm and fingers were calloused from sword and shieldtoo rough for galens these were hands that had been training in weaponry for longer than galen had been alive those hands held mine responding to my pressure squeezing as i clung to the feel of them my mouth stayed against kurags arm but my attention was in my hands and the strength that was holding me i could feel the pull of his arms as he forced my hands behind my back and slightly up just this side of pain it was perfectly distracting and exactly what i needed i pulled away from the wound with a gasp finally able to draw a good breath i started to gag but the hands jerked my arms upward and i gasped again instead the moment passed and i was all right i wasnt going to embarrass myself by throwing up all that good blood the hands eased my arms back from the pain now they were just something to hang on to hmm kurag said that was well done merry you are indeed your fathers daughter high praise indeed coming from you kurag i stepped back from him and stumbled the hands steadied me allowing me to lean back against the chest that went with them i knew who it was before i turned my head to see doyle stared down at me as i leaned against his body hands still clinging to him i mouthed the words thank you to him he gave a small nod of his head he made no move to let me go and i made no move to leave the press of his body i was terribly afraid if i did step away from him or let go of his hands i would fall but it was also in that moment i felt safe i knew that if i fell he would catch me my blood is in your body and yours in mine kurag i said blood kin we are until the next moon kurag nodded your enemies my enemies your beloved my beloved he took a step closer looming over me even over doyle we are blood allies for a moons space of time if i stared up at him what do you mean if the ritual is complete kurag raised his three eyes and stared at doyle your darkness knows what i mean he is still the queens darkness i said kurags eyes flicked down to me then back to doyle its not the queens hands hes holding i started to pull away from doyle but he tightened his grip on my hands i forced myself to relax against his body its none of your business what doyle holds of mine kurag kurags eyes narrowed is he your new consort i heard rumor that that was why you were coming back to the court to choose a new consort i wrapped doyles hands around my waist i have no consort i leaned more solidly into doyles arms he stiffened for a second and then i felt his body relax one muscle at a time until he rested like a heavy warmth around me but you might say im shopping around good good kurag said i felt doyle tense though i doubt anyone watching could have told a difference i was missing something here but what no consort means i can demand one more thing or the alliance is broken do not do this kurag doyle said i invoke the right of flesh kurag said he has taken your blood under false pretenses frost said he knows who your enemies are and the goblin king fears them do you call kurag goblin king a coward kurag asked frost tucked the little goblin he was holding under one arm leaving his other hand free but still bare of weapon yes i name you coward if you hide behind flesh what is the right of flesh i asked i started to step away from doyle but his arms tightened i looked up at him what is going on doyle kurag is trying to hide his cowardice behind a very old ritual kurag grinned at them both call anyone a coward at any of the courts and you ended up righting a duel kurag was being much too reasonable i fear no sidhe he said i invoke flesh not to avoid her enemies guardsmen but to truly join my flesh with hers you are already wed frost said adultery is a crime among the sidhe but not among the goblins kurag said so my marital status makes no difference here only hers i pushed away from doyle the movement was too sudden i swayed and fflurs hand on my elbow saved me from falling i am going to bind your wrists now she said i couldnt really argue thank you i said to her as she began to dress my wrists i turned back to the men someone please explain what he is talking about glad to kurag said if your enemy is mine and i must help you defend yourself against powerful forces then my beloved must truly be your beloved we will share flesh as we shared blood you mean sex galen asked kurag nodded yes sex i said no galen said oh no no flesh sharing no alliance kurag said among the sidhe doyle said your marriage vows are still sacred meredith can no more help you cheat on your wife than she could cheat on her own husband the rule of flesh only works if both parties are unjoined kurag scowled you would not lie outright damn he looked at me you always escape me merry only because you always resort to trickery to try and get in my pants a servant had come with a bowl of clean water holding it for fflur as she washed my wrists she popped open a bottle of antiseptic and drenched both of my wrists with it the reddish liquid fell into the water floating on the surface like drops of new blood i made you a valid offer of marriage once kurag said i was sixteen i said you scared the shit out of me fflur patted my wrists dry just too much man for you arent i the two of you together are too much man for me kurag youre right i said his hand went to his side where the extra genitalia lay one heavy stroke and there was a bulge under the pants in a place where most men didnt have to worry about it flesh has been invoked kurag said still stroking his side it cannot be undone until it is answered i looked to doyle what does he mean doyle shook his head im not sure a second servant brought up a tray of medical supplies and held it while fflur started binding clean white gauze around my wrists the servant acted as a sort of nurse giving her scissors and tape as she needed it i know what kurag is doing frost said he is still trying to run from your enemies kurag turned on frost like a large broad storm merry needs every strong arm she can muster at her back that is lucky for you killing frost will you honor your alliance then and be one of the strong arms at her back frost said truth kurag said if i cannot have sex with our merry then i would rather not honor the alliance his lopsided multieyed face suddenly seemed serious even intelligent i realized for the first time that kurag was neither as stupid as he acted nor as ruled by his glands as he pretended to be there was a moment of absolute shrewdness in those three yellow eyes a look so intent so different than a moment ago that it made me step back as if hed tried to strike me because underneath that so serious look was something elsefear what was happening in the courts that kurag the goblin king was afraid if you do not honor your alliance frost said then all the court will know you for an honorless coward your word will never be trusted again kurag looked around at the crowd some had gone with the queen like a brightly colored train of toadies but many had remained behind to watch to listen to spy the goblin king did a slow circle of the waiting faces then came back to me i have invoked flesh share flesh with one of my goblins one of my unwed goblins and i will honor this alliance of blood galen stepped up next to me merry is a princess of the sidhe second in line to this throne sidhe princesses do not sleep with goblins there was a force in his voice a heat anger i touched his shoulder its all right galen he turned to me no its not how dare he make such a demand there was a low angry murmur that swept through the sidhe in the room the small knot of goblins that hed been allowed to bring into our hill closed at his back doyle moved up at my back he whispered this could go badly i glanced at him what do you expect me do be a princess and a future queen he said galen caught part of that he turned on doyle what are you asking her to do the same thing she is doing with us at queen andaiss request doyle said he stared at me i would not ask if the sacrifice were not worth the goal no galen said doyle stared at galen then which do you value more her virtue or her life galen glared at him tension running through his body like a nearvisible current of anger finally he said her life but it was spat out as if it were something bitter if i had the goblins as allies then if cel did manage to kill me hed have a blood feud with kurag and his court it would make cel or anyone else hesitate i needed this alliance one of your goblins flesh in my body i take it i said kurag smiled his flesh in your sweet body let your flesh and his be one and all the goblin nation will be your allies whos flesh will i be sharing i asked kurag looked thoughtful the eye on his shoulder went wide and the two thin arms on his side gestured wildly pointing kurag turned to the circle of goblins and began to move through them following the small arms of his twin i couldnt see who he finally stopped at he walked back out of the tightly packed knot of goblins and it wasnt until the small goblin stepped out from behind him that i could see him at all he was only four feet tall with pale skin like gleaming motherofpearl i knew sidhe skin when i saw it his hair curled over his neck black and thick but cut short of his shoulders his face was strangely triangular with huge almondshaped eyes that were a solid sapphire blue with a line of black pupil like a stripe in the center of all that blue he was wearing nothing but a silver edged loincloth which in a goblin meant that there was something of a deformity on the bare spots they did not hide deformities but saw them as a sign of honor he walked toward me over the stone like a tiny perfect male doll if there was a deformity i couldnt see it except for his size and the eyes he could have been of the court this is kitto kurag said his mother was a sidhe lady raped in the last goblin war which made kitto nearly two thousand years old he certainly didnt look it greetings kitto i said greetings princess there was a strange sibilance to his words as if he had trouble forming the words his lips were full and pink and shaped like a perfect cupids bow but those pretty lips barely moved when he spoke as if there was something in his mouth that he didnt want me to see before you agree kurag said see the whole show kitto turned his back and showed why he was wearing the loincloth there was a spread of shining iridescent scales starting at the base of his hairline and descending down his back to the base of his spine his butt was small and tight and perfect but the glittering scales told me why his eyes had elliptical pupils and why he had trouble with his sss snake goblin i said kitto turned back to face me he nodded open your mouth kitto let me see it all i said he looked at the floor for a moment then rolled his strange eyes up at me he opened his mouth in a wide yawn flashing dainty fangs his tongue flicked out like a red ribbon with a dab of black on the end of each point ssatissfffied he asked i nodded yes you cant rhys said hed been so quiet id almost forgotten he was with us its my choice i said rhys touched my shoulder took me to one side take a good look at the scar across my face i know ive told you a thousand heroic stories about how i got this but the truth is the queen punished me she gave me to the goblins for a night of sport i thought why not free sex even if it is with goblins he blinked his one good eye a goblins idea of sex is more violent than you can imagine merry he traced the length of the scar with his fingertip and the look in his eye was distant remembering i touched the scar where it ended on his cheek catching his hand in mine a goblin did this to you during sex he nodded oh rhys i said voice soft he patted my hand and shook his head no pity i just want you to understand what youre agreeing to i understand rhys thank you for telling me i patted his cheek squeezed his hand and walked past him back to the waiting goblins i was walking straight and upright but there was a little turning inside my head that made me want badly to hold on to something but when youre negotiating a war treaty you need to look strong or at least not like youre about to faint dead away kittos flesh in my body right i asked kurag nodded and he looked pleased with himself as if he knew hed already won i agree to take kittos flesh into my body agreed kurag said surprise dripping from his voice you would agree to share flesh with a goblin i nodded i agree on one condition his eyes narrowed what condition if the alliance between us is a season long i said i felt doyle step closer to me the ripple of surprise spread through the room in whispers and small movements a season kurag said no too long eleven moons from now i said kurag turned back to me my queen has saved us the trouble of opening my vein then lets get on with it im wasting blood i said galen still had his hands over my wrists and i realized he was holding pressure on my wounds i looked up at him galen its all right he kept his hands tight around my wrists galen please let me go he stared down at me opened his mouth as if to say something then closed it and slowly moved his hands back from my wrists his hands came away stained with my blood but the pressure hed applied had slowed the bleeding or maybe it was just galens touch maybe it wasnt just my imagination that made his hands a cool soothing presence he helped me to my feet i had to push his hands away so i could stand alone i spread my legs to get as good a balance on the heels as i could and faced kurag standing i came almost up to his sternum his shoulders were nearly as wide as i was tall most of the sidhe were tall but the larger goblins were truly bulky fflur had moved to one side of me to join galen doyle and rhys at my back frost stood to one side with the little goblin dangling from his hands there was a press of bodies all around us sidhe goblin and others but i had eyes only for the goblin king though i do offer you my apologies for my mans rudeness kurag said i cannot offer you my blood without gaining in return i held my right hand out to him and my left hand to the red mouth on his chest drink then kurag goblin king i raised my right wrist as close to his main mouth as i could reach reaching so far above my head left me faintly dizzy i pressed my left wrist to the open mouth on his chest and it was those lips that closed around my wrist first that tongue that worked over the wound to get it to bleed afresh the tongue in that mouth felt soft and human not at all like the little goblins harsh cat tongue kurag bowed his head over my wrist careful not to use his hands to hold the wound close to him to use his hands would have been rude and taken as a sexual overture his tongue was rough like sandpaper even rougher than the little goblins had been it abraded the wound and brought a soft gasp from my throat the mouth in his chest had already formed a seal over the wounds sucking like a baby with a bottle kurags tongue lingered until the blood flowed fresh and easy when he wrapped his lips around my wound his mouth took in almost all of my wrist his teeth pressed against my flesh painfully as the suction grew the smaller mouth in his chest was much more polite kurags mouth worked at my wrist lips in a tight seal just as i grew accustomed to his sucking his teeth grazed the wound his tongue flicking in a sharp painful movement he was staying at the wound a long time it was sort of like a beerchugging contest you took as much in at a time as you could manage without throwing up but finally finally kurag drew his head back from my wrist i drew my left hand from his chest the lips placed a light kiss against my wrist as i pulled away kurag stretched his thin lips in a smile showing the yellowed teeth stained with blood do better if you can princess though ive always found the sidhe a little too prissy for good tongue action you must be entertaining the wrong sidhe kurag ive found them all i lowered my voice to a husky whisper and put a look in my eyes to match orally talented kurag chuckled low and evil but appreciative i swayed slightly but i kept my feet and that was all that was required but i was going to need to sit down soon before i fell down my turn i said kurags grin widened suck me sweet merry suck me hard id have shaken my head if i hadnt been convinced that it would make the dizziness worse you never change kurag i said why should i he said no female ive bedded in over eight hundred years has ever gone away wanting just bleeding i said he blinked then laughed again if there aint blood whats the point i tried not to smile and failed big talk for a goblin who hasnt offered up his blood yet he shook his head two moons ten i said three be reasonable i said five he said eight i countered he grinned six done i said kurag stared at me for a heartbeat or two done he said it softly as if even at the moment he spoke he was sure it was the wrong thing to do i raised my voice so it would carry throughout the room standing with feet braced wide apart it must have looked like an aggressive stance but i wasnt trying for aggressive i was trying not to let my body sway to the swirling inside my head the alliance is forged kurag raised his own voice forged only after you share flesh with my goblin i held my hand out to kitto he laid his hand on top of mine a light touch of smooth flesh i raised his hand up to my face i tried to bend down and kiss the back of his hand but the room swam i had to straighten up and raise his hand with both of mine spreading the small perfect fingers wide id never held a mans hand that was smaller than my own sucking a finger would have been the most sexual thing i could do but id sucked the last piece of flesh i wanted tonight i laid a gentle but full kiss on his open palm i didnt leave a lipstick print behind which meant id worn it all off sucking on kurags arm kittos strange eyes widened i raised my mouth away from his hand slowly so that i rolled my eyes at kurag as i came up over the goblins hand as if it were a fan well get around to sharing flesh kurag dont worry now join me kitto the queen awaits me and all my men kitto darted a glance at kurag then back to me i am honored i looked up at the tall king remember this kurag as i share flesh with kitto in the nights to come that it was your own lust and cowardice that gave him to me and me to him kurags face changed from yellow to a dark orange his great hands balled into fists bitch he said i spent many a night at your court kurag i know that to have me share myself with another sidhe is nothing to you for only sharing flesh with a goblin is true sex to you anything less is merely foreplay and you have given me over to another goblin kurag the next time you try and trick me into your bed think where your trickery has gotten you and me i felt my strength ebb as i finished the speech i stumbled just a step strong hands caught me at both armsdoyle on one side galen on the other i looked from one to the other of them and managed to whisper i need to sit down soon doyle nodded galen kept his arm at my elbow and slid his other arm around my waist doyles hold stayed on my arm but became firm as stone i let go with my upper body letting them take most of my weight while to other eyes i appeared to be standing just fine id perfected this particular technique many times being dragged by the guard before my aunt when she demanded i stay on my feet and i couldnt do it alone some of the guards would help you pull the trick off some would not walking was going to be interesting doyle and galen turned me toward the open doors one high heel scraped loudly on the stones i had to do better than that i concentrated on picking my feet up just enough to walk but galen and doyle were holding me up the world narrowed down to me putting one foot in front of the other gods but i wanted to go home but the queen was waiting and being kept waiting wasnt one of her strong suits i caught a glimpse of kitto moving just behind us and to one side according to goblin etiquette he was my consort my boytoy yes he could hurt me during sex but only if i were stupid enough to get into bed with him without negotiating a contract of what was and was not acceptable rhyss injuries could have been saved if hed known goblins but most of the sidhe simply saw them as barbarians savages most did not study the law of savages but my father had of course i wasnt planning on having sex of any kind with the goblin i was planning to share flesh with himliterally the goblins loved flesh better than blood or sex to share flesh meant both sex and the greater gift of an allowed bite that would leave a scar until your lover died it was a way of marking your lover showing that theyd been with a goblin many goblins had special scar patterns that they used for all their lovers so that people would see their conquests at a glance but whatever i had to do to cement the bargain i had the goblins as my allies for the next six months my allies not cels not even the queens if there was a war between now and six months from now the queen would have to negotiate with me if she wished the goblins to fight on her behalf that was worth a little blood and maybe even a pound of flesh if i didnt have to lose it all at once chapter a dip lay in the stones just inside the door a place where feet have turned for thousands of years pivoting on their heels to mount the low dais to either side of the room i could have walked this floor in the absolute dark but tonight i tripped on the small depression in the floor sandwiched between two guards i should have been solid as inside a wall but my ankle twisted and threw me so violently into doyle that it brought galen with me doyle caught us for an instant then we were all in a heap on the floor kitto was there first offering a hand to galen i caught the look on galens face as he stared at that small hand but he took it he allowed the goblin to help him to his feet there were other guards who would have spit on the hand instead of taking it it was frost one hand holding my knife who took my hand and raised me to my feet he wasnt looking at me he was searching the area for threats it had been subtle if the spell had been a little less vicious i might have chalked it up to bloodlossinduced clumsiness on my part but the spell had been too large too much you did not bring down two of the royal guard in an unceremonious heap because the woman in the middle tripped frosts hand forced me to take my full weight on my own two feet and one of my feet wasnt up to it pain shot through my left ankle i gasped going to one foot frost had to catch me around the waist lifting me completely of the ground pressed against his body encircled in his arm he was still searching for the attackthe attack that wasnt coming not here not now rhys was moving around the floor checking for other traps none of us moved very much until he nodded still crouched on the floor doyle was on his feet he hadnt taken out the other knife he met my eyes how badly are you hurt princess twisted ankle maybe the knee too frost swept me off my feet before i could tell that earned me a glance from frost i can put you down princess id rather you carry me to a chair he looked at doyle its not a matter for knives is it he sounded almost wistful no doyle said frost snapped the blade closed onehanded to my knowledge hed never handled a fading knife of any sort but he made the gesture look smooth and practiced he slid the blade into the back of his waistband and scooped me up in his arms what chair would you prefer he asked this one the queen said she was standing in front of her throne on the far raised das her throne rose above everyone elses as befit her position but there were two smaller thrones on the dais just below her own reserved for the consort and the heir usually tonight eamon was standing at her side his chair empty cel was sitting in the other small throne siobhan was at his back keelin was at his feet on a small cushioned stool like a lap dog cel was looking at his mother and there was something very close to panic on his face rozenwyn moved up beside siobhan she was cels second in command frosts equivalent her cottoncandy hair was piled in a crown of braids atop her head like a bowl woven of pink easter grass her skin was the color of spring lilacs her eyes molten gold id thought her lovely when i was small until she made it clear that i was lesser than she it was rozenwyns handshaped scar across my ribs she who had almost crushed my heart cel stood so violently that it slid keelin down the steps with the leash straining between them he never looked at her as she got to her feet mother you cannot do this she looked at him hand still guiding us toward eamons empty chair oh but i can son or have you forgotten that i am still queen here there was an edge to her voice such that if it had been anyone but cel theyd have thrown themselves down on the floor in an abject bow waiting for the blow to fall but it was cel and shed always been soft with him i know who rules here now cel said what i am concerned with is who shall rule after that too is my concern she said still in that so calm so dangerous voice i wonder who could have set such a powerful spell just inside the throne room without anyone else noticing it she looked around the huge room settling her gaze on each face in its small throne there were sixteen chairs on each side of the room on raised daises smaller chairs clustered around them but the main chairs held the heads of each royal family she studied them especially the ones nearest the doors i dont see how anyone could have worked such a spell and had no one notice it i looked at the sidhe nearest the doors and they avoided my gaze they knew they had seen and they had done nothing such a powerful spell andais continued if my niece had not been supported by two guards she might have fallen and broken her neck frost was still standing with me in his arms but had made no move to come closer bring her frost let her sit beside me as she is meant to andais said frost carried me forward doyle and galen bracketed him one right the other left rhys and kitto came like a rear guard frost went to both knees on the bottom step that led up to the throne he knelt with me in his arms as if it were no strain as if he could have stayed like that all night and there would have been no tremble in his arms i wondered briefly if his knees ever fell asleep from being forced to kneel too long the others dropped to their knees a little behind and to either side of us kitto didnt just go to his knees he flattened himself to the floor facedown arms and legs outstretched like some kind of religious penitent i hadnt fully appreciated his problem until then there were very specific types of bows and curtseys that you gave depending on your rank and the rank of the person being met kitto was not royal even among the goblins if he had been kurag would have mentioned it it had been a double insult to give me a goblin that was also a commoner kitto was not allowed to touch the steps except with express invitation only members of other sidhe royal houses were allowed to go to both knees in the throne room without bowing the body in any way kitto didnt know what the protocol was so hed taken the absolute lowest road i knew in that instant that hed cooperate with taking flesh instead of sex he was more interested in staying alive than in any false sense of pride come sit meredith let us make this announcement before another trap is sprung she glanced at cel when she said that last he was my bet for the spell too but only because he was always one of my first choices when something nasty happened to me in the court andais had always looked the other way for cels sake something had happened between them something that had changed andaiss attitude toward her only son what had he done to turn her from him frost stood in one easy motion and carried me up the steps i could feel his legs push us upward as he carried me he laid me gently in the chair sliding his hands out from under my body he went down on one knee in front of me cradling my left foot in his lap i looked out into the room id never been allowed on the dais id never seen the view from up here it wasnt so very high or so very grand but there was a sense of rightness to it bring a stool for meredith to prop her ankle upon when i have made my announcements then fflur may attend her she seemed to be speaking to no one in particular but a small cushioned footstool floated toward us i looked out of the corner of my eyes deliberately not looking directly at the floating stool a pale wisp of a shape showed like a white shadow holding the small stool in slender ghostly hands the white lady set the stool beside frosts leg i felt that pressure as if the weight of thunder filled a small piece of air it was the feel of a ghost standing far too close i didnt have to see her to know she was there now then the pressure eased and i knew shed floated away frost lifted my foot onto the much lower stool i swallowed a gasp at the movement but the pain had helped clear my head i didnt feel faint anymore it was the third attempt on my life in a single night someone was very determined frost moved to stand behind my chair as siobhan shadowed cel as eamon had moved back to stand by the queen andais stared out over the assembled nobles the goblins and lesser folk those invited at all had spilled back in to fill the long ornate tables to either side of the room but even kurag did not have a throne to sit upon in this room he was just one of the rabble here let it be known that princess meredith nicessus daughter of my brother is now my heir a gasp ran through the room from mouth to mouth like a wind until there was nothing but silence a silence so thick that the white ladies rose into the air like halfseen clouds and began to dance on the tension of it cel was on his feet mother meredith has come into her power at last she bears the hand of flesh as did her father before her cel was still standing my cousin must have used the hand in mortal combat and have been blooded in front of at least two sidhe witnesses he sat down looking confident again the queen gave him a look so cold that his confidence faded from his face leaving him unsure you speak as though i do not know the laws of my own kingdom my son all has been accomplished according to our traditions sholto she called sholto stood from his big chair near the door black agnes was on one side of him segna the gold on the other nightflyers hung from the ceiling like great bats other creatures of the sluagh filled in around him gethin waved at me yes queen andais sholto said his hair was tied back from a face that was as handsome as arrogant as any in the room tell the court what you have told me sholto told of neryss attack on me though not why shed done it he told an edited version of the events but there was enough he did not mention doyle though and i found it a strange thing to leave out the queen stood meredith is equal to cel my own son in all things but as i have only one throne for them to inherit it will go to the one who is with child first if cel makes one of the court women with child within three years then he will be your king if meredith is with child first then she will be your queen to ensure that meredith has her choice of the courts men i have lifted my guards celibacy geas for her and her alone the ghosts whirled overhead like happy clouds and the silence deepened as if we were all sitting at the bottom of some deep shining well the looks on the mens faces ran from surprise to disdain to shock and some went straight to lust but in the end almost every male face turned to me she is free to choose any among you andais sat down on her throne spreading her skirts out around her in fact i believe she has already begun the selection she turned those pale grey eyes to me havent you niece i nodded then bring them forth let them sit at your side no cel said she must have two sidhe witnesses sholto is only one doyle spoke still kneeling i am the other cel slowly sat back down on his own throne even he would not be so bold as to question doyles word cel stared at me and the hate in his eyes was hot enough to burn along my skin i turned from his hatred to gaze at the men who were still kneeling at the foot of the dais i held my hands out to them galen doyle and rhys rose and walked up the steps toward me doyle kissed my hand and took up his post beside frost at my back galen and rhys sat by my legs the way keelin sat beside cel it was a little subservient for my taste but i wasnt sure what else to do kitto stayed pressed to the floor motionless i turned to my aunt queen andais this is kitto a goblin he is part of my bargain with kurag goblin king to bind an alliance between the goblin kingdom and myself for six months andaiss eyes raised upward you have been a very busy girl tonight meredith i felt the need of powerful allies my queen i said my eyes strayed to cel even though i tried not to look at him you must tell me later how you managed to get six months out of kurag but for now call your goblin kitto i said holding my hand outward rise and come to my hand he raised his face without moving his body the movement looked almost painful in its awkwardness his eyes flicked to the queen then back to me i nodded its all right kitto he looked back to the queen she shook her head get up off the ground boy so a doctor may attend your mistresss wounds kitto rose to all fours when no one shouted at him he came to his knees then to one knee then very carefully to his feet he came up the steps too quickly almost a run and sat down at my feet with something like relief on his face fflur attend the princess andais said fflur came up the steps with two white ladies on either side of her the one holding the tray of bandages was the more solid of the two she looked almost alive in a white transparent sort of way the other spirit was utterly invisible holding a small closed box in midair as if aided by brownie magic but no brownies worked magic here nothing that earthly haunted the unseelie court fflur removed my shoe and rotated my foot which made me scoot around in my chair i managed not to say ow ow ow but i wanted to thankfully it was just the ankle everything else was working you need to remove your stocking so i can bind the ankle she said i started to work the skirt up and fish for the band of my thighhighs but galen put his hands over mine and stopped me allow me he said he was not coming to my bed tonight but the look in his eyes the hush in his voice the weight of his hands against mine over my thigh was like a promise for the future rhys laid a hand on my other knee why do you get to remove her stocking galen looked at him because i thought of it first rhys smiled and shook his head good answer galen smiled back at him that smile that made his entire face glow as if someone had lit a candle behind his skin he turned that shining face to me and the humor in his eyes slid away changing to something darker and more serious he was kneeling in front of me on the far side of the injured leg with rhys next to the other leg his hands had my hands trapped against my thigh he raised my hands in his gently kissing the back of each hand as he laid it on the arm of the throne he pressed my fingers against the wood as if telling me silently not to move my hands because of the way my leg was propped on the stool galen was kneeling to one side giving a full view to most of the room he pushed the long skirt up baring my leg and the garter he slid the garter down my leg and slipped it over his arm his fingertips touched the hose just above my knee sliding along the sleek fabric until both his hands pressed against my leg coming to rest midthigh like a hot weight against my skin he met my eyes and the look on his face made my heart race he lowered his eyes to watch his hands slide slowly up my leg his fingers moved under the edge of my skirt then his hands slid out of sight almost to their wrists as his fingertips found the top of the hose his hands seemed larger than they were pressed under my skirt when his fingertips moved past the elastic band onto my bare skin it brought an involuntary jerk his eyes went back to my face as if asking if i wanted him to stop the answer was both no and yes the feel of his hands on my body the knowledge that we didnt have to stop was intoxicating exhilarating if wed been alone and he completely healed i would have thrown caution and all my clothes to the wind but we were surrounded by nearly a hundred people and that was a little too much audience for me i had to close my eyes before i could shake my head no his fingers moved ever so slightly upward one fingertip caressing the edge of the hollow in the very upper line of my inner thigh it brought my breath in a quick shaking sigh i opened my eyes and looked at him this time i had the face to go with the head shake not here not now galen smiled but it was a private smile the kind of smile a man gives you when hes sure of you and knows that only a little privacy stands between him and your body he folded his fingers over the edge of the elastic band and started rolling the hose down my leg carefully slowly a voice came from behind us the princess seems to have already made her choice it was conri never one of my favorite people he stood tall dark handsome with eyes like melted tricolored gold with all due respect your highness you give us a promise of flesh then we are forced to sit and watch while another claims that prize meredith does seem to have been a busy little bee among all you lovely flowers andais said she laughed and the sound was derisive joyous cruel and somehow intimate it made a flush creep up my face as galen slid the hose down my leg and off my foot he moved to one side letting fflur kneel over my ankle he raised the hose to his face brushing the sheer black cloth against his mouth as he stared at conri conri had never been my friend he was one of cels childhood friends a loyal supporter of the one true heir i watched the rage in his gold eyes the jealousy not of me as a person but me as the only female they had access to you could feel the tension in the room growing swelling like the pressure before a storm the white ladies always seemed to respond to great tension or great change in the court the ghosts whirled around the edges of the room swinging in a spectral dance above the floor the more excited the ladies became the more agitated they wereand the greater the events unfolding they were like prophets that only predicted seconds ahead what can you do with seconds of warning sometimes much sometimes nothing the trick was that you had to see the danger coming to stop it seconds to see it and stop it and i was too slow too late again conris voice bellowed out i challenge galen to death galen started to stand and i caught his arm what do you hope to gain from his death conri to take his place at your side i laughed i couldnt help it the look of sullen rage on conris face at my laughter was chilling i pulled galen back down to kneel at my side fflur chose that moment to tighten the bandages and i had to breathe out before i could speak is galen greenhair a coward then conri scoffed he had moved from his chair off the dais to the floor i parted galens arm keeping him with me you never did have a sense of humor conri i said his eyes narrowed what are you talking about ask me why i laughed he stared at me for a second or two then he nodded fine why did you laugh because you and i are not friends we are very close to enemies i dont sleep with people i dont like and i dont like you he looked puzzled i sighed i mean that if you kill galen that wont get you a place in my bed i dont like you conri you dont like me i wont sleep with you under any circumstance so sit down shut up and let someone talk who has a chance in hell of sharing my bed conri was left standing openmouthed and lost as to what to do he was one of the most courtwise of all the guards he sucked up to cel expertly he flattered the queen within an inch of propriety he knew which nobles to treat well and which he could ignore or even treat badly id fallen into the last category because you couldnt be cels friend and be mine cel wouldnt allow it i watched conris face as he realized that he hadnt been quite as courtwise as he thought he had i enjoyed his embarrassment but he rallied my challenge stands if i cannot share your bed then i dont want galen to have you either my hand tightened on galens arm why fight if you know you dont get the prize i asked conri smiled and it wasnt pleasant because his death will cause you pain and that will be almost as sweet as your body next to mine galen rose sliding away from my grip on his arm he started down the steps and i was afraid for him conri was a cruel brownnosing bastard but he was also one of the best swordsmen in the court i stood hopping because i couldnt bear weight on my left foot rhys caught me or i might have fallen i am still the reason for this duel conri conri nodded watching galen walk toward him indeed you are princess know that when i kill him i did it all for spite of you then i had one of those moments of desperate inspiration a brilliant idea born of panic you cannot challenge a royal consort to a death duel conri i said he is not a royal consort until you are pregnant conri said but if i am actively trying to have a child with him then he is my royal consort because we have no way of knowing if i am with child at this second conri turned to me shocked you have noti mean the queen laughed again oh meredith you have been a busy busy little bee she stood if there is even a remote chance that galen could have fathered a child upon my niece then he is indeed a royal consort until proven otherwise if you slew him and she was with child and you had deprived this court of a fertile royal pair i would see your head rotting in a jar on a shelf in my room i dont believe it cel said they have not had sex tonight andais turned to him and was there not a lust spell in the car when they were alone in the back of it the blood drained from conris face in a wash leaving him pasty and sickly looking the look on his face was enough the lust spell had been his doing though few sidhe in this room would doubt who had told him to do it meredith is not the only one who has been a very busy bee tonight her voice was warm with the beginnings of a really fine rage cel sat up very straight and still managed to sink back into his chair siobhan moved from behind his chair to his side not quite putting herself between the prince and the queen but the gesture looked like what it was siobhan had stated her loyalties before the entire court andais would not forget it or forgive it rozenwyn hesitated not quite following her captains lead she eventually drifted up beside siobhan but her reluctance at having to choose between queen and prince showed rozenwyns loyalty was mainly to rozenwyn eamon moved up beside the queen and doyle moved a step closer to the queen as if he wasnt sure where he should be standing id never before seen him unsure where his duty lay i saw the queen search his face and i think his hesitation hurt her hed been her bodyguard for a thousand years her right hand her darkness now he stood unsure if he should leave my side to go to hers enough of this andais said the rage burned through those simple words i see you have made yet another conquest meredith my darkness has not hesitated in over a thousand years of service but there he stands practically dancing from foot to foot wondering whom he should protect if all goes badly the look she gave me made me grip rhyss hand tight be glad that you are blood of my blood meredith for anyone else to have divided the loyalties of my most trusted would be death it was almost as if she were jealous but in all the years that id been old enough to notice shed never treated doyle as anything but a servant a guard shed never treated him as a man hed never in over a thousand years been one of her chosen lovers but now she was jealous the look on doyles face was soft puzzled full of wonderment i realized in that moment that hed loved her once but no longer and it hadnt been my doing andais had thrown him away by simply not paying any attention to him at all it was too intimate a moment for such a public display among humans some of us would have looked away given them an illusion of privacy but that wasnt the sidhe way we stared we watched every nuance cross their faces and in the end mere minutes doyle stepped back to stand with me his hand on my shoulder it was not a particularly intimate gesture especially after the show galen had put on but from doyle in such a moment it was intimate he like siobhan had shown his loyalty burned his bridges id known that doyle would keep me alive at the expense of his own life because the queen ordered it now i knew hed keep me alive because if i died now the queen would never trust him again he would never again be her darkness he was mine for better or worse it gave a whole new meaning to till death do us part my death would almost surely mean his now i kept my eyes on my aunt but raised my voice for the entire room they are all my royal consorts protests spread throughout the room male voices raised you couldnt have slept with all of them and whore i think that was a woman i raised my hand in a gesture that id seen my aunt use time and again the room didnt grow totally quiet but it was close enough for me to continue my aunt in her wisdom foresaw the duels that might be fought that dangling any woman before the guard could lead to great bloodshed we could lose the best and brightest of us all a female voice cried out as if you are such a prize i laughed hand digging into rhyss shoulder for support as if he were a cane kitto moved up and offered his hand to my free hand i took the extra support gratefully the ankle was beginning to ache hanging down at my side i know that was you dilys no i am not such a prize but i am female and i am available to them and no one else is that makes me the prize whether any of us likes it or not but my aunt foresaw the problem yes andais said i have ordered meredith to choose not one among you or four or five but many she is to treat you all as her own personal harem are we allowed to refuse if she chooses us i looked out into the crowd but couldnt see who had asked you are free to refuse andais said but which of you would refuse the chance to be the next king if she is with your child then it will not be royal consort but monarch galen and conri were still standing about three yards apart staring at each other we all know who she wants to be her king she has made that abundantly clear tonight conri said all ive made clear i said is that i wont be sleeping with you conri the rest as they say is up for grabs you wont be making galen your royal consort cel said and his voice held satisfaction if you are with child it will be his last i looked at him trying to understand this level of animosity and failing i bargained with queen niceven before the damage was too great what did you have to offer niceven the tiny queen rose above the crowd where her miniature throne sat on a shelf like a doll house with her court surrounding her blood prince cel not the blood of a lowly lord but the blood of a princess we all carry the coin of the unseelie court in our veins cousin i said siobhan stepped in to try and save him guarded him with her words as she would guard him with her sword what if it is the goblin that makes her with child siobhan asked that the queen turned to her then it is the goblin that will be king there was a shocked ripple through the court murmurs curses exclamations of horror we will never serve a goblin king conri said others echoed him to refuse the chosen of the queen is treason andais said deliver yourself to the hallway of mortality conri i think you are overdue for a lesson in what disobedience will gain you he stood there staring at her then his eyes flicked to cel and that was a mistake andais stomped her foot i am queen here do not look to my son go to ezekials tender care conri go now or face worse conri gave a low bow and kept the bow all the way out of the room through the stillopen doors it was the only thing he could do to have argued further could have earned him a beheading sholtos voice came loud in the tense silence ask conri who ordered him to place the lust spell in the black coach andais turned to sholto like a storm about to break on the shore sitting next to her i could feel her magic gathering prickling along my skin it raised goose bumps on galens bare back i will punish conri do not fear she said but not conris master sholto said the court held its collective breath because sholto was finally saying what everyone knew to be true for years cel had ordered things done his toadies had suffered when caught but never him that is my business andais said but there was the faintest hint of panic in her voice who was it told me that your majesty wished the sluagh to travel to the western lands and kill princess meredith sholto asked dont the queen said but her voice was soft like a dreamer trying to convince herself that a nightmare is not real dont what your majesty sholto asked doyle spoke next who had access to branwyns tears and allowed mortals to use it against other fey the thick silence was filled with dancing ghosts whirling fast and faster faces were turned to the dais some pale some eager some frightened but all waiting waiting to see what the queen would do at last but it was cel who spoke next he leaned across and hissed at me isnt it your turn next cousin his voice held such hatred i realized he thought id seen him in los angeles but like sholto id only been waiting for the perfect moment to reveal him i drew a breath but andais gripped my arm she leaned in to me whispering do not tell about his worshipers she knew she knew that cel had let humans worship him it left me speechless unsaid between us was the knowledge that to protect her son she had risked all of us because if it could be proven in human courts that any sidhe had allowed themselves to be worshiped on american soil we would be expelled not just the sidhe but all fey i stared into those triplegrey eyes and saw not the terrifying queen of air and darkness but a mother afraid for her only child she had always loved cel too much i whispered back to her the worshiping must cease it has you have my word he must be punished i said but not for that she whispered i thought about that for a second or two while her hand gripped the bloodsoaked cloth of my sleeve then he must be punished for giving the tears to a mortal her hand tightened on my arm until it hurt if her eyes hadnt held such fear id have thought she was threatening me i will punish him for trying to kill you i shook my head no i want him to be punished for giving branwyns tears to a mortal that is a death sentence she said there are two punishments possible my queen ill agree he keeps his life but i want the full sentence allowed for the torture she pulled back from me pale her eyes suddenly tired the torture was very specific for the crime you were stripped naked and chained in a dark room then covered with the tears your body would be full of burning need magical lust but left untouched unfinished unrelieved it is said that it can drive a sidhe mad but it was the best or the worst i could do six months is too long she said his mind would not survive it it was the first time id ever heard her admit that cel was weak or at least not strong we bargained much as kurag and i had and ended with three months three months my queen but if i or my people are harmed in any way during that time then cel forfeits his life she turned and stared at her son who was watching us closely wondering what we were saying she finally turned back to me agreed andais pushed herself to her feet slowly almost as if her age were showing she would never have an old body but inside the years still passed she announced in a clear cold voice cels crime and his punishment he stood i will not submit to this she turned on him lashing out with her magic pushing him into his chair pressing on his chest with invisible hands of power until he could not draw breath to speak siobhan made some small movement doyle and frost moved between her and the queen you are a fool cel andais said i have saved your life this night do not make me regret what i have done she released him suddenly and he slid to the floor near where keelin still crouched andais turned back to the court meredith will take whom she pleases with her tonight to her hotel she is my heir the land welcomed her at her return tonight the ring on her finger is alive and full of magic once more you have seen the roses watched them come to life for the first time in decades all these wonders and still you question my choice have a care that you do not question yourselves to death with that she sat down and motioned for everyone else to sit down we all sat down the white ladies began to bring in the small individual tables that sat in front of the thrones the meal began to float in on ghostly hands galen joined us again at the side of the dais conri was already being punished and missing the banquet but not cel he and his would be allowed to enjoy the banquet before his sentence was carried out unseelie etiquette if you were prince the queen began to eat the rest of us ate the queen took her first sip of wine we drank she paused in sipping her soup and looked at me it was not an angry look more puzzled but it certainly wasnt a happy look she leaned in very close to me close enough that her lips brushed my ear fuck one of them tonight meredith or you will be joining cel i drew back enough to see her face shed known all along that galen and i hadnt made love but shed helped me save him from conris challenge and for that i was grateful still andais did nothing without a motive and i had to wonder why this act of mercy i would have loved to ask her but the queens mercy is a fragile thing like a bubble floating on the air if you poked at it too much it would simply burst and cease to be i would not prod this piece of kindness i would simply accept it chapter we were back in the black coach when the darkness still pressed against the sky but there was a feel of dawn on the air almost like the taste of salt in the air near the sea you couldnt see it but all the same you knew it was there dawn was coming and i for one was glad there were things in the unseelie court that could not come out in the light of day things that cel could send after me though doyle thought it doubtful that the prince would try anything else tonight but technically cels punishment wouldnt begin until tomorrow night so the three months had not yet begun which meant that when the men went to pack theyd gotten all their weapons frost practically clanked when he walked the others were a little more subtle but not by much frosts greatsword geamhradh pogwinter kisswas propped between him and the car door even strapped to his back the sword was too long to wear sitting in a car it wasnt a killing weapon like mortal dread but it could steal a feys passion leaving them cold and barren as a winter snow there had been a time when to be passionless without his or her spark would have frightened a fey more than death doyle drove and rhys rode in front with him doyle had ordered rhys to ride in back with the rest of us but frost had insisted that he be allowed in the back that had been odd now he sat in the far corner of the seat pressed against the door spine stiff all that silver hair shimmering in the dimness galen sat on the other side most of his wounds were almost healed and the ones that werent were hidden under fresh jeans hed put on a white tank top underneath a pale green dress shirt the shirt was tucked into his jeans but unbuttoned so the heavy ribbed material of the tank top showed the only thing that remained of the court was the kneehigh boots of soft soft hide dyed a deep forest green the braid that decorated the tops of the boots dangled down in two beaded strings making them look very native american the brown leather jacket that hed had for years was folded across his knees there was room on the seat for kitto but he had curled himself into a corner of the floorboard hugging his knees tight to his chest galen had loaned him a longsleeved dress shirt to cover the metallic thong he was wearing the shirt was huge on him white sleeves flapping down over his hands all i could see were his small bare feet sticking out from under the cloth he looked about eight huddled there in the dark to questions like are you all right are you sure he answered yes mistress that seemed to be his answer to everything but it was obvious that he was miserable for some reason i gave up trying to pry information from him i was tired and my ankle ached no my foot and my leg ached all the way up to my knee rhys and galen had taken turns holding ice on my ankle during the afterdinner entertainment the dance that was supposed to help me choose among the men had been a bust because i couldnt dance even without the ankle i felt unwell and achingly tired i leaned against galens shoulder half dozing he raised his arm to put it over my shoulders but stopped in midmotion ouch he said the bites still hurt i asked he nodded and slowly lowered his arm yeah i am not wounded frosts voice turned us to him what i asked i am not wounded he said i stared at him his face was its usual arrogant perfection from impossibly high cheekbones to the strong jaw with its hint of dimple it was a face that should have gone with a straight thin line of lips instead the lips were full sensual the dimple and the mouth saved his face from being utterly stern at that moment his face was set in as harsh a line as id ever seen it his back very straight one hand gripping the door handle so tightly that you could see the strain in his arm he had looked at me to make the offer but now he turned giving me only his profile i watched him sitting there and realized that the killing frost was nervous nervous of me there was something fragile in the way he held himself as if it had cost him dearly to offer me his shoulder to lean against i glanced back at galen he raised his eyebrows tried to shrug and stopped in midmotion he settled for a shake of his head nice to know that galen didnt know what was going on either i wasnt comfortable enough with frost to tuck my head against his shoulder but but he could have gone out the door saved himself when the thorns attacked but he hadnt he had stayed with us with me i had no illusions that frost had been harboring some deep love for me in secret all these years that just wasnt true but the geas had been lifted and if i said yes sex was a possibility for frost for the first time in a very long time hed insisted on riding in back with me and now hed offered his shoulder for me to lean upon frost in his own way was trying to court me it was kind of awkwardly sweet but frost was not sweet he was arrogant and full of pride it must have cost him dearly to make even such a small overture if i turned down the offer would he ever risk himself again would he ever offer himself to me in even a small way again i couldnt crush him like that and even as i thought it i knew how much frost would hate that what prompted me to scoot across the car seat wasnt lust or his physical beauty but something very close to pity i slid across the seat and he raised his arm so i could slide underneath he was a little taller than galen so it really wasnt his shoulder i laid my head against but the upper swell of his chest the sheer material of his shirt was scratchy against my cheek and i just couldnt relax id never been this close to frost and it was awkward it was like we couldnt get comfortable together he felt it too because we both kept making small adjustments he moved his hand from my back to my waist i tried my head higher on his chest lower on his chest i tried snuggling my body closer to him and farther away nothing worked i finally laughed he stiffened arm tense against my back i heard him swallow goddess he was nervous i started to go up on my knees beside him but remembered my ankle and could only tuck one foot underneath me carefully so the high heel didnt snag either my one remaining thighhigh or the satin of my panties frost was giving me just his profile again i touched his chin and turned him to face me from inches away even in the dark i saw the pain in his eyes someone somewhere had done him a hurt it was there naked and still bleeding in his eyes i felt my face soften the laughter sliding away the reason i laughed i said was because i know why you laughed he said and pulled away from me he tucked himself against the car door though he stayed upright and stiff it reminded me of how kitto was huddling on the floorboard i touched his shoulder gently that thin veil of hair had fallen across his shoulders it was like touching silk the color of his hair was so harshly metallic that i hadnt expected it to be so soft it was softer than galens curls a totally different texture he was watching me pet his hair i looked up at him its just that were at that awkward firstdate phase weve never held hands or hugged or kissed and we dont know how to be comfortable with each other yet galen and i took care of all the little preliminaries years ago he turned away from me sliding his hair out of my hands though i dont think he meant to he stared stolidly out the window though it acted as a black mirror showing his face to me like one of the white ladies of the court how does one overcome this awkwardness you must have dated once i said he shook his head it has been over eight hundred years for me meredith eight hundred i said i thought it was a thousand since the geas went into effect he nodded without turning around staring at his reflection in the window i was her chosen consort eight hundred years ago i serviced her for my three times nine years then she chose someone else there was the slightest hesitation in his voice when he said the last i didnt know i said me either galen said frost just stared out the window as if fascinated by the reflection in his own grey eyes i was like galen for the first two hundred years teasing the court women then she chose me and when she cast me aside it was so much harder to abstain the memory of her body of what we his voice trailed away so i do nothing i touch no one i have touched no one in over eight hundred years i have kissed no one held no ones hand he pressed his forehead against the glass i dont know how to stop i raised up on one knee until my face floated beside his in the window i rested my chin on his shoulder a hand on either side of him you mean you dont know how to start i said he raised his face and looked at my reflection beside his yes he whispered i slid my arms across his shoulders hugged the feel of him against my body i wanted to say i was sorry that shed done that to him i wanted to voice my pity but knew that if he once smelled pity that it would be over he might never open himself up to me again i rubbed my cheek against the unbelievable softness of his hair its all right frost its going to be all right he rested his head against my cheek and i felt his shoulders relax in the curve of my arms i wrapped my hands across his chest one hand grasping my other wrist slowly tentatively he slid his hands over mine and when i didnt move or tense he held my hands pressed them against his chest his palms were sweating oh so slightly his heart beat so hard i could feel it pulsing against my hands i touched my lips to his cheek almost too light to be called a kiss his breath ran out in a long sigh that made his chest rise and fall under my hands he turned his head and that one small movement put our faces close so close i looked into his eyes caressed his face with my gaze as if id memorize it and in a way that was what i was doing this was the first caress the first kiss it would never come again never be this new again frost could have closed that small distance with his lips but he didnt his eyes studied my face as i studied his but he made no move to finish it i was the one who leaned into him closed the distance between our mouths i kissed him soft his lips were utterly still against mine only his halfparted mouth and the frantic beat of his heart let me know that he wanted this i started to pull back and his hand slid up my arm until he cradled the back of my head he balled his hand into my hair squeezing feeling the thick hair as id felt the silk of his earlier his eyes were just a little wide flashing white he lowered my face back to his mouth we kissed and this time he kissed me back his lips pressed against my mouth he turned his shoulders into me so that i half spilled across one broad shoulder i opened my mouth to the press of his lips flicking my tongue a small wet touch his mouth opened to me and the kiss grew his hand stayed in my hair but the other hand swept around my waist and spilled me into his lap he kissed me as if he would eat me from the mouth down i could feel the muscles in his neck working under my hands as he kissed me with lips and tongue as if his mouth had parts id never felt before i turned in his arms sitting more solidly in his lap it brought a sound low in his throat and his hands were at my waist lifting me upward so that my legs swung to either side of his and i was suddenly kneeling with a leg on either side of him with the kiss in one unbroken wet line my bad ankle brushed the seat and i had to come up for a complete breath frost pressed his face against my upper chest his breathing came in ragged gasps i held his face against me arms around his shoulders i was blinking as if id been asleep galen was nearly openmouthed id been afraid hed be jealous but he was too astonished to be jealous that made two of us who were astonished i could hardly believe that it was frost i held in my arms that it was frost whose mouth seemed to leave a memory like a burn against my mouth kitto looked at me with his huge blue eyes and the look on his face wasnt astonished it was heated i remembered that he didnt know that he wasnt getting real sex tonight galen recovered first he applauded and said with an edge of nervous laughter in his voice on a scale of one to ten i give it a twelve and all i was doing was watching frost hugged me to him still breathing as if hed run a long way he spoke with an edge of gasping to it as if he hadnt quite recovered i thought id forgotten how to do that i laughed then a low rich sound the kind of laughter that will turn a mans head in a bar but this wasnt pretend my body was still pulsing with too much blood too much heat i held frost against my body the weight of his face on my upper chest his mouth leaning downward so the heat of his breath seemed to burn through the thin cloth of my shirt and i more than half wanted his mouth to go lower kissing across my breasts i found my voice trust me frost you havent forgotten a thing i laughed again and if you ever kissed better than this im not sure id survive it id like to be jealous galen said i was all set to be jealous but damn frost can you just teach me how to do it frost raised his head up so he could see my face and the look on his face was full of a shining pleasure with an edge of something dark and satisfied in his eyes it changed his face into something more human but no less perfect his voice was soft low intimate as he said and that was just the touch of my flesh no power no magic i stared down into his eyes and swallowed suddenly i was the one who was nervous it was magical frost all on its own my voice sounded breathy he blushed a pale pink flush from his throat to his forehead it was perfect i kissed him on the forehead and let him help me bring my injured ankle back over his lap i sat back down on the seat with frosts arm around my shoulders my body fit in the curve of his arm as if id always been there see all comfy i said yes he said and even that one word held a warmth that made my stomach and lower things clench you need to prop that foot up galen said i volunteer my lap he patted his leg i stretched my legs out and he put my feet on his legs but it was awkward with me sitting up against frost my back doesnt bend that way i said if you dont elevate the ankle its going to swell galen said keep your feet in my lap and lie down im sure frost wont mind if you put your head in his lap that last came out with a nice edge of sarcasm no frost said i dont mind if he got the sarcasm it didnt show in his voice i laid down keeping a hand on my skirt so it didnt slide up with my legs elevated in galens lap i was very glad for the long skirt which made it all more modest i was tired enough that modest was just about the right speed i rested my head on frosts thigh my temple cradled against his stomach his hand slid across my stomach until his fingers touched my hand and we held hands as i gazed up at his face the look was almost too intimate i moved my head to one side cheek resting full against his thigh his free hand played with the hair on the side of my face fingers gently pulling can i take off your other shoe galen asked i looked down the length of my body at him why he raised his hips slightly and i felt the stiletto heel press into flesh that was far too soft to be thigh he kept himself pressed against the sharp heel his gaze like a weight on my face the heels a little sharp he said then stop pressing yourself against it i said it still hurts to move around merry he said im sorry galen you can take the shoe off his smile flashed he slipped the shoe off my foot holding it up shaking his head i like the way you look in heels but flats might have saved your ankle shes lucky that was all that twisted frost said it was a powerful if poorly constructed spell i nodded my head snuggling against the bend of his leg yes it was like shooting at squirrels with buckshot youll kill them but there isnt much left to eat cel has power but very little control frost said are we sure it was cel galen asked we both looked at him arent you i asked im just saying we shouldnt put everything at cels door hes your enemy but he may not be the only one i dont want us to be looking so hard in cels direction that we miss something important well said frost said gee galen that was almost like a smart thing to say i said galen slapped the top of my foot gently compliments like that will get you nowhere near my body i thought briefly of pressing my foot into his groin and kneading to prove that i was already close to his body but i didnt he was hurt and it would just pain him to no purpose kitto was watching us all with an intense blue stare there was something in his face the way he held himself so attentive that i was betting hed be able to repeat everything wed done everything wed said would he tell kurag how much mine was he he caught me looking at him and his eyes stared into mine the look was not fearful it was bold expectant hed been more relaxed since id kissed frost though i wasnt sure why my stare seemed to make kitto grow more bold he crept forward toward me his eyes flicked to galen then to frost but he knelt on the floorboard legs straddling the hump in the middle he spoke very carefully keeping his mouth as closed as he could to hide the fangs and the forked tongue you have fucked the greenhaired sidhe tonight i started to protest but galen touched my leg squeezing slightly he was right we didnt know how much we could trust the goblin you have kissed the s in kiss was the first sibilance hed allowed in the speech and it made him hesitate he started over you have kissed the silverhaired sidhe tonight i would ask permission to uphold the goblins honor in this matter until we share flesh the treaty between you and my king is not finalized hold your tongue goblin frost said no i said its all right frost kittos actually being very polite for a goblin their culture is very bold when it comes to sex besides hes right if anything happens to kitto before we can share flesh the goblins are free of the treaty kitto bowed until his forehead touched the seat hair brushing along frosts hand where he still held mine he rubbed his head against the seat along the line of my body like a cat i tapped his head dont get any ideas about doing it in the car im not into group sex he raised up slowly those drowning blue eyes staring at me when we get to the hotel he made it a question shes injured galen said i think it can wait no i said we need the goblins i could feel galen tense just through the hand on my leg i dont like it you dont have to like it galen just acknowledge the practicality of it i do not like the thought of the goblin touching you either frost said but it would be a simple thing to assassinate the goblin they are easier to kill than a sidhe if you use magic i looked at kittos delicate body i knew he could trade blows with almost anything and limp away but magic that wasnt a goblins strong point i was tired so tired but id worked hard for the alliance with the goblins i wasnt going to lose it now through squeamishness the question was what piece of my body was i willing to let him sink those fangs into i wasnt going to lose a pound of flesh but a bite which kitto was within his rights to take where would you want someone to take a bite of you chapter i couldnt walk because of my ankle doyle carried me into the hotel lobby kitto stayed very close to me rhys had made a nasty comment on the way inside if rhys continued to carry a grudge against all goblins it was going to make things harder than they already were i didnt need harder i needed something to be easier what was waiting in the lobby was not easier griffin was sitting in one of the overstaffed chairs long legs stretched out so that the back of his head rested against the back of the chair his eyes were closed when we entered as if he were asleep his thick wavy coppercolored hair spilled just to his shoulders i remembered when it had hit his ankles and id mourned when he cut it id avoided searching the crowd for him tonight a glance was enough to prove that that deep nearly auburn red hair wasnt in the room why was he here why hadnt he been at the banquet i watched him with his line of black lashes closed on the pale face he was wasting glamour to pass for human but even dulled by his own magic he was a shining thing he was dressed in jeans with the bottoms of cowboy boots showing a white dress shirt buttoned up and a jean jacket with leather touches at shoulder and arm i waited for my chest to tighten my breath to catch at the sight of him because he wasnt asleep he was posing so that i could get the full effect but my chest was just fine my breath didnt catch doyle had stopped with me in his arms just short of the imitation oriental rug that the chairs sat upon i stared down at griffin from doyles arms and was empty seven years of my life and i could look at him now and feel nothing but an aching emptiness a wistful sort of sadness that i had wasted all that time all that energy on this man id been afraid to see him again afraid that all those old feelings would come flooding back or that id be furious with him but there was nothing i would always have sweet memories of his body and less sweet memories of his betrayal but the man that sat so carefully posed was not my love anymore the realization was both a profound relief and a great sorrow he opened his eyes slowly that smile curling his lips the smile made my chest hurt because once i had believed that that special smile was meant just for me the look in his honeybrown eyes was familiar as well too familiar he looked at me as if id never gone away he looked at me with the same surety that galen had had earlier his eyes filled with a knowledge of my body and the promise that he would have access to it soon that killed any kindness i might still have felt for him the silence had gone on a little too long but i didnt feel the need to break it i knew if i simply said nothing griffin would break first hed always been fond of the sound of his own voice he stood in one fluid motion slouching just a touch so he didnt look his six feet three he flashed me the full smile the one that made his eyes crinkle and showed that flash of dimple in one cheek i stared at him face immobile it helped that i was so tired i could barely think but it was more than that i felt empty inside and i let it show in my face i let him see that he meant nothing to me though knowing griffin he wouldnt believe it he stepped forward one hand outstretched as if hed take my hand i stared at him until his hand dropped away and for the first time he looked uncomfortable his gaze slid over all of us then came back to rest on me the queen insisted i not be there tonight she thought it might upset you the surety was sinking away from his eyes leaving him anxious what did i miss tonight what are you doing here griffin i said my voice was as empty as my heart he shifted from one foot to the other it was obvious that this reunion wasnt going the way hed planned the queen said shed lifted the geas on the guard for you his eyes flicked to doyle to the others he frowned at the goblin he didnt like any of this he didnt like me in someone elses arms there was a small flare of satisfaction petty but true how does the geas being lifted for me and me alone answer my question griffin he frowned at me why are you here i asked the queen said she told you that shed be sending one guard of her choosing along he tried the smile again and it faded as i stared at him are you trying to tell me that the queen has sent you as her spy his face raised that smooth chin jutting out it was a sure sign that he wasnt happy i thought youd be pleased merry there are a lot of guards that would be worse to share your bed with i shook my head leaned my face against doyles shoulder i am too tired for this what do you want us to do meredith doyle asked griffins eyes hardened and i knew that doyle had used my first name deliberatelynot a title but my name it made me smile take me up to the room and contact the queen i will not be forced to share a bed with him again not for any reason griffin took a step toward us hand stroking my hair doyle moved me out of his reach with a turn of his shoulders she was my consort for seven years griffin said and there was anger in his voice now then you should have valued her as the precious gift she is go away griffin i said ill get the queen to send someone else he moved in front of doyle blocking our way to the elevators merry merry dont you feel anything i finished for him i feel like getting out of this lobby before we attract a crowd he looked toward the desk the latenight attendant was giving us all her attention a man had come and joined her as if they were afraid thered be trouble i am here at the queens orders only she can send me away not you i stared into his angry eyes and laughed fine fine lets all troop up to the room and call her from there are you sure doyle said if you wish him to stay in the lobby we can make it so there was the faintest edge to his words and i realized that doyle wanted to hurt griffin wanted an excuse to punish him i dont think it was personal over me i think it was more that griffin had had what they all wanted access to a woman that adored him and hed thrown it away while all they could do was watch frost moved up at doyles back kitto followed him rhys moved in from the other side and galen began to edge around to come at griffin from the back griffin was suddenly tense his hand went to the edge of his belt and started to slide out of sight under the jacket doyle said if your hand goes out of sight ill assume you mean us harm you dont want me to assume that griffin griffin tried to keep them all in sight but hed allowed them to flank him you couldnt look at every side of a circle it was too careless for words and griffin was many things but not careless for the first time i wondered if he had truly felt distress at our breakup enough distress to make him careless enough distress to get him hurt or even dead the idea was sort of amusing in a sociopathic sort of way but i didnt want him dead i just wanted him away from me as amusing as it would be to watch you beat the shit out of each other lets not and just say we did what are your orders doyle asked everybody upstairs contact the queen clean up a little then well see as you like princess doyle said he carried me toward the elevators the others came behind forming a sort of halfcircular net to sweep griffin at our backs without being told rhys and galen took up posts to either side of griffin as we entered the elevator doyle stood to one side back to the mirrored walls so he could see both griffin and the closed doors frost mirrored him on the other side of the doors kitto kept eyeing griffin as if hed never seen him before griffin leaned his shoulders against the wall arms crossed on his chest ankles crossed the picture of casual ease but his eyes werent casual there was a stiffness to his shoulders that no amount of pretense could hide i looked at him between galen and rhys he was the taller by three inches and a lot more than that for rhys he caught me watching and he threw off his glamour slowly like a striptease id seen him do it nude too many times to count it was like watching a light spread from under his skin his feet first always then up the muscled ridge of his calves to the strong thighs up up his body until every inch of him glowed like polished alabaster with a candle inside it so bright that there were almost shadows cast from the glow of his skin the memory of his body nude and shining was burned on the inside of my head and closing my eyes didnt help it had been too dear a memory for too long i opened my eyes and watched his copperred hair glow as if it had thin metallic wire running through it the thick large waves in his hair crackled and moved with his power the eyes werent honeybrown they were tricolored brown around the pupil liquid gold then a burnished bronze the sight of him all aglow did make me catch my breath he would always be beautiful no amount of hatred could take that away from him but beauty wasnt enough not enough by half no one said a word until the elevator stopped then galen grabbed griffins arm and rhys checked the hallway before doyle carried me out why the caution griffin asked what happened tonight rhys checked the door then took the key card from me and opened the door he checked the room while we all waited out in the hall if doyles arms were getting tired from lugging me around it didnt show the rooms clear rhys said he took griffins other arm and they escorted him into the room the rest of us followed doyle laid me on the bed so i was sitting against the headboard he took a pillow out from the blue covers and propped it under my ankle he took off his cloak and laid it at the foot of the bed he was still wearing the leather and metalstudded harness across his bare chest the silver earrings still glittered in his curved ears the peacock feathers still brushed his shoulders it occurred to me for the first time that id never seen doyle any different than he was right now oh the clothes but i wasnt sure if he was using glamour or not doyle didnt try to be other than what he was i looked at griffin still glowing still beautiful galen and rhys had made him sit in a chair galen leaned on the small table by the chair rhys leaned against the wall none of them were glowing but i knew that galen at least wasnt trying to pass for human kitto climbed onto the bed curling beside me one hand sliding across my waist dangerously close to my lap but he didnt try to take advantage he curled his face against my hip and seemed content as if he meant to sleep frost sat down on the far side of the bed legs still on the floor but not leaving the bed to just the goblin he crossed his hands over his chest just below the blood stains he sat there tall and straight and heartstoppingly handsome but he didnt glow the way griffin glowed i had a sudden revelation griffin hadnt removed glamour hed added it all those times that i thought he was throwing off all trickery he was actually wrapping himself in the greatest trick of all most sidhe couldnt use glamour to make themselves look better to other sidhe you could try it but it was wasted effort even with me having come into my power he glowed but now i could see it for what it truly wasa lie i closed my eyes leaning my head back against the wall drop the glamour griffin just sit there like a good little boy my voice sounded tired even to me he is very good at it doyle said maybe the best ive ever seen i opened my eyes and looked at doyle glad to know the show wasnt just for my benefit i was feeling pretty stupid doyle glanced at the rest of the room gentlemen he glows galen said like a lightning bug in june rhys said frost nodded i touched kittos hair do you see him i asked kitto raised his head eyes halfclosed all the sidhe are beautiful to me he snuggled his face back against me and it was a little lower than my hip that he was cuddling against i looked at griffin still gleaming and so beautiful that i wanted to shield my eyes as if i were gazing at the sun i wanted to scream at him things about lies and trickery but i didnt anger would have convinced him that i still felt something for him i didntor rather not what he wanted me to feel i felt tricked and stupid and angry contact the queen doyle i said the dresser sat in front of the bed with the large mirror facing me doyle stood in the center of the mirror i could still see myself in the glass i stared back at myself and wondered why i didnt look more different oh my hair needed to be brushed the makeup needed to be retouched the lipstick was gone completely but my face was still the same my innocence had vanished years ago and there was very little surprise left in me all i truly felt was a great numbness doyle pressed his hands just above the glass i felt his magic crawl through the room like a prickle of ants marching along my skin kitto raised his head to watch resting his cheek against my thigh the power built to a push of pressure as if you could clear it by making your ears pop equalizing the pressure but the only thing that would make the pressure ease was use doyle caressed the mirror and it wavered like water his fingertips were like stones thrown into a pool where the ripples spread outward he made a small gesture with his hands a flexing at wrist and hand and the mirror was no longer clear the surface was milky like a cup of fog the mist cleared and the queen sat on the edge of her bed looking at us through the fulllength mirror in her private quarters shed removed her gloves but the rest of the outfit was intact shed been waiting for the call id have bet a body part on it eamons naked shoulder showed to one side of her he was turned on one side as if asleep the blond boy was kneeling beside her propped on his elbows he was naked too but he wasnt under the covers his body was strong but thin a boys body without the musculature of a man i wondered again if he was really eighteen doyle had stepped aside so that i was the first one that the queens eyes sought greetings meredith her eyes took in the scene the halfdressed goblin and frost on the bed with me she smiled and it was a pleased smile i realized that the two scenes were similar she had two men in her bed and i had two men in mine i hoped she was having a better time than i was or maybe i didnt greetings aunt andais i thought youd be all tucked into bed with one or more of your boys you disappoint me she stroked her hand along the boys bare back sweeping at the end of the oval fingertips across his buttocks it was an idle gesture like youd pet a dog my voice came out very neutral carefully empty griffin was here when we arrived he says you sent him i did she said you agreed to sleep with my spy i didnt agree to sleep with griffin i thought after our little talk you understood how i felt about him no andais said no i didnt understand that at all in fact i wasnt sure you knew how you felt about him yourself i dont feel anything about him i said i just want him out of my sight and i am certainly not going to sleep with him i realized as soon as i said the last part that she might insist on it out of sheer perversity i added quickly i want to know hes celibate again he was freed of the geas ten years ago so he could sleep with me but he used his freedom to fuck everyone that would have him i want him to know that im sleeping with the other guards that theyre getting sex and hes not that unless i consent to lie with him that he may never have sex again for the rest of his so unnatural life i smiled as i spoke and realized it was the truth goddess bless me it was vindictive but it was true andais laughed again oh meredith you may be more my bloodline than i ever dared hope as you will send him back to his lonely bed you heard her i said get out if its not me griffin said it will be someone else maybe you should ask her who she will send to replace me in your bed i looked at my aunt who are you going to send to replace griffin she held out her hand and a man stepped into view as if hed been patiently waiting for his cue his skin was the color of soft spring lilacs his kneelength hair the color of pink easteregg grass his eyes were like pools of liquid gold it was pasco rozenwyns twin brother i stared at him and he stared back we had never been friends in fact there was a time or two id thought we were enemies griffin laughed you cant be serious merry youd let pasco fuck you before me i stared at griffin hed stopped glowing and looked almost ordinary as he stood there he was angry so angry that there was a fine tremble in his hands as he pointed to the mirror griffin honey i said id let a hell of a lot of men in my bed before you the queen laughed drawing pasco down until he sat in her lap like a child visiting santa claus in the mall she stared out at me running her hands through pascos cottoncandy hair you agree to pasco as my spy i agree pascos eyes widened just a bit at that as if hed expected at least a little protest on my part but i just wasnt up to it tonight andais caressed a hand up pascos clothed back i think you have surprised him he told me youd never agree to sharing a bed with him i shrugged its not a fate worse than death very true niece of mine our eyes met through the nothing of the mirror she nodded and pushed the man to his feet she slapped his butt as he walked out of frame hell be right over great i said now get out griffin griffin hesitated then walked into view of the mirror he glanced from one to the other of us he opened his mouth as if to say something then closed it probably the wisest thing he could have done he bowed my queen he turned to me i will see you again merry i shook my head what for you did love me once he said and it was almost a question almost a plea i could have liedthere was no spell on mebut i didnt yes griffin i loved you once he looked at me eyes roving over the bed and the smorgasbord of men i am sorry merry he sounded sincere sorry you lost me sorry you killed my love for you or sorry that you cant fuck me anymore all of it he said im sorry for all of it good boy now get out i said something passed across his face something close to pain and for the first time i thought that maybe just maybe he understood what hed done was wrong he unlocked the door stepped outside and when the door closed behind him i knew he was gone gone in a way beyond simply not being around he was not my honey bun anymore not my special person i sighed and leaned back against the wall kitto snuggled close sliding one bare leg up and down against mine i wondered if there was a chance in hell of me getting any alone time tonight i looked at the mirror again you knew i wouldnt accept griffin as your spy not if it meant having sex with him she nodded i needed to know how you truly felt about him meredith i had to be sure that you werent still in love with him why i asked because love can interfere with lust now im sure that you are rid of him in your heart i am pleased im just tickled pink that youre pleased i said have a care meredith i dont like sarcasm directed at me and i dont like having my heart cut out for your pleasure the moment i said it i knew it was a mistake her eyes narrowed when i cut your heart out meredith youll know it the mirror spilled into fog then was suddenly reflective again i stared at myself in the mirror my pulse thudding in my throat having your heart cut out galen said poor poor choice of words i know i said in the future doyle said keep your temper andais doesnt need any help coming up with awful ideas i pushed kitto away i lifted my foot off the bed carefully using the bedside table to stand up what are you doing doyle asked i am going to clean some of this blood and dirt off then go to bed i looked at the men gathered in the room who wants to help me run my bath the silence was suddenly very thick the men looked at one another as if not sure what to do or say galen stepped forward gave me his hand to help me stand i took the hand but shook my head you cant be with me tonight galen it has to be someone who can finish what we start he looked at the floor for a second or two then up oh he helped me back to the bed and i let him do it then he walked to the chair where hed thrown his leather jacket im going to see about getting a second room next to this one then im going for a walk whos going with me they all looked at each other again little eye flits from one to the other no one seemed to know how to handle the situation how does the queen choose between you all i asked she simply requests the guard or guards she wishes to have for the evening doyle said dont you have a preference frost asked and there was something almost hurt in his tone you say that like theres a bad choice here there is no bad choice you are all lovely i have had my release with meredith doyle said so i will bow out for tonight that got everyones attention and doyle had to explain very briefly exactly what he meant by the comment frost and rhys looked at each other and suddenly there was a tension in the air that hadnt been there before whats wrong i asked you must choose meredith frost said why i asked galen answered you cant bring it down to just two of us without the danger of a duel its not just two its three i said they all looked at me then slowly at the goblin still on the bed he looked as surprised as they did he stared back at us with large eyes he looked almost frightened i would never presume to compete with the sidhe kitto is coming in the bathroom regardless of who else comes in i said every pair of eyes in the room swiveled back to me what did you say doyle asked you heard me i want the alliance with the goblins sealed that means i have to share flesh with kitto and thats what im going to do galen went for the door ill be back later wait for me rhys said youre leaving i asked as much as i want you merry i dont do goblins he walked out with galen they shut the door behind them and doyle locked it does this mean youre staying i asked i will guard the outer door doyle said what if we wish to use the bed frost asked doyle looked thoughtful then shrugged i can wait just outside the room if you feel the need of the bed there was a little more negotiating frost wanted it clear that he did not have to touch the goblin i agreed frost picked me up and carried me into the bathroom kitto was already in the room running the water for the bath he glanced up as we entered hed taken off galens shirt and was back to just his silver thong he said nothing to us just watched us with his huge blue eyes one hand trailing under the water as it poured from the faucet frost looked around the small room he finally sat me on the counter by the sink he stood in front of me and suddenly it was awkward the kiss in the car had been wonderful but it was the first time frost and i had ever touched each other now suddenly we were supposed to have sexwith an audience awkward isnt it i said he nodded the movement sent that thin veil of silver hair gliding around his body he reached out slowly tentatively to the dresss jacket he pushed the velvet off my shoulders slowly sliding it over my arms i started to help him with the sleeves but he said no let me i put my hands back at my sides and he pulled the sleeves off one hand then the other he dropped the jacket to the floor he ran the tips of his fingers down the bare skin of my shoulders it raised goose bumps down to my fingertips undo your hair i said he took out the first bone clip then the second and the hair fell around him in a glorious spill of christmastree tinsel i reached out and grabbed a handful of it it looked like silver wire but it felt soft as satin with a texture like spun silk he stepped close enough that his legs brushed mine he ran his hands over my bare arms his touches were so tentative as if he was afraid to caress me if you will lean forward i will unzip the dress i did what he asked leaning my head against his chest the sheer material of his shirt was scratchy but his hands as they unzipped the dress were slow gentle his fingertips slid inside the open dress circling the smooth skin of my back i tried to pull the shirt out of his pants but it wouldnt budge i cant get the shirt out it is fastened so it lies smoothly he said fastened i made the word a question i would have to take the pants off to get the shirt off he was blushing a wonderful pale red rose color whats wrong frost the bathwater stopped running kitto said the water is ready mistress thank you kitto i looked at frost answer the question frost whats wrong he looked down all that shining hair acting like a curtain he turned away from me to face the far wall so even the goblin couldnt see his face frost please dont make me hop down from the counter to make you look at me i dont need to twist another ankle he spoke without turning around i do not trust myself with you in what way i asked in the way of a man with a woman i still wasnt understanding him i still dont understand frost he turned suddenly to face me eyes a dark storm grey with anger i want to fall on you like some ravening beast i dont want to be gentle i just want are you saying you dont trust yourself not to i searched for a word but had to settle for rape me he nodded i laughed i couldnt help it i knew he wouldnt like the laughter but i just couldnt help it his face grew arrogant distant eyes cold but still angry what do you want of me meredith frost forgive me but you cant rape the willing he frowned at that as if he didnt understand the phrasing i want to have sex with you tonight thats the plan how can that be rape he shook his head sending the hair sliding around him sparkling in the light you do not understand i do not trust that i can control myself in what way in every way he turned away again hugging himself i finally began to get an inkling of what he was trying to say are you concerned that you wont last long enough for my pleasure that and what frost what he wants to fuck you kitto said we both looked at the goblin still kneeling by the bathtub i know that i said kitto shook his head not sex just fucking hes been so long without he just wants to do it i looked at frost he was avoiding my eyes is that what you want he hung his head hiding behind all that hair i want to strip off your panties put you up against the sink and just be inside you i dont feel gentle tonight meredith i feel halfcrazed then do it i said he turned and stared at me what did you say do it just the way you want it eight hundred years youre entitled to a little fantasy he frowned but it wont be enjoyable for you let me worry about that you forget that im descended from fertility gods as many times as you go inside me i can bring you back to need with a touch of my hand a tiny use of power just because we begin the night here doesnt mean we have to end it here you would let me do that i looked at him standing there with his broad shoulders the swell of his chest peeking through that glorious hair the narrow waist the tight hips encased in those sotight pants i thought about him dropping those pants of seeing him nude for the first time of having him push himself inside me urgent so full of need that he would touch nothing do nothing but shove himself inside me i had to let my breath go in a sigh before i could speak yes he crossed the room in two strides lifting me off the counter setting me on the floor i had to balance on the bad ankle but he didnt give me time to protest he pulled the dress off my arms in one abrupt movement i had to grab the edge of the counter to keep from falling he jerked the dress down letting it pool on the floor around my feet he grabbed the black satin of the panties and pulled them down too i could see kitto in the foggy mirror he watched everything with eager eyes utterly silent as if he didnt want to break the spell frost had to unlace the pants and it took time he was making a small noise low in his throat by the time he had gotten them unfastened and peeled down his body the shirt was fastened over his groin and he ripped the material away he was long and hard and more than ready i had a glimpse of him over my shoulder then his hands were on my waist turning me to face the fogged mirror i had a moment of feeling him sliding against me then he was inside me he shoved against the tightness of my body forcing himself into me id given him permission wanted him but with almost no foreplay it was still pain with the pleasure a bruising almost tearing pressure brought my breath in a gasp that was both pain and desire when he was sheathed inside me as far as he could go he whispered youre tightnot ready for mebut you are wet my voice came out breathy i know he drew himself out part way then in and after that there was nothing but his body inside mine his need was large and fierce and so was he he thrust into me as hard and as fast as he could the sound of flesh hitting flesh punctuated every thrust of his body it forced sounds from my throat from the sheer force of it and from the sensations as he moved inside me over me through me my body opened to him no longer tight just wet he used his hands to force my body down on the counter then lifted me so that most of my body was on the counter my feet were no longer touching the ground he pounded himself into me as if he were trying to force his way not just into my body but through and out the other side a tightness began to grow low in my body my breath coming faster flesh into flesh so hard and fast with such strength that it danced that thin line between pleasure and pain i kept expecting him to finish his need in one long glorious burst but he didnt he hesitated using large strong hands to move my hips along the counter a small adjustment as if he were looking for just the right spot then he thrust inside me again in one long hard movement and i cried out frost had found that spot inside my body and was running himself over it and over it and over it as hard and as fast as before but now he drew small sounds from me the tightness began to grow swell like a warm thing growing inside me it grew large and larger flowing outward along my skin as if a thousand feathers were being drawn down my skin to send me shivering twitching drawing noises from my mouth that were wordless thoughtless formless it was the song of flesh not love not even desire but something more primitive more primal i looked into the mirror and found my skin glowing my eyes startled full of greenandgold fire i could see frost in the mirror he was carved of ivory and alabaster a glowing shining play of white light pulsed against his skin as if the power would burst from him he caught me looking at him in the mirror and those glowing grey eyes like clouds with moonlight behind them turned angry he put his hand on my face turned me away so i couldnt watch him kept his hand there trapping me his other hand on my back his body pinning me i couldnt move couldnt get away couldnt stop him i didnt want to but i understood it was important to him that he be in control that he say when and how and even me looking at him was an intrusion this was his momenti was just the flesh that he drove himself into he needed for me to be nothing and no one except someone to fill his need i heard his breathing quicken his thrusts taking on an urgency harder faster until i cried out and still he didnt stop i felt the rhythm of his body change a shudder run through him then i was gone that swelling warmth spilled over me through me pulsing deep inside my body making my body contract jerking unable to control it only his hands on my body kept me still kept me whole but if my body couldnt move the pleasure had to come out some way it spilled out of my mouth in screams deep racking screams over and over as fast as i could draw breath frost cried out above me sending his cries after mine he leaned over the counter a hand on either side of me head down his hair spilled over my body like warm silk i lay totally passive still pinned under his body trying to relearn how to breathe he found his voice first though it was a ragged whisper thank you if id had enough breath id have laughed my throat was so dry that my voice sounded stiff trust me on this frost it was my pleasure he bent over and laid a kiss on my cheek i will try to do better next time he moved his hands away from me letting me move but stayed sheathed inside me as if he were reluctant to let that go i looked at him thinking he was joking but his face was utterly serious it gets better than this i asked he nodded solemnly oh yes the queen was a fool i said softly he smiled then i always thought so chapter i woke to a spill of silver hair stretched like glistening spiderwebs across my face i moved just my head leaving the hair to trail across my face frost lay on his stomach his face turned away from me the sheets lay in a twist around his waist leaving his upper body bare his hair trailed to one side like a second body lying between us and half across me of course there was a second body in the bed or rather a third kitto lay on my other side he was curled on his side facing away from me his body huddled around itself as if he were hiding from something in his dreams or maybe he was just cold because he lay naked beside me his body was pale like some perfect china doll id never been this close to a man that brought to mind words like petite my shoulder ached where hed left his mark a perfect set of his teeth marks set in the flesh of my shoulder the skin had bruised wonderfully around it reddish purple almost hot to the touch it wasnt poison just a really deep bite it would leave a scar and that was the point sometime during the third or fourth time with frost id invited kitto to us i had waited until frosts body brought me to a point where pain and pleasure merge and let kitto choose his bit of flesh it hadnt hurt when he did it which told how far gone id been last night it had hurt a little as we finally drifted off to sleep this morning it hurt more it wasnt the only thing that ached my body hurt telling me id abused it last night or rather that id let frost abuse it i reveled in the small pains stretching my body exploring exactly what hurt it was like the ache after a really good workout with weights and running except the muscle soreness was in different places i couldnt remember the last time id woken with the feel of sex riding my body like a silken bruise it had been too long kitto had been honored that i allowed him to mark me so that all would know i was his lover i dont know if he realized that he was never going to get intercourse from me but he hadnt asked last night in fact hed been utterly submissive doing only what was invited or asked never intruding he was the perfect audience because he simply wasnt there until called then he followed directions better than any man id ever been with i sat up and frosts hair spilled down my body like the brush of something alive i ran my hands through my own woefully short hair now that i was outed as princess meredith i could grow it out again my wrists hurt as i touched my hair and it had nothing to do with the sex the bandages at my wrists hadnt survived the bath last night and we should have redressed the wounds but this morning the marks of the thorns were scabbed over nearly healed as if they were a week or more old instead of hours i ran my fingers over the healing wounds i had never healed this fast before kitto must have bitten me after the fourth time otherwise it would have healed more assuming that the sex was what was healing me we still didnt know that for certain i had a small corner of sheet but the rest was wrapped around frost he was a cover hog it was chilly in the room i tugged at the covers and got only a small protesting noise for my troubles i stared down at the smooth expanse of his back and had an idea for how to get the covers away from him i ran my tongue down his back and he made a small sound i leaned over him drawing my tongue up his spine in a slow wet line frost raised his head from the pillow slowly like a man drawn from a deep dark dream his eyes were slightly unfocused but when he looked at me a slow pleased smile curled his lips havent you had enough i draped my naked body the length of his though the covers kept us from touching below the waist never i said he laughed a low pleasant chuckle and rolled onto his side propped on one elbow to look at me he also freed the covers i pulled them over the bed to cover kitto who still seemed to be deeply asleep frosts arm encircled my waist drawing me back down on the bed i laid back against the pillows and he bent down to place a soft kiss across my lips my hands slid over his shoulder his back pulling him against me his knee slid over my legs between them and hed made that first movement of his hips to slide on top of me when he froze the look on his face totally changed to something watchful almost frightened what is it frost quiet i was quiet he was the bodyguard was it cels people this was their last day to kill me without costing cel his life frost rolled off the bed snatching the sword winter kiss from the floor and crossing the room to the windows in a movement like blurred silver lightning i got my gun from under the pillows kitto was awake looking wildly around frost jerked the drapes back from the window and his sword was in midmotion toward the glass when he froze a man with a camera was on the outside of the window i had an instant to see him raise a startled face then frosts fist smashed through the window and grabbed the reporter by the neck frost no dont kill him i ran across the room naked the gun still in my hand the door behind us burst open and i turned gun pointed safety off at the door doyle stood in the doorway sword in hand we had a moment of eye contact where he saw the gun in my hand i pointed the gun at the floor and he kicked the door shut behind him and strode into the room he didnt sheathe his sword but tossed it on the bed as he moved toward frost the reporters face had turned that violent redpurple that said he wasnt able to breathe frosts face was unrecognizable torn with fury enraged frost youre killing him doyle came up beside him frost if you kill this reporter the queen will punish you for it frost didnt seem to be hearing either of us as if hed gone to a distant place and all that was left was his hand on the mans throat doyle stepped behind him and kicked him in the small of the back hard enough that frost fell into the window cracking more of the glass but he let go of the reporter he turned with blood running down his hand the look in his eyes feral doyle had gone into a fighting stance barehanded frost threw his sword on the floor and mirrored him kitto huddled in the middle of the bed and watched it all with wide eyes i went for the drapes intending to close them and i saw the reporters running like a pack of hounds toward us some were snapping pictures as they ran others screaming out princess princess meredith i closed the drapes so there was no gap for them to peer through but it wouldnt last we had to get into the room next door where galen and the rest had slept i sighted the gun on the wooden headboard of the bed to one side of the two guards kitto saw me and dived on the other side for the floor i fired the gun just once the report thunderous in the room it whirled the two men around staring and wildeyed i pointed the gun at the ceiling there are about a hundred reporters about to descend on us we have to get to the other room now no one argued with me frost kitto and i grabbed sheets and clothes and made it into the other room before the reporters started climbing in through the broken window doyle brought up the rear with the weapons he galen and rhys went back for the luggage i called the police and reported the reporters for breaking into our room the three of us who were naked took turns dressing in the bathroom not for modestys sake but because there were no windows in the bathroom when i stepped out of the bathroom with an armload of toiletries doyle and frost were sitting in the rooms only two chairs no one else was here they were both doing their typical guard face unreadable inscrutable but there was something about the way they held themselves something odd whats happened i asked i was walking normallyid forgotten my ankle was supposed to be sprained until galen had remarked on it neither of them spoke and that made me nervous the men glanced at each other doyle pushed to his feet he was wearing black jeans today spread over the tops of anklehigh black boots youd almost mistake them for dress shoes if you didnt know what you were looking at the shirt was a black dress shirt longsleeved it was silk and looked it shimmering against the blackness of his skin the black of his shoulder holster blended in perfectly with everything even the gun was black a beretta mm the older model his hair gave the illusion of being very short and cut close to his head it was in his usual tight braid curling down his back to be lost in the blackness of his jeans his high pointed ears gleamed with silver earrings in a shimmering display those and a small silver belt buckle were the only things that distracted from the total monochrome of his look hed added a silver chain on one ear with a small dangling ruby we have a problem he said like reporters taking pictures through the window of frost and me in bed together yes id say we have a problem it is not just the one reporter frost said i saw them like a pack of sharks on the scent of blood i started to put the small armful of toiletries away in the open suitcase that lay waiting on the bed ive been the subject of media attention but never like this frost crossed the legs of his grey dress slacks showing pale grey loafers but no socks frost would never wear dress slacks short enough to flash sockso déclassé the tailored jacket matched the pants and had a small pale blue show hankie in one pocket the shirt was white and held in place with a dove grey tie complete with a silver tie tack hed pulled his hair back in a tight ponytail leaving the strong clean lines of his face bare to the eye he was dazzlingly handsome without the hair to distract the eye he looked cool perfect not at all the same man whod nearly ground me into the bathroom tile last night but i knew the other frost was under there waiting for permission to come out i shoved the last of the toiletries in the suitcase closed it and started to zip it up i looked at the two men you guys look like something really really bad has happened something i dont know about yet where is everybody else frost answered they are guarding the door and the window they are trying to keep the media at bay but it is a losing battle meredith doyle leaned his hands on the dresser head hanging down the thick braid of his hair slid around his legs like some sort of pet youre scaring me just tell me whats happened frost touched the paper that was lying on the table next to him an idle gesture but is that the st louis postdispatch i asked doyle darted a look at frost who raised his hands showing them empty she has to know it is doyle said voice tight i talked to barry jenkins yesterday he said hed out me as the faerie princess i assume he was as good as his threat doyle turned leaning his butt against the dresser arms crossed so that his right hand caressed his gun it was a nervous gesture for him it looked like a threat when he stood behind the queen stroking his gun and it could be but it was also a nervous gesture i walked over to the table what is the big deal guys jenkins is an asshole but he wouldnt actively lie not in the post read it then tell me we have nothing to worry over doyle said the picture of galen and i at the airport was the lead photo front page but it was the caption that got me princess meredith returns home to find husband in smaller letters under the photo it read is this the one i turned to doyle and frost jenkins could be guessing galen and i knew there were photographers at the airport i stared from one to the other of them and they were still solemn worried what is wrong with the two of you weve all been in the papers before not like this frost said it gets better doyle said or worse read the article i started to browse the article but the first full paragraph stopped me griffin gave jenkins an interview my voice sounded breathy and i suddenly had to sit down on the edge of the bed goddess save us yes doyle said the queen has already been in contact with us she will see that he is punished for having broken your trust shes scheduled a press conference for tonight please meredith read the article doyle said i read the article i read it twice i didnt mind that griffin had given personal details but that hed done it without my permission hed shared my private life with everyone the sidhe have strange rules about privacy we dont value intimate secrets as humans do but our own personal life is not to be spied on spying on us used to bring a death penalty for griffin it still might the queen would think it very déclassé to have tattled to a reporter i ended simply sitting on the bed staring at the newsprint but not really seeing it i looked at the two men he gives details of our relationship hints dirty little hints im just lucky it was a legitimate paper and not some tabloid they looked at each other oh no please please tell me youre kidding frost reached behind his back as if hed been reading it as i came out of the bathroom he held it out to me i let the newspaper fall to the floor in a scattered heap and took the sleek colorful paper from him the picture on the front was one of griffin and me together in a bed only his hands kept my breasts from being fully exposed i was laughing we were both laughing i remembered the pictures i remembered his desire for the pictures i still had some of the pictures myself but not all of them not all of them i heard my voice and it sounded calm though far away how how did they get the article out so quickly i thought magazines didnt get out this fast apparently it can be done doyle said i stared at the picture the caption was princess meredith and her sidhe lovers sex secrets revealed please tell me that this is the only picture i am so sorry doyle said frost started to touch my hand as if to pat it then let his hand fall back there are no words for how sorry i am that he did this to you i looked into frosts grey eyes i saw compassion there but one thing i didnt see was anger and right now thats what i wanted does the queen know about this she knows doyle said i held it in my hands wanting to open it wanting to see what other pictures there were and i couldnt make myself open it i couldnt make myself look i shoved the paper into frosts hands how bad is it he looked up at doyle then back to me the arrogant distant mask slipped a little and the frost that id woken up with peeked from his eyes the tabloid didnt use any full frontal nudity other than that its bad i hid my face in my hands my elbows on my knees oh god if griffin would sell them to jenkins to the tabloids then he might sell them anywhere i raised up like a swimmer coming out of deep water it was suddenly hard to get my breath there are magazines in europe that would publish all of the pictures i didnt mind the nude photos but they were privatejust for griffin and me if id wanted to publish photos id have said yes to playboy years ago lord and lady how could griffin do this i had a horrible thought i looked to frost please tell me that you got the camera and the film from the reporter you tried to strangle this morning he met my eyes but he didnt want to im sorry meredith the camera should have been my first priority but i let my anger better my judgment i would do anything to make this up to you frost theyll publish the pictures do you understand that pictures of you and me and hell kitto in bed together theyll plaster them over the tabloids and the ones with nudity will go to europe i would have liked to swear or scream but i couldnt think of anything harsh enough to make me feel better griffin would know what the queen would do to him for this doyle said hell be lucky if she doesnt kill him i nodded trying to control my breathing forcing myself to concentrate on the rise and fall of my own chest i fought for calm but it wasnt happening today i nodded again hell do as much damage as he can before they catch him i took three quick gulping breaths and my voice came out strained but holding i assume hes fled the area we will find him frost said the world is not that big that made me laugh but the laughter turned into tears i slid off the chair onto the floor among the scattered pieces of the postdispatch it hurt to land so hard on the floor i was aching from the sex bruised the pain helped remind me that things were not that bad horrible but i still had access to the men of the court i was still welcome back in faerie the queen had given her wordand her powerto keep me from harm things could be worse or at least thats what i kept trying to tell myself i got my breathing under control but not my anger i did not mean him harm last night but now i grabbed the tabloid from frost and forced myself to look inside it wasnt the partial nudity that really cut me up it was the happiness in our faces our bodies wed been in love and it showed but if he could do this to me then hed never really loved me hed lusted after me desired me wanted to own me maybe but love love didnt do things like this i threw the pages up into the air and watched them flutter slowly back to earth i want him dead for this dont tell the queen that in a few days i may change my mind and i dont want her doing anything dramatic my voice was cold with anger the kind of anger that settles in your heart and never leaves hot rage runs through you and is close kin to hot passion but cold rage that is close kin to hate for this i hated griffin but not enough i dont want her to send me his head or heart in a basket i dont want that she may be planning to kill him anyway doyle said yes but if she does then its on her head not mine i wont ask for his death let her come up with it on her own frost knelt beside me gazing up at me with those stormgrey eyes he took my hands in his his hands felt warm which meant my hands were cold maybe i was more upset than i thought maybe i was in shock i am sure our queen has already decided his fate frost said no i said i stood pulling away from his hands from his eyes i hugged myself because i knew i could trust my own arms i was beginning to have doubts about everyone elses no if she catches him right away she might kill him but the longer he eludes capture the more creative shell get frost stayed kneeling on the ground looking up at me if i were he i think i would prefer to be captured soon while a quick death was still possible hell run i said hell run as far and as fast as he can hell delay and hope that some miracle will save him you know him that well frost asked i stared down into his face and laughed the laughter had a wild edge to it i thought i did maybe i never knew him at all maybe it was all just lies i stared at frost i was glad i didnt love him glad that it was just flesh at that moment i trusted lust more than i trusted love doyle stood taking my arms gently in his hands dont let griffin make you doubt yourself meredith dont let him make you doubt us i stared up into his dark face how did you know that was exactly what i was thinking because its exactly what i would be thinking in your place no it isnt youd be planning to kill him doyle hugged me to him resting his face against my hair i stayed tense against him but didnt pull away say that you wish his death and it will be so pick a body part of your choosing and i will fetch it for you we will fetch it for you frost said standing i relaxed enough against doyle to slide one arm around his waist i leaned my face against the silk of his shirt i could hear his heart beating solid and a little fast there was a knock on the door doyle nodded and frost moved to answer it doyle drew his gun then moved me to one side still in the curve of his arm so his body blocked me partially from view its galen open up frost checked the peephole a large nickelplated in one hand its him and rhys doyle nodded lowering his gun but not putting it away the tension level was high very high i think we were all expecting another attack from cel and company i know i was and i was only paranoid by necessity the guards were paranoid by profession kitto came in behind the two guards he was dressed in dark blue jeans a pale yellow polo shirt with a little alligator on the front and white jogging shoes everything looked brandnew stiff and fresh out of the package galen glanced at the papers then at me im so sorry merry doyle let me slide out from behind him so i could go to galen i buried my face against his chest wrapped my arms around his waist and held on i felt safe with doyle passion with frost but it was galens arms that made me feel comfortable i wanted to hold on to him to close my eyes and just cling but there was a press conference planned and the queen wanted us at the court early so we could all discuss the version of the truth we were going to feed the media id been going to press conferences since i was a child and id never been to one yet where we told the truth the whole truth so help us goddess there was no way to clean up the mess that griffin had made he could be punished but the story and the pictures were already out there and nothing would change that i still had no clue what sanitized version of the truth would account for the pictures of frost kitto and me naked together but if anyone could come up with a necessary lie to cover it it would be my aunt andais queen of air and darkness could put a spin on any scandal that would make the medias head spin bedazzled by her charms they tended to write what she told them to write though making this particular scandal squeaky clean was going to stretch even her talents i used to hope that id live to see my aunt fail badly now i was hoping shed succeed brilliantly was that hypocritical of me maybe or maybe it was just practical chapter by midnight the last of the reporters had drifted away full of old wine expensive hors doeuvres and my aunts bullshit but she did sling it with style shed dressed in a slinky black business suit and no blouse so that her cleavage showed at the line of the jacket callgirl chic she was thrilled that i was home for a visit excited that id finally decided to settle down with some lucky sidhe saddened by griffins betrayal one reporter had asked her about the alleged faerie aphrodisiac that had caused a near riot at a los angeles police station she had no knowledge of it andais wouldnt let anyone else but herself answer questions im not sure she trusted what id say the men were just window dressingthey never got to talk cel sat on her right and i sat on her left we smiled at each other the three of us posed for pictures him in his monochrome blackonblack designer suit me in a little black designer dress with a short jacket set with hundreds of genuine jet beads andais in her callgirl business suit we looked like we were going to a very expensive very chic funeral if i do ever get to be queen im getting the court a new color scheme anything but black the court was very quiet tonight cel had been led away to be prepared for his punishment the queen had taken doyle and frost to her rooms for a debriefing galen had been limping by the time we finished the conference so fflur had taken him off for some ointment to help speed his healing it left rhys and kitto and pasco to guard me pasco had come to the hotel last night but spent the night in the second room his long pinkcolored hair trailed to his knees like a pale curtain black was not his color it made his skin look purplish and his hair almost brown in the right colors pasco sparkled but not tonight black looked better on rhys but what made the outfit was the blue shirt a color to match his eye that the queen allowed him rhys and pasco paced behind me like good bodyguards kitto stayed at my side like a faithful dog he had not been allowed on camera during the conference goblin prejudice runs strong in the courts kitto was the only one who had been allowed to keep his jeans and tshirt we were staying at the court tonight because it was the only reporterfree zone within fifty miles nobody would be breaking the queens windows or snapping pictures through the earthen mound i was trying to find my old rooms but there was a door in the middle of the hallway a large woodenandbronze door the abyss of despair lay behind the door last id seen this room it had been near the hallway of mortalityread torture room the abyss was supposed to be bottomless which was impossible had it been purely physical but it wasnt purely physical one of the worst of our punishments was to be cast into the abyss and to fall forever never aging never dying trapped in free fall for all eternity i stopped in the middle of the hallway letting pasco and rhys catch up to me kitto moved to one side out of rhyss reach instinctively rhys had not so much as touched him just looked at him whatever kitto saw in that one blueonblue eye frightened the goblin whats wrong rhys asked what is this thing doing here he studied the door frowning its the door to the abyss exactly it should be down three levels of stairs at the very least whats it doing on the main floor you say that as if the sithen made sense pasco said the mound has decided to move the abyss up to the top floor sometimes it does major rearranging like that i looked at rhys he nodded it does sometimes define sometimes i said about every millennium rhys said i just love dealing with people whose idea of sometimes is every thousand years i said pasco grabbed the huge bronze door handle allow me princess the door moved slowly open proving beyond doubt that it was a very heavy door pasco was like most of the court in that he could have benchpressed a small house if he could have found a convenient handhold yet he opened this one door as if it had weight the room beyond was a dim greyness as if the lights that worked in the rest of the sithen didnt quite work here i stepped into the dimness with kitto at my heels darting just ahead of me staying out of rhyss way like a dog thats afraid of being kicked the room was just as i remembered it a huge circular stone room with a round hole in the center of the floor there was a white railing around that hole a railing made of bones and silver wire and magic the railing glimmered with its own brand of glamour some said the railing was bespelled to keep the abyss from flowing up through the floor and eating the world the railing was bespelled to keep people from jumping over it so no one could commit suicide in it or fall by accident there was only one way to go over the rail and that was to be thrown over i gave the glowing collection of bones a wide berth and kitto clung to my hand like a child afraid to cross the street by himself there was another door on the far side of the room and we walked toward it my high heels making clackety echoes in the huge room the door behind us closed with a huge clang that made me jump kitto tugged at my hand urging me to move faster toward the far door i didnt need any urging but i also wasnt going to run in the high heels id healed one sprained ankle this weekone was enough two things happened at once i saw something out of the corner of my eye on the side of the abyss opposite us a flicker of movement where nothing stood the other was a small sound from behind us i turned toward the noise rhys was on his knees hands limp at his sides an expression of bewilderment on his face pasco stood over him with a bloody knife in his hand rhys fell forward slowly landing heavily hands still at his side mouth opening and closing like a fish pulled from the water i moved toward the door the wall at my back kitto beside me but i knewi knew that it was too late the flicker on the other side of the room parted like an invisible curtain to reveal rozenwyn and siobhan the two women divided the room one moving left the other right coming to outflank me siobhan all pale and ghostly like a halloween horror and rozenwyn all pink and lavender like an easterbasket doll one tall one short so much opposites yet they moved like two pieces of a whole i put my back against the wall kitto crouching beside me as if trying to make himself smaller and more invisible rhys isnt dead even a heart blow wont kill him i said but a trip into the abyss will pasco said i take it thats my fate as well i said my voice sounding terribly calm my mind was racing but my voice was calm well kill you first siobhan said then throw you over thanks bunches how thoughtful of you to kill me first we could let you die of thirst while you fell rozenwyn said your choice is there a third choice i asked im afraid not siobhan said the sibilance of her voice echoing in the room as if it belonged here theyd both crossed around the edge of the railing and were coming in on either side pasco stayed by rhyss gasping body i had the two folding knives but they had swords i was outarmed and about to be outflanked are you so fearful of me that it takes three of you to kill me rozenwyn nearly killed me herself i still bear her mark over my ribs rozenwyn shook her head no meredith you cant talk us into a oneonone duel we were given very strict orders that we are simply to kill you no games no matter how fun they would be kitto had pressed himself to the floor huddled by my leg what are you going to do to kitto the goblin joins rhys in the abyss siobhan hissed i took out one of the folding knives and they laughed i called power to the other hand called the hand of flesh deliberately for the first time i waited for it to hurt but it didnt power moved through me like heavy water smooth alive tilling my body my hand like something almost thick enough to throw the two women knew id called some magic because they glanced at one another there was a moment of hesitation then they moved forward again they were only about ten feet away when kitto launched himself from his crouch like a leopard springing onto siobhan she stabbed him the blade coming clean through his body but it missed anything vital and he rode her body slashing biting fighting like some small elegant animal rozenwyn rushed me sword up but i was expecting it and i dived to the floor feeling the rush of air as the blade roared past me i grabbed for her leg touched her ankle and her leg collapsed in upon itself to do what id done to nerys i needed to hit in the center of her body but rozenwyn would never give me a chance at a midbody blow she fell to the ground shrieking watching her long beautiful leg shrivel up roll bone and flesh in waves i drove the folded blade into her throat not to kill but to distract i scooped the sword out of her suddenly nerveless hand i heard pasco running up behind me i dropped to my knees fighting the urge to look behind but there was no time i felt his blade go over my head and drove rozenwyns sword back and up desperately seeking his body and finding it the sword bit deep into his body and i said a quick breath of prayer as i rolled away from him his own body weight carried him to the floor drove the sword in hilt deep while he made wet sounds deep in his throat then something happened that i hadnt planned pasco rolled onto his sisters damaged leg and the rolling flesh poured over his face he didnt even have time to scream before his sisters flesh covered his and his body began to melt into her his hands beat against the floor while his head was already swallowed into the lump of flesh that had become his sisters lower body rozenwyn pulled my knife from her throat the wound healed instantly and she began to shriek she reached out one lavender pink hand to me meredith princess do not do this i beg you i backed into the wall watching because i could not stop it i didnt know how it had been an accident they were twins theyd shared a womb once and that may have caused this a freak accident in every way if id had any clue where to begin id have tried to stop it no one deserved this i tore my gaze away from the melting horror of rozenwyn and her brother becoming one to see siobhan and kitto siobhan was bloodied scratched and bitten but not really hurt she was kneeling though her sword on the floor in front of her she was surrendering her weapon to me kitto lay gasping beside her the hole in his chest already beginning to close she could have killed me while i watched rozenwyn and pasco melt but siobhan who was the stuff of nightmares watched with open horror as the pinkandpurple flesh consumed the two sidhe she was too scared to risk coming close enough for a death blow she was scared of me rozenwyns face went last screaming as if she were trying to keep her head above quicksand but it swallowed her and the mass of flesh and organs pulsed on the stone floor you could hear their screams two voices this time two voices trapped my pulse pounded in my ears until all i could hear taste was my horror at the sight it wasnt just siobhan who was scared rhys staggered to his feet his own sword in his hands then he fell to his knees beside me his eyes on the thing on the floor lord and lady protect us i could only nod but finally my voice came low hoarse disarm siobhan then kill that thing how he asked chop it up rhys chop it up until it stops moving i stared down at rozenwyns sword it was one of a kind made for her hand with a hilt of jeweled spring flowers i started for the near door with the sword naked in my hand where are you going rhys asked i have a message to deliver the huge bronze door opened in front of me as if moved by a great hand i walked through it and it closed behind me the sithen pulsed and whispered around me i went to find cel he was naked chained to the floor of a dark room ezekial was there our torturer with surgical gloves on his hands and a bottle of branwyns tears the torture had not yet begun which meant that the three months had not begun so i could not demand cels life the queen saw me first her eyes going to the sword in my hand doyle and frost were with her witnesses to her sons shame what has happened she asked i placed the sword across cels bare chest he recognized iti could see it in his eyes i would have brought you an ear from rozenwyn and pasco but they dont have an ear left between them what did you do to them he whispered it i raised my left hand just above his body the queen said meredith no you cannot they shared a womb once now they share flesh should i have them thrown into the abyss where you meant to put rhys and kitto should i let them fall forever a pulsing ball of meat he stared up at me and the fear was there but underneath the cunning i did not know they were going to do this i did not send them i stood up and motioned ezekial forward begin ezekial looked at the queen she nodded and he knelt beside cels body and began to coat him with the oil i turned to andais for this i want him in here like this alone for six months the full sentence andais started to argue but doyle said your majesty you must begin to treat him as he deserves she nodded six months i give my oath on it mother no no when youre done ezekial seal the room and she walked out while he was still screaming for her i watched ezekial coat him with the oil watched his body come alive at the touch of it frost and doyle stood on either side of me cel looked at me while it was happening his face saying plainly that he was thinking about me in a very uncousinlike way i was going to just kill you meredith but not now when i get out of here ill fuck you fuck you until youre with my child the throne is mine even if i have to get it through your lilywhite body if you come near me again cel ill kill you with that i turned and walked out doyle and frost came behind and to either side like good bodyguards cels voice followed us down the hallway he was screaming my name merry merry each time more frantic than the last long after i shouldnt have been able to hear his screams they echoed in my ears chapter pascos death meant that the queen needed a new spy to send back to los angeles with me she seemed unsure of herself with cels screams still echoing in the hallways i was able to press until we settled on a guard who wasnt exactly one of her pets nicca is terrified of my aunt so hell report to her but he also helped us after the thorns tried to drink me dry doyle trusts him and i trust doyle the queen says that nicca is not an inspired lover but the packaging is nice his father was one of the demifey something with butterfly wings his mother was one of the ladies of the court a fullblooded sidhe the queen had him strip his shirt off for me to show that giant butterfly wings are tattooed across his shoulders arms down his back to vanish into his pants the genetics tried to give him wings even though he was mansized no tattoo artist has ever done anything as lovely as the wings on niccas back the queen would have had him strip completely so i could see just how far down the wing design went but i opted to be left with a little mystery nicca had looked frightened the entire time he watched queen andais the way a crippled sparrow watches a snake just wondering when the first big bite is going to sink into its flesh i got him out of her presence as soon as was polite doyle assures me that nicca is fine as long as the queen is nowhere around id love to know what she did to him in particular to make him so very afraidor maybe i wouldnt the older i get the more i realize that ignorance may not be bliss but sometimes it beats the alternative we flew back to los angeles as soon as we could get a flight out the police had to be called in to keep the press at bay the pictures of frost kitto and me were already in the tabloids im told the european tabloids were showing the full nude shots with nothing fuzzed out the question everyone wanted to know the answer to was is frost or kitto the new fiancé i kept answering no and one smart reporter asked if i was into polyandry i motioned at all the beautiful men surrounding me and said wouldnt you be the press laughed and loved it since we cant do anything else were playing to it princess meredith is picking a new husband or two jeremy brought uther to the airport to meet our plane uther used the glare to clear a path through the reporters when youre thirteen feet tall muscular and have a double row of wickedlooking tusks coming out of your face even reporters will clear a path jeremy fielded questions that yes the princess did work for the grey detective agency wed already talked on the phone because jeremy had pretty much expected me not to come back to work but being a detective had made me feel better than being a faerie princess ever had besides i had a lot of mouths to feed ringo was out of the hospital and almost completely healed from the ogres attack in the van roane was back from his sea vacation he gave me a seashell pale white gleaming with opalescence like a daintier pinker version of abalone shell it was lovely and meant more to me than any jewel because it meant more to roane he bowed out as my lover without having to be told though ive let him know that if our having sex has made him sidhestruck hes welcome he seems fine his new sealskin seems to be a cure for sidhesickness im glad because truth is i have enough men in my life right now i have at least one bodyguard with me at all times doyle prefers two its going to be twentyfourseven so they rotate and mix the rotation so no watchers can ever be sure who is going to be on duty and who isnt im letting doyle handle the detailsit is his job when theyre not guarding my body theyre trying to settle into the new world ive dragged them into rhys of course wanted to work for the detective agency and be a reallife detective jeremy didnt argue with a fullblooded sidhe warrior coming on staff once the word got out it seemed like every celebrity in the area wanted a sidhe to guard their body business was so good and most of the time so easya lot of standing around and looking decorative with no real dangerthat galen and nicca both signed on doyle says he doesnt guard anyone but me frost seems to agree kitto simply wants to hang around with me and would spend most of his time under my desk if i let him hes not adapting well to his first view of the twentieth century the poor goblin never saw a car before or a televisionand now he spends his days in a skyscraper in one of the most modern cities in the world if he doesnt start thriving ill have to send him back to kurag which will mean the goblin king will send a replacement call it a hunch im betting the next goblin wont be nearly so nice whatever the demifey did to galen it was more than simple injury because hes not healing in one certain area the way he should weve had a doctor and the best magical practitioner in the city look at him neither one of them was very helpful if science and magic both keep failing us i may have to talk to queen niceven herself and find out what the hell they did to him i think hes taking to guarding other bodies because to be so close to me and still not be able to have me when everyone else can is just too difficult for him me too all that heat all those years of waiting and were still waiting the grey detective agency is getting so much highprofile bigbucks business that jeremy is interviewing new people and talking about moving to bigger offices there were some tense moments between jeremy and the guards because they were unseelie and jeremy was still holding a grudge galen and rhys took him out drinking i dont know what was said but the next day the tension level was better male bonding at its best alistair nortons widow frances norton and naomi phelps his exmistress are doing well theyve moved in together and if they were a heterosexual couple id say we might be getting a wedding invitation soon they seem happy and no one is mourning alistair the police have traced some of alistairs fellow sidhe worshipers two of them died mysteriously just before the police found them i dont have much hope for the health of any of the sidhe worshipers the queen or cels toadies or both are tidying up the mess the queen assured me that there was only one bottle of branwyns tears missing from her private stock so the danger to the human public is over she gave me her oath on it and no sidhe would go back on their oath not even andais there is almost no worse insult among the sidhe than to be an oathbreaker no one will do business with you after that no one will bed you let alone marry you andais is on shaky ground with the sidhe right nowshe would not risk it there are whispers of revolution and i know that cels followers among the court are behind it though some have suggested that barinthus is behind it that he intends to make me queen whether i bear a child or not barinthus queenmaker is what they say behind his back ive made him promise hes not doing anything like that but he still refuses to come to los angeles saying we need at least one powerful friend to talk to the court about me hes probably right but im beginning to wonder exactly what hes saying at court without me there to say yea or nay to it doyle has shared my bed but not our bodies literally we have slept together but not had sex he says that anticipation will make it better i dont know what he has planned but looking into his dark eyes i know he has a plan a purpose when i ask about that plan he says i want only to keep you safe and see you queen after your aunt i dont believe him oh i believe he wants me safe and i believe he wants me to rule after andais but there is more to it than that when i press he smiles and shakes his head i should know by now that when the queens darkness keeps secrets there is no prying them from him until he is ready to speak them until we are together completely until i know exactly what he is thinking he is still the queens darkness and not truly mine its not the lack of sex but the wealth of secrets that keeps me from owning doyle completely if i cannot own him body and heart how can i trust him the answer simply is i cant im back in los angeles working as a detective but under my real name now i have access to sidhe lovers and could return to faerie any time i want i have everything i wanted but there is a tension that never quite goes away because i know that as they say the other shoe has not dropped cel still lives his followers fear that i will destroy them if i gain the throne revolutions have begun over less the media is always present like a circle of sharks kept at bay only by court orders theyre chasing the sex and romance angleif only they knew how very much more there is to the story griffin hasnt been found maybe hes dead and no one told me though somehow knowing my aunt i think shed probably box him up and send me a few favorite parts i should be happy and i am but im not at peace we are in the quiet before the storm and it is going to be a hell of a storm i will be weathering the storm in a boat made of flesh and bone the bodies of my guards and with every caress every glance i am more and more reluctant to give any of them up ive lost enough people in my life id like to try just this once not to lose anyone else id pretty much abandoned my religion with my family but ive set up an altar in my room and im praying again im praying as hard as i can but i know better than most that while you always get an answer to your prayer sometimes the answer isnt what you want it to be i dont want the throne if i have to climb over the bodies of my friends and lovers to get it i dont want anything that badlyi never did i always thought love was more important than power but sometimes you cant have love without the power to keep it safe i pray for the safety of those i care about maybe what im really praying for is power enough power to protect them so be it whatever it takes to keep them safe even if that means being queen i cant be queen while cel lives no matter what my aunt believes i pray for the safety of those i care about and what im really asking for is power the throne and my cousins death because those three things must happen to give us all safety they say be careful what you wish for well be even more cautious with your prayers make sure very sure its what you want you never know when a deity may give you exactly what you asked for
