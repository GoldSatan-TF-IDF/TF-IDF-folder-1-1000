mercedes lackey last herald mage trilogy magics pawn one your grandfather said vanyels brawny fifteenyearold cousin radevel was crazy he has a point vanyel thought hoping they werent about to take an uncontrolled dive down the last of the stairs radevels remark had probably been prompted by this very back staircase one that started at one end of the thirdfloor servants hall and emerged at the rear of a linen closet on the ground floor the stair treads were so narrow and so slick that not even the servants used it the manorkeep of lord withen ashkevron of forst reach was a strange and patchworked structure in vanyels greatgreatgrandfathers day it had been a more conventional defensive keep but by the time vanyels grandfather had held the lands the border had been pushed far past forst reach the old reprobate had decided when hed reached late middle age that defense was going to be secondary to comfort his comfort primarily not that vanyel entirely disagreed with grandfather he would have been one of the first to vote to fill in the moat and for fireplaces in all the rooms but the old man had gotten some pretty peculiar notions about what he wanted where along with a tendency to change his mind in midalteration there were good points windows everywhere and all of them glazed and shuttered skylights lighting all the upper rooms and the staircases fireplaces in nearly every room heated privies part and parcel of the bathhouse every inside wall lathed and plastered against cold and damp the stables mews kennel and chickenyard banished to new outbuildings but there were bad points if you didnt know your way you could really get lost and there were an awful lot of places you couldnt get into unless you knew exactly how to get there some of those places were important like the bathhouse and privies the old goat hadnt much considered the next generation in his alterations either hed cut up the nursery into servants quarters which meant that until lord withens boys went into bachelors hall and the girls to the bower they were cramped two and three to a series of very tiny atticlevel rooms he was your grandfather too vanyel felt impelled to point out the ashkevron cousins had a tendency to act as if they had no common ancestors with vanyel and his sibs whenever the subject of grandfather joserlin and his alterations came up huh radevel considered for a moment then shrugged he was still crazy he hefted his own load of armor and padding a little higher on his shoulder vanyel held his peace and trotted down the last couple of stone stairs to hold the door open for his cousin radevel was doing him a favor even though vanyel was certain that cousin radevel shared everyone elses low opinion of him radevel was by far and away the bestnatured of the cousins and the easiest to talk round and the bribe of vanyels new hawking gauntlet had proved too much for him to resist still it wouldnt do to get him angry by arguing with him he might decide he had better things to do than help vanyel out gauntlet or no gauntlet oh gods let this work vanyel thought as they emerged into the gloomy back hall did i practice enough with lissa is this going to have a chance against a standard attack or am i crazy for even trying the hallway was as cold as the staircase had been and dark to boot radevel took the lead feet slapping on the stone floor as he whistled contentedly and tunelessly vanyel tried not to wince at the mutilation of one of his favorite melodies and drifted silently in his wake his thoughts as dark as the hallway in three days lissa will be gone and if i cant manage to get sent along ill be all alone without lissa if i can just prove that i need her kind of training then maybe father will let me go with her that had been the halfformed notion that prompted him to work out the moves of a different style of fighting than what he was supposed to be learning practicing them in secret with his older sister lissa that was what had ultimately led to this little expedition that and the urgent need to show lord withen that his eldest son wasnt the coward the armsmaster claimed he was and that he could succeed on martial ground of his own choosing vanyel wondered why he was the only boy to realize that there were other styles of fighting than armsmaster jervis taught hed read of them and knew that they had to be just as valid else why send lissa off to foster and study with trevor corey and his seven wouldbe swordladies the way vanyel had it figured there was no way short of a miracle that he would ever succeed at the brute hackandbash system jervis used and no way lord withen would ever believe that another style was just as good while jervis had his ear unless vanyel could show him then father would have to believe his own eyes and if i cant prove it to him oh gods i cant take much more of this with lissa gone to brenden keep his last real ally in the household would be gone too his only friend and the only person who cared for him this was the final trial of the plot hed worked out with liss radevel would try to take him using jervis teachings vanyel would try to hold his own wearing nothing but the padded jerkin and helm carrying the lightest of targetshields and trusting to speed and agility to keep him out of trouble radevel kicked open the unlatched door to the practice ground leaving vanyel to get it closed before somebody yelled about the draft the early spring sunlight was painful after the darkness of the hallway vanyel squinted as he hurried to catch up with his cousin all right peacock radevel said goodnaturedly dumping his gear at the edge of the practice ground and snagging his own gambeson from the pile get yourself ready and well see if this nonsense of yours has any merit it took vanyel a lot less time than his cousin to shrug into his armor he offered tentatively to help radevel with his but the older boy just snorted botch mine the way you botch yours no thanks he said and went on methodically buckling and adjusting vanyel flushed and stood uncertainly at the side of the sunken practice ground contemplating the thick dead grass at his feet i never botch anything except when jervis is watching he thought bleakly shivering a little as a bit of cold breeze cut through the gambeson and then i cant do anything right he could almost feel the windows in the keep wall behind him like eyes staring at his back waiting for him to fail again whats wrong with me anyway why cant i ever please father why is everything i do wrong he sighed scuffed the ground with his toe and wished he could be out riding instead of trying something doomed to failure he was the best rider in forst reach he and star had no equals on the most breakneck of hunts and he could if he chose master anything else in the stables and just because i wont bother with those ironmouthed brutes father prefers he wont even grant me the accolade there gods this time i have to win wake up dreamer radevel rumbled his voice muffled inside the helm you wanted to have at lets get to it vanyel walked to the center of the practice field with nervous deliberation waiting until the last minute to get his helm on he hated the thing he hated the feeling of being closed in and most of all hated having his vision narrowed to a little slit he waited for radevel to come up to him feeling the sweat already starting under his arms and down the line of his back radevel swung but instead of meeting the blow with his shield as jervis would have done vanyel just moved out of the way of the blow and on his way past radevel made a stab of his own jervis never cared much for pointwork but vanyel had discovered it could be really effective if you timed things right radevel made a startled sound and got up his own shield but only just in time and left himself open to a cut vanyel felt his spirits rising as he saw this second opening in as many breaths and chanced another attack of his own this one actually managed to connect though it was too light to call a disabling hit light vanyel shouted as he danced away before his cousin had a chance to disqualify the blow almost enough peacock radevel replied reluctant admiration in his voice you land another like that with your weight behind it and ill be out try this for size he charged his practice blade a blur beside his shield vanyel just stepped aside at the last moment while radevel staggered halfway to the boundary under his own momentum it was working radevel couldnt get near him and vanyel was pecking away at him whenever he got an opportunity he wasnt hitting even close to killing strength but that was mostly from lack of practice if hold damn your eyes long habit froze them both in position and the armsmaster of forst reach stalked onto the field fire in his bloodshot glare jervis looked the two of them up and down while vanyel sweated from more than exertion the blond cragfaced mercenary frowned and vanyels mouth went dry jervis looked angry and when jervis was angry it was generally vanyel who suffered well the man croaked after long enough for vanyels dread of him to build up to full force learning a new discipline are we and whose idea was this mine sir vanyel whispered might have guessed sneakandrun would be more suited to you than an honest fight the armsmaster sneered well and how did you do my bright young lord he did all right jervis to vanyels complete amazement radevel spoke up for him i couldnt get a blow on im an if hed put his weight behind it hed have laid me out a time or two so youre a real hero against a halfgrown boy ill just bet you feel like another veth krethen dont you jervis spat vanyel held his temper counting to ten and did not protest that radevel was nearly double his size and certainly no halfgrown boy jervis glared at him waiting for a retort that never came and strangely that seemed to anger jervis even more all right hero he snarled taking radevels blade away and jamming the boys helm down over his own head lets see just how good you really are jervis charged without any warning and vanyel had to scramble to get out of the way of the whirling blade he realized then that jervis was coming for him allout as if vanyel was wearing full armor which he wasnt he pivoted desperately as jervis came at him again ducked wove and spun and saw an opening this time desperation gave him the strength he hadnt used against radevel and he scored a cheststab that actually rocked jervis back for a moment and followed it with a good solid blow to the head he waited heart in mouth while the armsmaster staggered backward two or three steps then shook his head to clear it there was an awful silence then jervis yanked off the helm and there was nothing but rage on his face radevel get the boys then bring me lordling vanyels arms and armor the armsmaster said in a voice that was deadly calm radevel backed off the field then turned and ran for the keep jervis paced slowly to within a few feet of vanyel and vanyel nearly died of fear on the spot so you like striking from behind hmm he said in that same deadly quiet voice i think maybe ive been a bit lax in teaching you about honor young milord a thin smile briefly sliced across his face but i think we can remedy that quickly enough radevel approached with feet dragging his arms loaded with the rest of vanyels equipment arm up jervis ordered and vanyel did not dare to disobey exactly what jervis said then other than dressing vanyel down in front of the whole lot of them calling him a coward and a cheat an assassin who wouldnt stand still to face his opponents blade with honor vanyel could never afterward remember only a haze of mingled fear and anger that made the words meaningless but then jervis took vanyel on his way his style it was a hopeless fight from the beginning even if vanyel had been good at this particular mode of combat in moments vanyel found himself flat on his back trying to see around spots in front of his eyes with his ears still ringing from a blow he hadnt even seen coming get up jervis said five more times vanyel got up each time more slowly each time he tried to yield by the fourth time he was witwandering dazed and groveling and jervis refused to accept his surrender even when he could barely gasp out the words radevel had gotten a really bad feeling in his stomach from the moment he saw jervis face when van scored on him hed never seen the old bastard that angry in all the time hed been fostered here but hed figured that vanyel was just going to get a bit of a thrashing hed never figured on being an unwilling witness to a deliberate massacre that was all he could think it van was no match for jervis and jervis was coming at him all out like he was a trained adult fighter even radevel could see that he heaved a sigh of relief when vanyel was knocked flat on his back and mumbled out his surrender as soon as he could speak the worst the poor little snot had gotten was a few bruises but when jervis had refused to accept that surrender when he beat at van with the flat of his blade until the boy had to pick up sword and shield just to get the beating to stop radevel got that bad feeling again and it got worse five times more jervis knocked him flat and each time with what looked like an even more vicious strike but the sixth time vanyel was laid out he couldnt get up jervis let fly with a blow that broke the wood and copper shield right in the middle and to radevels horror he saw when the boy fell back that vanyels shield arm had been broken in half the lower arm was bent in the middle and that could only mean that both bones had snapped it was pure miracle that they hadnt gone through muscle and skin and jervis eyes were still not what radevel would call sane radevel added up all the factors and came up with one answer get lissa she was adultrank she was vans protector and no matter what the armsmaster said in justification for beating the crud out of van if jervis laid one finger in anger on lissa hed get thrown out of the keep with both his arms broken if withen didnt do it there were others who liked liss a lot who would radevel backed off the field and took to his heels as soon as he was out of sight vanyel lay flat on his back again breath knocked out of him in a kind of shock in which he couldnt feel much of anything except except that something was wrong somewhere then he tried to get up and pain shooting along his left arm sent him screaming into darkness when he came to lissa was bending over him her horsey face tight with worry she was pale and the nostrils of that prominent ashkevron nose flared like a frightened fillys dont move van no both the bones of your arm are broken she was kneeling next to him he realized with one knee gently but firmly holding his left arm down so that he couldnt move it lady get away from him jervis voice dripped boredom and disgust its just his shield arm nothing important well just strap it to a board and put some liniment on it and hell be fine she didnt move her knees but swung around to face jervis so fast that her braid came loose and whipped past vanyels nose like a lash you have done quite enough for one day master jervis she snarled i think you forget your place vanyel wished vacantly that he could see jervis face at that moment it must surely be a sight but his arm began to hurt and that was more than enough to keep his attention there wasnt usually a healer at forst reach but vanyels aunt serina was staying here with her sister during her pregnancy shed had three miscarriages already and was taking no chances she was attended by her very own healer and lissa had seen to it that the healer not jervis was the one that dealt with vanyels arm oh van lissa folded herself inelegantly on the edge of vanyels bed and sighed how did you manage to get into this mess that beaky ashkevron nose and her determined chin combined with her anxiety to make her look like a stubborn mulish mare most people were put off by her appearance but vanyel knew her well enough to read the heartsick worry in her eyes after all shed all but raised him vanyel wasnt certain how clear hed be but he tried to explain lissa tucked up her legs and rested her chin on her knees an unladylike pose that would have evoked considerable distress from lady treesa when he finished she sighed again i think you attract bad luck thats all i can say you dont do anything wrong but somehow things seem to happen to you vanyel licked his dry lips and blinked at her liss jervis was really angry this time and what you told him didnt help hes going to go right to father if he isnt there already she shook her head i shouldnt have said that should i van all i was thinking about was getting him away from you i i know liss im not blaming you but but i made him mad well ill see if i can get to father before jervis does but even if i do he probably wont listen to me im just a female after all i know he closed his eyes as the room began to swing just try liss please i will she slipped off the bed then bent over and kissed his forehead try and sleep like the healer told you all right he nodded toughminded and independent like the grandmother who had raised her lissa was about the only one in the keep willing to stand up to lord withen now that grandmother ashkevron had passed on not surprising that given grandmother the ashkevrons seemed to produce about one strongwilled female in every generation much to the bemusement of the ashkevron males and the more compliant ashkevron females lady treesa anything but independent had been far too busy with pregnancy and all the vapors she indulged in when pregnant to have anything to do with the resulting offspring they went to the hands of others until they were old enough to be usefully added to her entourage lissa went to grandmother but vanyel went to liss and they loved each other from the moment shed taken him out of the nursery shed stand up to a raging lion for his sake so lissa went in search of their father unfortunately that left him alone and unfortunately lissa didnt return when she couldnt immediately find lord withen and that of course left him vulnerable when his father chose to descend on him like the god of thunders vanyel was dizzy with pain as well as with the medicines the healer had made him drink when lord withen stormed into his tiny whiteplastered room he was lying flat on his back in his bed trying not to move and still the room seemed to be reeling around him the pain was making him nauseous and all he wanted was to be left in peace the very last thing he wanted to see was his lord father and withen barely gave him enough time to register that his father was there before laying into him whats all this about your cheating withen roared making vanyel wince and wish he dared to cover his ears by the gods you whelp i ought to break your other arm for you i wasnt cheating vanyel protested stung his voice breaking at just the wrong moment he tried to sit upright which only made the room spin the more he fell back supporting himself on his good elbow grinding his teeth against the pain of his throbbing arm i was he gasped through clenched teeth i was just doing what seldasen said to do and just who might this seldasen be his father growled savagely his dark brows knitting together what manner of coward says to run about and strike behind a mans back eh oh gods now what have i done though his head was spinning vanyel tried to remember if herald seldasens treatise on warfare and tactics had been one of the books hed borrowed without leave or one of the ones he was supposed to be studying well when lord withen scowled his dark hair and beard made him look positively demonic the drugs seemed to be giving him an aura of angry red light too father why cant you ever believe i might be in the right the book was on the approved list vanyel remembered with relief as he recalled his tutor istal assigning certain chapters to be memorized its herald seldasen father he said defiantly finding strength in rebellion its from a book istal assigned me about tactics the words he remembered strengthened him still more and he threw them into his fathers face he said let every man that must go to battle fight within his talents and not be forced to any one school let the agile man use his speed let his armoring be light and let him skirmish but not close with the enemy let the heavy man stand shoulder to shoulder with his comrades in the shield wall that the enemy may not break through let the small man of good eye make good use of the bow aye and let the herald fight with his mind and not his body let the heraldmage combat with magic and not the sword and let no man be called coward for refusing the place for which he is not fit and i didnt once hit anybody from behind if jervis says i did well i didnt lord withen stared at his eldest son his mouth slack with surprise for one moment vanyel actually thought hed gotten through to his father who was more accustomed to hearing him quote poetry than military history parrot some damned book at me will you lord withen snarled dashing vanyels hopes and what does some damned lowborn herald know about fighting you listen to me boy you are my heir my firstborn and you damned well better learn what jervis has to teach you if you want to sit in my place when im gone if he says you were cheating then by damn you were cheating but i wasnt cheating and i dont want your place vanyel protested the drugs destroying his selfcontrol and making him say things hed sooner have kept behind his teeth that stopped lord withen cold his father stared at him as if hed gone mad grown a second head or spoken in karsite great good gods boy he managed to splutter after several icy eternities during which vanyel waited for the roof to cave in what do you want i vanyel began and stopped if he told withen that what he wanted was to be a bard you ungrateful whelp you will learn what i tell you to learn and do what i order you to do youre my heir and youll do your duty to me and to this holding if i have to see you half dead to get you to do it and with that he stormed out leaving vanyel limp with pain and anger and utter dejection his eyes clamped tight against the tears he could feel behind them oh gods what does he expect of me why cant i ever please him what do i have to do to convince him that i cant be what he wants me to be die and now now my hand oh gods it hurts how much damage did they do to it am i ever going to be able to play anything right again heyla van he opened his eyes startled by the sound of a voice his door was cracked partway open radevel peered around the edge of it and vanyel could hear scuffling and whispers behind him you all right no vanyel replied suspiciously what the hell does he want radevels bushy eyebrows jumped like a pair of excited caterpillars guess not bet it hurts it hurts vanyel said feeling a sick and sullen anger burning in the pit of his stomach you watched it happen and you didnt do anything to stop it cousin and you didnt bother to defend me to father either none of you did radevel instead of being put off inched a little farther into the room hey he said brightening you should have seen it i mean whack an that whole shield just split an you fell down an that arm will you go to hell vanyel snarled just about ready to kill him and you can take all those ghouls lurking out there with you radevel jumped looked shocked then looked faintly offended vanyel didnt care all that mattered was that radevel and whoever else was out there took themselves away left finally alone vanyel drifted into an uneasy slumber filled with fragmented bits of unhappy dreams when he woke again his mother was supervising the removal of his younger brother mekeal and all mekeals belongings from the room well that was a change lady treesa usually didnt interest herself in any of her offspring unless she had something to gain from it on the other hand vanyel had been a part of her little court since the day hed evidenced real talent at music about five years ago she wouldnt want to lose her own private minstrel which meant shed best make certain he healed up all right i wont have you racketing about she was whispering to mekeal with unconcealed annoyance on her plump pretty face i wont have you keeping him awake when he should be sleeping and i wont have you getting in the healers way thirteenyearold mekeal a slightly shrunken copy of his father shrugged indifferently bout time we went to bachelors hall anyway milady he replied as lady treesa turned to keep an eye on him cant say as iii miss the caterwauling an the plunking although vanyel could only see his mothers back he couldnt miss the frown in her voice it wouldnt hurt you to acquire a bit of vanyels polish mekeal lady treesa replied mekeal shrugged again quite cheerfully cant make silk out o wool lady mother he peered through dancing candlelight at vanyels side of the room seems mbrothers awake heyla peacock theyre movin me down t quarters seems you get up here to yourself out treesa ordered and mekeal took himself off with a heartless chuckle vanyel spent the next candlemark with treesa fussing and weeping over him indulging herself in the histrionics she seemed to adore in a way it was as hard to deal with as withens rage hed never been on the receiving end of her vapors before oh gods he kept thinking confusedly please make her go away anywhere i dont care he had to keep assuring her that he was going to be all right when he was not at all certain of that himself and treesas shrill borderline hysteria set his nerves completely on edge it was a decided relief when the healer arrived again and gently chased her out to give him some peace the next few weeks were nothing but a blur of pain and potions a blur endured with one or another of his mothers ladies constantly at his side and they all flustered at him until he was ready to scream including his mothers maid melenna who should have known better it was like being nursemaided by a covey of agitated doves when they werent worrying at him they were preening at him especially melenna would you like me to get you a pillow melenna cooed no vanyel replied counting to ten twice can i get you something to drink she edged a little closer and leaned forward batting her eyelashes at him no he said closing his eyes thank you shall i no he growled not sure which was worse at this moment the pounding of his head or melennas questions at least the pounding didnt have to be accompanied by melennas questions sniff he cracked an eyelid open just enough to see her she sniffed again and a fat tear rolled down one cheek she was a rather pretty little thing and the only one of his mothers ladies or maidservants who had managed to pick up treesas knack of crying without going red and blotchy vanyel knew that both mekeal and radevel had tried to get into her bed more than once he also knew that she had her heart set on him and the thought of bedding her left him completely cold she sniffed a little harder a week ago he would have sighed and apologized to her and allowed her to do something for him anything just to keep her happy that was a week ago now its just a game for her a game she learned from mother im tired of playing it im sick to death of all their games he ignored her shutting his eyes and praying for the potions to work and finally they did which at least gave him a rest from her company for a little while van that voice would bring him out of a sound sleep let alone the restless drugdaze he was in now he struggled up out of the grip of feverdreams to force his eyes open lissa was sitting on the edge of his bed dressed in riding leathers liss he began then realized what riding leathers meant oh gods van im sorry i didnt want to leave you but father said it was now ot never she was crying not prettily like lady treesa but with blotched cheeks and bloodshot eyes van please say you dont mind too much its all right liss he managed fighting the words out around the cold lump in his throat and the colder one in his gut i know youve got to do this gods liss one of us has to get away van i ill find some way to help you i promise im almost eighteen im almost free father knows the guard is the only place for me he hasnt had a marriage offer for me for two years he doesnt dare ruin my chances for a post or hell be stuck with me the gods know youre safe enough now if anybody dared do anything before the healer says youre fit hed make a protest to haven maybe by the time you get the splints off ill be able to find a way to have you with me she looked so hopeful that vanyel didnt have the heart to say anything to contradict her do that liss i ill be all right she hugged him and kissed him and then left him and then he turned to the wall and cried lissa was the only support he had had the only person who loved him without reservations and now she was gone after that he stopped even pretending to care about anything they didnt care enough about him to let liss stay until he was well so why should he care about anything or anyone even enough to be polite armor does more than protect it conceals helms hide faces and your opponent becomes a mystery an enigma seldasen had that right just like those two down there the cruel blank stares of the helmslits gave no clues to the minds within the two opponents drew their blades flashed identical salutes and retreated exactly twenty paces each to end at the opposite corners of the field the sun was straight overhead their shadows little more than pools at their feet twelve restive armored figures fidgeted together on one side of the square the harsh sunshine bleached the short dead grass to the color of light straw and lit everything about the pair in pitiless detail hmm not such enigmas once they move one fighter was tall dangerously graceful and obviously wellmuscled beneath the protection of his worn padding and shabby armor every motion he made was precise perilous and professional the other was a head shorter his equipment was new the padding unfrayed the metal lovingly burnished but his movements were awkward uncertain perhaps fearful still if he feared he didnt lack for courage without waiting for his man to make a move he shouted a tremulous defiant battle cry and charged across the sunburnt grass toward the tall fighter as his boots thudded on the hard dry ground he brought his sword around in a lowline attack the taller fighter didnt even bother to move out of his way he simply swung his scarred shield to the side the sword crunched into the shield then slid oif metal screeching on metal the tall fighter swept his shield back into guard position and answered the blow with a return that rang true on the shield of his opponent then rebounded while he turned the momentum of the rebound into a cut at the smaller fighters head the pale stone of the keep echoed the sound of the exchange a racket like a madman loose in a smithy the smaller fighter was driven back with every blow giving ground steadily under the hammerlike onslaught until he finally lost his footing and fell over backward his sword flying out of his hand there was a dull thud as he hit his head on the flinty unforgiving ground he lay flat on his back for a moment probably seeing stars and scarcely moving arms flung out on either side of him as if he meant to embrace the sun then he shook his head dazedly and tried to get up only to find the point of his opponents sword at his throat yield boy rumbled a harsh voice from the shadowed mouthslit of the helmet yield or i run you through the smaller fighter pulled off his own helm to reveal that he was vanyels cousin radevel if you run me through jervis whos going to polish your mail the point of the sword did not waver oh all right the boy said with a rueful grin i yield the sword a potmetal practice blade went back into its plain leather sheath jervis pulled off his own battered helm with his shield hand as easily as if the weight of wood and bronze wasnt there he shook out his sweatdampened blond hair and offered the boy his right pulling him to his feet with the same studied precise movements as hed used when fighting next time you yield immediately boy the armsmaster rumbled frowning if your opponents in a hurry hell take banter for refusal and youll be a cold corpse jervis did not even wait to hear radevels abashed assent you on the end mekeal he waved to vanyels brother at the side of the practice field helm up vanyel snorted as jervis jammed his own helm back on his head and stalked back to his former position dead center of the practice ground the rest of you laggards he growled lets see some life there pair up and have at jervis doesnt have pupils he has living targets thought vanyel as he watched from the window there isnt anyone except father who could even give him a workout yet he goes straight for the throat every damned time he gets nastier every day about all he does give them is that he only hits half force which is still enough to set radev on his rump bullying bastard vanyel leaned back on his dusty cushions and forced his aching hand to run through the fingering exercise yet again half the lute strings plunked dully instead of ringing both strength and agility had been lost in that hand i am never going to get this right again how can i when half the time i cant feel what im doing he bit his lip and looked down again blinking at the sunlight winking off mekeals helm four stories below every one of them will be moaning and plastering horse liniment on his bruises tonight and boasting in the next breath about how long he lasted against jervis this time thank you no not i one broken arm was enough i prefer to see my sixteenth birthday with the rest of my bones intact this tiny tower room where vanyel always hid himself when summoned to weapons practice was another legacy of grandfather joserlins crazy building spree it was vanyels favorite hiding place and thus far the most secure a storage room just off the library the only conventional access was through a tiny halfheight door at the back of the library but the room had a window a window on the same side of the keep as the window of vanyels own atticlevel room any time he wanted vanyel could climb easily out of his bedroom edge along the slanting roof and climb into that narrow window even in the worst weather or the blackest night the hard part was doing it unseen an odd wedgeshaped nook this room was all that was left of the last landing of the staircase to the top floor an obvious change in design since the rest of the staircase had been turned into a chimney and the hole where the roof trapdoor had been now led to the chimney pot but that meant that although there was no fireplace in the storeroom itself the room stayed comfortably warm in the worst weather because of the chimney wall not once in all the time vanyel had taken to hiding here had anything new been added to the clutter or anything been sought for like many another of the old lords eccentricities its inaccessibility made it easy to ignore which was fine so far as vanyel was concerned he had his instruments up here two of which he wasnt even supposed to own the harp and the gittern and any time he liked he could slip into the library to purloin a book at the point of the room he had an old chair to sprawl in a collection of candle ends on a chest beside it so that he could read when the light was bad his instruments were all safe from the rough hands and pranks of his brothers and he could practice without anyone disturbing him he had arranged a set of old cushions by the window so that he could watch his brothers and cousins getting trounced all over the moat while he played or tried to play it afforded a ghost of amusement sometimes the gods knew he had little enough to smile about it was lonely but vanyel was always lonely since lissa had gone it was bloody awkward to get to but he couldnt hide in his room though he hadnt found out until hed healed up the rest of his siblings and cousins had gone down to bachelors hall with mekeal while hed been recovering from that broken arm he hadnt even when the healer had taken the splints off his brothers slandered his lute playing when theyd gone telling his father they were just as happy for vanyel to have his own room if he wanted to stay up there probably withen recalling how near the hall was to his own quarters had felt the same vanyel didnt care it meant that the room was his and his alone one scant bit of comfort his other place of refuge his mothers solar was no longer the retreat it had been it was too easy for him to be found there and there were other disadvantages lately his mothers ladies and fosterlings had taken to flirting with him he enjoyed that too up to a point but they kept wanting to take it beyond the range of the game of courtly love to the romantic for which he still wasnt ready and lady treesa kept encouraging them at it jervis drove mekeal back step by step fools vanyel thought scornfully forcing his fingers through the exercise in time with jervis blows they must be mad to let that sour old man make idiots out of them day after day maybe break their skulls just like he broke my arm anger tightened his mouth and the memory of the shuttered satisfaction hed seen in jervis eyes the first time vanyel had encountered him after the accident roiled in his stomach damn that bastard he meant to break my arm i know he did hes good enough to judge any blow he deals to within a hair at least he had a secure hiding place secure because getting into it took nerve and neither jervis nor his father nor any of the rest of them would ever have put him and a climb across the roof together in the same thoughteven if they remembered the room existed the illassorted lot below didnt look to be relatives the ashkevron cousins had all gone meaty when they hit adolescence bigboned muscled like plow horses and about as dense but withens sons were growing straight up as well as putting on bulk vanyel was the only one of the lot taking after his mother withen seemed to hold that to be his fault too vanyel snorted as mekeal took a blow to the helm that sent him reeling backward that one should shake up his brains serves him right too carrying on about what a great warrior hes going to be clodheaded beanpole all he can think about is hacking people to bits for the sake of honor glorious war hah fool cant see beyond the end of his nose for all that prating if he ever saw a battlefield hed wet himself not that vanyel had ever seen a real battlefield but he was the possessor of a far more vivid imagination than anyone else in his family he had no trouble in visualizing what those practice blades would be doing if they were real and he had no difficulty at all in imagining the deadlie woundes of the ballads being inflicted on his body vanyel paid close attention to his lessons if not to weapons work he knew all of the history ballads and unlike the rest of his peers he knew the parts about what happened after the great battles as well the lists of the dead the dying the maimed it hadnt escaped his notice that when you added up those lists the totals were a lot higher than the number of heroes who survived vanyel knew damned well which list hed be on if ever came to armed conflict hed learned his lesson only too well why even try except that every time he turned around lord withen was delivering another lecture on his duty to the hold gods im just as much a brute beast of burden as any donkey in the stables duty thats bloody all i hear he thought staring out the window but no longer seeing what lay beyond the glass why me mekeal would be a thousand times better lord holder than me and hed just love it why couldnt i have gone with lissa he sighed and put the lute aside reaching inside his tunic for the scrap of parchment that trevor coreys page had delivered to him after hed given lissas official letters into treesas hands he broke the seal on it and smoothed out the palimpsest carefully clever lissa to have filched the scraped and stained piece that no one would notice was gone shed used a good strong ink though even though the letters were a bit blurred he had no trouble reading them dearest vanyel if only you were here i cant tell you how much i miss you the corey girls are quite sweet but not terribly bright a lot like the cousins really i know i should have written you before this but i didnt have much of a chance your arm should be better now if only father wasnt so blind what im learning is exactly what we were working out together vanyel took a deep breath against the surge of anger at withens unreasonable attitude but we both know how he is so dont argue with him love just do what you re told it wont be forever really it wont just hold on ill do what i can from this end lord corey is a lot more reasonable than father ever was and maybe i can get him talked into asking for you maybe that will work just be really good and maybe father will be happy enough with you to do that love liss he folded the letter and tucked it away oh liss not a chance father would never let me go there not after the way ive been avoiding my practices it wont be forever hmm i suppose thats right i probably wont live past the next time jervis manages to catch up with me gods why is it that nobody ever asks me what i want or when they do ask why cant they mean it and listen to me he blinked and looked again at the little figures below still pounding away on each other like so many tent pegs determined to drive each other into the ground he turned restlessly away from the window stood up and replaced the lute in the makeshift stand hed contrived for it beside his other two instruments and everywhere i turn i get the same advice from liss dont fight do what father asks from mothercrying vapors and essentially the same thing shes not exactly stupid if she really cared about me she could manage father somehow but she doesnt care not when backing me against father is likely to cost her something and when i tried to tell father leren about what jervis was really like he shuddered the lecture about filial duty was bad enough but the one about proper masculine behavior youd have thought id been caught fornicating sheep and all because i objected to having my bones broken its like im doing something wrong somewhere but no one will tell me what it is and why its wrong i thought maybe father leren would understand since hes a priest but gods theres no help coming from that direction for a moment he felt trapped up here the secure retreat turned prison he didnt dare go out or hed be caught and forced into that despised armor and jervis would lay into him with a vengeful glee to make up for all the practices hed managed to avoid he looked wistfully beyond the practice field to the wooded land and meadows beyond it was such a beautiful day summer was just beginning and the breeze blowing in his open window was heady with the aroma of the hayfields in the sun he longed to be out walking or riding beneath those trees he was as trapped by the things he didnt dare do as by the ones he had to tomorrow i ii have to go riding out with father on his rounds he gloomed and no getting out of that hell have me as soon as i come down for breakfast that was a new torment added since hed recovered it was nearly as bad as being under jervis thumb he shuddered thinking of all those farmers staring staring like they were trying to stare into his soul this was not going to be a pleasure jaunt for all that he loved to ride no he would spend the entire day listening to his father lecture him on the duties of the lord holder to the tenants who farmed for him and the peasantfarmers who held their lands under his protection and governance but that was not the worst aspect of the ordeal it was the people themselves the way they measured him with their eyes opaque eyes full of murky thoughts that he could not read eyes that expected everything of him that demanded things of him that he did not want to give and didnt know how to give even if he had wanted to i dont want them looking to me like that i dont want to be responsible for their lives he shuddered again i wouldnt know what to do in a drought or an invasion and whats more i dont care gods they make my skin crawl all those people eating me alive with their eyes he turned away from the window and knelt beside his instruments stretched out his hand and touched the smooth wood the taut strings oh gods if i werent me if i could just have a chance to be a bard in the days before his arm had been hurt he had often imagined himself a court bard not in some outoftheway corner like forst reach but one of the great courts gyrefalcons marches or southron keep or even the high court of valdemar at haven imagined himself the center of a circle of admirers languid ladies and jewelbedecked lords all of them hanging enraptured on every word of his song he could let his imagination transport him to a different life the life of his dreams he could actually see himself surrounded not by the girls of treesas bower but by the entire high court of valdemar from queen elspeth down until the visualization was more real than his true surroundings he could see hear feel all of them waiting in impatient anticipation for him to sing the bright candles the perfume the pregnant silence now even that was lost to him now practices were solitary for there was no lissa to listen to new tunes lissa had been a wonderful audience she had a good ear and knew enough about music to be trusted to tell him the truth she had been the only person in the keep besides treesa who didnt seem to think there was something faintly shameful about his obsession with music and she was the only one who knew of his dream of becoming a bard there were no performances before his mothers ladies either because he refused to let them hear him fumble and all because of the lying bullying bastard his father had made armsmaster withen he froze startled completely out of his brooding by the sound of his mothers breathless slightly shrill voice just beyond the tiny door to the library he knelt slowly and carefully avoiding the slightest noise the last thing he wanted was to have his safe hiding place discovered withen what is it youve dragged me up here to tell me that you couldnt have said in my solar she asked vanyel could tell by the edge in her voice that she was ruffled and not at all pleased vanyel held his breath and heard the sound of the library door being closed then his fathers heavy footsteps crossing the library floor a long ponderous silence then im sending vanyel away withen said brusquely what treesa shrilled you how where why in the gods names withen why vanyel felt as if someone had turned his heart into stone and his body into clay i cant do anything with the boy treesa and neither can jervis withen growled im sending him to someone who can make something of him you cant do anything because the two of you seem to think to make something of him you have to force him to be something he can never be treesas voice was muffled by the intervening wall but the note of hysteria was plain all the same you put him out there with a man twice his weight and expect him to to behave like a man hes a sniveler a whiner treesa hes more worried about damage to his pretty face and delicate little hands than damage to his honor and you dont help matters by making him the pet of the bower treesa the boys become nothing more than a popinjay a vain little peacock and worse than that hes a total coward a coward gods withen only you would say that lady treesas voice was thick with scorn just because hes too clever to let that precious armsmaster of yours beat him insensible once a day so what does he do instead run off and hide because once just once he got his poor little arm broken great good gods id broken every bone in my body at least once by the time i was his age is that supposed to signify virtue she scoffed or stupidity vanyels mouth sagged open shes my gods shes standing up to him i dont believe this it signifies the willingness to endure a little discomfort in order to learn withen replied angrily thanks to you and your fosterlings all vanyels ever learned was how to select a tunic that matches his eyes and how to warble a love song hes too damned handsome for his own good and youve spoiled him treesa youve let him trade on that pretty face get away with nonsense and arrogance youd never have permitted in mekeal and now he has no sense of responsibility whatsoever he avoids even a hint of obligation youd prefer him to be like mekeal i suppose she replied acidly youd like him to hang on your every word and never question you never challenge you damned right withen roared in frustration the boy doesnt know his damned place filling his head with booklearned nonsense he doesnt know his place because he can think for himself just because he can read and write more than his bare name unlike certain grown men i could name gods withen that priest of yours has you parroting every little nuance doesnt he and youre sending van away because he doesnt measure up to his standards of propriety arent you because vanyel has the intelligence to question what hes told and leren doesnt like questions her voice reached new heights of shrillness that priest has you so neatly tied around his ankle that you wouldnt breathe unless he declared breathing was orthodox enough ah vanyel thought a part of his mind still working while the rest sat in stunned contemplation of the idea of being sent away now treesas support had a rational explanation lady treesa did not care for father leren vanyel was just a convenient reason to try to drive a wedge between withen and his crony although vanyel could have told her that this was exactly the wrong way to go about doing so i expected youd say something like that withen rumbled you have no choice treesa the boy is going whether you like it or not im sending him to savil at the high court sheii brook no nonsense and once hes in surroundings where hes not the only pretty face in the place he might learn to do something besides lisp a ballad and moon at himself in the mirror savil that old harridan his mothers voice rose with each word until she was shrieking vanyel wanted to shriek too he remembered his first and last encounter with his aunt savil only too well vanyel had bowed low to the silverhaired stranger a woman clad in impeccable heraldic whites contriving his best imitation of courtly manner herald savil who had packed herself up at the age of fourteen and hied herself off to haven without word to anyone and then been chosen the moment she passed the city gates was lissas idol lissa had pestered grandmother ashkevron for every tale about savil that the old woman knew vanyel couldnt understand why but if lissa admired this woman so much surely there must be more to her than appeared on the surface it was a pity that liss was visiting cousins the one week her idol chose to make an appearance at the familial holding but then again maybe that was exactly as withen had planned so this is vanyel the woman had said dryly a pretty boy treesa i trust hes something more than ornamental vanyel went rigid at her words then rose from his bow and fixed her with what he hoped was a cool appraising stare gods she looked like his father in the right light like lissa she had that ashkevron nose a nose that both she and withen thrust forward like a sharp blade to cleave all before them oh dont glare at me child the woman said with amusement ive had better men than you try to freeze me with a look and fail he flushed she turned away from him as if he was of no interest turning back to vanyels mother who was clutching a handkerchief at her throat so treesa has the boy shown any sign of gift or talent he sings beautifully treesa fluttered really hes as good as any minstrel weve ever had the woman turned and stared at him stared through him potential but nothing active savil said slowly a pity id hoped at least one of your offspring would share my gifts you can certainly afford to spare one to the queens service but the girls dont even have potential gifts your four other boys are worse than this one and this one doesnt appear to be much more than a clotheshorse for all his potential she waved a dismissing hand at him and vanyels face had burned ive seen what i came to see treesa she said leading vanyels mother off by the elbow i wont stress your hospitality anymore from all vanyel had heard savil was in many ways not terribly unlike her brother hard cold and unforgiving preoccupied with what she perceived as her duty she had never wedded vanyel was hardly surprised he couldnt imagine anyone wanting to bed savils chill arrogance he couldnt imagine why warm loving lissa wanted to be like her now his mother was weeping hysterically his father was making no effort to calm her by that vanyel knew there was no escaping the disastrous plan incoherent hysterics were his mothers court of last resort if they were failing there was no hope for him give it up treesa withen said unmoved his voice rocksteady the boy goes tomorrow you unfeeling monster that was all that was understandable through treesas weeping vanyel heard the staccato beat of her slippers on the floor as she ran out the library door then the slower heavier sound of his fathers boots then the sound of the door closing as leaden and final as the door on a tomb two vanyel stumbled over to his old chair and collapsed into its comfortable embrace he couldnt think everything had gone numb he stared blankly at the tiny rectangle of blue sky framed by the window just sat and stared he wasnt even aware of the passing of time until the sun began shining directly into his eyes he winced away from the light that broke his bewildered trance and he realized dully that the afternoon was gone that someone would start looking for him to call him for supper soon and hed better be back in his room he slouched dispiritedly over to the window and peered out of it making the automatic check to see if there was anyone below who could spot him but even as he did so it occurred to him that it hardly mattered if they found his hideaway considering what hed just overheard there was no one on the practice field now just the empty square of turf a chicken on the loose pecking at something in the grass from this vantage the keep might well have been deserted vanyel turned around and reached over his head grabbing the rough stone edging the window all around the exterior and levered himself up and out onto the sill once balanced there in a half crouch he stepped down onto the ledge that ran around the edge of the roof then reached around the gable and got a good handhold on the slates of the roof itself and began inching over to his bedroom window halfway between the two windows he paused for a moment to look down it isnt all that far if i fell just right the worst id do is break a leg then they couldnt send me off could they it might be worth it it just might be worth it he thought about that and thought about the way his broken arm had hurt not a good idea with my luck father would send me off as soon as i was patched up just load me up in a wagon like a sack of grain deliver to herald savil no special handling or worse id break my arm again or both arms ive got a chance to make that hand work again maybe but if i break it this time there isnt a healer around to make sure its set right vanyel swung his legs into the room balanced for a moment on the sill then dropped onto his bed once there he just lacked the spirit to even move he slumped against the wall and stared at the sloping whitewashed ceiling he tried to think if there was anything he could do to get himself out of this mess he couldnt come up with a single idea that seemed at all viable it was too late to mend his ways even if he wanted to no no i cant absolutely cant face that sadistic bastard jervis though im truly not sure which is the worst peril at this point in the long run aunt iceandiron or jervis i know what heii do to me i havent a clue to her he sagged and bit his lip trying to stay in control trying to think logically all he knew was that savil would have the worst possible report on him and at haven the irony of the name he would have no allies no hiding places that was the worst of it going off into completely foreign territory knowing that everybody there had been told how awful he was that they would just be waiting for him to make a slip all the time but there was no getting out of it for all that treesa petted and cosseted him vanyel knew better than to rely on her for anything or expect her to ever defy withen that brief flair during their argument had been the exception treesas real efforts always lay in keeping her own life comfortable and amusing shed cry for vanyel but shed never defend him not like lissa might well have if lissa had been here when the page came around to call everyone to dinner he managed to stir up enough energy to dust himself off and obey the summons but he had no appetite at all the highborn of forst reach ate late a candlemark after the servants hirelings and the armsmen had eaten since the great hall was far too small to hold everyone at once the torches and lanterns had already been lit along the worn stonefloored corridors they did nothing to dispel the darkness of vanyels heart he trudged along the dim corridors and down the stone stairs ignoring the servants trotting by him on errands of their own since his room was at the servants end of the keep he had a long way to go to get to the great hall once there he waited in the sheltering darkness of the doorway to assess the situation in the room beyond as usual he was nearly the last one to table as far as he could tell only his aunt serina was missing and she might well have eaten earlier with the children carefully watching for the best opportunity to do so undetected he slipped into his seat beside his brother mekeal at the low table during a moment when lord withen was laughing at some joke of father lerens the usually austere cleric seemed in a very good mood tonight and vanyels heart sank if leren was pleased it probably didnt bode vanyel any good where were you this afternoon mekeal asked as he wiggled over to give vanyel a place on the bench interrupting his noisy inhalation of soup vanyel shrugged does it matter he asked trying to sound indifferent its no secret how i feel about that nonsense and its no secret how jervis feels about me so does it really matter where i was mekeal chuckled into his bowl probably not you know jervisll just be harder on you when you do get caught and youre going to get caught one of these days youre looking for another broken arm if youre lucky if thats the way you want it on your head be it so father hasnt said anything yet vanyel thought with surprise his spoon poised above the soup he glanced over at the head table lady treesa was in her accustomed place beside her lord and she didnt look any more upset than she usually did she certainly showed no signs of the hysterics vanyel had overheard this afternoon could she actually have stood up for me just this once could she have gotten him to back down oh gods if only the renewal of hope did not bring a corresponding renewal of appetite the tension only made his stomach knot up the more the room seemed far too hot he loosened the laces of his tunic but that didnt help the flames of the lamps on the wall behind him made the shadows dance on the table until he had to close his eyes and take several deep breaths to get his equilibrium back he felt flushed and feverish and after only a few mouthfuls of the thick swiftly cooling soup that seemed utterly tasteless he signaled to a servant to take it away he squirmed uncomfortably on the wooden bench and pushed the rest of his meal around on his plate with one eye always on the high table and his father the high table was high raised on a dais a good hand above the rest of the room and set at the head of the low table like the upper bar of a t that meant that it overlooked and overshadowed the low table vanyel could feel the presence of those sitting there looming over him even at those few times when he wasnt watching them with each course his stomach seemed to acquire another lump a colder and harder one until he finally gave up all pretense of eating then just at the dessert course when he thought he might be saved his father rose to his feet lord withen towered over the table as he towered over vanyel and everything belonging to forst reach he prided himself on being a plain man close enough in outlook to any of his men that they could feel easy with him his sturdy brown leather tunic and linen shirt were hardly distinguishable from the garb of any of the hireling armsmen the tunic was decorated with polished silver studs instead of copper but that was the only token of his rank the tunic strained across his broad shoulders and across the barest hint of a paunch his long dark hair was confined in a tail at the nape of his neck by a silver band his beard trimmed close to his square jawline vanyels changeling appearance especially when contrasted with mekeals may have been one reason why withen seemed to be irritated whenever he looked at his eldest son vanyel was lean and not particularly tall mekeal was tall and muscular already taller than vanyel although he was two years younger vanyels hair was so black it had blue highlights and his eyes were a startling silvergray exactly like his mothers and he had no facial hair to speak of mekeals eyes were a chestnut brown he already had to shave and his hair matched his fathers so closely that it would not have been possible to tell which of them a particular plucked hair came from mekeal made friends as easily as breathing i never had anyone but lissa mekeal was tonedeaf vanyel lived for music mekeal suffered through his scholastic lessons vanyel so far exceeded his brother that there was no comparison in short mekeal was completely his fathers son vanyel was utterly withens opposite perhaps that was all in withens mind as he rose and spared a glance for his firstandsecondborn sons before fixing his gaze on nothing in particular the lanterns behind withen danced and his shadow reached halfway down the low table as that stark shadow darkened the table it blackened vanyels rising hope after due consideration withen rumbled i have decided that it is time for vanyel to acquire education of a kind more involved than we can give him here so tonight will be the last night he is among us tomorrow he will begin a journey to my sister heraldmage savil at the high court of valdemar who will take official guardianship of him until he is of age withen sat down heavily treesa burst into a tearful wail and shoved herself away from the table as she stood her chair went over with a clatter that sounded in the unnatural silence that now filled the great hall as loud as if the entire table were collapsing she ran from the room sobbing into her sleeve as withen maintained a stony silence her fosterlings and ladies followed her and only melenna cast an unreadable glance over her shoulder at vanyel before trailing off in the wake of the others everyone in the silent room seemed to have been frozen by an evil spell finally withen reached forward and took a walnut from the bowl before him he nestled it in his palm and cracked it in his bare hands vanyel jumped at the sound and he wasnt the only one very good nuts last year dont you think withen said to father leren that seemed to be the signal for the entire room to break out in frantic babbling on vanyels right three of his cousins began laying noisy bets on the outcome of a race between radevel and kerle on the morrow on his right radevel whispered to mekeal while across the table from him his youngest brother heforth exchanged punches and pokes with cousin larence vanyel was pointedly ignored he might just as well have been invisible except for the sly sidelong looks he was getting and not just from the youngsters either when he looked up at the high table once he caught father leren staring at him and smiling slyly when their eyes met the priest nodded very slightly gave vanyel a look brimming with selfsatisfaction and only then turned his attention back toward withen during that silent exchange which nobody else seemed to have noticed vanyel had felt himself grow pale and cold as the dessert course was cleared away the elders left the hall on affairs of their own and a few of the girlsmore of vanyels cousins returned a sign that lady treesa had retired for the night the boys and young men remaining now rose from their seats the young usually reigned over the hall undisturbed after dinner with the girls that had returned they formed three whispering giggling groups two sets of four and one of eleven all three groups blatantly closing vanyel out even the girls seemed to have joined in the conspiracy to leave him utterly alone vanyel pretended not to notice the muttering the jealous glances he rose from the bench a few moments after the rest had abandoned him making it a point of honor to saunter over to stare into the fire in the great fireplace he walked with head high features schooled into a careful mask of bored indifference he could feel their eyes on the back of his neck but he refused to turn refused to show any emotion at all much less how queasy their behavior was making him feel finally when he judged that he had made his point he stretched yawned and turned he surveyed the entire room through halfclosed eyelids for a long moment his own gaze barely brushing each of them then paced lazily across the endless length of the great hall pausing only to nod a cool good night to the group nearest the door before finally achieving the sanctuary of the dark hallway beyond it ye gods youd think he was the heir to the throne sandar exclaimed rolling his eyes and throwing up his hands queen elspeth herself wouldnt put on such airs eighteenyearold joserlin corveau stared after the lad for a long moment putting his thoughts together he was the oldest of the fosterlings and the latestcome really he wasnt properly a fosterling at all nor a close cousin a true cousin childless after many years had decided on joserlin as his heir and as he himself was not in the best of health requested he be fostered to lord withen to learn the ways of governance of ones holdings he was broad and tall as any of the doors to the keep and even jervis respected the power of his young muscles after a single practice session with young jos jervis had decreed that he was old enough to train with withens armsmen after seeing the way jervis trained the boys jos had been quite content to have it so some of the younger boys had made the mistake of thinking that his slow speech and large build meant that he was stupid they had quickly discovered their mistake when hed gotten them with welltimed jokes he liked to say of himself that while he didnt think quickly he did think things through all the way and there were aspects of this vaguely disturbing evening that were not adding together properly in his mind meanwhile the rest of his group continued dissecting withens leastbeloved offspring he thinks he is the heir to the throne giggled jyllian swishing her skirts coquettishly or at least that the rest of us are that far below him you should see him lording it over us in the bower she struck her nose in the air and mimed looking down it while playing a makebelieve lute but just try and get anything out of him besides a song brrr watch the snow fall youd think we were poisonvellis the way he pulls away and goes cold mekeal snorted tossing his head thinks hes too good for you i sppose nothing high enough for him but a lady of the bloodroyal no doubt think girls like you arent lofty enough or not pretty enough snickered merthin havens give it a thought none of you little lovelies are even a close match for his majestys sweet face cant have his lady less beautiful than he is after all i dont doubt larence put in his bit coming up behind merthin well hell find hes not the only pretty face when he gets to the high court he just might find himself standing in somebodys shadow for a change take my word for it dear little vanyel is going to get a rude awakening when he gets to haven dammit its not fair mekeal grumbled face clouding at this reminder of vanyels destination id give my arm to go to haven i mean think of it the best fighters in the country are there its the center of everything he flung his hands wide nearly hitting merthin in a gesture of total frustration howm i ever going to get a an officers commission or any kind of position when nobody with any say at court is ever going to see me thats why they sent msister off to be fostered right near there you have a chance to get noticed at court shes going to be an officer you can bet on it an best ill ever get is maybe a sector command which means not one damn thing i need to be at court i aint going to inherit im the one that should be going not vanyel its not fair huh youve got that right larence echoed shifting his feet restlessly dammit were all seconds thirds we all need a chance like that or well be stuck doing nothing at the end of nowhere for the rest of our lives were never going to get anywhere stuck off here in the back of beyond and think of the ladies added kerle rolling his eyes up and kissing his hand at the ceiling all the loveliest darlings in the kingdom he ducked laughing as jyllian feinted a blow at his head then shook her fist at him in mockanger dammit think a bit mekeal persisted what in havens name has he done to deserve getting rewarded like that all he does around here is play hes a minstrel look down that long nose of his at the rest of us and shirk every duty he can mekeal glowered and pounded his fist into the palm of his other hand to emphasize his words hes mothers little darling but theres no way shed have talked father into sending him off you all saw how she acted so why why him when the rest of us would die to get a chance to go to the capital joserlin continued to stare off into the dark he was still putting together what hed been observing everyone looked expectantly at him when mekeal subsided and he cleared his throat they all knew at this point that he was not the bright intellectual light among his brothers and cousins that vanyel was but he had a knack of seeing to the heart of things and they wanted to hear if he had an answer for them he usually did and as they had half expected this time was no exception what makes you all think its a reward he asked quietly the astonishment in the faces turned to his followed by the light of dawning understanding made him nod as he saw them come to the same conclusion he had made you see he said just as quietly as before it isnt a reward for vanyel its an exile vanyel didnt have to control his trembling when he reached the safe concealing shelter of the hallway but he didnt dare pause there someone might take it into his or her head to follow him but what he could do now that he was out of the range of prying curious eyes and ears was run so he did though he ran as noiselessly as he could fleeing silently behind his shadow through the dim uncertain light of the hallways his flight took him past the dark closed doorways leading to the bower to bachelors hall to the chapel his shadow sprang up before him every time he passed a lantern or torch splaying out thin and spidery on the floor he kept his head down so that if anyone should happen to come out of one of those doorways they wouldnt see how close he was to tears but no one appeared he reached the safe shelter of the servants wing without encountering a single soul once there he dashed heedlessly up the stone staircase someone had extinguished the lanterns on the staircase itself vanyel didnt care hed run up these stairs often enough when half blind from trying not to cry and his feet knew the way of themselves he hit the top landing at a dead run and made the last few feet to his own door in a few heartbeats he was sobbing for breath as he fumbled out his key in the dark and unlocked it and the tears were threatening to spill spill they did as soon as he got the door open he shut and locked it behind him leaning his back against it head thrown back and resting against the rough wood he swallowed his sobs out of sheer prideful refusal to let anyone know of his unhappiness even a servant but hot tears poured down his cheeks and soaked into the neck of his tunic and he couldnt make them stop they hate me they all hate me i knew they didnt much like me but i never knew how much they hated me never had he felt so utterly alone and nakedly vulnerable at that moment if he could have ensured his death hed have thrown himself out of his window but as hed noted earlier it wasnt that far to the ground and pain was a worse prospect than loneliness finally he stumbled to his bed pulled his clothing off and crawled under the blankets shivering with the need to keep from crying out loud but despite his best efforts the tears started again and he muffled his sobs in his pillow oh liss oh liss i dont know what to do nobody cares nobody gives a damn about me nobody would ever risk a hangnail for me but you and they ve taken you out of reach im afraid and im alone and fathers trying to break me i know he is he turned over and stared into the darkness above him feeling his eyes burn i wish i could die now he tried to will his heart to stop but it obstinately ignored him why cant they just leave me alone he closed his burning eyes and bit his lip why he lay in his bed feeling every lump in the mattress every prickle in the sheets every muscle was tensed until it ached his head was throbbing and his eyes still burning he lay there for at least an eternity but the oblivion he hoped for didnt come finally he gave up on trying to sleep fumbled for the candle at his bedside and slid out into the stuffy darkness of the room he grabbed up his robe from the foot of the bed and pulled it on over his trembling naked body and began crossing the floor to the door though the room itself was warm too warm the tiled floor was shockingly cold under his feet he felt his way to the door and pressed his ear against the crack at the side listening with all his might for any sounds from the corridor and stairs beyond nothing he cautiously slipped the inside bolt listened again still nothing he cracked the door and peered around the edge into the corridor it was thankfully empty but the nearest lantern was all the way down at the dead end he took a deep breath and drew himself up standing as tall and resolutely erect as if he were lord of the keep himself he walked calmly surely down the empty corridor with just as much arrogance as if all his cousins eyes were on him because there was no telling when one of the upper servants who had their rooms along this hall might take it into their heads to emerge and servants talked frequently and they would talk if one of them got a glimpse of vanyel in tears it would be all over the keep in a candlemark he lit his candle at the lantern and made another stately progress back to his room only when he had securely bolted the door behind him did he let go of the harpstringtaut control hed maintained outside he began shaking so hard that the candle flame danced madly and spilled drops of hot wax on his hands he lit the others in their sconces by the door and over the bed as quickly as he could and placed the one he was clutching in the holder on his table before he could burn himself with it he sat down heavily on the ruckedup blankets sucking the side of his thumb where hot wax had scorched him and staring at his belongings trying to decide what his father was likely to let him take with him he didnt even bother to consider his instruments they were far safer where they were maybe someday if he survived this he could come back and get them but there was no chance none at all that he could sneak them out in his belongings and if his father found them packed up hed smash them hed smash them and laugh and wait for me to say or do something about it he finally got up and knelt on the chill stone beside the chest that held his clothing he raised the heavy carved lid and stared down at the top layer for a long moment before lifting it out tunics shirts breeches hose all in the deep jeweltones of sapphire and aquamarine and emerald that he knew looked so good on him or his favorite black silvery or smoky gray all clothing he wore because it was one tiny way to defy his father because his father could wear the same three outfits all year all of them identical and never notice never care because his father didnt give a damn about what he or anyone else wore and it angered him that vanyel did vanyel pondered the clothing stroking the soft raime of a shirt without much thinking about what he was doing he wont dare keep me from taking the clothes though i bet hed like to ill have to look presentable when i get there or ill shame him and the stuff mekeal and the rest scruff around in is not presentable he began rolling the clothing carefully and stowing it into the traveling packs kept in the bottom of the chest though he didnt dare take an instrument he managed to secrete some folded music some of his favorite pieces between the pages of the books he packed bards are thick as birds in a cherry grove at haven he thought with a lump in his throat maybe i can get one to trade an old gittern for a cloakbrooch or something it wont be the same as my lovely woodlark but itll be better than nothing provided i can keep aunt unsavory from taking it away from me it was all too quickly done he found himself on the floor beside the filled packs with nothing more to do he looked around his room there was nothing left to pack that he would miss except for those few things that he wanted to take but didnt dare pretty fine life ive led when all of it fits in four packs he got slowly to his feet feeling utterly exhausted yet almost too weary to sleep he blew out all the candles except the one at his bedside slipped out of his robe tucked it into the top of the last pack and climbed back into bed somehow he couldnt bring himself to blow out the last candle while there was light in the room he could keep the tears back but darkness would set them free he lay rigid staring silently at the candlelight wavering on the slanted ceiling until his eyes burned all the brothers and fosterlings shared rooms mekeal had shared his with vanyel until his older brothers broken arm had sent mekeal down here a year early and when vanyel hadnt made the move down mekeal hadnt been particularly unhappy so for a while he had this one to himself at which point he found that he really hadnt liked being alone after all he liked company now though at least since late spring hed shared with joserlin that had been fine with him jos was the next thing to an adult mekeal had been excited to have him move in pleased with his company and proud that jos had treated him like an equal and jos talked to him he didnt talk much but when he did it was worth listening to but hed already said his say earlier tonight so mekeal had thought so he was kind of surprised when jos deep voice broke the silence right after theyd blown the candles out mekeal why are you younglings so hard on your brother mekeal didnt have to ask which brother it was pretty plain who jos meant but hard on him how could you be hard on somebody who didnt give a damn about anything but himself cause hes a toad mekeal said indignantly hes got no more backbone than a mushroom hes a baby a coward an the only thing he cares abouts hisself hes just like mama shes gone and made him into a mamapet a shirker hmm really what makes you so sure of that last father says and jervis because he wont let jervis pound him like a set of pells joserlin snorted with absolute contempt cant says as i much blame him myself if i was built like him with jervis on my back reckon id find a hidinghole too i sures haven wouldnt go givin jervis more chances t hit on me mekeals mouth fell open in shock and he squirmed around in his bed to face where joserlin was a dark bulk to his right but but jervis hes armsmaster hes a hamhanded lackwit came the flat reply you forget meke i was fostered with lord kendrik i learned under a real armsmaster master orser and hes a good one jervis wouldnt be anything but another armsman if he hadnt been an old friend of your fathers he dont deserve to be armsmaster havens meke he goes after the greenest of you like you was his age his weight and his experience he dont pull his blows half the time and he dont bother to show you how to take em just lets you fumble it out for yourselves an he dont know but one bare style an that ones holy writ but but nothin hes no great master let me tell you by my way of thinkin hes no master at all if i was vanyel ida poisoned myself before i let the old goat take his spleen out on me again i heard what happened this spring about how he took after van an beat him down a half dozen times an then broke his arm but he was cheating mekeal protested no such thing radevel told me what really happened before that bastard managed to convince you lot that you didnt see van getting beaten up cause he bested the old peabrain that werent nothing but plain old bullying an if my old armsmaster had treated one of his pupils that way hed have been kicked off the top of the tower by lord kendrick hisself mekeal could hardly believe what he was hearing but he protested again but father your fathers a damn fool joserlin replied shortly an i wont beg your pardon for sayin so hes a damn fool for keepin jervis as master an hes a damn fool for treatin young vanyel the way he does hes beggin for trouble evry time he pushes that boy half of what vanyel does he made him do to spite him you mark my words i seen this before only the opposite place next to where i was fostered at your age old lady cedrys at briary holding old cedrys she was big on scholarly stuff nothin would do but for her oldest t be at the books night and daycept her oldest was like you mad for the guard and the more cedrys pushed books the more liaven ran for the armsmaster at our place till one day he kept right on running and didnt stop till hed signed up with a common mercenarycompany an she never saw him again but jos youve seen him the way he lords it over us like he was king of the gods or something keeping his nose in the air every time he looks at us uhhuh joserlin replied out of the dark and some of its cause hes spoiled flat rotten by lady treesa i wont deny that hes one right arrogant little wart an he sure knows hes the prettiest thing on the holding makes sure everybody else knows it too but i cant help but wonder how much he sticks that nose in the air around you lot cause you seem so bent on rubbin it in the dirt hmm mekeal could find nothing to say in reply i could run away vanyel thought almost dizzy with weariness but still finding sleep eluding him icould run away i think he chewed his lip until it bled if i did what could i do go for sanctuary gods no there is no way i was meant to be a priest i dont write well enough to be a scribe and besides there isnt a lord would hire me once they found out who i was father would see to that i know he would oh gods why didnt you make me a bard he licked the corner of his mouth struck with a kindred though i could try my hand at minstrelsy couldnt i i couldnt i darent show my face at any large courts but theres a bit of coin to be had singing almost anywhere else for a moment it seemed the way out he need only slip across to the storeroom and get his instruments then run off before dawn he could be far away before anyone realized he was gone and not just hiding again but no my hand my hand until its working right i cant do anything but the barest simple music if i cant play right theres no way i could look for a place in a household and without the kind of noble patronage i cant look for i wont be able to do much more than keep myself fed i cant live like that i just cant i cant sing for farmers in the taverns and the folks in the fairs i cant go begging like that not to peasants not unless it looks like savil is going to poison me and i dont bloody think thats likely shes a herald heralds dont do that sort of thing even to please their brothers he sighed and the candle went out no it wont work theres no way to escape he waited feeling the lump growing in his throat threatening to undermine him again the tears were going to come going to weaken him still further push him down into helplessness the darkness closed around him like a fist and he fought against crying with such singlemindedness that he never quite knew when he passed from a halfdaze into troubled dreamhaunted sleep he was alone completely alone for once in his life there was no one pushing him no one mocking him above him was only dull gray sky around him a plain of ice and snow stretched glittering to the horizon everywhere he looked there was nothing but that barren white plain completely empty completely featureless it was so cold he felt numb numb not aching inside not ready to weep at a single word just cold no pain just nothing he just stood for several long moments savoring the unfeeling the lack of pain safe he was safe here no one could touch him as long as he stayed in this isolation this wilderness no one could touch him he opened his eyes wide in the dream and breathed the words out if no one touches me no one can hurt me all i have to do is never care it was like a revelation a gift from the hithertouncaring gods this place this wilderness of ice if he could hold it inside him if he could notcare enoughhe could be safe no matter what happened who hated him no one could ever hurt him again not ever again three in the morning all he had to do was think of his dream and he was cold inside ice filling the place within him where the hurt and loneliness had been he could be as remote and isolated as a hermit on a frozen mountaintop any time he chose it was like taking a drug against pain an antidote to loneliness idifference was a defense now and not just a pose could this armor of indifference serve as an offensive weapon too it was worth a try after all he had nothing to lose the worst had already occurred he dressed quickly riding leathers that had originally been brown that he had ordered redyed to black without his fathers knowledge he was very glad that hed done so now black always made him look taller older and just a little bit sinister it was a good choice for a confrontation it was also the color of death he wanted to remind his father of just how often the man had vanyel elsewhere he had second thoughts about his instruments at least the lute which he had been permitted he wouldnt pack it but it should be here else lord withen might wonder where it was besides if he could confront withen with it then force the issue by packing it in front of his eyes it might gain him something so he slipped quickly across to his hiding place and back before the sun actually rose and when withen came pounding on his door he was ensconced below the window with the instrument in his hands picking out a slow but intricate little melody one where his right hand was doing most of the work he had staged the entire scene with the deliberate intent to make it seem as if he had been there for hours lord withen had no doubt expected to find his oldest son still in his bed had expected to rouse out a confused and profoundly unhappy boy into the thin gray light of postdawn had undoubtedly counted on rinding vanyel as vulnerable as he had been last night that would have pleased you wouldnt it father it would have given you such confirmation of my worthlessness instead he flung the door open after a single knock to find vanyel awake packed and already dressed for travel lute suddenly stilled by his entrance vanyel looked up and regarded his father with what he hoped was a cool and distant arrogance exactly the kind of expression one would turn upon a complete stranger who had suddenly intruded himself without invitation his surprise and the faint touch of unease in his eyes gave vanyel the first feelings of gratification hed had in a long time he placed his lute on the bed beside him and stood up slowly drawing himself up as pridefully erect as he could as you see sir he lifted a single finger and nodded his head very slightly in the direction of his four packs i am prepared already lord withen was obviously taken further aback by his tone and abstracted manner he coughed and vanyel realized with a sudden surge of vindictive joy that he for once had the advantage in a confrontation then withen flushed as vanyel stooped quickly and caught up the neck of his lute detuning it with swift and practiced fingers and stuffing it quickly into its traveling bag that was a challenge even withen recognized he glowered and made as if to take the instrument from his son and vanyel drew himself up to his full height he said nothing he only gave back withen a stare that told him push me do it see what happens when you do i have absolutely nothing to lose and i dont care what happens to me withen actually backed up a pace at the look in his sons eyes you may take your toy but dont think this means you can spend all your time lazing about with those worthless bards withen blustered trying to regain the high ground hed lost the moment he thrust the door open youre going to savil to learn something other than i never imagined i would be able to for a moment sir vanyel interrupted and produced a bitter notsmile im quite certain he continued with carefully measured venom that you have given my aunt very explicit instructions on the subject and on my education sir withen flushed again vanyel felt another rush of poisonous pleasure you know and i know what this is really about dont we father but you want me to pretend its something else at least in public too bad i dont intend to make this at all easy on you and i dont intend to be graceful in public i have the high ground father i dont give a damn anymore and that gives me a weapon you dont have withen made an abrupt gesture and a pair of servants entered vanyels room from the corridor beyond each picking up two packs and scurrying out of the door as quickly as they could vanyel pulled the shoulder strap of the lute over his own head arranging the instrument on his back as a clear sign that he did not intend anyone else to be handling it you neednt see me off sir he said when withen made no move to follow the servants with their burdens im sure you have more important things to attend to withen winced visibly vanyel strolled silently past him then turned to deliver a parting shot carefully calculated to hurt as much as only a truth that should not be spoken could after all sir he cast calmly over his shoulder it isnt as if i mattered you have four other potential and far worthier heirs i am sorry you saw fit not to inform my mother of my hour of departure it would have been pleasant to say farewell to someone who will miss my presence withen actually flinched vanyel raised one eyebrow dont bother to wish me well sir i know what father leren preaches about the importance of truth and i would not want you to perjure yourself the stricken look on withens face made a cold flame of embittered satisfaction spring up in vanyels iceshrouded soul he turned on his heel and strode firmly down the corridor after the scuttling servants not giving his father the chance to reply nor to issue orders to the servants he passed the two servants with his packs in the dim graylit hallway and gestured peremptorily that they should follow him again he felt that blackly bitter satisfaction obviously lord withen had intended that his son should have scampered along in the servants wake but the sudden reversal of roles had confused withen and left the servants without clear instructions vanyel seized the unlookedfor opportunity and held to it with all his might for once just this once vanyel had gotten the upper hand in a situation and he did not intend to relinquish it until he was forced to he led them down the illlit staircase hearing them stumbling blindly behind him in the darkness and thankful that he was the one carrying his lute and that there was nothing breakable in the packs they emerged at the end of the hall nearest the kitchen vanyel decided to continue to force the issue by going out the servants door to the stables it was closer but that wasnt why he chose it he chose it to make the point that he knew his fathers thoughts about him the two servitors laden as they were with the heavy packs had to stretch to keep up with him already they were panting with effort as vanyels boots crunched in the gravel spread across the yard between the keep and the stables he could hear them puffing along far behind him the sun was barely over the horizon and mist was rising from the meadows where the horses were turned loose during the day it would likely be hot today one of the first days of true high summer vanyel could see as he came around the side of the stable that the doors were standing wide open and that there were several people moving about inside couldnt wait to be rid of me could you father dear meant to hustle me off as fast as you could throw me into my clothes and my belongings into packs i think in this i will oblige you it should keep you sufficiently confused now that he had this set of barriers for the first time in more than a year he was able to think clearly and calmly he was able to make plans without being locked in an emotional morass and carry them out without losing his head to frustration gods it was so simple just dont give a damn dont care what they do to you and they do nothing if i were staying id never have dared to say those things but im not and by the time father figures out how to react ill be far beyond his ability to punish me even if he reports all this to aunt unsavory its going to sound really stupid and whats more it ii make him look a fool he paused in the open doors feet slightly apart hands on his hips after a few moments those inside noticed him and the buzz of conversation ceased altogether as they turned to gape at him in dumbfounded surprise why isnt my mare saddled he asked quietly coldly the only two horses bearing riding saddles were two rough cobs obviously meant for the two armsmen beside them men who had been examining their girths and who had suddenly straightened to attention at the sound of his voice there was another beast with a riding saddle on it but it wasnt a horse it was an aging fat pony one every boy on the holding had long since outgrown and a mount that was now given to treesas most elderly women to ride beggin yer pardon mlord vanyel said one of the grooms hesitantly but yer father i really could not care less what my father ordered vanyel interrupted rudely and angrily he isnt going to have to ride halfway to the end of the world on that hobbyhorse i am the one being sent on this little exile and i am not going to ride that i refuse to enter the capital on a beast that is going to make me look like a clown besides star is mine not his the lady treesa gave her to me and i intend to take her with me saddle her the groom continued to hesitate if you wont vanyel said his eyes narrowing his voice edged with the coldest steel i will either way youll have trouble and if i have to do it and my lady mother finds out youll have trouble from her as well as my father the groom shrugged and went after star and her tack leaving his fellow to strip the pony and turn it into the pasture lovely put me on a mount only a tyro would have to ride and make it look as if i was too much a coward to handle a real horse make me look a fool riding into haven on a pony and deprive me of something i treasured not this time father in fact vanyel was already firmly in stars saddle by the time lord withen made a somewhat belated appearance in the stableyard the grooms were fastening the last of the packs on the backs of three mules and the armsmen were waiting also mounted out in the yard vanyel patted the proudly arched neck of his star a delicatelyboned black palfrey with a perfect white star on her forehead a star that had one long point that trailed down her nose he ignored his father for a long moment giving him a chance to absorb the sight of his son on his spirited little bloodmare instead of the homely old pony then he nudged star toward the edge of the yard where lord withen stood by his stunned expression once again taken by surprise she picked her way daintily across the gravel making very little sound like a remnant of nightshadow in the early morning light vanyel had had all her tack dyed the same black as his riding leathers and was quite well aware of how striking they looked together so was she she curved her neck and carried her tail like a banner as he directed her toward his father lord withens expression changed as they approached first discomfited then resigned vanyel kept his the same as it had been all this morning nonexistent he kept his gaze fixed on a point slightly above his fathers head behind him vanyel could hear the mules being led out to have the lead rein of the first fastened to the cantle of one of the armsmens saddles he halted star about then a few paces from the edge of the yard he looked down at his father keeping his face completely still completely closed they stared at each other for a long moment vanyel could see withen groping for something appropriate to say and each time he began to speak the words died unspoken beneath vanyels cold and dispassionate gaze im not going to make this easy for you father not after what you ve done to me not after what you tried to do to me just now im going to follow my sires example im going to be just as nasty as you are but im going to do it with more style the silence lengthened almost unbearably even the armsmen began picking up the tension and shifted uneasily in their saddles their cobs fidgeted and snorted restlessly vanyel and star could have been a statue of onyx and silver finally vanyel decided he had prolonged the agony enough he nodded once almost imperceptibly then without a word he wheeled star and nudged her lightly with his heels she tossed her head and shot down the road to the village at a fast trot leaving the armsmen cursing and kicking at their beasts behind him trying to catch up he reined star in once they were past the forst reach village not wanting her to tire herself so early in the journey and not wanting to give the armsmen an excuse to order him to ride between them fathers probably told them that they re to watch for me trying to bolt he thought cynically as star fought the rein for a moment then settled into a moreorless sedate walk and indeed that surmise was confirmed when he saw them exchange surreptitious glances and nottoowell concealed sighs of relief huh little do they know for once they got beyond the forst reach lands that lay under the plow they entered the completely untamed woodlands that lay between forst reach and the nearest eastward holding of prytheree ford this forest land had been left purposely wild there werent enough people to farm it at either holding and it supplied all of the wood products and a good half of the meat eaten in a year to the people of both holdings it took skilled foresters to make their way about in a wood like this and vanyel knew very well that he had no more idea of how to survive in wilderland than he did of how to sprout fins and breathe water the road itself was hardly more than a rutted track of hardpacked dirt meandering through a tunnel of tree branches the branches themselves were so thick overhead that they rode in a kind of green twilight although the sun was dispersing the mist outside the wood there were still tendrils of it wisping between the trees and lying across the road and only an occasional sunbeam was able to make its way down through the canopy of leaves to strike the roadway to either side the track was edged with thick bushes a hint here and there of red among the green leaves told vanyel that those bushes were blackberry hedges probably planted to keep bears and other predators off the road itself even if hed been thinking of escape he was not fool enough to dare their brambly embrace even less did he wish to damage stars tender hide with the unkind touch of their thorns beyond the bushes so far as he could see the forest floor was a tangle of vegetation in which he would be lost in heartbeats no he was not in the least tempted to bolt and run but there were other reasons not to run besides the logical ones there were or seemed to be things tracking them under the shelter of the underbrush shadowshapes that made no sound he didnt much like those shadows behind the bushes or ghosting along with the fog he didnt at all care for the way they moved sometimes following the riders on the track for furlongs before giving up and melting into deeper forest those shadows called to mind far too many stories and tales and the border with all its uncanny creatures wasnt all that far from here the forest itself was too quiet for vanyels taste even had those shadows not been slinking beneath the trees only occasionally could he hear a bird call above the dull clopping of the horses hooves and that was faint and far off no breeze stirred the leaves above them no squirrels ran along the branches to scold them of course it was entirely possible that they were frightening all the nearby wildlife into silence simply with their presence these woods were hunted regularly that was the obvious explanation of the silence beneath the trees but vanyels tooactive imagination kept painting other grimmer pictures of what might be lurking unseen out there even though it became very warm and a halt would have been welcome he really found himself hoping they wouldntmake one the armor that had so far been proof against pressure from without cracked just a little from the pressure within of his own vivid imagination he was uneasy when they paused to feed and water the horses and themselves at noon and was not truly comfortable until they saddled up and moved off again the only way he could keep his nerves in line was to concentrate on how well he had handled lord withen recalling that stupified look hed last seen on withens face gave him no end of satisfaction withen hadnt seen vanyel the boy hed seen a man in some sort of control over his situation and he plainly hadnt enjoyed the experience it was with very real relief that vanyel saw the trees break up then open out into a huge clearing ahead of them just as the woods began to darken with the dying of the day he was more than pleased when he saw there was an inn there and realized that his guardians had been undoubtedly intending to stay there overnight they rode up the flinty dirt road to the facade of the inn then through the entryway into the inn yard that was where his two guardians halted looking about for a stableboy vanyel dismounted feeling very stiff and a lot sorer than he had thought hed be when a groom came to take stars reins he gave them over without a murmur then paced up and down the length of the dusty stableyard trying to walk some feeling back into his legs while he walked one of the armsmen vanished into the inn itself and the other removed the packs from the mules before turning them and their cobs over to more grooms it was at that point that vanyel realized that he didnt even know his captors names that bothered him he was going to be spending a lot of time in their company yet they hadnt even introduced themselves during the long ride he was confused and uncomfortable yet the less i feel the better off ill be he closed his eyes and summoned his snowfield could almost feel it chilling him numbing him he began looking over the inn ignoring the other guard and saw with mild surprise that it was huge much bigger than it had looked from the road only the front face of it was really visible when he rode up toll now he could see the entire complex it was easily five times the size of the little village inn at forst reach and twostoried as well its outer walls were of stone up to the second floor then timber the roof was thickly thatched and the birds vanyel had missed in the forest all seemed to have made a happy home here nestling into the thatch with a riot of calls and whistles as they settled in for the night with the stables it formed two sides of a square around the stable yard the fourth side being open on a grassy field probably for the use of traders and their wagons the stables were extensive too easily as large as lord withens and he was a notable horsebreeder blue shadows were creeping from the forest into the stableyard although the sky above had not quite begun to darken very much and it was getting quite chilly something vanyel hadnt expected given the heat of the day he was just as glad when the second armsman finally put in an appearance trailed by a couple of inn servants vanyel pretended to continue to study the sky to the west but he strained his ears as hard as he could to hear what his guardians had to say to each other any problems garth asked the one whod remained with vanyel as the first bent to retrieve a pack and motioned to the servants to take the ones vanyel recognized as being his own nay the first chuckled this early in th summer they be right glad of custom wi good coin in hand none o yer shifty peddlers neither just like mlord said got us rooms on second story wi his highness there on t inside no way he gets out wiout us noticin besides we bein second floor ts needful we just move t bed across t door an he wont be goin nowhere vanyel froze and the little corner of him that had been wondering if he could perhaps make allies of these two withdrew so thats why theyre keeping their distance he straightened his back and let that cool expressionless mask that had served so well with his father this morning drop over his features again i might have guessed as much i was a fool to think otherwise he turned to face his watchers i trust all is in order he asked letting nothing show except perhaps boredom then shall we he nodded slightly toward the inn door where a welcoming golden light was shining without waiting for a reply he moved deliberately toward it himself leaving them to follow vanyel stared moodily at the candle at his bedside there wasnt anything much else to look at his room had no windows other than that it wasnt that much unlike his old room back at forst reach quite plain a bit stuffy not too bad really except that it had no windows except for being a prison inventory one bed one chair one table no fireplace but that wasnt a consideration given the general warmth of the building and the fact that it was summer all four of his packs were piled over in the corner the lute still in its case leaning up against them hed asked for a bath and theyd brought him a tub and bathwater rather than letting him go down to the bathhouse the water was tepid and the tub none too big but hed acted as if the notion had been his idea at least his guardians hadnt insisted on being in the same room watching him when he used it one of them had escorted him to the privy and back though hed headed in that direction and the one called garth had immediately dropped whatever it was hed been working on and attached himself to vanyels invisible wake following about a half dozen paces behind that had been so humiliating that he hadnt spoken a single word to the man simply ignored his presence entirely and they hadnt consulted him on dinner either theyd had it brought up on a tray while he was bathing not that hed been particularly hungry he managed the bread and butter and cheese the bread was better than he got at home and a bit of fresh fruit but the rest boiled chicken a thick gravy and dumplings and all of it swiftly cooling into a greasy congealed mess on the plate had stuck in his throat and he gave up trying to eat the tasteless stuff entirely but he really didnt want to sit here staring at it either so he picked up the tray opened his door and took it to the outer room setting it down on a table already cluttered with oddments of traveling gear and the wherewithal to clean it both men looked up at his entrance eyes wide and startled in the candlelight the only sound was the steady flapping of the curtains in the light breeze coming in the window and the buzzing of a fly over one of the candles vanyel straightened licked his lips and looked off at a point on the farther wall between them and above their heads every corridor in this building leads to the common room so i can hardly escape you that way he said in as bored and detached a tone as he could muster and besides theres grooms sleeping in the stables and im certain youve already spoken with them im scarcely going to climb out the window and run off on foot you might as well go enjoy yourselves in the common room you may be my jailors but that doesnt mean you have to endure the jail yourselves with that he turned abruptly and closed the door of his room behind him but he held his breath and waited right beside the door his ear against it the better to overhear what they were saying in the room beyond huh the one called garth said after an interval of startled silence whatcha think of that that he aint half so scatterbrained as mlord thinks the other replied thoughtfully he knows damn well whats goin on not that he aint about as noseinthair as ive ever seen but he aint addlepated not a bit of it never saw mlord set so on his rump before garth agreed speaking slowly aint never seen him taken down like that by a lord much less a grassgreen youngling an never saw that boy do anythin like it before neither boys got sharp asudden give im that too sharp hmmno the other said no i reckon in this case he be right silence for a moment then a laugh yknow i spect his majesty just dont want to have t lissen t us gabbin away at each other mebbe we bore im eh what th hell i could stand a beer you eh if youre buy in erek their voices faded as the door to the hall beyond scraped open then closed again vanyel sighed out the breath hed been holding in and took the two steps he needed to reach the table sagging down into the hard wooden chair beside it tired gods i am so tired this farce is taking more out of me than i thought it would he stared numbly at the candle flame and then transferred his gaze to the bright flickering reflections on the brown earthenware bottle beside it its awful wine but it is wine i suppose i could get good and drunk there certainly isnt anything else to do at least nothing theyll let me do gods they think im some kind of prig his majesty indeed he shook his head whats wrong with me why should it matter what a couple of armsmen think about me why should i even want them on my side who are they anyway what consequence are they they re just a bare step up from dirtgrubbing farmers why should i care what they think besides they cant affect what happens to me he sighed again and tried to summon a bit more of the numbing disinterest hed sustained himself with this whole filthy day it wouldnt come at first there was something in the way nothing matters he told himself sternly least of all what they think about you he closed his eyes again and managed this time to summon a breath of the chill of his dreamsanctuary it helped after a while he shifted making the chair creak and tried to think of something to do maybe to put the thoughts running round his head into a set of lyrics instead he found he could hear muffled and indistinct the distracting sounds of the common room somewhere a floor below and several hundred feet away the laughter in particular came across clearly vanyel bit his lip as he tried to think of the last time hed really laughed and found he couldnt remember it dammit i am better than they are i dont need them i dont need their stupid approval he reached hastily for the bottle poured an earthenware mug full of the thin slightly vinegary stuff and gulped it down he poured a second but left it on the table rising instead and taking his lute from the corner he stripped the padded bag off of it and began retuning it before the wine had a chance to muddle him at least there was music there was always music and the attempt to get what hed lost back again before long the instrument was nicely in tune that was one thing that minstrel what was his name shanse that was it had praised unstintingly vanyel hed said had a natural ear shanse had even put vanyel in charge of tuning his instruments while he stayed at forst reach he took the lute back to the bed and laid it carefully on the spread while he shoved the table up against the bedstead he curled up with his back against the headboard the bottle and mug in easy reach and began practicing those damned finger exercises it might have been the wine but his hand didnt seem to be hurting quite as much this time the bottle was half empty and his head buzzing a bit when there was a soft tap on his door he stopped in midphrase frowning certain hed somehow overheard something from the next room but the tapping came a second time soft but insistent and definitely coming from his door he shook his head a little hoping to clear it and put the lute in the corner of the bed he took a deep breath to steady his thoughts uncurled his legs rose and paced weaving only a little to the door he cracked it open more than half expecting it to be one of his captors come to tell him to shut the hell up so that they could get some sleep oh said the young girl who stood there her eyes huge with surprise one wearing the livery of one of the inns servants he had caught her with her hand raised about to tap on the door a third time beyond her the armsmens room was mostly dark and quite empty yes he said blinking his eyes which were not focusing properly when hed gotten up the wine had gone to his head with a vengeance uh i just the girl was not as young as hed thought but fairly pretty soft brown eyes curly dark hair rather like a shabby copy of melenna just ye wasnt down wi th others mlord an i wunnered if ye needed aught no thank you he replied still trying to fathom why she was out there trying to think through a mist of winefog unless that armsman garth might well have sent her to make certain he was still where he was supposed to be the ties of the soft yellow blouse she was wearing had come loose and it was slipping off one shoulder exposing the round shoulder and a goodly expanse of the mound of one breast she wet her lips and edged closer until she was practically nosetonose with him are ye sure mlord she breathed are ye sure ye caint think of nothin good gods he realized with a start shes trying to seduce me he used the ploy that had been so successful with his mothers ladies he let his expression chill down to where it would leave a skin of ice ob a goblet of water quite certain thank you mistress she was either made of sterner stuff than they had been or else the subtler nuances of expression went right over her head or third possibility she found either vanyel or his presumably fat purse too attractive to let go without a fight i cd turn yer bed down fer ye mlord she persisted snaking an arm around the door to glide her hand along vanyels buttock and leg he was only wearing a shirt and hose and felt the unsubtle caress with a startlement akin to panic no please he yelped in shock the highpitched strangled shout startled her enough so that she pulled back her arm he slammed the door in her face and locked it he waited with his ear pressed up against the crack in the door waited for an explosion of some kind nothing happened he heard her muttering to herself for a moment sounding very puzzled then finally heard her retreating footsteps and the sound of the outer door opening and closing again he staggered back to the bed and sat down on it heavily finally he reached for the lute detuned it and put it back in its traveling case then he reached for the bottle and gulped the wine as fast as he could pour it down his throat oh lord oh gods a fool after everything this morning after i start to feel like im getting a grip on things and i go and act like a fool like a kid like a baby whod never seen a whore before he burned with humiliation as he imagined the girl telling his guards what had just passed between them and drank faster he did remember to unlock his door and blow out the candle before he passed out if sun and shadow out there decided to take it into their heads to check on him he didnt want them breaking the door down that would be even more humiliating than having them follow him to the privy or laughing at him with the girl ive never been this drunk before he thought muzzily as he sank back onto the bed i bet i have a head in the morning he snorted then a sound with no amusement in it at least if im hung over itll make trusty and faithful happy if they cant report to father that i tried to escape at least they can tell him i made a drunken sot of myself at the first opportunity maybe i should have let the girl in after all it wouldnt be the first time ive bedded something i didnt much care for and it would have given them one more story to tell oh gods whats wrong with me mekeal would have had her tumbled before she blinked twice what is wrong with me he rolled over and it felt a lot like his head kept on rolling after hed stopped moving then again i dont think so not even for that the wines bad enough here i hate to think where the girls came from or where they ve been but why cant i react the way everyone else seems to why am i so different his head hurt but not unbearably his stomach was not particularly happy with him but he wasnt ready to retch his guts up in short he was hung over though less than hed expected in an odd sort of way he was feeling even more detached than before perhaps his intoxication had purged something out of him last night some forlorn hope some last grasping at a life no one would ever let him have he pulled on his riding leathers and groomed himself as impeccably as he could manage without a mirror leaving only the tunic off since he intended to soak his aching head in cold water before he mounted star in the horse trough if he had to he walked out into the morning light pouring in through the outer room surveying the pathetic wrecks that had been his alert and vigilant guardians only the night before with what he hoped was cool distant impassiveness and he spared a half a moment to hope that the girl hadnt told them his guards were in far worse case than he was having evidently made a spectacular night of it quite a night judging by their bleary eyes surly yet satiated expressions and the rumpled condition of the bedding and vanyel was not such an innocent as to be unable to recognize certain aromas when he detected them in the air before garth opened the window he was just as pleased to have been so drunk as to be insensible when they had been entertaining their temporary feminine acquaintances could be the chambermaid had found what shed sought in the company of garth and erek after being rebuffed by vanyel they werent giving him the kind of sly looks hed have expected if the girl had revealed his panicked reaction well maybe she was too busy thank you gods he managed to deal with his hangover in a fairly successful fashion willowbark tea came for his asking hot from the kitchen on the way to the privy with the faithful garth in queasy attendance he managed to divert long enough to soak his head under the stable pump until his temples stopped pounding the water was very cold and he saw garth wincing when he first stuck his head beneath it that dealt with the head the stomach was easier he drank nothing but the tea and ate nothing but bread very mild cheese and fruit he was perfectly ready to ride out at that point his guards were not so fortunate or perhaps so wise since their remedies seemed to consist of vile concoctions of raw eggs and the heavy imbibing of the ale that had caused their problem the night before as a result their departure was delayed until midmorning not that this disturbed vanyel a great deal theyd be outside the bounds of the forest before dark at least according to what the innkeeper told garth that was all vanyel cared about garth and erek were still looking a bit greenish as they mounted their cobs and neither seemed much inclined toward talk that suited vanyel quite well it would enable him to concentrate on putting just a bit more distance between himself and the world and it would allow him to do some undisturbed thinking the forest did not seem quite so unfriendly on the eastern side of the inn perhaps because it was hunted more frequently on this side the underbrush certainly wasnt as thick the boughs of the trees overhead werent either and vanyel got a bit of nasty satisfaction at seeing garth and erek wincing out of the way of sunbeams that were much more frequent on this side of the woods but it was hotter than yesterday and vanyel finally stripped off his leather tunic and bundled it behind him seeing no lurking shadows beneath the trees he felt a bit easier about turning his attention inward to think about just what exactly he was heading toward i can guess at what fathers told the old bat thats easy enough the question is what shes likely to do about it he tried to dig everything he could remember out of the dim recesses of memory not just about his aunt in particular but about heralds in general heii tell her i m to be weaponsschooled thats for certain but how thats up to her and now that i think of it damn if it wasnt a herald that wrote that book that got me in such trouble i may i just might actually be better off in that area huh now that i think about it i cant see any way id be worse off a bird called overhead and vanyel almost felt a bit hopeful no matter who i get schooled under he cant possibly be worse than jervis because whoever he is he wont have a grudge against me the absolute worst i can get is a jervistype without a grudge that might just be survivable if i keep myself in the background if i manage to convince him that im deadly stupid and clumsy stupid and clumsy are not possible to train away and even jervis knew that another bird answered reminding him that there was however the matter of music hes bound to have issued orders that im not to be allowed anywhere near the bards except right under savil s eye and if shes like father she has no ear at all which means sheli never go to entertainments unless she has no choice he sighed oh well theres worsei wont be any worse off than i was at home where i saw a real trained bard once in my entire lifetime at least theyll be around maybe if i can get my fingering back and play where one is likely to overhear me he sternly squelched that last best not think about it i cant afford hope anymore star fidgeted she wanted her usual earlymorning run he reined her in calmed her down and went back to his own thoughts one thing for sure father is likely to have told savil all kinds of things about how rotten i am so shell be likely looking for wrong moves on my part and ill bet she ii have her proteges and friends watching me too its going to be hell hell with no sanctuary and no liss he studied stars ears as he thought watching her flick them back with alert interest when she heard him sigh well everyone else is going to hate me but you still love me he patted stars neck and she pranced a little to the lowest hells with all of them i do not need them i dont need anybody not even liss ill do all right on my own but there was one puzzle one he was reminded of later when they passed one of the remote farms and vanyel saw the farmer out in the field talking with someone on horseback who was likely his overlord huh he thought i cant figure how in havens father expects savil to train me in governance then he felt a cold chill unless he doesnt really expect me to ever come home again gods he could try to work something out in the way of sending me off to a temple he could do that and it bloody wouldnt matter if father leren could find him a priest he could bribe into accepting an unwilling acolyte it would work it would work especially if it was a cloistered order and with me out of the way in savils hands he has all the time he needs to find a compliant priest he doesnt even have to tell savil just issue the order to send me back home again when its all arranged then spirit me off and announce to anyone who asks that i discovered i had a vocation and i would spend the rest of my life in a little stone cave somewhere he swallowed hard and tried to find reasons to dismiss the notion as a paranoid fantasy but all he could discover were more reasons why it was a logical move on lord withens part he tried to banish the fear telling himself that it was no good worrying about what might only be a fantasy until it actually happened but the thought wouldnt go away it kept coming back not only that day but every day thereafter it wasnt quite an obsession but it wasnt far off it was quite enough to keep him wrapped in silent apprehensive thought for every day of the remainder of the journey and to keep him sleepless for long hours every night and not even dreams of his isolate snowplain helped to keep it from his thoughts four all right tylendel that was passable but it wasnt imparticularly smooth heraldmage savil admonished her protege tucking her feet under the bottom rung of her wooden stool and absently smoothing down the front of her white tunic remember the power is supposed to flow from you to the shield and back again smoothly not in spurts you tell me why tylendel a tall strikingly attractive dark blond heraldtrainee of about sixteen frowned with concentration as he considered savils question she watched the powerbarrier he had built about himself with her magesight and saw the pale violet halfdome waver as he turned his attention to her question and lost a bit of control over the shield she could feel the room pulsing as he allowed the shield to pulse in time with his heartbeat if he let this go on it would collapse tylendel youre losing it she warned he nodded looked up and grimaced but did not reply his actions were reply enough the energy comprising the halfdome covering him stopped rippling firmed and the color deepened have you an answer to my question yet i think so he answered if it doesnt flow smoothly ill have times when its weak and whatever im doing with it will be open to interruption when it weakens right savil replied with a brisk nod only dont think in terms of interruption lad think in terms of attack like now she flung a levinbolt at his barrier without giving him any more warning than that and had the satisfaction not only of seeing it deflected harmlessly upward to be absorbed by the work room shields but seeing that he shifted his defenses to meet it with no chance to prepare at all now that was good my lad she approved and tylendels brown eyes warmed in response to the compliment so someone knocked on the door of the work room and savil bit off what she was going to tell him with a muffled curse of annoyance now what she muttered shoving back her tall stool and edging around tylendeis magebarrier to answer the door the work room was a permanently shielded circular chamber within the palace complex that the heraldmages used when training their proteges in the mageaspects of their gifts the shielding on this room was incredibly ancient and powerful it was so powerful that the shielding actually muffled physical sound you couldnt even hear the death bell toll inside this room one of the duties of every heraldmage in the circle was to augment the protections here whenever they had the time and energy to spare this shielding had to be strong strong enough to contain magical accidents that would reduce the sparse furniture within the room to splinters those accidents were the reason why the walls were stone the furniture limited to a couple of cheap stools and an equally cheap table and why every heraldmage put full personal shields on himself and his pupil immediately on entering the door of this room those accidents were also the reason why anyone who disturbed the practice sessions going on in the work room had better have a damned good reason for doing so savil yanked the door open and glared at the fairhaired blueuniformed palace guard who stood there at rigid and proper attention well she said letting a bit of ice creep into her voice your pardon heraldmage he replied his expression as stiff as his spine but you left orders to be notified as soon as your nephew arrived he handed her a folded and sealed letter his escort wished you to have this she took it and stuffed it in a pocket of her breeches without looking at it oh bloody hell she muttered so i did she sighed and became a bit more civil thank you guard send him and whatever damned escort he brought with him to my quarters ill get with them as soon as i can the guard saluted and turned sharply on his heel savil shut the door before he finished his pivot and turned back to her pupil all right lad how long have we been at this tylendel draped an arm over his curly head and grinned long enough for my stomach to start growling im sorry savil but im hungry thats probably why my concentrations going she shook her finger at him tchah younglings and their stomachs and just what do you plan to do if you get hungry in the middle of an arcane duel hmm eat he replied impishly she threw up her hands in mock despair all right off with you ah ah she warmed wagging her finger at him as he made ready to dispel the barrier the quick and dirty way by pulling the energies into the ground properly my lad he bowed to her in the finest courtly manner she snorted get on with it lad if youre in such a hurry to stuff your face she watched him carefully as he took down the barrier properly did so with quite a meticulous attention to little details like releasing the barrierenergy back into the same flow hed taken it from she nodded approvingly when he stepped across the place where the border had been and presented himself to have the shields shed put on him taken off youre getting better tylendel she said touching the middle of his forehead with her index finger and absorbing the shield back into herself her skin tingled for a moment as she neutralized the overflow youre coming along much faster than i guessed you would another year no less i think and youll be ready to try your hand at a border stint with me and not much longer than that and ill shove you into whites its my teacher he replied impishly seizing her hand and kissing it his long hair falling over her wrist and tickling it how can i help but succeed in such attractive surroundings she snatched her hand back and cuffed his ear lightly get on with you even if i wasnt old enough to be your grandmother we both know im the wrong sex for you to find me attractive he ducked the blow grinning and pulled the door open for her oh savil dont you know that the real truth is that id lost my heart to my teacher knew i had no hope and couldnt accept a lesser woman than out she sputtered laughing so hard she nearly choked liar before i do you damage he ran off down the woodpaneled hallway his own laughter echoing behind him she closed the work room door behind her and leaned against the wall still laughing holding her aching side the imp more charm than any five younglings and all the mischief of a young cat i havent laughed like this in years not the way i have since i acquired tylendel as a protege that boy is such a treasure if i can just wean him out of that stupid feud his family is involved in hell make a fine heraldmage if i dont kill him first she gulped down several long breaths of air and composed herself im going to have to deal with that spoiled brat of a nephew in a few minutes she told herself sternly using the thought to sober herself and i havent the foggiest notion of what to do with him other than have him strangled no thats not such a good notion it would please withen too much great good gods the man has turned into such a pompous ass in the last few years i hardly recognized him that ridiculous letter a week ago could have come from our father she smoothed her hair with her hands checking to see that the knot of it at the base of her neck had not come undone tugged on the hem of her tunic and made sure that the door of the work room was closed and magelocked before heading up the hall toward her personal quarters the heels of her boots clicked briskly against the stone of the hallway and she nodded at courtiers and other heralds as they passed her if only treesa hadnt spoiled the lad so outrageously there might be something there worth salvaging now i dont know i certainly dont have the time to find out for myself huh i wonder if i put the buy into lessons with the other heraldtrainees then leave him to his own devices the rest of the time that just might tell me something if he doesnt turn to gambling and hunting and wild parties i he becomes bored with the flitterheads in the court she pushed open one half of the double doors to the new heralds quarters and strode through her own suite was just at the far end and on the left side of the hall changes changes five years ago we were crammed in four to a room and not enough space to throw a tantrum in now we rattle around in this shinynew barracks like a handful of peas in a bucket and me with a suite and not getting forlorn looks from jays or tantras because one of the rooms is vacant i cant see how well ever get enough bodies to fill this place the door stood slightly ajar she shoved it out of the way and paused a few steps into her outer room crossing her arms and surveying the trio on the couch beneath her collection of hawkbrother featherwork masks at the end of the room only one of them was actually on the couch vanyel beside him only too obviously playing his jailers stood a pair of withens armsmen on vanyels right a short stocky man axeman if savil was any judge on his left one about a head taller and very swarthy a common swordsman and vanyel sitting very stiffly on the edge of the couch savil heaved a strictly internal sigh lad a year obviously hadnt improved you except in looks and thats no advantage youre too damned handsome and you know it since shed last seen him vanyels face and body had refined it was a face that could and probably did break hearts broad brow high cheekbones pointed chin sensuous lips finearched black brows and incredible silver eyes all of it crowned with thick straight blueblack hair most women would kill to possess the body of an acrobat nicely muscled if not overtall and the posture was arrogant the mouth set in sullen silence the eyes sulky and at the same time challenging her lord and lady do i believe my fool brother or do i take the chance that a good portion of whats wrong with the boy is due to withen trying to mold him into his own image while she tried to make up her mind she nodded at the two armsmen thank you good sirs she said crisply you have performed your duty admirably you may go the taller one coughed uneasily and gave her an uncomfortable look well she asked sensing something comingsomething she wasnt going to like something petty and smallminded the boys horse stays of course she interrupted seeing the flash of hurt in vanyels eyes before he masked it and reacting to it without needing to think about which way she was going to jump but herald its a valuable animal the armsman protested his mouth thinning unhappily lord withen my lord surely youve beasts enough here what do you think this is she snapped turning on him with unconcealed anger gods if this was symptomatic of the boys trip here no wonder he was sullen take the boys horse will you you bloody little she took control of herself and gave them irrefutable reasons to take back to their master they were after all only following orders you think we run a damned breeding farm here we havent horses to spare the boy will be taking equitation lessons of course and hes hardly going to be able to go over the jumping course on foot but the armsman sputtered not prepared to give up surely the companions bear their chosen and no other she took a deep breath and forced her temper to cool the man was making her more than annoyed with his obstinacy he was making her quite thoroughly enraged and if this was a measure of what vanyel had been subjected to over the past few years well perhaps the boy wasnt entirely to blame for his current behavior i said she told the men glaring you may go but i have certain orders certain things i am to tell you i am countermanding those orders she answered swiftly invoking all of her authority not just as a herald but as one of the most powerful heraldmages in the heraldic circle second only to queens own seneschals and lordmarshals herald this is my place and my jurisdiction and you may tell my brother withen that i will make up my own mind what is to be done with the boy if he wants to deposit young vanyel in my care then hell have to put up with my judgments and you can tell him i said so good day gentlemen she smiled with honeyed venom or need i call a guard to escort you they had no choice but to take themselves off though they did so with extreme reluctance savjl waited until they had gone and were presumably out of hearing range before taking the letter shed been given out of her pocket she held it up so that vanyel could see that it had not been opened then slowly deliberately tore it in four pieces and dropped the pieces on the floor margret is going to have my hide she thought wryly ii shes told me once not to throw things on the floor shes told me a hundred times i dont know what withen had to say in that letter she told the strange and silent boy was that sullenness in the set of his mouth or fear was that suspicion in the back of his eyes or arrogance frankly i dont care this much i can tell you young man you are going to stand or fall with me by your own actions i tell you now that i very much resent what withen has done i have three proteges to train and no time to waste on cosseting a daydreamer might as well let him know the truth about how i feel right out and right now he ii find out from the gossip sooner or later i cant afford to have him pulling something stupid in the hopes i ii pull him out of it and give him some attention i have no intention of trying to make you into something you arent but i also have no intention of allowing you to make a fool out of me or inconvenience me there was a whisper of sound at the door without turning around savil knew from the brush of embarrassed mindspeech behind her that tylendel and her other two proteges mardic and donni had come in behind her not expecting to find anyone except savil here they had stopped in the doorway startled at finding their mentor dressing down a strange boy and more than a bit embarrassed to have walked in at such a touchy moment and of course now it would be even more embarrassing for them to walk back out and try to pretend it hadnt happened youll be taking lessons with some of the heraldtrainees and with some of the young courtiers as soon as i get a chance to make the arrangements savil continued serenely gesturing slightly with her right hand for her three children to come up beside her now vanyel this is donni this mardic and this tylendel as heraldtrainees they outrank you lets get that straight right now yes aunt vanyel said without changing his expression a hair now what that actually means is not one damned thing except i expect you to be polite yes aunt my servant margret tends to us breakfast and lunch are cold and left over on that table over there supper will be with the court for you once i get you introduced if you miss it you can take your chances with us lessons hmm for now oh donni i want you to take him with you in the morning and turn him over to kayla withen was rather insistent on his getting weapons work and for once i agree with him yes savil the short touslehaired trainee said calmly savil blessed the girls soothing presence and also blessed the fact that she was lifebound to mardic nothing shook a lifebond except the death of one of the pair vanyels handsome face wasnt going to turn her head she rather dreaded the effect of that face on the rest of the younglings at the court though mardic the imperturbable farmers son nodded his round head without speaking take him to bardic collegium in the afternoon for me and get them to put him into history literature and she wrinkled her brow in thought as her three proteges arranged themselves around her how about religions tylendel suggested he raised one darkgold eyebrow and mindspoke his teacher in privatemode his lips thinning a little hes lovely savil and he feels like hes either an arrogant little bastard or somebodys been hurting him inside for an awfully long time frankly i couldnt tell you which is he going to be as much trouble as i think dont know lad savil mindspoke soberly but dont get wrapped up with him not until we know and dont fall in love with him i have no idea where his preferences lie but even withen didnt hint he was shayachern i dont want to have to patch your broken heart up again not a chance teacher tylendel mindgrinned ive learned better huh i should hope oh lord of light i did give all of you grabs at dominicks old room didnt i i dont want to start this off with hurt feelings yes you did and none of us wanted to move tylendel mindchuckled the garden door may be nice but its drafty as the cave of the winds if i had someone to keep me warm i could get you a dog she suggested and watched his lips twitch as he tried not to smile well thats one worry out of the way then said aloud all right vanyel history literature and religions it is and weapons work with kayla in the morning she teaches the young highborns and shes very good and if i find out youve been avoiding her lessons ill take a strap to you vanyel flushed at that but said nothing donni mardic tylendel give vanyel a hand with his things well put him in the garden chamber i had margret get it ready for him this morning as the three trainees scooped up a pack apiece and vanyel bent slowly to take the fourth savil added a last admonition vanyel what you do with your free time is your own business she said perhaps a bit more harshly than she intended but if you get yourself into trouble and theres plenty of it to get into around here dont expect me to pull you out i cant and i wont youre an imposition its your job to see that you become less of one vanyel thanked the trainees for their help as they dropped his packs to one side of the door speaking in a voice that sounded dull and exhausted even in his own ears the blond one hesitated for a moment just long enough to give him what looked like a genuine smile before slipping out the door but despite that smile vanyel was mortally glad when they didnt linger he closed the door behind them then leaned up against it with his eyes shut the entire day had been confusing and wearying an emotional obstacle course that he was just happy to have survived the worst of it had been the past couple of hours first being shuttled off to savils quarters with erek and garth suddenly deciding to act like the jailers that they were then the interminable wait then the interview her words had hurt he willed them not to he willed himself not to care then he moved to the middle of his new room and looked around himself and blinked in surprise it was amazing warm and welcoming paneled and furnished in goldenoak and as wellappointed as his mothers private chamber certainly nothing like his room back at forst reach a huge bed stood against one wall a bed almost wide enough for three and covered with a thick soft red comforter in the corner a wardrobe not a simple chest to hold his clothing beside it a desk and padded chair havens an instrument rack on the wall next to the weaponsrack next to the window a second more heavily padded chair both chairs upholstered in red that matched the comforter his own fireplace a small table next to the bed and a bookcase but that wasnt the most amazing thing his room had its own private entrance something that was either a small glazed door or an enormous window that opened up on a garden i dont believe this he thought staring stupidly through the glass at the sculptured bushes and the glint of setting sun on the river beyond i just do not believe this i expected to be in another prison instead he tried the dooriwindow it was unlocked and swung open at a touch instead im given total freedom i do not believe this his knees went weak and he had to sit down on the edge of the bed before he collapsed the breeze that had been allowed to enter when he opened the window made the light material used as curtains flap lazily gods he thought dazedly i dont know what to think she saves star then she humiliates me in front of the trainees she gives me this room then she tells me im the next thing to worthless and she threatens to beat me herself what am i supposed to believe he could hear the murmuring of voices beyond the other door the one the tall blond had closed after himself they sound so comfortable out there so easy with each other he thought wistfully they were terribly unalike the three of them the one called donni could have been ereks twin sister they looked to have been cast from the same mold dark curlyhaired phlegmatic the shorter boy mardic had the look of one of withens smallholders earthy square and brown but the third vanyel was experiencing a strange unsteady feeling when he thought about the tall graceful blond called tylendel he didnt know why not even the minstrel shanse had evoked this depth of disturbance in him there was a burst of laughter beyond the door they sound so happy he thought a bit sadly before his thoughts darkened theyre probably laughing at me he clenched his teeth damn it i dont care i wont care i dont need their approval he closed his walls a little tighter about himself and began the mundane task of settling himself into his new home and tried not to feel himself left on the outside telling himself over and over again that nothing mattered the slender girl vanyels aunt had called donni looked askance at all the padding and armor vanyel picked off his armorstand and weaponsrack are you really taking all that she asked hazel eyes rather wide with surprise he nodded shortly she shook her head in disbelief her tight sable curls scarcely moving i cant see why you want all that stuff but i guess its your back come on thered been no one in the suite when vanyel woke but there had been cider bread and butter cheese and fruit waiting on a sideboard in the central room he had figured that was supposed to be breakfast seeing that someone or several someones more like had already made hearty inroads on the food he had helped himself then found a servant to show him the way to the bathingroom and the privies and cleaned himself up hed pulled on some of his oldest and shabbiest clothing in anticipation of getting them wellgrimed at the coming weaponrylesson he was back in his own room and in a very somber mood sitting on the floor while putting some new leather lacings on his practice armor when donni came hunting him he gathered up his things and followed one step behind her out through his garden door and into the sunlit fragrant garden trying not to let any apprehension seep into his cool shell she took him on a circuitous path that led from his own garden door past several ornamental grottoes and fish ponds down to a graveled pathway that followed the course of the river they trudged past what looked like a stable except that the stalls had no doors on them and past a smaller building beside it then the path took an abrupt turn to the right ending at a gate in a high wooden fence by now vanyels arms were getting more than a little tired he was hot and sweating and he hoped that this was at least close to their goal but no the seemingly placid trainee flashed him what might have been a sympathetic grin and opened the gate motioning for vanyel to go through there she said pointing across what seemed to be an expanse of carefully manicured lawn as wide as the legended dhorisha plains at the other end of the lawn was a plain rawly new wooden building with high clerestory windows thats the salle she told him thats where were going they just built it last year so that we could practice year round she giggled i think they got tired of the trainees having bouts in the hallways when it rained or snowed vanyel just nodded determined to show no symptoms of his weariness she set off across the grass with a stride so brisk he had to really push himself to keep up with her it was all he could do to keep from panting with effort by the time they actually reached the building and his side was in agony when she slowed down enough to open the door for him once inside he could see that the structure was one single large room with a mirrored wall and a carefully sanded wooden floor there were several young people out on the floor already ranging in apparent age from as young as eleven or twelve to as old as their early twenties most of them were sparring vanyel was too exhausted to take much notice of what they were up to although the pair nearest him he saw with a sinking heart were working out in almost exactly the weapons style jervis used this him a woman with a soft musical contralto spoke from behind them and vanyel turned abruptly dropping a vambrace yes maam donni said picking the bracer up before vanyel had a chance even to flush vanyel this is weaponsmaster kayla kayla this stuff is all his i guess he brought it from home ive got to get going or ill miss my session in the work room havens forfend kayla said dryly savil would eat me for lunch if you were late dont forget you have dagger this afternoon girl donni nodded and slipped out the door leaving vanyel alone with the redoubtable weaponsmaster for redoubtable she was from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet she was nothing but sinew and muscle her black hair tightly braided to her head showed not a strand of gray despite the age revealed by the fine net of wrinkles around her eyes and mouth those graygreen eyes didnt look as if they missed much for the rest kaylas shoulders were nearly a handspan wider than his and her wrists as thick as his ankles vanyel had no doubt that she could readily wield any of the blades in the racks along the wall even the ones as tall or taller than she he did not particularly want to face this woman in any sort of combat situation she looked like she could quite handily take on jervis and mop the floor with his ugly face vanyel remained outwardly impassive but was inwardly quaking as she in turn studied him well young man she said quietly after a moment that was far too long for his liking you might as well throw that stuff over in the corner over there she nodded toward the far end of the salle and a pile of discarded equipment well see what we can salvage of it you certainly wont be needing it vanyel blinked at her wondering if hed missed something why not he asked just as quietly good gods lad that stuffs about as suited to you as boots on a cat she replied with a certain amusement whoever your last master was he was a fool to put you in that gear no young man you see redel and oden over there she pointed with her chin at a pair of slender androgynous figures involved in an intricate and possibly deadly dance with very light slender swords ill make duke oden your instructor hell be pleased to have a pupil besides young lord redel thats the kind of style suited to you so thats what youll be doing young vanyel she told him his heart rose to its proper place from its former position somewhere in the vicinity of his boots kayla graced him with a momentary smile mind you lad odens no light taskmaster youll find you work up as healthy a sweat and collect just as many bruises as any of the hackandbashers so lets get you suited for it eh if the morning was an unexpected pleasure and it was for the first time in his life he received praise for weapons work and preened under it the afternoon was an unalloyed disaster it started when he returned with equipment that weighed a third of what hed carried over he racked it with care he usually didnt grant to weaponry and sought the central room of the suite someone probably the hitherto invisible margret had taken away the food left on the sideboard this morning and replaced it with meat rolls more fruit and cheese and a bottle of light wine tylendel was sprawled on the couch a meat roll in one hand a book in the other a crease of concentration between his brows he didnt even look up as vanyel moved hesitantly just into the common room itself once again he got that strange halffearful fluttery feeling in the pit of his stomach he cleared his throat and tylendel jumped dropping his book and looking up with his eyes widened and his hair over one eye good gods vanyel make some noise next time he said bending to retrieve his book from the floor i didnt know there was anyone here but me thats lunch over there he pointed with the halfeaten roll savil says to eat and get yourself cleaned up shes going to present you to the queen before the noon recess then youll be able to have dinner with the court the rest of us get it on the fly as our schedules permit savil will be back in a few minutes so youd better move he tilted his head to one side just a little and offered if you need any help vanyel stiffened the offer hadnt sounded at all unfriendly but it could be tylendel was looking for a way to spy on him savil hadnt necessarily told the truth if only no he replied curtly i dont need any help he paused then added for politeness sake thank you tylendel gave him a dubious look then shrugged and dove back into his book savil was back in moments vanyel had barely time to make himself presentable before she scooped him up and herded him off to the throne room the throne room was a great deal smaller than he had pictured long and narrow and rather dark and stuffy there were more people crammed into this room than it had ever been intended to hold somewhere down at the farther end of it was the throne itself beneath a huge blue and silver tapestry of a rampant winged horse with broken chains on its throat and legs that took up the entire wall over the throne vanyel could see the tapestry but nothing else everyone else in the room seemed to be at least a hand taller than he was and all he could see were heads the presentation itself was a severe disappointment vanyel waited with savil at his side for nearly an hour while some wrangle or other involving a pair of courtiers was ironed out then savils name was called the two of them vanyel trailing in savils formidable wake were announced by a middleaged herald in full court whites vanyel was escorted to the foot of the throne by that same herald where queen elspeth a thin darkhaired woman who was looking very tired and somewhat preoccupied nodded to him in a friendly manner and said about five words in greeting he bowed and was escorted back to savils side and that was all there was to it then savil hustled him back to change out of court garb and into ordinary daygarb for his afternoon classes mardic practically flew in the door from the hallway and took him in tow they traversed a long dark corridor leading from savils quarters out through a double door to a much older section of the palace from there they exited a side door and out into more gardens herb gardens this time and kitchen gardens mardic didnt seem to be the talkative type but he could certainly move his fast walk took them past an lshaped granite building before vanyel had a chance to ask what it was and up to a square fieldstone structure bardic collegium mardic said shortly pausing just long enough for a couple of youngsters who were running to get past him then opening the black wooden door for him he didnt say another word just left him at the door of his first class before vanishing elsewhere into the building he was finding it hard to believe that savil was going so far in ignoring his fathers orders as to put him in lessoning with the bardic students nevertheless here he was inside bardic collegium actually inside the building seated in a row of chairs with three other youngsters in a small sunny room on the first floor more than that pacing back and forth as he lectured or questioned them was a real live bard in full scarlets a tall powerful man who was probably as much at home wielding a broadsword as a lute at home vanyel had always been a full step ahead of his brothers and cousins when it came to scholastics so he began the hour with a feeling of boredom history was the proverbial open book to him or so he had always thought he began the session with the rather smug feeling that he was going to dazzle his new classmates the other three boys looked at him curiously when he came in and sat down with them but they didnt say anything one was mouseblond one chestnut and one dark all three were dressed nearly the same as vanyel in ordinary dayclothing of white raime shirt and tunic and breeches of soft brown or gray fabric he couldnt tell if they were heraldic trainees or bardic they wore no uniforms the way their elders did not that it mattered really except that he would have liked to impress them with his scholarship if they were bardic students the room was hardly bigger than his bedroom in savils suite but unlike the heralds quarters this building was old worn and a bit shabby vanyel had a moment to register disappointment at the scuffed floor dusty furnishings and fuded paint before the leonine bard at the windowend of the room began the class after that all he had a chance to feel was shock yesterday we discussed the arvale annexation today were going to cover the negotiations with rethwellan that followed the annexation with those words bard chadran launched into his lecture a dissertation on the important arvalezalmon negotiations in the time of king tavist it was fascinating there was only one problem vanyel had never even heard of the arvalezalmon negotiations and all he knew of king tavist was that he was the son of queen terilee and the father of queen leshia tavists reign had been a quiet one a reign devoted more to studied diplomacy than the kind of deeds that made for ballads so when the bard opened the floor to discussion vanyel had to sit there and try to look as if he understood it all without having the faintest idea of what was going on he took reams of notes of course but without knowing why the negotiations had been so important much less what they were about they didnt make a great deal of sense he escaped that class with the feeling that hed only just escaped being skinned and eaten alive religions was a bit better though not much hed thought it was religion singular he found out how wrong he was again it was indeed religions in the plural sense since the population of valdemar was a patchwork quilt of a dozen different peoples escaping from various unbearable situations it was hardly surprising that each one of those peoples had their own religion as vanyel heard over and over again that hour the law of valdemar on the subject of worship was there is no one true way but with a dozen or more ways in practice it would have been terribly easy for a bard or herald to misstep among people strange to him hence this class which was currently covering the people of the one who had settled about crescent lake it was something of a shock hearing that what his priest would have called rankest heresy was presented as just another aspect of the truth vanyel spent half his time feeling utterly foolish and the other half trying to hide his reactions of surprise and disquiet but it was literature or rather an event just before the literature class which truly deflated and defeated him he had been toying with the idea of petitioning one of the bards to enroll him in their collegium before he began the afternoons classes but now he was doubtful of being able to survive the lessons gods i im as pigignorant compared to these trainees as my cousins are compared to me he thought glumly slumping in the chair nearest the door as he and the other two with him waited for the teacher of literature to put in her appearance but maybe this time lord of light knows ive memorized every ballad i could ever get my hands on then he overheard bard chadran talking out in the hallway with another bard presumably the teacher of this class but when he heard his own name and realized that they were talking about him he stretched his ears without shame or hesitation to catch all that he could so savil wants us to take him if hes got the makings chadran was saying well has he asked the second a dark sensuously female voice shanses heard him sing says hes got the voice and the hands for it and i trust him on that said chadran hesitantly but not the gift the second persisted chadran coughed i didnt hear any sign of it in class and its pretty obvious he doesnt compose or wed have heard about it shanse would have said something or put it in his report and he didnt he has to have two out of three gift talent and creativity you know that chadran said the woman shanse didnt see any signs of gift either did he chadran sighed no breda when savil asked me about this boy i looked up shanses report on the area he did mention the boy and he was flattering enough about the boys musicality that we could get him training as a minstrel if if if he werent his fathers heir but the truth is he said the boy has a magnificent ear and aptitude for mimicry and the talent but no creativity and no gift and thats not enough to enroll someones heir as a mere minstrel still breda love you look for gift youre better at seeing it than any of us id really like to do savil a favor on this one she says the boy is set enough on music to defy a fairly formidable father and we owe her a few ill try him said the woman but dont get your hopes up shanse may not have the gift himself but he knows it when he hears it vanyel had something less than an instant to wonder what they meant by gift before the woman hed overheard entered the room as tall as a man thin plainshe still had a presence that forced vanyel to pay utmost attention to every word she spoke every gesture she made today were going to begin the windrider cycle she said pulling a gittern around from where it hung across her back im going to begin with the very first windrider ballad known and im going to present it the way it should be dealt with heard not read this ballad was never designed to be read and ill tell you the truth the flaws present in it mostly vanish when its sung she strummed a few chords then launched into the opening to the windrider unchained and he no longer wondered what the gift could be because she didnt just sing not like vanyel would have sung or even the minstrel or as he realized now the bard shanse would have no she made her listeners experience every word of the passage to feel every emotion to see the scene to live the event as the originals must have lived it when she finished vanyel knew he would never forget those words again and he knew to the depths of his soul that he would never be able to do what she had just done oh he tried when she prompted him to sing the next windrider ballad while she played he gave it his best but he could tell from the look in his fellow classmates eyes interest but not rapt fascination that he hadnt even managed a pale imitation as he sat down and she gestured to the next to take a ballad he saw the pity in her eyes and the slight shake of her head and knew then that she knew hed overheard the conversation in the hallway that this was her way of telling him gently and indirectly that his dream could not be realized it was the pity that hurt the most after the realization that he did not have the proper material to be a bard it cut as cruelly as any blade all that work all that fighting to get his hand back the way it had been and all for nothing hed never even had a hope vanyel threw himself onto his bed his chest aching his head throbbing i thought nothing would ever be worse than home but at least i still had dreams now i dont even have that the capper on the miserable day was his aunt his competent clever selfless damnhertoninehells aunt he flopped over onto his stomach and fought back the sting in his eyes shed pulled him aside right after dinner i asked the bards to see if they could take you shed said im sorry vanyel but they told me youre a very talented musician but thats all youll ever be thats not enough to get you into bardic when youre the heir to a holding but hed started to say then clamped his mouth shut she gave him a sharp look i know how you probably feel vanyel but your duty as withens heir is going to have to come first so youd better resign yourself to the situation instead of fighting it she watched him broodingly as he struggled to maintain his veneer of calm the gods know she said finally i stood in your shoes once i wanted the holding but i wasnt firstborn son and as things turned out im glad i didnt get the holding if you make the best of your situation you may find one day that you wouldnt have had a better life if youd chosen it yourself how could she know he fumed i hate her so help me i hate her everything she does is so damned perfect she never says anything but she doesnt have to all she has to do is give me that look if i hear one more word about how i m supposed to like this trap thats closed on me i may go mad he turned over on his back and brooded it wasnt even sunset and he was stuck here with his lute staring down at him from the wall with all the broken dreams it implied and nothing to distract him or was there dinner was over but there were going to be people gathered in the great hall all night and there were plenty of people his age there young people who werent bard trainees nor herald proteges ordinary young people more like normal human beings he forgot all his apprehensions about being thought a country bumpkin all he could think of now was the admiration his wit and looks used to draw at the infrequent celebrations that brought the offspring of several keeps and holdings together he needed a dose of that admiration and needed its sweetness as an antidote to the bitterness of failure he flung himself off the bed and rummaged in his wardrobe for an appropriately impressive outfit he settled on a smoky gray velvet as suiting his mood and his flair for the dramatic he planned his entrance to the great hall with care waiting until one of those moments that occur at any gathering of people where everyone seems to choose the same moment to stop talking when that moment came he seized it pacing gracefully into the silence as if it had been created expressly to display him it worked to perfection within moments he had a little circle of courtiers of his own flocking about him eager to impress the newcomer with their friendliness he basked in their attentions for nearly an hour before it began to pall a lanky youngster named liers was waxing eloquent on the subject of his elder brother dealing with a set of brigands vanyel stifled a yawn this was sounding exactly like similar evenings at forst reach so he charged straight at them which was a damn fool thing to do if you ask me vanyel said his brows creasing but it takes a brave man the young man protested weakly i repeat it was a damn fool thing to do vanyel persisted totally outnumbered no notion if the party behind him was coming in time great good gods the right thing to do would have been to turn tail and run if hed done it convincingly he could have led them straight into the arms of his own troops charging off like that could have gotten him killed it worked liers sulked oh it worked all right because nobody in his right mind would have done what he did it was the valiant thing to have done liers replied lifting his chin vanyel gave up he didnt dare alienate these younglings they were all he had youre right liers he said hating the lie it was a valiant thing to have done liers smiled in foolish satisfaction as vanyel made more stupid remarks eventually vanyel extricated himself from that little knot of idlers and went looking for something more interesting the fools were as bad as his brother he could not would never get it through their heads that there was nothing romantic about getting themselves hacked to bits in the name of valdemar or a lady that there was nothing uplifting about losing an arm or a leg or an eye that there was nothing nothing glorious about warfare as soon as he turned away from the male contingent the female descended upon him in a chattering flock flirting coquetting each doing her best to get variyels attention settled on her it was exactly the same playette that had been enacted over and over in his mothers bower there were more players and the faces were both different and often prettier but it was the identical seript vanyel was bored but it was marginally better than being lectured by savil or longing after the bards and the gift he never would have tylendel said the pert little brunette at his elbow with a sigh of disappointment what about tylendel vanyel asked his interest for once caught oh tashi is in love with tylendels big brown eyes laughed another girl a tall palecomplected redhead not a chance tashi said reva who was flushed from a little too much wine she giggled you havent a chance hes whats that word savil uses shayachern supplied cress its some outland tongue whats it mean vanyel asked reva giggled and whispered that he doesnt like girls he likes boys lucky boys for tylendel id turn into a boy tashi sighed then giggled back at her friend oh what a waste are you sure sure as stars reva assured her only just last year he broke his heart over that bastard nevis vanyel suppressed his natural reaction of astonishment didnt like girls he knew at least that the youngling courtiers used like synonymously with bedding but didnt like girls liked boys hed known hed been sheltered from some things but hed never even guessed about this one was this why withen nevis wasnt he the one who couldnt make up his mind which he liked and claimed hed been seduced every time he crawled into somebodys bed tashi asked in rapt fascination the very same reva told her i am so glad his parents called him home they were off into a dissection of the perfidious nevis then and vanyel lost interest he drifted around the great hall but was unable to find anything or anyone he cared to spend any time with he drank a little more wine than he intended but it didnt help make the evening any livelier and at length he gave up and went to bed he lay awake for a long time skirting the edges of the thoughts hed had earlier from the way the girls had giggled about it it was pretty obvious that tylendels preferences were something short of respectable and withen oh he knew now what withen would have to say about it if he knew that his son was even sharing the same quarters as tylendel all those times he went after me when i was tiny for hugging and kissing meke that business with father leren and the lecture on proper masculine behavior the fit he had when liss dressed me up in her old dresses like an overgrown doll oh gods suddenly the reasons behind a great many otherwise inexplicable actions on withens part were coming clear why he kept shoving girls at me why he bought me that professional why he kept arranging for friends of mothers with compliant daughters to visit why he hated seeing me in fancy clothing why some of the armsmen would go quiet when i came by why some of the jokes would just stop father didnt even want a hint of this to get to me he ached inside just ached ive lost music no even if tylendel is to be trusted i cant take the chance not even on being his friend if he didnt turn on me which he probably would all that was left was the other dream the icedream the only dream that couldnt hurt him the chasm wasnt too wide to jump but it was deep and there was something terrible at the bottom of it he didnt know how he knew that but he knew it was true behind him was nothing but the empty wintry iceplain on the other side of the chasm it was springtime he wanted to cross over to the warmth to listen to birdsong beneath the trees but he was afraid to jump it seemed to widen even as he looked at it vanyel he looked up startled tylendel stood on the other side wind ruffling his hair his smile wide and as warm and open as spring sunshine do you want to come over the trainee asked softly he held out one hand ill help you if you like vanyel backed up a step clasping his arms tightly to his chest to keep from inadvertently answering that extended hand vanyel the older boys eyes were gentle coaxing vanyel id like to be your friend he lowered his voice still more until it was little more than a whisper and gestured invitingly id like he continued to be more than your friend no vanyel cried turning away violently and running as fast as he could into the empty whiteness when he finally stopped he was alone on the empty plain alone and chilled to the marrow he ached all over at first but then the cold really set in and he couldnt feel much of anything there was no sign of the chasm or of tylendel and for one brief moment loneliness made him ache worse than the cold then the chill seemed to reach the place where the loneliness was and that began to numb as well he began walking choosing a direction at random the snowfield wasnt as featureless as hed thought it seemed the flat smooth snowplain that creaked beneath his feet began to grow uneven soon he was having to avoid huge teeth of ice that thrust up through the crust of the snow then he could no longer avoid them he was having to climb over and around them they were sharpedged sharp as glass shards he cut himself once and stared in surprise at the blood on the snow and strangely enough it didnt seem to hurt there was only the cold five tylendel was sprawled carelessly across the grass in the garden reading vanyel watched him from behindthe safety of his window curtains half sick with conflicting emotions the breeze was playing with the trainees tousled hair almost the same way it had in his dream he shivered and closed his eyes gods oh gods why me why now and why oh why him savils favorite protege he clutched the fabric of the curtain as if it were some kind of lifeline and opened his eyes again tylendel had changed his pose a little leaning his head on his hand frowning in concentration vanyel shivered and bit his lip feeling his heart pounding so hard he might as well have been running footraces no girl had ever been able to make his heart race like this the thought made him flush his stomach twisting gods what am i like him i must be father will oh gods father will kill me lock me up tell everyone ive gone mad maybe i have gone mad tylendel smiled suddenly at something he was reading vanyels heart nearly stopped and he wanted to cry if only hed smile at me that way oh gods i cant i cant i darent trust him hell only turn on me like all the others like all the others he turned away from the window invoking his shield of indifference with a sick and heavy heart if only i dared if only i dared savil locked the brassbound door of her own private version of the work room with fingers that trembled a little and turned to face her favorite protege tylendel with more than a little trepidation gods this is not going to be easy she braced herself for what was bound to be a dangerous confrontation both for herself and for tylendel she didnt think he was going to go for her throat but well this time she was going to push him just a little farther than she had dared before and there was always the chance that it would be too far this time he stood in the approximate center of the room arms folded over the front of his plain brown tunic expression unwontedly sober it was fairly evident that he had already gathered this was not going to be a lesson or an ordinary discussion there was nothing else in this room nothing at all unlike the public work room this one was square not circular but the walls here were stone too and for some of the same reasons in addition there was an inlaid pattern of lightercolored wood delineating a perfect circle in the center of the hardwood floor and there was an oddness about the walls a sense of presence as if they were nearly alive in a way they were savil had put no small amount of her own personal energies into the protections on this room they were in some senses a part of her and because of that she should be safer here than anywhere else if something went wrong you didnt bring me in here to practice tylendel stated flatly savil swallowed and shook her head no i didnt youre right i wanted to talk with you i have two subjects really and i dont want anyone to have a chance at overhearing us the first subject tylendel asked or i think i know my family again his expression didnt change visibly but savil could sense his sudden anger in the stubborn setting of his jaw your family again savil agreed tylendel youre a herald or nearly heralds do not take sides in anyones fight not even when their own blood is involved your people have been putting pressure on you to do something now i know you havent interfered but i also know you want to and im afraid that you might give in to that temptation his mouth tightened and he looked away from her so evan leshara can pour his poison into the ear of anyone at court who cares to listen and i m not allowed to do or say anything about it is that it im not even allowed to call him a damned liar for some of the things hes said about staven he pulled his gaze back to her and glared at her as angrily as if she were the one responsible for his enemys behavior its more than just my blood savil its my twin by all he believes by all he holds true weve got blooddebt to pay here and staven for all that hes young is the lord holder now its his decision the rest of us frelennye must and will support him and besides all that hes in the right dammit lord holder or not young or not right or not hes a damned hotheaded fool savil burst out flinging up both her hands before her in a gesture of complete frustration blooddebt be hanged its that kind of fool thinking that got your people and the leshara into this stupid feud in the first damned place you cant bring back the dead with more blood its honor dammit he clenched his hands into fists cant you even try to understand that it has nothing to do with real honor she said scornfully it has everything to do with plain obstinate pride lendel you cannot be involved she froze with her heart in her mouth as he made one angry step toward her he saw her reaction and halted she plowed onward trusting in the advice shed gotten please jaysen be right this time too this whole feud is insanity lendel listen to me lt has got to be stopped and if it goes on much longer its the heralds wholl have to stop it and you cannot take sides all right so far she hadnt said anything new now for the fresh goad and hope it wasnt too much of a goad too soon lendel i know youve never been able to figure out why both you and staven werent taken by companions well dammit its exactly this insanity thats the reason your beloved twin didnt get chosen and you did you at least can see the futility of this when you arent busy defending him hes too full of vainglory and too damned stubborn to ever see any solution to this but crushing the leshara branch and root your twin is an idiot lendel hes just as much an idiot as wester leshara but that doesnt change the fact that hes going to get people killed out of plain stupidity and i will not permit this to go on for very much longer if i have to denounce staven to end your involvement with this i will never doubt it you have more important things to do with your life than waste it defending a fool tylendels fists clenched again he was nearly rigid with anger as his eyes went nearly black and his face completely white with the force of his emotions and for one moment savil wondered if hed strike her this time or strike at her that is if he came for her she didnt intend to be where his fist landed or his levinbolt if it came to that please lord and lady dont let him lose it this time let him stay in control ive never pushed him this far before and dont let him try magic if he hits out i may not be able to save him from what my protections will do she prayed and looked steadfastly and she hoped compassionately into those angry eyes she could feel him vibrating inside caught between his need to strike out at the one who had attacked his very beloved twin and his own conscience and good sense savil continued to hold her ground refusing to back down the tension in the room was so acute that the powercharged walls picked it up reverberating with his rage and that fed back into savil willshe nillshe it was all she could do to hold fast and maintain at least the appearance of calm then he whirled and headed blindly into a corner he rested his forehead against the cool stone of the wall with one arm draped over his head pounding the fist of his free hand against the gray stones cursing softly under his breath now savil let him alone saying absolutely nothing once you get him worked into a rage let him deal with his anger and his internal turmoil in his own way had been jaysens advice leave him alone until hes calmed himself down finally he turned back to the room and her bracing himself in the corner eyes nearly closed breathing as hard as if hed been running a mile youll never get me to agree to stop supporting staven you know he said in a perfectly conversational tone i wont interfere with the heralds i wont help with the feud and i wont call evan leshara a damned liar but i will defend staven and what he thinks is right if only to you i love him and i will not give that up there was no sign that a moment before hed been in literally a killing rage i know savil replied just as calmly giving no indication that she was still shaking inside im not asking you to give up loving staven all i want is for you to think about this mess not just react to it if it was only your two families it would be bad enough but youre involving the whole region in your feuding we know very well that youve both been looking for mages to escalate this thing and lendel i do not want to hear a single word about which side started that the important thing is that youve done it the important thing is that if either side involves magic in this the heralds must and will take a hand we cant afford to have wild magic loose and hurting innocent people you are a herald or nearly you have to remember that you cannot take a side you have to be impartial no matter what evan leshara does or says tylendel shrugged but it was not an indifferent shrug his pain was very real and only too plain to his mentor she hurt for him but this was one of the most important lessons any herald had to learn that he had to be impartial no matter what the cost of impartiality was and no matter whether the cost was to himself or to those he cared for all right he said tonelessly ill keep out of it so now that youve turned my guts inside out what else did you want to discuss vanyel savil said relaxing enough that her voice became a little dulled with weariness hes been here for more than a month i want you to tell me what you think gods he sagged back against the wall and opened his eyes completely they had returned to their normal warm brown you would bring up his loveliness whats the matter savil asked sharply and took a closer look at him he was wearing a most peculiar halfsmile and she smelled a rat or at least a mouse lendel dont tell me youve gone and fallen in love with the boy he snorted no but the lad is putting a lot of stress on my selfcontrol let me tell you that when i dont want to smack that superior grin off his face i want to cuddle and reassure him and i dont know which is worse i dont doubt savil replied dryly walking over to where he leaned and draped herself against the wall opposite him all right obviously youve had your eye on him tell me what youve figured out so far even speculation will do half the time i think you ought to drown him her trainee replied shaking his golden head in disgust that miniature court hes collected around himself is sickening the posing the preening savil made a little grimace of distaste you dont have to tell me but what about the other half in my more compassionate moments im more certain than ever that hes hurting and all that posing is just that a pose a defense that the little court of his is to convince himself that hes worth something but ive made overtures and he just goes to ice on me he doesnt hit at me he just goes unreachable well savil eyed her protege with speculation that particular scenario hadnt occurred to me i thought that now hed been given his head he was just showing his true colors i was about ready to wash my hands of him foster him with oh oden or somebody somebody with more patience spare time and court connections than me dont tylendel said shortly a new and calculating look on his face i just thought of something didnt you tell me one of the things his father was absolutely livid about was his messing about with music yes she said slowly pretending to examine the knuckles of her right hand as if they were of intense interest but in reality concentrating on tylendels every word the boy was a marginal empath when he wasnt thinking about it she didnt want to remind him of that gift just now not when she needed the information she could get from it yes she repeated point of fact he told me flat i was to keep the boy away from the bards and you told me breda let him down gently or as gently as she could about his ambitions how often has he played since then now savil gave him a measuring look of her own not at all she said slowly not a note since then margret says theres dust collecting on that lute of his lord and lady tylendel bit his lip and looked away all his attention turned inward i didnt know it was that bad i thought he might at least be playing for those social butterflies hes collected not a note savil repeated positively is that bad for a lad whos certainly good enough to get a lot of praise from his sycophants for one whose only ambitions lay with music its bad its worse than bad we broke his dream for him savil i take back the first half of what i said tylendel rubbed his neck betraying a growing unease he looked up at the ceiling then back down at her his eyes now frank and worried we have a problem a serious problem that boy is bleeding inside if we cant get him to open up he may bleed himself to death how do we get at him savil asked taking him at his word her weakness and what made her a bad field herald although it was occasionally an asset in training proteges was in dealing with people she didnt read them well and she didnt really know how to handle them in a crisis situation this business with tylendel and his twin and the feud for instance i would never have thought of this solution desensitizing him weaning him into thinking about it logically by bringing him to the edge over and over but never letting him slip past that edge bless jaysen and damn him gods every time we play this game it wreaks as much damage on me as it does on poor lendel im still vibrating like a harpstring tylendel pondered her question a long time before answering his handsome face utterly quiet his eyes again turned inward i just dont know savil not while hes still rebuffing every overture he gets we need some time for this to build i think and then some event that will break his barricades for a minute until that happens we wont get in and hell stay an arrogant bastard until he explodes she felt herself grow cold inside suicidal to her relief tylendel shook his head i dont think so hes not the type it wouldnt occur to him now me never mind no what hell do is go out of control in one way or another hell either do it fast and have some kind of breakdown or slowly and debauch himself into a state where hes got about the same amount of mind left as a shrub wonderful she placed her right hand over her forehead rubbing her eyebrows with thumb and forefinger just what i wanted to hear tylendel made one of his expressive shrugs you asked i did she said reluctantly gods why me if its any comfort its not going to happen tomorrow it better not i have an emergency council session tonight she sighed and rubbed her hands together ill probably be up half the night so dont wait up does that mean the interview is over he asked quirking one corner of his mouth it does you can have the suite all to yourself tonight just dont leave crumbs on the floor or grease on the cushions i wouldnt care but margret will take your hide off in one piece and dont look for the lovebirds either theyre out on a fortnight field trial with shallan and her brood so youll be all alone for the evening oh gods all alone with the beautiful vanyel you really want to test my selfcontrol dont you he laughed then sobered shoving away from the wall and straightening on the other hand this might give me the chance i was talking about if i get him alone maybe i can get him to open up a bit savil shrugged and pushed away from the wall herself youre better than i with people lad thats why i asked your advice if you think you have an opportunity then take it meanwhile i have to go consult with the queens own and from there straight to the meeting no time for a break tylendel asked sympathetically she nodded he reached for her shoulders and embraced her closely see that you eat teacher he murmured into her hair i want you to stay around for a while not wear yourself into another bout of pneumonia and maybe kill yourself this time even when i hate you you old bitch you know i love you she swallowed down another lump in her throat and returned the embrace with a definite stinging in her eyes i know love dont think i dont count on it she swallowed again closed her eyes and held him as tightly a brief point of stability in a world that too often was anything but stable i love you too and dont you ever forget it the emptiness of the suite almost oppressed tylendel with the lovebirds gone savil due so the dinnertime rumor in the kitchens had it for a tilldawn council session in her capacity as speaker for those heralds teaching proteges and vanyel presumably entertaining his little coterie of followers there was nothing and no one to break the stifling silence it closed around him like a shroud until the very beating of his heart was audible outside the windows it was as dark as the heart of sin and so overcast not even a hint of moon came through his scalp was damp hot and prickly sweat trickled down the back of his neck and soaked into his collar it felt a whole lot later than it actually was time was crawling tonight not flying tylendel gave up trying to read the treatise on weathermagic savil had assigned him and switched to a history instead a handwritten pamphlet on weatherworking was not what he needed to be reading right now anyway not with a storm threatening his energy control often wasnt as good as hed like and he didnt want to inadvertently augment what was coming in he was a lot better at controlling his subconscious than he had been but there was no point in taking chances with savil out of reach that storm was at least part of what was making the suite seem stuffy tylendel sensed the thunderheads building up in the west even though he couldnt see them from where he was sprawled on the couch of the common room that was the gift that made him a heraldmage trainee and not just a heraldtrainee the ability to see or otherwise sense and manipulate energy fields both natural and supernatural his gifts had come on him early and a long time before he was chosen theyd given him trouble for nearly half of his short life and only his twins support had kept him sane in the interval between their onset and when his companion gala finally appeared are you tucked safe away dearling he mindspoke to her when this blow comes its going to be a good one the drowsy affirmative he got told him that she was halfasleep heat did that to her heat mostly made him irritable he had propped every window and door wide open and to hell with bugs but there wasnt even a whisper of breeze to move the air around the candle flames didnt even waver and the honeybeeswax smell of the candles placed all around the common room was almost choking him with its sweetness he shook back his damp hair rubbed his eyes and tried to concentrate on his book but part of him kept hoping for a flash of lightning in the dark beyond the windows or the first hint of cooling rain and part of him kept insisting that all he had to do was nudge it a little he told that part of himself to take a long walk and waited impatiently for the rain to come of itself nothing happened just an itchy sort of tension building he gave up trying to concentrate got up and went to the sideboard for a glass of wine he needed to get centered and calmed and a little less sensitive and he wasnt going to be able to do it on his own the only wine left was a white and it was a bit dry for his taste but it did accomplish what he wanted it to with just that hint of alcohol inside him he finally managed to relax and get into the blasted book he got so far into it in fact that when the first simultaneous blast of wind and thunder came he nearly jumped off of the couch half the candles the ones not sheltered in glass chimneylamps blew out wind whipped through the suite sending curtains flying and carrying with it a welcome chill and the scent of rain the shutters in mardics and donnis room banged monotonously against the walls not hard enough to shatter the glass yet but it was only a matter of time he dropped the book and got up to head for their door just as vanyel stumbled in through the corridor door and into the brightness of the common room the boy stood as frozen as a statue blinking owlishly at the light tylendels stomach gave a little lurch vanyel looked like death it was bad enough that the boy was lightcomplected bad enough that he was wearing stark black tonight which only accentuated his fair skin but his face had no color at the moment it was so white it was almost transparent his eyes looked sunken and his expression was of someone who has seen but been denied the havens vanyel tylendel said whispered really his voice barely audible above the banging shutter and the sound of the storm he cleared his throat and tried again vanyel i didnt expect you back so uh soon is something wrong for one moment for one precious moment tylendel thought he had him he was sure that the boy was going to open up to him his eyes begged for pity his expression so hungry and haunted nearly cracked tylendels own calm the trainee made a tentative step toward him it was the wrong move he knew that immediately vanyels face shuttered and assumed his habitual expression of flippant arrogance wrong he said with false gaiety bright lady no of course theres nothing wrong some of the bards just came over from their collegium and started an impromptu contest it got so damned hot in the great hall with all those people crowded in that i gave up just then the shutters in both the lifebondeds room and savils crashed against the walls with such force that it was a wonder that the windows didnt shatter havens vanyel yelped shell kill us and dove for savils room tylendel dashed into the other mentally cursing his own clumsiness and cursing himself for letting his reaction to the boy cloud his reading of him by the time he got everything secured and returned to the common room vanyel had retreated into his own room and the door was firmly and irrevocably shut vanyel the trainee said softly his eyes dark with compassion and understanding is something wrong i vanyel began then closed his eyes as a jit of trembling hit him i the music i suddenly tylendel was beside him holding him quieting his shivering its all right he murmured into vanyels ear his breath warm and like a caress in his hair its all right i understand vanyel stood as unmoving as a dead stick hardly daring to breathe afraid to open his eyes tylendel stroked his hair the back of his neck his hands warm and light and vanyel thought his heart was going to pound itself to pieces i understand he repeated i know what its like to want something and know you ii never have it you do vanyel faltered tylendel chuckled it was a warm rich sound and his fingers traced the line of vanyels spine slowly sensuously vanyel started to relax in tylendels arms and his eyes popped open in startlement when his own hands at tylendels chest encountered not cloth but skin the trainee was starkly gloriously nude then again tylendel whispered looking deeply into vanyels eyes maybe i will get it vanyel made a strangling noise wrenched himself away and fled into darkness into cold into the middle of his old dream first there had been the snowplain then as he walked across it the teeth of ice had begun poking their way up through the granular snow theyd grown higher as he walked but what he hadnt known was that they were growing behind him as well now he was trapped inside a ring of them trapped inside walls of ice smoother than the smoothest glass colder than the coldest winter he couldnt break out he pounded on them until his arms were leaden to no effect everywhere he looked ice snow nothing alive nothing but white and pale blue and silver even the sky was white and he was so alone so terribly alone nothing soft nothing comforting nothing welcoming only the ice only the unyielding unmoving ice and the white grainy snow he was cold so appallingly cold so frozen that he ached all over he had to get out hoping to climb over the barrier he reached for the top of one of the icewalls and pulled back his hands as pain stabbed through them he stared at them stupidly his palms were slashed nearly to the bone and blood oozed sluggishly from the cuts to pool at his feet there was blood on the snow red blood but as he stared at it in numb fascination it turned blue then his hands began to burn with the cold yet fiery pain of the wounds he gasped and tears blurred his vision he wanted to scream but could only moan gods it hurt hed give anything to make it stop hurting suddenly the pain did stop his hands went numb his eyes cleared and he looked down at his injured hands again and saw to his horror that the slashes had frozen over and his hands were turning to ice blue and shiny and utterly without feeling even as he gazed at them the ice crept farther up over his wrists crawling up his forearms and he cried out then he wasnt there anymore he was somewhere else it was dark but he could see by the lightning by a strange blue glow about him lightning flickered overhead and seemed to be controlled by what he did or thought he was standing on a mound of snow in the center of a very narrow valley to either side of him were walls of ice that towered over his head reaching to the night sky in sheer crystalline perfection behind him there was nothing somehow he knew this but before him vanyel before him an army an army of mindless monsterscreatures with only one goal to get past him already he was wounded he twisted to direct the lightning to lash into their ranks and felt pain lancing down his right side felt the hot blood trickling down his leg into his boot and freezing there there were too many of them he was doomed he gasped and wept at the horrible pain in his side and knew that he was dying dying alone so appallingly alone vanyel he struggled up out of the canyon of ice out of the depth of sleep shaken out of the nightmare by hot almost scorching hands on his shoulders and a commanding voice in his ears he blinked feeling things and not connecting them his eyes hurt hed been crying his hair his pillow were soggy with tears and he was still so cold too cold even to shiver that was why tylendels hands on his bare shoulders felt so hot vanyel tylendels eyes were a soft sable in the light of the tiny bedside candle like dark windows on the night windows that somehow reflected concern his hands felt like branding irons on vanyels skin gods vanyel youre like ice as he tried to sit up vanyel realized that he was still leaking tears as soon as he started moving he began shivering so hard he couldnt speak i he said and could get nothing more out tylendel snagged his robe from the foot of the bed without even looking around and wrapped it about his naked shoulders it wasnt enough vanyel shook with tremors he could not stop and the robe wasnt doing anything to warm him vanyel tylendel began then simply wrapped his arms around vanyel and held him vanyel resisted tried to pull away he blinked the snowplain stretched all around him empty but not asking anything of him cold but not a threat but lonely lonely oh gods how empty but not asking not hurting he blinked again and tylendel was still there still staring into his eyes with an openness and a concern he could not doubt go away he gasped waiting for pain waiting to be laughed at why tylendel asked quietly i want to help you he was turning to ice soon there would be no feeling and nothing to feel and he would be trapped tylendel took advantage of his distraction to get his arms around him van i wouldnt hurt you i couldnt hurt you he closed his eyes and gasped for breath his chest tight and hurting oh gods i want this im just trying to get you warm again tylendel said with a hint of impatience thats all relax will you he did relax he couldnt maintain his indifference and to his shame began crying again and he couldnt stop the tears any more than he could the shivering but not only did tylendel not seem to mind come on vanyel he soothed pulling him into a comfortable position on his shoulder supporting him like a little child its all right i told you i wont hurt you i wouldnt ever hurt you cry yourself out its just you and me and ill never tell anyone on my honor absolutely on my honor it was already too late to save his battered dignity anyway vanyel surrendered appearance selfrespect everything he sagged against tylendels shoulder burying his face in tylendels soft worn blue robe he let the last of his pride dissolve releasing all the tears hed been keeping behind his walls of indifference and arrogance soon he was crying so hard he couldnt even think just cling to tylendels shoulders and sob he didnt really hear what tylendel was saying only the tone of his voice registered in his sleepmazed grief comforting compassionate caring he cried his eyes sore and dry he cried until his nose felt swollen to the size of an apple all the time he shivered with the terrible cold that seemed to have become one with his very bones shivered until the bed shook finally there just werent any tears left and he wasnt shivering anymore he was warm and more than warm protected and completely exhausted tylendel held him as carefully as if he was made of spun glass and would shatter at a breath just held him that was all it was enough it was more than he ever remembered having he wished it could last forever may the gods help me ive always wanted this done tylendel asked very quietly a good while after the last of the sobs and the tremors had finished shaking his body he nodded reluctantly and felt the arms holding him relax he sat up again and tylendel cupped both his hands around his face turning him into the light he winced away from it knowing what he must look like the trainee chuckled but it had a kindly not a mocking sound youre a mess peacock he said somehow making the words a joke to be shared between them vanyel smiled tentatively and tylendel dabbed at his eyes with the corner of the sheet do you have so common a thing as a handkerchief around here he asked quite casually vanyel nodded and fumbled at the drawer of the bedside table until tylendel patted his hand away and got the square of linen out of it himself here he gave it to vanyel then settled back a little i couldnt sleep got up to get some wine and heard you do this often vanyel blew his nose and looked up at the older boy through halfswollen eyes often enough he confessed nightmare he nodded and looked down at his hands know why no he whispered but he did he did it was hearing the bards hearing what hed never ever have and then encountering tylendel and knowing gods want to tell me about it he dared another glance at the trainee the quiet face of the older boy was not easy to read but there were no signs of deception there that vanyel could see but youll laugh at me he said ready to pull away again no on my honor van i dont lie i wont laugh at you and nothing you tell me will go outside this room unless you want it to vanyel shivered again and without any warning at all the words came spilling out its ice he said sniffing studying his hands and the handkerchief he had twisted up in them its all around me im trapped i cant get out and im so cold so cold then i cut myself and i start to turn into ice then sometimes like tonight im somewhere else and im fighting these things and i know im going to die and the worst of it isnt the pain or the dying its that that he faltered im all alone so totally alone it sounded so banal so incredibly foolish just put into words like that especially when he didnt couldnt tell tylendel the rest the part about him he looked up expecting to see mockery in the older boys face and froze seeing nothing of the kind van i think i know what you mean tylendel said slowly there are times when when being alone is a hurt thats worse than dying when its easier to die than to be alone arent there vanyel blinked caught without words tylendels voice was so soft he might well have been speaking to himself sometimes maybe its better to have had someone and lost them than to have never had anyone then tylendels eyes focused for a moment on vanyel and vanyels heart spasmed at the flash of emotion he saw a longing hed not ever dreamed to see there directed at him oh gods i never i thought he cant he does he is father will i dont care he snatched at what was proffered before it could be taken away vanyel the blond began lendel vanyel interrupted urgently daring the nickname hed heard his aunt use stay with me please please his words tumbled over one another as he hurried to get them out before tylendel could interrupt he caught hold of the older boys wrist the ice is still there i know it is its inside me and its freezing me from the inside out its killing my feelings i think its killing me please please dont leave me alone with it you dont know what youre asking tylendel said almost angrily pulling his hand out of vanyels his eyes no longer readable you cant know you dont know what iam but i do vanyel protested desperately i do the girls tell me things to get my attention they told me youre uh shayachern they said that you dont sleep with girls that you he felt himself blush the rush of blood almost painful his cheeks were so sore from crying then dammit vanyel what do you think im made of tylendel cried harshly his face twisted and his eyes reflecting internal pain what do you think i am marble youre beautiful youre bright youre everything id ever ask for you think i can stay here and not want you good gods i wont take advantage of an innocent but what youre asking of me would try the control of a saint you dont understand i know what im asking vanyel replied catching his wrist again before he could get up and stalk off into the dark i do know tylendel shook his head violently and looked away lendel look at me vanyel pleaded pouring his heart out in a confession hed never have dared to make before this listen i dont like girls either im not an innocent i know what i want lendel please listen ive been rlve bedded enough of them to know that they dont do anything for me its about as mechanical as dancing or eating they just dont mean anything to me tylendel stopped trying to pull away and turned a face to vanyel that was so full of dumbfounded surprise that the younger boy had to fight hysterical laughter and i do you tylendel began then his face hardened dont play with me vanyel dont toy with me ive had that game played on me once already and i dont want to hear you crying to savil in the morning that i seduced you vanyel bit his lip and looked directly into tylendels eyes pleadingly im not playing lendel please he felt his eyes sting and this time didnt try to hide the two tears that spilled down his raw cheeks i ive been thinking about this for a long while almost since i got here and they told me about you and you never laughed at me you were kind to me you kept being kind to me even when i was pretty rude it meant a lot to me and i didnt know how to thank you i started feeling things around you i was scared i didnt dare let you guess i didnt want to admit what i wanted now i do the older boy looked at him sideways which is vanyel gulped i want to be with you lendel and if you go i wont have any choice but the ice once again tylendel cupped his face between his strong hands and gently brushed the tears away with hesitant fingers he stared deeply into vanyels eyes for so long and so searchingly that vanyel thought he surely must be reading right down to the depths of his soul vanyel held his gaze and tried to make his own eyes say that he meant every word hed said tylendel finally nodded once slowly then he reached out quite deliberately and snuffed the candle before taking vanyel back into his arms it was very dark no light outside no sound but the rain falling after a moment tylendel chuckled with what sounded like surprise and said softly into vanyels ear im beginning to wonder just whos taking advantage of who here then a bit later another chuckle to tell vanyel that he was teasing move over you selfish little peacock im about to freeze to death then no words at all then again they didnt need words the halls were totally deserted chill and lit by lamps that were slowly flickering out as they used up the last of the nights oil savils slow weary footsteps echoed before and behind her without disturbing so much as a spider at one point on the long walk back to her quarters from the council chamber savil wasnt entirely certain she was going to make it she was so damned tired she was about ready to give up and lie down in the middle of the cold hall im getting too old for this she told herself no more younglings after this lot i cant take the emotional ups and downs and i truly cannot take these allnight sessions with a lot of stubborn old goats she grinned a little ironically at herself of which i am one of the most stubborn but gods hours like this are for the young i hurt and i think im going to beg off lendels weather working lesson today else my bones are going to ache more gods bless the door at last she pushed open the door to the suite tylendel had left a nightcandle burning but it too was guttering no matter there was the pearly gray light of an overcast dawn creeping in through the windows of her room the lifebondeds and tylendels she froze tylendels bed was unoccupied she could see it through the door dont panic old woman she cautioned herself just do a bit of a trace first youve shared magic you ve got the line to his mind see where it leads she found the little energylink that said tylendel and followed it back to where tylendel himself was it wasnt very far still in the suite in fact in vanyels room vanyels room her first reaction was to fling the door open and demand to know what was going on her second was to chuckle with aura overtones like that she bloody well knew what was going on but vanyel gods have mercy no sign he was shay a chern then again given withens prejudices he might have feared for a long time that the boy was fey and withens answer to that fear would have been exactly what hed been doing keeping the boy sheltered at home rather than fostering him out and trying to shove him in the direction withen wanted trying to force the boy into a mold he was totally unsuited for and he also might well have protected the boy from even the idea that samesex pairings were possible so the boy himself wouldnt have known what he was until he first found out about lendel which answered a great many questions indeed the question now was what had led to this and what was it going to mean for the future she took a deep breath of the chilly damp air and groped her way back to her own room no use rushing things questioning could be done just as easy with herself lying in her own warm bed easier actually given how she felt she stripped herself down to the skin promised her weary bones a bath later and dragged on a bedgown before crawling into the blankets the warm blankets and she blessed tylendels thoughtfulness for putting the warming spell on her bed before hed taken to his own or whatever she settled herself comfortably and reached out a thin tendril of mindspeech in privatemode if the imp was awake he was savil came the sleepblurred thought dense with a feeling of contentment thought i heard you come in found me hmm aye and i have a pile of questions she shifted herself until her left shoulder stopped aching quite so much the only important one is how did you talk him into it i didnt it was all vans idea she almost lost the mindspeech thread with her start of surprise and had to grope after it sounds like i really missed something what in the name of the havens happened last night too much to talk about now there were overtones of mental and physical weariness to his mindvoice but hes going to be all right savil we did more than just the physical i think we must have talked for hours before and after he handed me the key to himself and he wanted me to have it she raised a sardonic mental eyebrow lendel i dont want to drench you with cold water but may i remind you of what happened the last time morning arrived with you in someone elses bed it s all right savil it really is this time a feeling of faint surprise you know you re always teasing me about falling in love but i dont know this feels different savil snorted right it always does no dont let an old cynic disturb you teacher i think this is going to be something more than just a onetime i think he needs me oh havens all right if thats the way you think its going just let me know in the morning if you plan to move in with him or him with you though his is the better chamber we could use a spare for guests flavor of laughter like crisp apples you just want my room back if you arent using it seriously lendel this is important i want to have a long talk with him when i get up and i want you there he really should know what hes letting himself in for as shayachern i dont think we should let that get out and ill mindspeak with you on that before we talk with him hmm cancel your classes this morning im too tired and i have the feeling you werent exactly early to sleep another applefeeling of laughter and the mindlink faded and she let exhaustion pull her down into a slumber that she really didnt want not anymore one last thought before sleep came great good gods what am i going to tell withen tylendel raised himself up on his elbow and looked down at the slumbering boy beside him rest had repaired the damages that several hours of soulwrenching weeping had done to vanyels face relaxed and with all his barriers down he looked as innocent as an unawakened child which he was as tylendel now knew quite intimately not not in any way except perhaps his vulnerability van he whispered touching his shoulder and feeling just a faint chill of apprehension despite his words to his mentor can you wake up a little vanyel stirred wrinkled his nose and halfopened his eyes and when he saw who was beside him he smiled with heartstopping sweetness with all his masks gone he was as charming as he was beautiful hmm he said blinking as tylendel felt a surge of relief and gratitude that this was not going to be a repeat of the infamous nevis affair want a roommate you why he grinned he knew now that you had to show van that something was a joke or often hed taken it seriously savil seems to want my room back for guests she says besides i like your company vanyels reply though not verbal was a definite and unmistakable affirmative we have savil said dryly several problems here shed had that mindspeech conference with tylendel as shed gotten herself put together for the day nice thing mindspeech let you cover more than one thing at once and after giving it thorough consideration while she bathed she decided to have her little talk with vanyel in his room with any luck hed feel less threatened there she did usurp the most comfortable chair in the room though the privilege of age she told herself waiting for the two young men to settle themselves without seeming to consult about it tylendel sat on the edge of the bed and vanyel arranged himself crosslegged on the floor at his feet and the flexibility of youth would that i could still do that the body language gave her spirits a lift though the way vanyel had positioned himself was interesting at tylendels feet below both her head and his lovers that could well show hed given up that pose of arrogant superiority very interesting i wonder if having a steady lover at his side might well give lendel something to think about besides his twin and that damned feud on the other hand this lads been so affectionstarved this could be another sort of trouble yes indeed we have quite a few little problems here she repeated tylendel nodded at her words vanyel looked puzzled at first then thoughtful the first problem and the one thats going to tie in to all the others vanyel is your father she paused and vanyel bit his lip im sure that you realize that if he finds out about this he is going to react badly vanyel coughed and bowed his head hiding his face for a moment when he looked back up he was wearing a weary ironic halfsmile a smile that had as much pain in it as humor it was by far and away the most open expression savil had ever seen him wear badly is something of an understatement aunt he replied rubbing his temple with one finger hell gods i cant predict what hell do but hell be in a rage thats for certain hell pull you home van tylendel said in a completely flat voice and he can do it youre not of age you arent chosen and you arent in bardic and i cant protect you savil sighed wishing that she could i can stall him off for a while seeing as he officially turned guardianship of you over to me but it wont last more than a couple of months then well ill give you my educated guess as to what withen will do i think hell put you under house arrest long enough for everybody to forget about you then find himself a compliant priest and ship you off to a temple probably one far away with very strict rules about outside contact there are im sorry to say several sects who hold that shayachern are tainted theyd be only to happy to purify you for withen and withens gold and under the laws of this kingdom none of us could save you from them vanyel nodded by the startled agreement in his eyes savil reckoned that this was a speculation hed entertained before this although for different causes so is there anything i can do he asked quietly obviously she said or i wouldnt be talking to you now but you arent going to like the solution to your problem its pretty heartbreakingly simple outside of this room vanyel nothing is to change but he twisted his head around to see what tylendel thought about this only to find that his lover was nodding in complete agreement with her savils right van tylendel said sadly but vanyel protested holding out one hand toward him in entreaty then turning the same pleading eyes on savil when tylendel shook his head mardic and donni are discreet and id trust margret to keep what she knows behind her teeth even under torture but if you want to stay here vanyel you wont say or do anything to betray your relationship to lendel the moment people start to talk itll get back to your father the quickest way to make them talk love tylendel said in what was almost a whisper is to change is to even be friendlier to me than you have been you told me the girls told you i was a pervert vanyels eyes widened at tylendels directness it cant have escaped your notice how they sniggered and giggled about it and they were being polite my preferences are not generally socially acceptable there are only two reasons why i have as little trouble as i do the first is that im a heraldtrainee and heralds are allowed a bit more license than ordinary mortals and my patron is savil she just happens to outrank everybody in the circle except the queens own and the other reason vanyel said in a very subdued voice what stretched tylendels mouth was something less than a smile the fact that i took a couple of the worst offenders on and kept knocking them down until they didnt get up oh tylendel caught up one of his hands in both of his own i know you want everyone to know about us i cant tell you how much that means to me but it will mean a lot more to me to know you were going to be able to stay with me and to do that young vanyel savil said intruding into the intense interaction between them you are going to have to begin a performance a master player couldnt equal lendel and i have been talking about you this afternoon from the complete astonishment on his face savil could tell that he hadnt guessed theyd been in conference via mindspeech for that matter it might be that he didnt know they both had that gift we share the mindspeech gift lad and its damned useful at times like this hes told me some of what you told him and it rather changed my mind about you but i will not lie to you im going to help you because he wants it because he wants you here so now im going to order you outside of this suite you are to be the same arrogant little bastard that arrived here and if you can manage to be slightly rude to lendel thats even better and in return ill make this suite a little sanctuary for the two of you is it a bargain vanyel who had gone rather pale gulped and nodded savil smiled for the first time since shed begun this conference thats a good lad if youre half of what lendel claims for you im going to come to like you a great deal and im sorry for the treatment youve had from your father ill tell you that he isnt the same person i knew when i was chosen hes gone stiff and stubborn and altogether hidebound maybe its age maybe its that a lot of his old friends have taken the long walk and hes seeing death looking for him too maybe its that priest hes gotten tied up with i just dont know she coughed well thats not to the point what is to the point is that youll only have to keep up this charade until youre eighteen youll be your own man then and can do what you please and ill see to it that lendel begins having trouble with his magelessons she winked and tylendel chortled i think we can keep him out of whites until youre of age after that if this love affair lasts that long youll have to make your decisions on your own fair enough more than fair aunt savil vanyel looked very subdued and quite unlike the boy that had faced her something like a month ago she couldnt quite pinpoint why lendel what is it about him she mindspoke letting her puzzlement drift over no masks came the immediate answer this is the real vanyel dearheart the one nobody but me and maybe his sister has seen now see why i love him the last thought stopped her cold are you that sure kechara are you really that sure his eyes caught hers over vanyels head caught and held them im that sure and him i don know but he was willing to defy his father for me and i think that says something she closed her own eyes against that burning intense gaze then may the gods help and guard you she turned her attention back to vanyel and quickly he was still looking toward tylendel and the very same look was in his eyes and a vulnerability and apprehension that cut at her heart ill help you all i can son she said quietly ill help you all i can six dont go yet tylendel said abruptly as vanyel picked himself up off the floor vanyel gave him a look of uncertainty he was still too new to this being open he was still waiting for blows that never came but tylendel seemed to know that its all right van he said softly its really all right i have a good reason ive got a lesson he protested history and im still behind the other three tylendel made a wry face youre a law unto yourself remember at least thats what youre supposed to be acting like you skipped your lessons this morning skip the rest of them today tell em you were sick tell em the storm last night gave you a headache but its important tylendel coaxed really it is more important than that history lesson if youre behind ill coach you please it didnt take much encouragement from tylendel to get him to do what he already wanted to do lessons were hardly as attractive as more of tylendels company here he wasnt going to be hurt here someone cared for him it was as heady as a little too much wine only without the hangover vanyel closed the door to his room then turned an expectant face toward his lover poised with one hand still on the latch tylendel stretched lazily reaching for the ceiling with his head tilted back then he dropped his arms rose from his seat on the bed and walked over to put his hand behind vanyels shoulder theres somebody i want you to meet he said gently pushing vanyel in the direction of the rooms outside door but vanyel protested weakly i thought youre awfully fond of that word but love tylendel chuckled what does it take to get you to say something else he opened the door still without enlightening vanyel as to the reason why he was going to introduce vanyel to someone after savil had just got done telling them both that they were to keep the relationship a secret and tylendel had agreed with her vanyel started to protest again realized that the only thing he could think of to say was but and subsided as tylendel guided him out the door to the gardens beyond you see that bridge tylendel pointed northward to the first of the two bridges crossing the terilee river on the palace grounds and that stand of pines on the other side vanyel nodded it was quite a healthy grove in fact and the trees extended a good distance back into the field they were tall very thick and a deep green that was almost black with huge branches that drooped beneath their own weight until they touched the ground you count to fifty after you see me go in there then you follow tylendel ordered in case anybody happens to come by though or looks out a window youd better try your hand at acting the arrogant little prig vanyel nodded again completely mystified but willing to go along with about anything that tylendel wanted he posed himself carefully leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest attempting to look as if he were simply idling about in the gardens while tylendel sauntered off this is going to be harder than it was before he thought somberly trying to look anywhere except after tylendel i didnt have anything to lose before now i have everything to lose if i slip he closed his eyes and turned his face up to the sun as if he were savoring the warmth but if i dont slip oh gods whichever one of you is responsible for this its worth anything i swear its worth anything you ask of me he chanced a sideways glance across the river tylendel was only just reaching the pine grove he looked away strolled over to a stand of daylilies admired them for a moment then glanced across the river again tylendels blond hair gleamed against the dark boughs like a tangled skein of spun sunlight then vanished as the branches closed behind him vanyel transferred his admiration to a bed of rose vines languidly bending to inhale their perfume all the while counting to the requisite fifty he had no sooner reached the required number though when a giggling flock of his admirers rounded a hedge saw him and altered their course to intersect with his oh no he thought dismayed and looked surreptitiously about for an escape route but saw no way to avoid them sighing he resigned himself to the inevitable and waited for their arrival vanyel what are you doing out here asked slim barelyadolescent jillian batting her sandy lashes at him arent you supposed to be at lessons vanyel covered a wince it would have to be jillian no common sense and the moral fiber of a hound in heat and after me with all the dedication youd see in a hawk stooping on a pigeon lord i hope her father marries her off quick or she ii be sleeping her way around the court before long but he smiled at her a smile with a calculated amount of pain in it a rotten headache pretty one it took me last night when the storm came in and i cannot be rid of it i tried sleeping in but he shrugged my aunt suggested i take a long walk the entire covey giggled in nearunison suggested with a stick ill bet dark kertire said sardonically squinting into the sunlight sour savil well well walk with you then and keep you from being bored vanyel bit his lip in vexation and thought quickly she suggested my course as well he told them grimacing to the end of companions field and back and i have no doubt shes watching from her window he pouted at them much as i would adore your company my pretties i rather doubt those slippers youre wearing are equal to a hike across a field full of er horseturds said jesalis inelegantly wrinkling her nose and tossing her blonde curls over her shoulder bother no youre right she continued sticking her foot out a little and surveying the embroidered rosesatin slipper on it with regret i just finished the embroidery on these and got them back from the cobbler i dont want them spoiled and they would be before wed gotten half across the others murmured similar sentiments as their faces fell were never going to forgive you for deserting us vanyel now thats unfair he exclaimed assuming a crushed expression blaming me for the orders of my crotchety old aunt he rolled his eyes mournfully at them jesalis giggled well only forgive you if you promise to make it up to us tonight after dinner tonight he asked pained by the idea of spending the evening with them instead of with tylendel as theyd planned this morning they mistook his expression for headache well not if you still arent feeling well jesalis amended after a tramp across a perilous obstacle course like that he gestured flamboyantly at the field across the river i much doubt i m going to be feeling better well a bargain if youll forgive me ill come and play for you while youre doing finework tomorrow morning he said quite desperately willing to promise them almost anything to avoid losing his evening and recalling that theyd all been pestering him to play for them before it hadnt been possible it would have hurt too much now though well becoming or not becoming a bard didnt seem all that important anymore and consequently the thought of music didnt hurt anymore or not as much certainly it was a small price to pay for having his evening free you will squealed wendi whose older sister was fostered with vanyels mother really ratha told me you were as good as a bard well he shrugged then smirked i wont say im a bad hand at the lute and i know a ballad and a dance or two done said jesalis a bargain bless you my dear he replied with honest thankfulness i wouldnt be able to live without your forgiveness now if youll all excuse me the sooner i get this nonsense over the sooner ill be able to go back to my bed they giggled and turned back retracing their footsteps while he watched them they disappeared behind the hedge again heading in the direction of the maze when they were safely out of sight he trudged to all appearances most unwillingly across the bridge and up a little rise heading a little indirectly for the pine grove he went past it walking through soft grasses that ranged from kneehigh to closely cropped and despite what he had told the girls there were no traps lurking beneath the grass for the unwary that did surprise him a bit he was no stranger to long walks across pastureland and the hazards thereof what on earth do the companions do drop it all in one corner i suppose the stories say theyre as intelligent as a human i suppose its possible likely really they still eat grass like horses and whod want to eat in the privy after first making certain that there was no one about to see him vanyel doubled back to the pine grove and pushed aside the heavy scratchy boughs he almost had to force his way past them the needles caught in his hair and clothing and the branches closed over his head almost immediately shutting off most of the sunlight a few feet inside the grove there was no direct light he walked through a pinescented twilight gloom with boughs lacing together just barely above his head and a thick carpet of dry needles at his feet the needles crunched a little releasing more piny scent but otherwise his own footsteps were almost noiseless some where in the distance he could hear birds calling but their songs seemed to be furlongs away this place looked enormous now that he was inside it much larger than it had appeared from outside magical almost mystical and far removed from the bright greenandgold field just a few feet away this wasnt the grove that was a good deal farther into the field but this stand of ancient pines was giving vanyel a pleasant shivery sort of feeling making him feel somehow more aware and alive lendel he called softly into the bluegreen quiet under the pine boughs his voice muffled by the rows of straight columnar trunks of shaggy ebony all about him he turned slowly trying to see past the shadows peering beneath the feathery branches right here came the reply from slightly behind him and a white shape ghosted up on his right resolving itself into a companion the first that vanyel had ever seen at close range and tylendel beside her one hand on her snowy arched neck this is who i wanted you to meet van this is gala she already knows about you van she knew last night were mindlinked i told her everything and she wanted to see you right away vanyel felt strange and awkward those sapphire eyes held an intelligence that was rather frightening but the form was a horse how in the havens did you introduce yourself to a horse the silence grew he stared into galas eyes swallowed and finally made the attempt hullo he said shyly looking straight into those eyes and hoping to speak directly to the intelligence there trying to ignore the fact that he was feeling more than a bit intimidated and foolish i i hope you dont mind gala snorted and tylendel chuckledshe says to tell you that shes been hoping id find a nice mate and give her a chance for a little peace for a long time she says its altogether disconcerting to be sidling up to a handsome stallion and find me in her head asking for bedtime stories that was the last response hed expected vanyel choked down a laugh lendel you didnt he nodded as gala tossed her own head i most certainly did but only once it was after nevis and i was he faltered and looked to the side rather lonely vanyel touched the hand still resting on galas neck not anymore i hope tylendel glanced from the hand resting lightly on his own to vanyels face and halfsmiled into his eyes no he replied quietly not anymore the quiet the peace of the shadowed grove let them ignore everything except each other caught in the spell of that place and that pose neither paid any attention to the passing of time until vanyel stumbled forward propelled by a hard shove in the small of his back tylendel grabbed him to keep him from falling both of them too startled to do more than emit rather undignified squeaks of surprise gala danced backward a few steps making sounds vanyel would have been willing to stake his life were laughter it was pretty obvious that shed shoved him into tylendels arms with her nose tylendel burst into gales of laughter he clutched his stomach nearly incoherent and gasping for breath gala snorted and bobbed her head and he doubled over again theyre talking vanyel finally realized as tylendel wheezed or well i guess shes teasing him gods above and below all the stories are true i wish i could hear them his stomach fluttered uncertainly and he tasted the sour bite of what could only be jealousy tylendel and gala were sharing something he never could something theyd had for years before he had come along in this he was he would always be the outsider that realization condensed into a hard cold lump in his throat and besides the bitter taste of jealousy he shivered in a sudden chill of loneliness and just a touch of doubt he could really have about anyone he wanted couldnt he so why should he bother with me how can i know if he means what he told me but before he could throw himself into a mire of depression he found he had his hands full keeping the trainee from falling over while tylendel struggled to breathe around his laughter and gasped like a stranded fish you wouldnt tylendel choked as tears ran down his cheeks and he pulled away from vanyel to advance on his companion in mock threat the effect somewhat spoiled by the fact that he had to catch hold of a tree trunk as something she said made him bend over again with laughter dont you dare gala ill do no such thing you rude little bitch gaia danced in place her hooves making no sound at all in the thick carpet of needles her eyes sparkled with mischief and vanyel had for one moment a disconcerting doublevision image of the prancing companion and an equally mischievous young woman of about tylendel s age laughing soundlessly at her chosen this was worse than before vanyel felt completely alone and left altogether on the outside tylendel not noticing his distress in the least managed to get himself back under control and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand as he straightened up he assumed a stern expression now see here you wicked young lady he began when she turned the tables on him by whickering and reaching out to nuzzle his cheek vanyel saw his eyes soften as he folded immediately oh all right i forgive you he sighed in defeat putting his arms around her neck and resting his cheek against hers but you had damn well better not what it was gala had better not do tylendel did not verbalize nor was vanyel entirely certain he wanted to know he had the sneaking suspicion that it would be no little embarrassing finally gala shook herself free and shoved her chosen in vanyels direction a good bit more gently than shed shoved the latter and as if in apology she paced forward and gave vanyel a brief caress with her nose rather like a soft kiss before trotting off into the blue twilight under the pine boughs and out of sight among the trunks silence followed her going well tylendel said at last that was gala vanyel replied with the first thing that came into his head you really love her dont you more than anything or anybody except you and staven tylendel replied almost apologetically im not sure i can explain it he bit off what he was saying as if something in vanyels expression told him how depressed this meeting had made him van he reached out hesitantly toward vanyels shoulder then pulled his hand back as if unsure whether to touch him i didnt bring you here to hurt you his very real distress forced vanyel to pull himself together and try to analyze his feelings instead of just wallow in them they were to say the least mixed i think im jealous he said after an uncomfortable pause i know its stupid she cant ever have you the way i do but i cant ever share your thoughts the way she does huh you wouldnt want to tylendel began but thats not the point vanyel interrupted backing a few steps away i cant know that you can tell me but i cant ever know that can i he wasnt sure what to do or what else to say and so fell silent turning away slightly and looking out past tylendel into the shadows that had swallowed the companion van he felt tylendels hand fall lightly on his shoulder and turned to look into his eyes do you want to talk about this do you want to hear about what its like for us how it started do you think that will help you understand not trusting his voice vanyel nodded this will take a while pick a spot to sit unless youd rather go back to the room tylendel raised one eyebrow inquiringly no i like it here it somehow seems more private vanyel faltered and covered his hesitation by looking around for a good place he finally chose a spot at the base of one of the bigger trees beside them between two roots that were each as thick as his leg he put his back against the trunk and slid down it to be cradled where the roots joined the tree tyiendel pondered his choice for a moment well i can only see two ways i can talk and look at you at the same time and since i dont fancy shouting across the clearing before vanyel had time to react hed stretched himself out along the ground and put his head in vanyels lap much better he sighed vanyel froze van tyiendel said quietly closing his eyes i wont hurt you not for any reason i like being near you with you i need to touch people and i wont ever hurt you vanyel relaxed a little i like this grove too though hardly anyone else seems to it feels like theres no time in here he kept his eyes closed and vanyel saw a little paincrease between his eyebrows he gets those headaches he told me last night i wonder if hed mind if it would help vanyel hesitated for a moment then began massaging tylendels temples with gentle fingertips the trainee chuckled and vanyel felt his shoulders relax you have about a hundred years to stop doing that he said i think i have the headache you claimed you were going to tell me about you and gala and being chosen vanyel prompted though the thought made him a little uncomfortable still i mean you practically got my whole life story last night and i still dont know that much about you to begin at the beginning i have a twin staven hes the elder by about an hour nothing like me by the way hes taller thinner darker and much handsomer hes the leader im the follower weve had a primitive sort of mindlink ever since we were born things happened between us all the time things like oh i blacked out when he fell down the well he acted like hed broken his leg when i broke mine we always knew what the other one was up to he took a deep breath people knew all about that but i had other gifts too that i could use besides that mindlink from the time i was about nine i had a touch of thoughtsensing for people besides slav and i had an ability to make accidents happen to people i didnt like did that cause you problems vanyel asked with other people i mean i should think they wouldnt much appreciate that last tylendel shook his head slightly it didnt crop up often enough for people to really notice or if they did they were too afraid of my father to say anything about it i didnt do it often the accidentcausing i mean it made me sick after staven sometimes tried to egg me on but it wasnt something id give in to him about tylendel paused and bit his lip his expression flickered briefly into one both dark and brooding before it lightened again it was the link between me and staven that was the strongest and most predictable of the gifts it was pretty much limited to physical sensations but once we figured out how to use it vanyel chuckled i bet you were unholy terrors tylendel echoed the chuckle and winked at him i wouldnt mind having a link like that with you vanyel blushed but answered with exactly what he was thinking i wouldnt mind either tylendels expression sobered now comes the part where things got odd staven matured pretty early by twelve he was as tall as most at fifteen and all the girls were starting to flirt with him and not just the girls but grown women as well i think he got all his share of femaleattraction and mine if you want to know the truth that summer we were hosting a tournament and everything from goosegirls to visiting highborn were after him and he was acting like a young and randy rooster in a henyard it all climaxed if youll forgive the expression when one of the ladies whod come to visit mother dropped him a note that said in no uncertain terms that shed be quite pleased to find him in her bed that night well he closed his eyes for a moment then looked up into vanyels face his own expression ironic understand i was just as curious as any twelve year old about what doing it was like i said id cover for him if he let me uh eavesdrop something tells me it didnt go according to plan vanyel guessed dead in the black tylendel said soberly i was with him for about as long as it took for things to get interesting i had been feeling odd from the start but i tried to ignore it and concentrated on the link then things got i dont know how to describe it except that i started losing my grip on me and started merging with him and the more i concentrated the stranger it all got it was a bit like those times id made accidents happen the room faded in and out i was in a kind of sickish fever my heart was racing and i couldnt tell what was me and what was slav under any other circumstances i think i would have quit and shut everything down but i was stubborn and i was a little afraid of stav making fun of me for diving out after this was over i kept holding to that link figuring that if i could just weather it out things would get fun again then he shook his head a bit and his mouth twitched just as things were about to come to the cusp for staven something broke loose in me i just barely remember the start of it like id suddenly been dropped into a fire i was in unbelievable pain it felt like being in the middle of a lightning storm and from the wreck i made of our room thats exactly what i may have created something about what was going on something about the link i had with staven triggered all my potential gifts explosively i was unconscious for about a day and when i woke up he shuddered nothing would ever be the same he closed his eyes and vanyel stroked his forehead his mouth was tight with lines of unhappiness at the corners far off in the distance vanyel could hear meadows wifts crying like the lost souls of ghostchildren so there i was tylendel continued his voice thin and strained i had the magegift thoughtsensing fetching a bit of empathy none of it predictable none of it controlled and all of it likely to burst out at any moment he took a look at vanyels face and read the puzzlement there gods i keep forgetting you arent a trainee fetching that means i can move things without touching them empathy means i can feel what someone else is feeling which is why i knew when you had that nightmare last night thoughtsensing if someone isnt shielding i can tell what theyre thinking the magegift is harder to explain but its what makes it possible for a heraldmage to do magic you can tell what im thinking vanyel said dubiously he would have liked being able to share tylendels thoughts the way gala did but wasnt entirely sure he wanted the relationship to hold that kind of onesided intimacy i can but i wont tylendel said with such firmness that vanyel couldnt find it in his heart to doubt him even if it wasnt so unfair to you its counter to all the ethics that go with being a herald basically i just use it to talk with gala and savil vanyel nodded comforted so you had all these gifts sort of thrown at you and no way to control them exactly tylendel said soberly and all this at twelve it was two years before gala came for me if it hadnt been for staven id have gone mad why vanyel whispered what was happening what wasnt id drop into a fit when id wake up again id be in the middle of a fiftyfoot circle of wreckage that was the magegift and fetching working together in a way savil and i havent been able to duplicate under control seems i have to go berserk he frowned and reached up to rub his forehead between his eyebrows staven was the only one who could get near me who was willing to stay near me in or out of a fit they said id been taken by a demon they said that because of what staven and i had tried to share i had been possessed when i started to show signs of being shayachern they said i was cursed too thats thats stupid vanyel cried indignantly they still said it if theyd dared theyd have outcaste me but they didnt staven swore if they did hed go with me and he was the heir the only possible heir with me acting the way i was mother wasnt capable of having any more children father wouldnt remarry and hed been completely faithful to her so there werent any bastards around they didnt have a choice they had to allow me to stay but they didnt have to make it comfortable for me vanyel thought with wonder that tylendels situation was actually worse than his own they kept me pretty well isolated even when i was fine they avoided me but when everyone else abandoned me in one of my fits he stayed he took care of me absolute and unshakable in the belief that i would never hurt him positive that despite what was whispered what had happened was not that id been possessed but was something that would somehow be worked out tylendel shuddered again his eyes haunted and plainly seeing another time and place vanyel feeling his pain put both his hands on his shoulders trying to just be a comforting presence without disturbing him tylendel looked up at him patted his hand and halfsmiled you see i think maybe thats why we understand each other well finally gaia came gods i cannot ever tell you what it was like looking into her eyes for the first time it was like souls touching and the reliefknowing that i wasnt mad that i wasnt demonpossessed i went from hell to the havens in the space of a heartbeat he sighed and seemed to sink into his own thoughts for a long while what did she do vanyel asked for one thing she put me under her shielding got me controlled until we arrived here and savil took me under her wing thats more than enough reason to love her even without the bond to her shes my very best friend and the sister of my soul he reached up and touched vanyels cheek his hand was cool almost cold but shell never be what you are can you understand what im saying love i owe her my sanity but in a lot of ways shes more than i am i love her the way i love savil or my mother inferior to superior not brother to sister or lover to lover not ever as equals vanyel put his own hand over the one touching his cheek and held it warming it in his own what am i then youre my partner my equal my friend and my love vanyel i didnt say this in so many words last night but i do love you those words were not expected certainly the implied level of commitment was not what vanyel had expected but he stuttered not sure whether what he was feeling was joy or fear van i know we havent known each other long but i do love you tylendel said ignoring the but holding vanyels gaze with his own and i love you because i love you not because i owe you anything or because some god somewhere decided i was going to be a herald or because youre a beloved teacher i love you because youre vanyel and we belong together and together we can stand backtoback against anything much to his confusion vanyel felt his eyes start burning i dont know really know what to say he replied awkwardly blinking hard except lendel i think after last night i cant ever remember being this happy ive never loved anyone i dont know what its like but if he tried to say what he felt if wanting to die for you is love his eyes burned he rubbed at them with his free hand and tried to put his feelings into coherent words he groped after his thoughts totally awkward and altogether out of his depth but he needed to articulate his bewildering emotions hed never felt so vulnerable and exposed in his life id do anything for you id take the sneers the pointed fingers i wouldnt care so long as they didnt take me away from you if i could id give you anything id do anything i could to make you happy and ill gladly share you with gala havens dont say that tylendel chuckled though his voice sounded suspiciously thick and his eyes glistened in the shadows she wanted to eavesdrop you know shed take you up on that the randy little bitch vanyels face flamed hotly and he laughed using his own embarrassment to get past that moment of complete vulnerability i knew she was saying something that would make me blush i just knew it well she is not going to have her prurience satisfied i promise you tylendel said firmly i am not going to share you and thats that vanyel entered their room through the garden door blinking until his eyes adjusted to the semidarkness after the noontide sunlight of the gardens he was carrying his lute by the neck in his right hand and holding his left wrapped in a handkerchief curled against his chest ye gods i should have known better he thought ruefully as his left hand throbbed i am such a damned fool lendel he called into the outer room racking the lute with care still using only his right hand are you out there of course i am tylendel strolled in a halfeaten slice of bread and cheese in one hand its lunchtime you know im always here when the food is vanyel began unwrapping his hand slowly tylendel stopped chewing then tossed his lunch forgotten onto the table gods van what did you do to yourself sit the ends of vanyels fingers were blistered and the blisters had broken and were bleeding the muscles of the hand were cramped so hard he couldnt have gotten his fingers uncurled to save his soul he looked at the wreckage hed made of his hand with a kind of pained disbelief tylendel pushed him down onto the bed and took the injured hand in both his own i made a fool of myself is what i did vanyel told him regretfully i told the girls yesterday that if theyd leave me alone id play for them this morning i forgot how long its been since i played and well ill tell you the truth i forgot i lost some feeling in those fingers when the arm got broken i didnt even realize what id done to my fingerends until after the muscles in my hand started to cramp stay right there tylendel went to the little chest at the foot of the bed that hed moved into vanyels room with the rest of his things bent over it for a moment and came back with bandages and a little pot of salve im no healer he said sitting down and taking vanyels hand back into his but ive banged myself up a time or two and this is good stuff he took some of it on the ends of his fingers and massaged it into the palm of vanyels hand a pleasant sharp odor came from it both green and spicy and his fingers began to relax from their cramped position both from the warming effect of the salve and the massage what is that vanyel asked sniffing im going to smell sort of like a pastry tylendel laughed dont tempt me this early in the day vanyelashke its cinnamon and marigold good for the cramped muscles and the poor battered fingers he had worked all the way out to the ends of vanyels fingers the cramps were mostly gone and the salve rather than burning as vanyel had half feared it would was numbing the areas where tylendel was spreading it now just let me get you bandaged up what was that you just called me ashke its tayledras hawkbrothertongue all those feathered faces and masks savil has on the wall out in the common room are from the tayledras she studied with one of their adepts starwind ktreva and they made her a wingsister thats like a blood brother for them tylendel was wrapping each finger carefully and taking his time about it vanyel didnt mind in the least now that he wasnt in much pain there was something a bit sensual about tylendels ministrations she uses a lot of their expressions when there isnt a good word for the thing in our tongue like shayachern it translates as oh one whose lover is like self with a sexual connotation to the word self that makes it clear that they arent talking about incest or similar interests its a very complicated language he looked up from his bandaging and vanyel could see laughterglints lurking in the depths of his eyes you smell delicious are you sure you have lessons this afternoon we promised savil wed be virtuous today vanyel reminded him feeling greatly tempted anyway tylendel heaved an exaggerated sigh too true well ashke translates simply to beloved and its part of your name already ashke ashkevron see he tied off the last bit of bandage with a flourish ashke vanyel mused i like it it suits you ashke savil says the hawkbrothers seldom go by their bornnames they take usenames when they become mages maybe thats the name you always should have had now lets go eat lunch and be virtuous before i decide to break my sworn word to savil savil looked up from her book and rubbed her tired blurring eyes tylendel and vanyel had taken over the couch across from her to study candlelight from the lantern beside them made a halo of tylendels dark gold curls and highlighted the golden brown of his tunic beside him in deep blue vanyel seemed to be an extension of his shadow they shared vanyels history text it rested on their knees with each holding a corner tylendels arm was around vanyels shoulder their heads nestled closely together from time to time savil could catch the murmur of a question from her nephew and tylendels slightly higher reply strange that its the older who has the tenor voice and the younger whos the deeper she mused blinking sleepily at them though the pairing is strange all around i would never have reckoned vanyel for shayachern not with withen for a father she yawned silently and halfclosed her eyes the two young ones across the room from her blurred into a haze of gold and darkest blue hes got lendel thinking about something other than that damned feud at least for that id warm to him even if i want to knock him into the wall occasionally for being a little prig lendel does seems to be getting some notion of responsible behavior into his head and a bit more politeness though its a damn good thing mardic and donni are inclined to take everything he says generously or they might have knocked him into the wall for me bless them he can be so damned rude sometimes arid not mean it she worried a hangnail with the end of her thumb hes been so isolate i suppose i shouldnt be surprised gods be thanked lendel seems to be civilizing him theres more patience there than there was before and i think maybe a little more kindness less arrogance for certain withen should be pleased enough with the reports hes getting to let him stay she noted vanyels intense concentration on his book and restrained the corners of her mouth from quirking up looks like hes enjoying himself cant say that i d mind studying with my lendel coaching poor little lad when he gives his heart to a thing he certainly doesnt do it halfway still im not certain i like the way hes becoming so dependent on lendel that isnt healthy not for either of them it could make for trouble later on a thin tendril of contact reached for her from across the room although tylendels eyes remained on the book a silver for your thoughts teachermine how pretty you look together young demon she replied the same way and how grateful i am that you ve managed to stay discreet discipline discipline came the laughtertinged answer seriously youve heard no gossip only that im likely to find you two at knifepoint one day the aura of amusement deepened well well so it worked i owe van a forfeit savil raised her eyebrows in surprise and opened her eyes again to catch tylendel looking at her with a smile lurking in the corners of his mouth how so demonchild hes been insulting me behind my back popinjay pecking mostly on my proclivities so if anything gets back to withen we decided i should find out about it and go for him if the insults got noticed great good gods she bit her lip to keep from laughing pot calling kettle oh my hope of the havens what were you planning on doing are you going to call him out id rather you didnt have at each other with anything sharp oh probably ill make a major confrontation with as many witnesses as possible but not with blades teacherlove hes too good for me and we figured he should lose so he gets the sympathy of his flock of doves barehanded we think wrestling we ii try to keep fists out if it as much as possible too we had some vague notion of trying it the next time it rains in the mud it should be lots of fun savil had to drop the mindlink for a moment until she got herself back under control lots of fun indeed great good gods both of them tussling in the open in front of everyone and no one guessing how much they re enjoying it demonchild i think ill put you in for envoy when i grant you your whites you have altogether too twisted a mind well doing it that way we can avoid the chance of hurting each other and ive already established that i go after people very directly poor van is going to have to decide which outfit of his im going to ruin though i intend to rip it to rags for verisimilitude savil nearly choked to death trying not to laugh at the mindpictures and overtones that came across with that last sending verisimilitude my behind you just want why savil the eyes across from her were wide with assumed innocence how could you think such a thing easy enough she replied her own mental tone so dry that it had a metallic taste given who ive got for a protege well well indeed lendel just a word of caution and i may be being reactionary but i dont like the way van is coming to lean on you for everything it isnt healthy he needs to learn how to depend on himself a little oh savil im serious its just a phase hes young and he needs so badly great good gods nobodys ever bothered to love him cept his sister after hes had me around for a bit and knows i wont vanish on him hell grow out of it lendel im not the expert on people that lancir is but in my experience people dont grow out of a habit of dependence she glanced at the timecandle ah weii just leave it at that all right keep it in mind and thats enough study for one night both of you to bed again the mental laughter why savil to sleep dammit tylendel nudged the other boy and closed the book then looked across the room at his mentor with that ironic halfsmile she knew so well lets pack it up for the night van he said quietly and of course teacher to sleep she mindheard then as they disappeared into their room eventually savil had forgotten all about the planned fight by the time a good soaking rain actually put in an appearance nearly a fortnight later she had reserved the work room for mardic and donni that afternoon for all that they were lifebonded they were having a tremendous difficulty in working together magically speaking donni had a tendency to rush into something at full tilt mardic was entirely the opposite holding reserves back until the very last moment and dithering about full commitment that meant that when they worked together their auras pulsed and had some serious weak spots and their shields never quite meshed savil was putting them through an exercise designed to force them to synchronize their energylevels and work as a unit rather than as an uneven team when someone pounded urgently on the door the union of energy fields disintegrated at the first knock dissipating with a pop into a shower of visible sparks and separating into the auras green for donni yellow for mardic surrounding each of her crestfallen students savil swore an oath sufficiently heated to blister paint she looked the couple over with othersight and swore another nearly as strong dammit their concentrations gone completely look at those auras pulse oh hellfires if this isnt important ill kill whoevers out there she banished the violet shield she had placed about the pair with an abrupt gesture and stalked to the door yanking it open and glaring at the agitated guard standing just outside yes she said with an edge to her voice that was sharp enough to shave with herald savil your nephew and your protege tylendel theyre fighting the man gulped stepping back involuntarily at the sight of her angry face tylendel put up a barrier and we cant get at them to break it up hes got your nephew down and were afraid he may do him true harm damn the word exploded from her as for one moment she thought that something had really happened between the pair and the fight was serious then she recalled the plan and almost ruined it for them all by laughing in the mans face she schooled her expression to the one she would have been wearing if this had been a genuine fight mouth tight and eyes narrowed in feigned anger show me she barked ill deal with this nonsense right now the guard scurried ahead of her down the hallway she followed at a neartrot wincing a little at the aches the rain had called up in the depths of her joints iii bet lendel put up the magebarrier to keep people from seeing that he and van arent really hitting each other she decided hastening her pace a bit as the guard pulled ahead and to keep folks from breaking up the fight too soon id better make a major scene over this or hell never forgive me there was no doubt of where the fight was taking place heraldproteges young courtiers bardtrainees and other assorted young people were clustered tightly around the door to the gardens on the southeast side of the palace all of them babbling like a pack of fools the guard pushed his way through them with no regard for rank or ceremony whatsoever savil followed behind him and peered out the door into the pouring rain the combatants were about fifty paces beyond the door in a spot beside the paved path where all the grass had been worn away there was indeed a magebarrier over the area where they were struggling a place that looked more like a pigwallow at this point the barrier and the rain were blurring the combatants badly enough that it was hard to see exactly what was going on vanyel was down on his back at least savil assumed it was vanyel since the current loser was slightly smaller and his hair was mostly dark under the mud tylendel was sitting on his chest and if savil hadnt known better shed have sworn he was strangling the younger boy you take that back you little bastard tylendel roared you take that back unless you want another pound of mud shoved down your throat savil steeled herself and barked in her best stopamobinfullcry voice a single word enough instantly the fighters froze savil strode out into the deluge her dignity somewhat diminished when her feet squelched instead of coming down firmly and the rain immediately plastered her hair to her skull sending tendrils of it straggling into her eyes and mouth nevertheless she reckoned she looked imposing enough since all the babbling behind her ceased as she reached the edge of tylendels magebarrier and stopped take it down trainee she said her tone so cold it could have turned the rain into snow tylendel scrambled to his feet and dismissed the barrier now that he could be seen clearly he truly looked as if hed been through the wars his hair was full of mud and straggling around his face in dirty coils one eye was turning black and starting to swell his lower lip was split and bleeding his tunic was torn and muddy and so were his breeches one of his boots had come unlaced and sagged around his ankle he wore a very untylendellike expression sullen and full of barelysmothered anger vanyel remained prone for several moments longer with his chest heaving as he gulped for air long enough that savil began to think he might really be hurt she breathed a little easier when he levered himself up out of the mud and got slowly to his feet he was in worse case than tylendel his tunic had been all but stripped from his body there wasnt much left of it and what there was hung in strips from his belt and his wrists he had several angrylooking scratches on his arms and chest and a split lip to match tylenders but more seriously he was favoring his right foot wincing in real pain when he had to put any weight on it he didnt move once hed gotten to his feet just stood with his hands clasped before him wearing an expression so like tylendels that savil began to be alarmed lendel she mindspoke layering the name with her anxiety and distress tylendels expression didnt change by so much as a twitch of an eyelid but the mindvoice was as cheerful and amused as his face was angry and sullen no fear teachermine its still going mostly as planned she sighed mentally with relief mostly well we couldn tpractice this much so we made some miscalculations van got me in the eye with his elbow we both managed to sock each other in the mouth somehow and i think i made him sprain his ankle when i tackled him hurry up and lecture us i cant keep a straight face much longer she straightened and looked down her long nose at both of them ignoring the water dripping off the end of it a fine thing she said acidly when i cant trust my protege and ward to conduct themselves like civilized adults in my absence what am i to do with you find you keepers tylendel made as if to say something but shrank under her icy glare the rain slowly washing the mud out of his hair trainee tylendel you should have known better you are a heraldintraining i expect you to act in accordance with the dignity and honor of our office i do not expect to find you thrashing about in the mud like a sixyearold brat with no manners and no sense no matter how much vanyel provoked you you should have come to me first not taken the matter into your own hands tylendel hung his head and mumbled something in the direction of the puddle around his feet louder trainee she snapped i cant hear you yes herald savil he repeated his voice harsh and full of suppressed emotion i was wrong go back to your quarters now make yourself presentable ill deal with you when im done with vanyel tylendel bowed slightly and without another word walked past her and through the crowd at the doorway savil didnt turn around to watch his progress but even above the steady beat of the rain she could hear the sound of the crowd parting behind her to let him through one or two in the group snickered a little but that was all she turned her daggergaze on vanyel who was glaring at her from under a wet comma of black hair that was obscuring one eye and you fine state of affairs this is she walked forward a bit and folded her arms trying not to shiver in the cold rain ive heard about those snide little comments of yours the backbiting and all the rest of it youve been picking at lendel ever since you arrived here young man and i wont have it vanyel raised his head glaring back at her with every bit of the arrogance hed ever shown hes nothing but a he outranks you young man and youd do well to remember that she snapped consider yourself confined to your quarters for the duration if i learn youve set one toot out of the suite when you arent at lessons ill ship you back to your father so fast the wind of your passing will tear the thatch from the roofs now march vanyel set his jaw and pivoted where he stood setting off toward savils suite through the rain taking the opposite course that tylendel had followed he was more than half staggering and it made savils ankle ache in sympathy to to see him struggling through the mud but she made no move to help him instead she stalked along behind him as if making certain that he reached his goal but once they had rounded the corner and were out of sight of the doorway she dropped her pose and her dignity and scrambled through the slippery grass to reach his side lean on me lad she said coming up beside him and pulling his arm over her shoulder ive been called an old stick before this i might as well act like one aunt thank the gods he gasped i thought wed never get out of sight he stumbled and nearly fell all of his weight suddenly landing on savil making her stagger please ive got to rest a minute gods above this hurts how bad is it she asked as he shivered beside her in the cold rain dont know he managed a wan grin hurts more than a thorn in the toe less than when i broke my arm that tell you anything hardly she snorted come on the sooner i get you inside the happier ill be and i hope my protege has the sense to think and not come running out to help the lights of savils windows were in sight and her heart sank for a moment when she did see someone running toward them through the rain then she saw a second silhouette beside the first and realized that it was not tylendel who was coming to help them in but mardic and donni the youngsters took over the task of supporting vanyel that left savil free to go on ahead of them for which she was truly grateful she was chilled right down to the bone and those bones were starting to ache rather persistently she stepped in through vanyels outer door almost as soon as shed stepped across the threshold she found herself enveloped in a warm blanket and practically carried into the common room it was tylendel of course he stayed with her just long enough to settle her in her favorite chair and put a mug of mulled wine in her hand then he was gone he was back again in a moment vanyels arm around his shoulder the latter hopping awkwardly beside him there was already a blanket waiting on the couch tylendel got vanyel bundled into it and pressed another mug of the wine into his hands mardic and donni piled in right behind them giggling shaking the rain out of their hair and heading straight for the kettle of wine on the hearth vanyel was more interested in his lovers black eye and swollen lip than the wine gods lendel i did not mean that he mourned reaching out hesitantly to touch the edge of the bruise oh lord and lady why do i have to be so clumsy oh you just fight like a girl tylendel teased all flying knees and elbows it was my own stupid fault for getting my face in the way its your ankle im worried about he started unlacing vanyels boot fighting the wet laces and swearing under his breath when they wouldnt cooperate im all ouch tylendel froze did i no vanyel said around clenched teeth just get that damned boot off before you have to cut it off but tylendel dithered over the task until mardic pushed him out of the way and took over getting the boot off with an abrupt yank that blanched vanyel to the color of pure beeswax he clutched tylendels hand while mardic examined the ankle pronounced it probably not broken and bound it up havens teacher mardic laughed rescuing his cup from donni and returning to sit at her feet across from savil were we as moonstruck as that gods i feel like im being smothered in syrup he nodded at the two on the couch each assuring the other that his own hurts were less than nothing and fussing over the others injuries for at least the first five or six months savil replied dryly after sipping her wine just as moonstruck and just as cloying and even more sentimental she raised her voice a bit you two might thank me certainly savil tylendel replied craning his head around if youd tell us what were thanking you for gods vanyel dont you ever listen im sorry aunt he said looking confused his hair still trailing over one eye my foot hurt so much i wasnt paying any attention it wasnt a real lecture after all she cast her eyes up to the ceiling give me strength i just confined you completely to the suite for as long as i care to enforce my decision you little ninny i just got you away from the girlgaggle and gave you orders to stay here indefinitely except for lessons youll be here waking and sleeping that includes taking meals here you did he said dazed i am you mean i can stay here with lendel and not arouse any suspicions she interrupted thats exactly what i mean fact of the matter is your damnfool father will probably be pleased to hear that you were she broke off seeing that she no longer had the attention of either of them across from her she heard mardic snicker she favored the lifebonded with a sardonic glance dont feel too smug she told them or ill start trotting out tales about you two yes savil mardic replied not in the least repentant whatever you say would you care for honey in that wine savil spared a glance back toward the couch tylendel was rebandaging vanyels ankle treating it as if it were as fragile as an insects wing she made a face i think not she replied weve got enough sweetness around here for one night tylendel looked up and stuck his tongue out at her while vanyel blushed savil chuckled and sat back in her chair well content with her world at least for the moment she thought taking another sip of spiced wine which is all any herald can reasonably hope for ill worry about tomorrow when tomorrow gets here seven tylendel sprawled in his favorite chair and watched vanyel restringing his lute sitting crosslegged on the bed candlelight reflected in a honeycolored curve along the round belly of the instrument is it time he wondered he plays for the girls but they dont matter he doesnt care if he plays well or badly for them will he play for someone he loves someone who does matter can he has he recovered enough only one way to find out though ashke he said quietly extending his little gift of empathy as far as it would go van lifted his head from his work he looked rather comical with the old strings dangling from his mouth like the feelers on a catfish mph he replied when you get woodlark in tune would you play for me vanyel froze tylendel felt the startlement and the ache and reacted to them please id like it vanyel took the strings out of his mouth and tylendel could sense his withdrawal why he asked bitterly his eyes shining wetly theres dozens better than i am right here at bardic why listen to a halfcrippled amateur tylendel restrained his natural reaction which was to go to him hold him ease his hurt that way that would ease it all right but it wouldnt cure it because you arent halfcrippled anymore he replied because you arent an amateur youre good the bards all say so but not good enough to be one of them vanyel turned away but not before tylendel saw tears in his eyes and felt the anguish thats not true he insisted gently look van its not that you arent good enough its that you just dont have the gift can a blind man paint vanyel just shook his head and tylendel could sense his further withdrawal its not the same thing he said tightly the blind man cant see a painting but theres nothing wrong with my ears tylendel searched for something that might reach this wounded corner of his beloved and finally found it ashke why do you think there are minstrels trained at bardic why do you think that people welcome minstrels when there are bards about hed asked that same question of breda who had all three bardic talents the gift the skill and the creativity her answer had been enlightening vanyel shook his head still tightly bound up inside himself because there arent enough bards to go around just like there arent enough heralds or healers wrong tylendel said firmly and i have this from breda there are times when the gift gets in the way of the music what vanyels head whipped around in startlement and tylendel saw the shine of tears on his cheek what do you mean by that just what i said now was the time to rise and go to vanyels side and tylendel did just that listen to me just what is the bardic gift hmm its the ability to make others feel the things you want them to through music but when a bard does that you cant keep your mind on the music can you you never really hear how beautiful it is youre too busy with what the bard is doing you never really hear it for itself and when you remember it you dont remember the music you remember the emotions theres another reason when the bard performs you put nothing of yourself into the listening but when a minstrel performs or a bard without the gift you get out of the music exactly what you put into thelistening he chuckled and reached for vanyels limp hands breda said that in some ways its a little like making love with a paid courtesan or with your lover your lover may not be as expert but the experience is a lot more genuine breda said that vanyel faltered in her cups yes he didnt add it had been here in savils quarters the evening shed tested and failed vanyel breda had a very soft heart beneath that bony chest shed not enjoyed destroying vanyels hopes even indirectly they do say that theres truth in the bottom of every wine bottle he paused and raised one eyebrow at his lover she also said that if you werent your fathers heir theyd snap you up so fast youd leave your boots behind she did he could feel vanyel uncoiling from around that lump of hurt she did he picked up the lute and put it back in vanyels hands and since my personal preference is not for courtesans however expert will you play for me just vanyel swallowed and finally met his eyes the hurt was still there but already fading just let me get her in tune to vanyel ashkevron from lord withen ashkevron greetings i have received good reports of you from herald savil except for the instance of your quarrel with her protege while i cannot condone your actions i can understand that it may be irritating to share the same roof with the young man you must keep your temper and not provoke him further as it is obvious that he cannot be relied upon to keep his i am also given to understand that you have abandoned your pretensions as a musician and relegated such nonsense to its proper place an amusing hobby no more i am pleased with this development it seems to me this is evidence of maturity and acceptance of your proper place in life and i have sent a small token of my approval inscribed by father leren benevy by my hand and seal lord withen ashkevron to lord withen ashkevron from vanyel ashkevron greetings i have received your letter and your token for which my thanks i am endeavoring to follow all of herald savils instructions to the best of my ability i have found her to be a wise and knowledgeable mentor and hope to better please her in the future by my hand vanyel ashkevron dearest son i pray with all my heart that this finds you well and that you were not hurt by that brutal boy i feared that something of this nature would occur from the instant your father told me of this foolish scheme and have had dark and fell dreams from the moment you departed savil is plainly not to be relied upon to keep her creatures in order i pray you do not provoke the barbarian further lam endeavoring to persuade your father to fetch you home again but thus far it is all in were not enough i have been visited with a further grief my maid melenna has been rendered with child and by your brother mekeal so she claims and so mekeal admits your father is no help he seems to think it is all very amusing indeed i am at my wits end and i know not what to do but even in my extremity i have not forgotten my beloved child nor that your birthday is this very day i enclose a small token all that i could manage and not nearly your desert i beg you that if you are in need that you will tell me at once i shall manage something more from your father hardhearted as he is your loving mother lady treesa ileana brendywhinashkevron purple ink tylendel said incredulously looking over vanyel s shoulder am i really seeing purple ink and pink paper costs a fortune and its all shell use vanyel answered absently pondering how to reply without setting his mother off again the pink page lay on the blotter of the desk its very existence a maternal accusation that he hadnt written since he arrived here beside it were two piles of silver coins absolutely equal in value one reward for beating up a pervert one consolation for getting beaten up by a pervert he sighed gods there are times i wish i was an orphan may i tylendel asked vanyel shrugged go ahead youll encounter her eventually im sure you ought to know what shes like tylendel worked his way through the ornamented and scrolled calligraphy and gave it back to vanyel with a grimace that said more than words could have you think this is bad you should see the letters she writes to friends or worse people she thinks have slighted her three four and five pages purple ink and tearblotches and everything capitalized he sighed again and appalling grammar when she gets really hysterical she goes into formal mode and she cannot seem to keep her thees and thous straight he contemplated the letter for a moment whats really awful she talks like that too tylende laughed threw himself down on the bed and got back to the book hed been reading dear mother i really am all right please dont worry about me worry about yourself if you dont take care of yourself if you let your fine sensibilities get the better of you youii make yourself ill savil is quite kind and the problems i had with tylendel have been taken care of every rumor that comes out of this court is an exaggeration at best and an outright lie at worst so pay no attention to what your friends are telling you i am sorry to hear about melenna this must be a terrible burden for you your present was very kind and very much appreciated and for in excess of my needs i love you and i think about you often be well vanyel dear vanyel what in havens is going on are you all right if its unbearable for the gods sake let me know and ill lead the seven corey swordmaids to your rescue theyre dying to play avenging angels although given their figures its more like avenging angles all my love lissa vanyel laughed aloud and passed the note to tylendel tylendel grinned broadly and handed it back to him now this one i like whats my chances of meeting her pretty good vanyel replied stretching once the secrets out about us father will disinherit me mother will have vapors and lissa will show up sword in hand to defend me from fathers wrath shes gotten a lot spunkier since she went over to the coreys to foster lord trevor has just about promised her a commission in the guard which he can give her since hes in charge of recruitment for the guard tylendel said thoughtfully is that your last letter one more after this dearest lissa dont worry its all right im fine and im happier than ive been in my life here savil is on my side against father and some of what you ve been hearing is to keep him happy trust me it really is all right i love you and i miss you van to vanyel ashkevron from evan leshara greetings i believe we have mutual interests and i would be honored and pleased if we could meet to discuss them i am at your disposal any evening by my hand and seal evan leshara lendel vanyel said slowly sorely puzzled by this last note which had been delivered to the suite by a page that very afternoon who is evan leshara tylendel paced the confines of the bedroom as restless as a caged wolf savil thought both of them were in here he hadnt told her that vanyel had slipped his leash to go see what evan leshara wanted he glanced over at the timecandle it hadnt burned down any since the last time hed looked at it i shouldnt have let him go if leshara figures out the fight was all a ruse up and back up and back it was damned hot for an autumn night or was it being on edge that was making him sweat his scalp prickled and he felt a headache beginning just under his right eye shadows cast by the light of the timecandle danced and flickered shrank and grew if he figures out the game were playing hell be able to use blackmail on van against me and me against staven oh gods i shouldnt have let him go i should have told him to ignore lesharas invitation i should have i the creak of the garden door broke into his worries and his tensions evaporated when vanyel slipped in from the darkness and latched the door behind himself ashke tylendel began then hesitated seeing the troubled expression in vanyels eyes hes a damned persuasive man this leshara vanyel said softly sitting himself in the chair in front of the cold fireplace thats why hes here tylendel replied grimly its the leshara countermove to my being here since they cant buy into the heralds theyve sent the one of their kin with the sweetest tongue to get the ear of the queen if he can he says hes got it he said a lot of things lendel there was an awful lot of what he said that made sense of course there was tylendel interrupted ill be willing to bet that half of what he told you was the absolute truth even by my standards its the way he said it the context and what he was prompting you to infer from what he told you that counts you ought to know yourself from what youve been writing home that the best possible lie is to tell only the truth just not all of it but lendel vanyel still looked uncertain lendel he says his people have been willing to settle for months now a settlement the queen approves and yours refuse to go along with it he didnt tell you what that plan was did he vanyel shook his head to marry my thirtyyearold maidencousin whos never been outside of a cloister to a fiftyyearold lecher take staven out of being lord holder and put her in he said savagely which effectively means putting him in since theres no way shed ever be able to stand up to him shed dry up and blow away the first time he spoke harshly to her thats the leshara notion of an equitable settlement he glared at vanyel angry and a little hurt that vanyel would even consider taking evan lesharas word as the whole truth hes using the fact that stavens only seventeen as a way to imply that hes incompetent too young to make any kind of rational decisions and a lot of the powers at court being old goats themselves are buying into the idea after all seventeens only old enough to be told you have to go fight and die for something its not old enough to have any say in the matter vanyels eyes had gotten very distressed and he had shrunk back into the chair as far as he could lendel he faltered i didnt mean i wasnt doubting you tylendel gave himself a mental kick in the posterior for upsetting him ashke i didnt mean to shout at you he said kneeling beside the chair and putting one hand on vanyels knee im sorry im just so damned frustrated he can say any damned thing he wants and because im a heraldtrainee i cant even refute him it makes me a little crazy sometimes vanyel brightened and put his hand over ty lenders thats all right i know how you feel like me and father and jervis something like it lendel would you vanyel hesitated would you tell me your side tylendel took a deep breath if i do ill be breaking a promise i made to savil not to get you involved im already involved i why thats what i really want to know whats keeping this thing going something wester leshara did tylendel replied fighting down the urge to get up grab a horse and ride out to strangle wester with his bare hands the whitehot rage that always filled him whenever he called that particular memory up was very hard to control savil says i have to be absolutely fair so to be absolutely fair ill tell you that this was in retaliation for a raid that accidentally killed his youngest son we our people went in to stampede his cattle the boy fell off his horse and wound up under their hooves but i dont think that excuses what wester did which was my father had just died he hired some kind of twocopper conjuror to convince mother that fathers ghost wanted to speak with her she wasnt very stable which wester was damned well aware of and this pushed her over the edge we got rid of the charlatan but not before hed gotten her convinced that if she found just the right formula shed be able to communicate with fathers spirit she started taking all manner of potions trying to see him finally she did see him she ate black angel mushrooms he did not add that he and staven had been the ones to find her vanyel looked sick enough tylendel got a lid on his anger and changed the subject what did the bastard want anyway he wanted me to let him know any time i heard anything about you or your family and he wanted me to talk my father round to his side what did you tell him vanyel grimaced i guess i was playing the same game of telling not all of the truth i told him that i heard more about your people directly from you than i heard casually and let him draw his own conclusions tylendel relaxed and chuckled vanyel brightened a little more what about your father i told him the truth that i had been sent here as punishment because i wouldnt toe the line at home and that father would take advice from a halfwit before hed take it from me he was rather disappointed now tylendel laughed and hugged him ashke ashke you couldnt have done better if id given you a script so i did all right now vanyel was fairly glowing you did better than all right gods he thought seeing vanyel so elated he fades like an unwatered flower when he thinks im angry at him and now this youd have thought id offered him a bards laurel does my opinion mean so much to him do i mean so much to him the thought was a sobering one and it was followed inevitably by another maybe savil s right he said he wants to stay in touch with me anyway just in case i hear something i told him that was all right with me in fact i acted pretty eager about it he turned his head a little to one side and offered tentatively i thought we could sort of tell him what we wanted him to hear ha we not you no savils not right he depends on me but i depend on him and if hes leaning on me a little well that isnt going to hurt anyone hes just not usedto making decisions on his own thats all thats perfect he said leaning on the arm of the chair absolutely perfect now after facing off the dragon for me oh noble warrior in what way can i ever reward you he batted his eyelashes at vanyel who laughed and drew himself up as if he sat in a throne ill do anything oh vanyel replied archly anything savil told me something funny today tylendel murmured quietly into vanyels ear his voice roused vanyel out of the sleepy halfdream hed been in ever since he and tylendel had settled into their favorite spot in all of the field it was the first time either of them had broken the silence since theyd entered the pine copse the suite had seemed far too stuffy for the warm autumnal evening even with all the windows open and vanyel had scarcely left it since theyd staged their fight except for lessons and the obligatory evenings with evan leshara to feed him misinformation and the appearances he had to make at court to keep his circle of admirers happy and deceived it was moondark and the chance of anyone seeing them heading out into companions field together was practically nonexistent so when vanyel had looked up from his religions text and tentatively suggested a walk tylendel had shut his own book and flung the garden door open with a mocking bow and a real grin it was inevitable that gala should join them when they crossed the river vanyel had come to take her presence for granted on the precious few joint excursions theyd judged safe from detection it was equally inevitable that they should seek their pine grove it drew them as no other place within walking distance could it was blacker than sunsingers despair beneath the branches on this moonless night but tyiendel had made a tiny magelight once theyd gotten past the first line of trees and were safely out of sight theyd just rambled for a long time from one end of the peaceful grove to the other and back again not speaking but not needing to not touching either but again not needing to it wasnt until theyd walked out the last of their endoftheday tensions that theyd finally decided to settle next to the oldest tree in the grove and just relax in silence gala provided a willing backrest and the two of them leaned up against her soft warmth with vanyel resting his head on tylendels shoulder tyiendel had put out the magelight leaving them in neartotal darkness there were still a few crickets that hadnt been killed by the first frost calling from a dozen different directions and once vanyel had heard geese crying by high overhead but other than that and the sigh of galas breathing they might have been the only two living creatures in an endlessly empty pinefragrant universe which was exactly the way vanyel wanted it this continual charade of theirs was proving to be both harder and easier than hed thought it would easier because he was no longer trying to block out his feelings no longer trying to convince himself that he didnt need anyone easier because the arrogant pose the flirtation games were no longer anything more than an elaborate set of games but harder because one single slip one hint getting back to withen of what was really going on and hed lose everything that was making his life something more than a burden to be endured and harder because of the doublegame he was playing with leshara one slip there and leshara would know what was really going on and it would be childs play for him to use that knowledge as a doubleweapon against vanyel and tylendel and there was no way of knowing how much or how little evan leshara believed out of all the things vanyel was telling him all he could do was trust that lendel knew enough to seed the falsehoods with exactly the right amount of truth because he certainly didnt know enough the pretense was a constant drain on his emotional energy and it wasnt often that he felt safe enough to forget and enjoy the moment the insecurity of the situation was the first thing on his mind when waking and the last when going to sleep that wasnt the only strain since the fight hed been virtually ostracized by the bards heralds and all their trainees tylendel was somewhat to his own surprise highlyregarded among the working members of queen elspeths high court but that meant that vanyel was bearing the burden of their scorn for provoking the fight and while his teachers remained within the bounds of polite civility they were making no secret of their disdain lessons had become ordeals and only tylendels insistence that he was going to have to continue if the charade was going to work had kept vanyel persisting in the face of the hostility he was facing the only one of his teachers that seemed oblivious to the whole mess was lord oden possibly because the lordmarshalls secondincommand was pretty well indifferent to anything not involving the martial arts vanyel had ample occasion to reflect on the irony that his situation was now precisely the opposite of what he had endured at forst reach there hed been the pet of his tutors except for the armsmaster and despised by everyone his own age here discounting the trainees his peers were fawning on him but his teachers were doing their icily gracious best to get him to give up and drop out of their lessons except for his armsmaster it was not his imagination that they were being harder on him than the others being lessoned mardic was in his religions group now and had confirmed his suspicions so what did savil say he replied closing his weary eyes and shifting a bit so that he wasnt resting so much of his weight on tylendels arm tylendel responded by holding him a little closer that she cant understand why we havent had at least one fight tylendel said laughing a little she says were sickening she has a point vanyel conceded with a ghost of a chuckle we are a bit she told me she cant understand how we stay so dotingly devoted to each other she says we act like a couple of spaniels you know kick em and they just come back begging to be kicked again only worse because we arent kicking each other she just doesnt realize vanyel said sobered by a moment of introspection lendel there is no way id fight with you when any moment my father might find out about us and pull me home i couldnt bear the idea of our last words being angry ones i have to make every moment we have together a good memory dont let it eat at you tylendel interrupted youre sixteen now im seventeen its only two years before youre of age well be all right so long as you can keep your end of things going with lord evan vanyel sighed gods gods two years it seems like forever it seems like its been years already i just cant imagine coming to the end of this tylendel stroked his hair his hand as light as a breath of wind youll manage ashke youre stronger than you think i sometimes think youre stronger than i am i doubt i could be dealing successfully with the plate youve been handed and whether or not you believe this i think i depend as much on you as you do on me gala says so she does vanyels voice rose with his surprise really frequently he sighed and vanyel wondered why there were times when it seemed that there were some serious points of disagreement between gala and her chosen usually involving tylendels tacit and unshakable support of his twin vanyel personally couldnt see what all the fuss was about even if lendel hadnt had the close bond he did with staven even if wester leshara hadnt connived the painful suicide of lenders mother it would still have been his duty to support staven even though vanyel himself had a rather bitter and uncomfortable relationship with his own brother mekeal if it came to an interhouse confrontation there was no doubt in his mind where he would stand and he knew mekeal was likely to feel the same and given how much tylendel owed to his brother for supporting him in the face of all opposition well vanyel couldnt see what else he could do in all decency and honor but then there was a great deal about all this herald business he didnt understand for instance lendel if we make it that far all the way to when you get your whites if dont think in terms of if love tylendel chided softly it may not be easy but well make it havens i should talk about not being easy when its you that is having to take the worse share on your shoulders but ill help you ill help you all i can and we will see this through to the other side well whats going to happen with us when you get your whites and im of age what then there was a long pause and tylendels hand stopped moving resting on the back of his neck thats the easy part really first thing you make up your mind about exactly what you want to do about lord withen i mean you could flat tell him about us or you could just let him find out whichever way you want at that point the worst he could do is disown you and you know everything i have is yours for the asking the circle wont stint me ill have more than enough to support two he probably will disown me vanyel said bitterly which will mean ill have to ask lendel so were partners arent we it wont be charity ashke itll be sharing vanyel squelched the automatic retort that it would still feel like charity all right assume ive told my father and im free to do what i want then what after that savil will turn the lovebirds over to another herald and take me us out on a field assignment us because obviously i wont go without you savil knows that so its a given thats a year or thereabouts but then i dont know im a heraldmage trainee they usually give us permanent positions rather than having us ride circuit like the straight heralds do theyll probably put me either here at haven or out along the border at the places where magic is needed down by white foal pass around the edge of the pelagirs why thats something that has me baffled why vanyel asked i mean why are you going to do what somebody else wants why do you have to go where they say who are they anyway they thats the heraldic circle queens own seneschals herald lordmarshals herald the speaker for the heralds with trainees thats savil the speaker for the heraldmages and the speaker for the heralds on circuit and the queen of course and the heir theyre the ones who decide where heralds and heraldmages will serve and what theyll do thats thats just the way it is van i dont understand you now there was hurt in tylendels voice dont you want to go with me oh gods vanyel groped for tylendels free hand and held it tightly lendel i didnt mean that id rather lose my arms and legs than lose you ill go wherever you go and glad to im just trying to get all this to make sense why are you doing this going where they tell you doing what they tell you to do why is this herald stuff so important to you vanyel could almost feel tylendel fumbling after the right words its i dont know its a kind of hunger i cant help it ive got these abilities these gifts and i cant not use them i couldnt sit here knowing that there were people out there who need exactly the kind of help i can give them and not make the effort to find them and take care of them its like backing staven its just something i could not even see myself not doing i cant explain it van i cant i have to or or im not me anymore vanyel just shook his head a little all right ill accept that but i still cant really grasp it he confessed giving up everything to play nursemaid to a pack of people you dont even know wont you have any life of your own who are these hypothetical people that need you that youre sacrificing your whole life for them huh tylendel said you sound just like stav suddenly he went rigid staven he whispered stav then his entire body convulsed as he screamed stavens name and the night erupted into chaos around them the scream went on and on filling the entire universe with pain and loss an unbearable pressure rose around them and shattered all in the moment the eternity of that scream the still air churned and began pummeling them with fists of heat and turbulence gala scrambled to her feet vanyel caught and held his lover trying to support him as he thrashed in uncontrolled spasms tylendels forehead cracked against the bridge of his nose he saw stars and tasted blood but gritted his teeth against the pain and held on a galeforce wind sprang up out of the confusion and chaos it went howling about them moving outward in a spiral nearly tearing the clothes from vanyels body as it passed tylendel was glowing angry red light pulsed around him in it vanyel could see his face set in a mask of madness his teeth were clenched in a grimace of pain and there was no sense in his eyes no sign of intelligence the trees closest to them literally exploded in a shower of splinters those farther away spasmed in convulsions much like tylendels before they began tearing them selves apart the wind picked up in strength trees farther away began thrashing and the wind spiraled outward a little farther than it had a moment before the light surrounding tylendel and now vanyel throbbed ebbing and strengthening with each paroxysm of his body and something frighteningly like lightning was crackling off the edges of that glow striking at random all about them where it hit the effect was exactly like natural lightning trees split and the ground was scorched and pitted the wind was scouring the earth bare making projectiles of dead needles and bits of wood even the ground was shuddering heaving like a horse trying to throw a rider vanyel held tylendel as tightly as he could looking wildly about for gala finally he saw her off on the edge of the circle of chaos she too was glowing bluely the edge of her glow seemed to be deflecting the debris and the lightning but it looked as if she was unable to do anything not that she wasnt trying she stretched her neck out toward her chosen her eyes bright and terrible with distress but all she seemed able to do was shield herself she couldnt even get near them gala vanyel shouted over the screaming of the wind restraining tylendel as his lover spasmed in another convulsion get help get savil he couldnt think if gala were helpless to do anything savil was the only possible source of aid she shook her head tried to force her way through the gale toward them but was actually pushed back by whatever force was controlling the raging wind she tried twice more twice more was shoved farther back as the circle of destruction grew finally she reared screamed like a terrified human and pivoted on her hind feet then sprang off into the darkness vanyel closed his eyes and clasped tylendel against his chest trying to protect him from the wind trying to keep him from hurting himself as he continued to convulse he was well beyond fear his mind numb his mouth dry his heart pounding praying for an end to this praying for help he couldnt think couldnt move all he could do was stay lendel im here he thought as hard as he could hoping somehow that tylendel would hear him lendel come back to me the trainee spasmed once more his back arcing and suddenly it was over the light vanished and with it the wind the ground settled and there was nothing but a deadly silence hollow darkness and the weight of his lovers unmoving body in vanyels arms lendel he shook tylendels shoulders and bit back a moan when he got no response oh gods tylendel was still breathing but it was strange shallow breathing and the trainees skin was clammy and almost cold a moment later savil and two other heralds came pounding up on their companions magelights glowing over their heads by their light vanyel could see that tylendel was limp and completely unconscious his head lolling back his eyes rolled up under halfopen lids he swallowed down fear as savil slid off kellans back without waiting for her to come to a full stop landing heavily and stumbling to them as the light of the pulsing balls strengthened vanyel saw with shock that there was not so much as a single pine seedling left standing in what had been a healthy grove of trees i ii dddont know what hhhappened he stuttered as savil went to her knees beside them pulled open tylendels eyelids and checked his pulse her face gray and grim in the blue light of her globe the other two heralds dismounted slowly looking about them at the destruction with expressionless faces he was aaall right one minute and then aunt savil please i dddidnt do this tttto him did i no lad she said absently jaysen come over here and confirm will you the taller of the two heralds knelt beside savil and made the same examination she had backlash shock he said succinctly bad best thing we can do for him is get him in a bed and put someone he trusts with him what i thought she replied getting to her feet and motioning to the older herald to come help jaysen take up the unconscious trainee no vanyel it had nothing to do with you she finally looked at him did you know your nose is broken it is he replied mind still fogged with fear for tylendel it is hold still jaysens got just about enough of the healing gift to do something the tall bleachedlooking herald freed a hand from his task just long enough to touch his face there was an odd tugging sensation and a flash of pain that sent him blind for a moment then numbness savil looked him over briefly good enough itll hurt like hell for the next few days but itll heal up straight well wash the blood off your face later jaysen rolf get lendel back to my quarters this isnt anything a healers going to be able to treat well take care of him ourselves aunt please what happened he staggered to his feet holding tylendels hand tightly as the other two picked him up still limp as a broken doll and showing no signs of consciousness he was not willing to let go until he knew what was wrong savil gently loosed his fingers from their grip if what we got from gala is right the moment he went mad is the moment someone assassinated his twin she said angrily you know the bond he had with staven vanyel nodded and his whole face throbbed he felt it felt the death knew what had happened lost all control lost his mind for a while like the fits he used to have only i think worse this time now hes depleted himself down to next to nothing his whole bodys in collapse from the energies he put through it his minds in trauma from stavens death thats backlash shock vanyelwasnt sure he understood but nodded anyway savils face darkened to pure rage may all the gods damn those fools and their feuding death after death and still they arent satisfied van our job is to see we dont lose tylendel as well lose him vanyels voice broke and he looked wildly after the heralds and their unconscious burden oh no oh gods aunt tell me what to do i cant let him i dont intend to let him die she interrupted him pushing him after the other heralds the masquerade has been canceled and to hell with what your father finds out ill deal with withen myself and ill keep you here if i have to get the queens order to do it you go with them and dont you leave him no matter what happens savil bit her lip and gave vanyel another push when he looked at her with a fear that held him nearly paralyzed go go on he needs you lad like hes never needed anyone before youre my only hope of getting him through this sane the two heralds that savil had called jaysen and rolf got tylendel stripped and into bed without the trainee giving any sign of returning consciousness vanyel hovered at the edge of the room his hands clenched his face throbbing and feeling as if it were nearly as white as tylendels when they left after giving him more than one dubious and curious glance he installed himself in a chair at tylendels side took his lovers limp cold hand in his own and refused to be moved he stayed there for the rest of the night unable to sleep unable to even think very clearly tylendel looked ghastly his skin had gone transparent and waxy there was no muscle tone in die hand vanyel held and the only thing showing he was alive was the shallow movement of his chest as he breathed savil looked in once or twice during the night but said nothing mardic came in at dawn to try to persuade him to get some rest but vanyel only shook his head stubbornly he would not he could not rest until he knew that tylendel would be all right savil left for a council session probably dealing with the feud right after sunrise with some reluctance mardic and donni departed for their lessons a couple of candlemarks later when mardic failed to convince vanyel to rest donni had tried to talk him into some food hed refused that as well suspecting that with all the best intentions in the world she might have slipped something into it to make him sleep lendel theyve gone he said when he heard the door open and close just to have some other sound in the room besides tylendels breathing its just you and me lendel you have to come back please i need you lendel he laughed right on the edge of hysteria look you know yourself that im too far behind on my history for mardic to help me he thought maybe he saw a flicker of response his heart leapt and he continued talking coaxing reciting bits of tylendels favorite poems anything to bring him out of that unnatural sleep he talked until his mouth and throat were dry talked his voice into a harsh croak left just long enough to get water and returned to begin the monologue again he lost track of what he was saying somewhere around midafternoon he was vaguely aware of someone checking on them but ignored the other presences to keep up the flow of words for by afternoon there was no doubt there was some change going on in tylendels condition and for the better he didnt know if it was the talking that was doing it but he couldnt take any chances he just kept holding to tylendels hand saying anything that came into his head however foolishsounding sunset arrived turning the river beyond the windows briefly to a sword of flame the light faded the room darkened and still he refused to move savil came in long enough to light the candles and whisper something that he was doing the right thing he thought he wasnt sure he didnt care his whole world had narrowed to the white face resting on the pillow and the slowly warming hand in his his eyes grew heavy and his whole body ached and his voice had thinned down to a whisper not even he could make out he finally put his head down on his arms intending to just rest for a moment and woke feeling a hand tentatively caressing his hair he started jerking his head up off the coverlet making his face pulse with pain tyiendel regarded him out of blueringed weary eyes eyes so full of anguish and loss that vanyel nearly started weeping i heard you he whispered i heard you i just didnt have the strength to answer van staven his face crumpled and vanyel slid oif the chair and onto the side of the bed talking him into his arms and holding him as tightly as he could supporting him against his shoulder giving him what little comfort his presence would give tylendels body shook with sobs and he clung to vanyel as to the only source of consolation left to him in the entire world and vanyel wept with him they finally fell asleep like that true sleep not the state of shock tyiendel had been in vanyel still fully clothed and sprawled between his chair and the side of the bed tylendel clinging to him like a heartbroken child eat vanyel ordered setting the tray down in tylendels blanketcovered lap tylendel looked nauseated and shook his head cant he whispered hoarsely you mean wont vanyel retorted almost as hoarsely trying to ignore the fact that talking made the whole of his face ache youve gone all day without food savil says if you dont get something down youll go into backlash shock again i didnt spend all that time talking you out to have you drop back in again now eat dammit he crossed his arms over his chest and glared down at tylendel the trainee eased a little higher up on the pillows supporting him in a sitting position and tried to shove the tray away unfortunately he was so weak he couldnt even lift it he just moved it a palmlength away vanyel put it back precisely where he had placed it the first time tylendel gave the perfectly good soup on the tray a look that would have been better bestowed on a bowl of pig swill but picked up the spoon anyway he swallowed the first spoonful with the air of someone who expects what hes just eaten to make a precipitate reappearance but when nothing happened gingerly ventured a second mouthful and a third vanyel sat warily on the edge of the bed careful not to overset the tray between them there was something very different about tylendel since hed reawakened something secretive but at the same time impassioned he could sense it in every word theyd exchanged he thought he knew what it was but he wanted to be sure theyre afraid im going to go mad you know tylendel whispered in a matteroffact tone when he was about halfway through the bowl i know vanyel replied just as matteroffactly sensing that the secret was about to be revealed thats why they have me here are you tylendel looked up from his meal and there was that strange burning something vanyel had felt searing sullenly at the back of his eyes they might think so van youve got to help me you didnt have to ask vanyel replied soberly tell me what you want and ill get it for you vengeance the thing at the back of his eyes flared for a moment before subsiding into halfhidden secretive smoldering again vanyel nodded this was rather what he had expected if tylendel wanted revenge tell me if i can do it i will tylendel slumped back on the pillows piled behind him his head tilted back a little his eyes closed his features gone slack with relief oh gods van i thought eat vanyel growled ive told you before this that i understand even if savil doesnt the only question ive got is how you think two halfgrown halftrained younglings are going to get revenge on people who live a good fortnight away by fast horse i assume youve got an answer for that problem tylendel opened his eyes and nodded soberly but the spoon was still lying in the bowl of soup where hed left it and vanyel was concentrating on the more immediate goal of getting him back on his feet hed worry about this plan when tylendel was in shape to execute it and not before dammit lendel if you dont eat i wont help you tylendel started guiltily and leaned forward again to finish his meal vanyel stole his mug long enough to get a sip of wine his face hurt as badly as it looked and when hed taken one glance in the mirror hed had to look away again his circle of admirers would have little to sigh over at the moment he looked like he was wearing a blackandblue domino mask and a putty nose and he hurt gods he hurt the only reason hed slept at all once hed comforted tylendel last night was because hed been utterly utterly exhausted did i do that tylendel asked softly finally looking at his face as he scraped the last spoonful of soup from the bottom of the bowl vanyel nodded seeing no reason to deny it you werent exactly yourself he said taking the tray away and stretching across tylendel to put it on the table beside the bed oh gods van im sorry the smothered fury faded from tylendels eyes for a moment and was replaced by concern as he reached in the direction of vanyels nose the concern was replaced by hurt as vanyel winced away touch me anywhere but there it hurts bloody awful and it wasnt your fault all right to counteract that flash of hurt in tylendels eyes he moved closer close enough to give lendel a quick hug before taking his hand in both his own now you want to talk i think maybe its my turn to listen the deeplyburied fire returned warring with anguish in his expression that link between staven and me it was different from what they think most of the time distance matters in a link like that distance makes it weaker it never did for us but savil thought it did and i let her go on thinking that she would have been on me to break it otherwise he tensed and closed his eyes vanyel held his hand a little more tightly all i ever had to do was think about him for him to be with me it was the same for him they the leshara they ambushed him killed his escort killed him and it wasnt just an assassination van they used magic vanyel felt his mouth drop open they what how how could a herald it wasnt a herald theyve hired a mage from outkingdom they turned some things loose on the holding magic monsters maybe from the pelagirs staven went after them with an escort but when he got there they were gone he must have spent all day trying to track them down and just exhausting himself the fighters and their horses thats when the mage brought them back and ambushed staven with them tylendels eyes were horrible like he was looking into hell these tilings they hurt him before they killed him hurt him awfully on purpose on their masters orders i think on lesharas orders i cant tell you he gripped vanyels hand so tightly that both their hands went white and his voice quavered he knew i was there with him he knew it the moment i linked thank the gods he knew he wasnt alone but the last thing the very last thing he did was to beg me plead with me to pay them back his eyes opened and they no longer smoldered they flamed with fury and pain i promised him van i promised him those bastards killed staven but they wont get away with it vanyel met that fury and bowed before it i told you lendel he replied quietly just ask oh love the voice broke on a sob and vanyel looked up to see tears trickling down tylendels cheek i shouldnt get you into this gods i shouldnt it isnt fair it isnt right youve got no stake in this you told me yourself that were partners that whatever you had id share vanyel replied as forcefully as he could that means the bad as well as the good by my way of thinking now it was his turn to fumble in the drawer of the bedside table for a handkerchief here he said pressing it into tylendels hand now tell me what you want me to do tylendel scrubbed the tears away his hand shaking we cant let gala know what were doing shed try to stop me i can block her from knowing ive already blocked her from knowing about the link to staven ill play sick you are sick look at your hand shake tylendel looked at the trembling of his hands with a certain amount of surprise sicker then too sick to do anything but lie here what i need you to do is to sneak into savils room and get me two books theyre proscribed nobody except very highlevel heraldmages are even supposed to know they exist and savil is one of only three here at haven who have copies vanyel felt stirrings of misgiving in that case wont they be locked up the corner of tylendels mouth twitched oh they are shes got them under protections but the protections dont work against someone with no magegift what vanyels jaw dropped again margret has to get in there and clean so savil only put up a protection against someone with a magegift touching them that way margret can handle them and put them away if she leaves them out by accident she figured nobody without the gift would ever know what to look for so you can get them even though i cant now vanyel asked dubiously tylendel shook his head no i cant cant handle much of anything right now later he choked and whispered oh gods staven his breath caught again and this time he couldnt control himself he dissolved into hopeless sobbing and vanyel turned his attention instantly from plans of revenge to comfort youll have to turn the pages tylendel told him looking down at the plain blackbound book lying on the coverlet between them i dont dare touch them vanyel shrugged and obliged opening the ordinarylooking book to the first page the ruse had worked admirably well tylendel had feigned a far greater weakness than he actually felt and all savil had shown was simple concern that he rest as much as possible she hadnt evidenced any signs that she thought his recovery was taking overlong she hadnt even brought in a healer when vanyel had tentatively suggested as a test that tylendel didnt seem to be improving that much backlash is a nasty thing lad shed said with a sigh takes weeks to bounce back from it months sometimes i didnt expect him to come out of this as well as he did and i think perhaps ive got you to thank for it vanyel had blushed and mumbled something deprecating savil had ruffled his hair and told him to get back to his charge and not be an idiot in a way hed felt a bit guilty at that moment knowing what he knew knowing that they were plotting something she wouldnt have permitted but she couldnt possibly understand he told himself for the hundredth time she couldnt possibly she cut her family ties long ago and they were never that strong to begin with from time to time the strength of tylendels desire for revenge frightened him a little but he told himself that it was tylendel who was within his rights in this and when the thought occurred that his lover had grown to be obsessed with his revenge he dismissed the thought as unworthy unworthy of lendel of staven this wasnt revenge it was justice certainly the heralds hadnt made any move toward dealing with the leshara this afternoon savil had scheduled donni and mardic for the work room and threatened murder on anyone who interrupted her this time with the coast thus completely cleared vanyel had slipped into her room the books so tylendel had told him would be in a small bookcase built into the wall beside the door that led to her own work room hed felt a chill of apprehension when hed found the two volumes tylendel wanted on the top shelf hed reached for them expecting any moment to be flung across the room or fried by a lightning bolt but nothing had happened hed returned to the bedroom where tylendel waited tucked up in bed with pen and paper he slipped in furtively clutching the books to his chest and shutting the door behind him tylendels fierce look of joy as he placed the books on the coverlet sent a shiver down his spine that he told himself was a thrill of accomplishment what are you looking for he asked curiously turning the pages slowly tylendel nodding to signal when he should two spells we dont use spells a lot but that doesnt mean they dont work tylendel said absently they do and they work really well for somebody with a magegift as strong as the one ive got savil says i can pull energy out of rocks well most of us cant so thats why we dont use spells much the first one i want is something called a gate itll let us cover that distance from here to the leshara lands in under an hour you have got to be joking vanyel replied in disbelief ive never heard of anything like that heraldmages would rather that people didnt know they could do that really only the best of them can savil can and she said once that i should be able to and mardic and donni if they ever learn how to work together most of the ones that can wont if theyre on their own thats because to do it you need a lot of energy it takes everything a mage has and then whats he going to do when he gets where he wants to go good point what are you going to do im going to borrow your energy if youll let me tylendel faltered and looked up from the book in entreaty vanyel firmed his chin what do you mean if of course you can borrow it what other good am i going to do gods ashke ashke i dont deserve you tylendel said softly halfsmiling his voice shaking in a way that told vanyel he was on the verge of tears again its the other way around love vanyel replied cutting him off who was it kept me from killing myself by inches who showed me what happiness was about who loves me when nobody else does hmm who blacked your eyes broke your nose and nearly fractured your ankle well that proves it doesnt it vanyel retorted trying to make a feeble joke they say if you dont hurt you dont love tylendel shook his head i gods dont let me go all to pieces again vsaiyelashke i could never hope to do this without you theres no one else that i would trust in this that could help me with a gatespell and van i should warn you youre going to feel damn seedy afterward like youve had a case of backlash to match mine can you borrow this stuff vanyel interrupted dubiously i mean i dont have any magegifts or anything not active youve got something youve got the potential but its locked i wouldnt have known but i think were linking a little on a deeper level than savil and i have or even gala and i its more like what i had with my twin it isnt conscious but i know you know when im unhappy vanyel finished for him thoughtfully and other things uhhuh i think youre right i thought it might just be because im worried about you but it seems to be going farther than that like last night when i woke you up before youd barely started to nightmare tylendel nodded so i think were linking i think it happened some time between when i started the fit and when i came out of the backlash coma i can feel something in you something very deep but very strong thats when i thought about the gatespell and i used othersight on you i sort of felt the link and then i saw you had mageenergies i could tap into using that link gods lendel dont tell me im going to turn into a heraldmage he said alarmed by the very idea if you havent by now it isnt too bloody likely tylendel replied to his profound relief savil says a lot of people have the potential but nothing ever triggers it youve just got the potential so dont trigger it vanyel replied shivering with an unexplained drill i dont want to be a herald or a heraldmage or anything like them tylendel gave him an odd look but only said i doubt i could even if you wanted it theres stories that theres a couple of mageschools that know how to trigger potential but nobody i know has ever seen it done so even if its possible the people that can do it are keeping the means a deep secret good vanyel replied still fighting down his chill of apprehension thats exactly the way i want it so you make this gate thing then what when we get to the other side of the gate well be on leshara land right on top of the keep if i can manage it ill use the other spell im looking for and that will be the end of it vanyel suddenly knew without knowing how he knew that he did not want to know what this other spell was fine he replied shortly turning another page you keep looking just tell me when to stop eight vanyel stared nervously at his own reflection in the window a specter pale and indistinct ghostlike with dark hollows for eyes beyond the glass night blanketed the gardens a moonless night a night of wind and cloud and no light at all not even starlight sovvannight the night of celebration of the harvest but also the night set apart for remembering the dead of the year past the night when so most traditions held the otherworld was closer than on any other night a night of profound darkness like the one a moon ago when staven had been slain savil was with the rest of the heralds mourning their dead of the year donni and mardic having no one in need of remembrance were with some of the other trainees at a palace fete indulging in a certain amount of the superstitious foolery associated with harvestfest that was also a jpart of sovvannight at least for the young lord evan leshara had gone home to westrel keep presumably well satisfied with himself there was no doubt in vanyels mind that lord evan had somehow extracted enough good information from what had been fed to him to deduce exactly what bait would serve best to lure staven to his death they had tried to use him and had ended up being used by him and that was a blackly bitter thought tylendel and vanyel had been left alone in the suite tylendel and vanyel would not be mewed up in the suite much longer are you ready tylendel asked from the door behind him vanyel nodded and pulled the hood of his dark blue cloak up over his head trying not to shiver at his own reflection with the hood shrouding his face he looked like an image of death itself then tyiendel moved silently to his side and there were two of the hooded figures reflected in the clouded glass death and deaths shadow he shook his head to free it of such ominous thoughts as tyiendel opened the door and they stepped out into the cold blustering night this morning he had slipped out into haven and bought a pair of nondescript horses from a downattheheels beasttrader using most of the coin he and tyiendel had managed to scrape together over the past three weeks hed taken them off into the west end of the city and stabled them at an inn just outside the city wall tylendel had told vanyel that before he worked the spell to take them within striking distance of the leshara holding he wantedto be out of the easy sensing range of the heraldmages they needed transportation but it didnt matter how brokendown the beasts were their horses only needed to last long enough to get them an hours ride out of the city after that it wouldnt matter what became of them obviously riding gala was totally out of the question they werent taking star or borrowing any of the true horses from the palace stables because if their absence were noticed tyiendel didnt want any suspicions aroused until it was too late to stop them vanyel had concurred without an argument if they couldnt force their mounts through tylendels gate and the trainee had indicated that they might not be able to or might not want to they were going to have to turn them loose to fend for themselves he didnt want to lose star and he didnt want to be responsible for the loss of anyone elses prized mount either the iceedged wind caught at their cloaks finding all the openings and cutting right through the heavy wool itself vanyel was shivering long before they slipped past the gate guard at the palace gates and on out into the streets of the city the guard was preoccupied with warming himself at the charcoal brazier beside the gate he didnt seem to notice them as they hugged the shadows of the side of the gate farthest from him and took to the cobblestoned street beyond now they were out in the wealthiest district of the city the high buildings on either side of them served only to funnel the wind right at them or so it seemed tylendel who was still not entirely steady on his feet grabbed vanyels arm and hung on vanyel could feel him shivering partly with cold but from the way his eyes were gleaming in the shadows of his hood partly also with excitement these mansions of the wealthy and highborn were mostly dark tonight the inhabitants were either at temple services or attending the harvestfest gathering at the palace vanyel had not received an invitation and although he was anything but displeased he wasnt entirely certain why he had not his apparent aboutface with regard to tylendel had confused not only his own little circle but the trainees and heralds as well and no one had enlightened them savil had reckoned that keeping the rumormongers confused would keep the real story from reaching withen for a while and buy them additional time assuming lord evan hadnt told him just for the pure spite of making things difficult for tylendel and tylendels lover it would suit the mans character vanyel thought briefly of the sovvanfete he was missing it was possible that those in charge of the festivities had assumed he would be staying at tylendels side especially tonight it was also possible that they blamed him for tylendels condition mardic had reported several stories to that effect and were punishing him for his conduct whatever the reason this had proved to be too good an opportunity to slip out undetected to let pass by they turned a corner and the buildings changed now they were smaller crowded closer together and no longer hidden behind walls each had candles in the otherwise darkened windows another sovvancustom it was by the light of these candles that the two were finding their way the torches that usually illuminated the street by night had long since blown out tylendel had been growing increasingly strange and withdrawn in the past several days since vanyel had purloined savils magic books for him vanyel would wake up in the middle of the night to find him huddled in the chair studying his handwritten copies of the two spells with fanatic and feverish concentration during waking hours he would often stare for hours at nothing or at a candleflame and his conversation had become monosyllabic the only time he seemed anything like his old self was when hed begin a nightmare and vanyel would wake him from it then he would cry for a while on vanyels shoulder and afterward talk until they both fell asleep again then he sounded like the old tylendel not afraid to share his grief or his fears with the one he loved but when day arrived he would be back inside his shell and nothing vanyel would do or say could seem to crack that barrier vanyel had long since begun to think that he would never be his old self again until his revenge had been accomplished and he had begun to long for that moment with a fervor that nearly equaled his lovers they reached the sector of shops and inns long before they saw another human out on the streets and that was only the nightwatch the patrol of two men gave them hardly more than a passing glance they were obviously unarmed except for knives were too welldressed to be streettoughs and not flashy enough to be young highborns out to find some trouble the two men of the watch gave them nearly simultaneous nods curt and preoccupied nods which they returned as the light from the watchlantern in the hands of the rightmost one fell on them satisfied by what they saw the watch passed on and so did they bootheels clattering on the cobbles here the buildings were only one or two stories tall and the wind howled and ramped about them unimpeded the quality and state of repair of these buildings mostly shops inns lodginghouses and workshops declined steadily and rapidly as they neared the west citywall of haven the guards on the great gates of haven were not in evidence tonight although there was a viewport in the wall and vanyel could almost feel eyes on him as they passed below it obviously the guards found as little to alarm them in the two younglings as the watch had they passed out under the wall with no challenge whatsoever once outside the west wall they were in the lowest district in the city vanyel led the way to the ramshackle inn where hed left their sorry nags fighting the wind every inch of the way as it nearly tore the edges of his cloak out of his halffrozen hands the red nose inn was brightly lit and full to bursting with roisterers vanyel heard their outoftune singing and hoarse laughter even over the moaning of the wind as they passed by the open door smoke and light alike spilled out that door and the wind carried a random puff of the smoke into their eyes as they passed a noisome smudge that made them cough and their eyes water for a moment before cleaner air whipped it out of their faces again they ignored that open door and passed around the side of the inn to the dirty courtyard and the stabling area there was a single halfdrunk groom on duty slumped on a stack of hay bales by the stable door illuminated by a feebly burning lantern his head lolled on his chest as he snored smelling even in this wind as if hed fallen into a vat of cheap beer tylendel waited in the shadows beyond reach of the light from the smoking lantern that had been hung in the lee of the stable door while vanyel shook the mans shoulder until he roused up eh the man grunted peering into the shadows under vanyels hood in an unsuccessful attempt to make out his features his breath was as foul as his clothing his face was filthy and unshaven and his hair hung around his ears in lank greasy ringlets what ye want then where be yer nags already here vanyel replied in a tone as adult brusque and gruff as he could manage here he shoved the claimchits at the groom together with two silver pieces the man stared stupidly at them for a moment blinking in surprise as if he were having trouble telling the chits from the coins then he grinned in sudden comprehension displaying a mouthful of halfrotten teeth and nodded muff celebratin eh master just ye wait just ye wait right here he shoved the coins and chits together into the pocket in the front of his stained oily leather apron heaved himself up off his couch of hay bales and staggered inside the stable door he emerged a great deal sooner than vanyel would have thought possible leading a pair of scruffylooking nondescript brown geldings that were already saddled and bridled with patched and worn tack vanyel squinted at them in the smoky light trying to make out if they were the same ones hed bought this morning then realized that it didnt matter if they were or not it wasnt as if the horses hed purchased were any kind of prize specimens in fact if these werent his horses they were likely as not to be an improvement over the ones hed bought he took the reins away from the groom without another word turned and led them across the dirt court to where tylendel was waiting huddled against the inn wall in a futile attempt to avoid the biting wind when he looked back over his shoulder he could see that the groom had already flopped down on the straw bales and resumed his interrupted nap he handed tylendel the reins of the best of the two mounts and scrambled into his own saddle his fleabitten beast skittered sideways in an attempt to avoid being mounted and gave a halfhearted buck as vanyel settled into his seat vanyel made a fist and gave it a good rap between the ears the nag stopped trying to rid itself of its rider and settled down the spine of his saddle was broken the horse itself was sway backed and its gait was as rough as hed ever had the misfortune to encounter he hoped as tylendel took the lead and they headed down exiles road into the west that they wouldnt be riding for too very long the wind had died down at least momentarily when tylendel finally stopped it was so dark that the only way he really knew that tylendel had pulled up was because the sound of hooves on the hard surface of the road ahead of him stopped theyd trusted to the fact that exiles road was lined on either side with hedges to keep their sorry beasts on the roadway he kicked at his own mount and forced it forward until he could feel the presence of tylendel and his horse bulking beside him there was a flare of light vanyel winced away from it it was quite painful after the neartotal darkness of the last candlemark or so when he could bear to look again he saw that tylendel had dismounted and was leading his horse a red ball of magelight bobbing along above his head he scrambled off of his own mount glad enough to be out of that excruciatingly uncomfortable saddle snatched the reins of the beast over its head and hastened to catch up are we far enough away yet he asked longing for even a single word from the trainee to break the silence and tension tylendels face was drawn and fey and strained tylendels attention was plainly somewhere else his whole aspect wrapped up in the kind of terrifying concentration that had been all too common to him of late almost he replied after a long and unnerving silence his voice had a strange quality to it as if tylendel was having to work to get even a single word out past whatever it was he was concentrating on im looking for something vanyel shivered and not from the cold what a place to put the gate they came to a break in the hedge no not a break when tylendel stopped and led his horse over to it vanyel could see that it was the remains of a gated opening in the hedge long since overgrown beyond the gap something bulked darkly in the dim illumination provided by the magelight tylendel nodded slightly i thought i remembered this place he muttered he didnt seem to expect a response so vanyel didnt make one it was obvious that the horses were not going to be able to force themselves through so narrow a passage tylendel stripped the bridle from his hung it on the saddlebow and gave the gelding a tremendous slap on the hip that made it snort with surprise and sent it cantering off into the darkness vanyel did the same with his not sorry to see it go and turned away from the road to see that tylendel had already forced his way past the gap in the hedge and was now out of sight only the reddish glow of the magelight through the leafless branches of the hedgerow showed where he had gone vanyel shoved his way past the branches cursing as they caught on his cloak and scratched at his face when he emerged staggering from the prickly embrace of stubborn bushes he found that he was standing kneedeep in weeds in what had been the yard of a small building it could have been anything from a shop to a cottage but was now going to pieces the yard was as overgrown as the gate had been the building seemed to be entirely roofless and the door and windows were mere holes in the walls tylendel was examining the remains of the door with care the gap where the door had been was a large one easily large enough for a horse and rider to pass through tylendel nodded again and this time there was an expression of dour satisfaction on his face this will do he said softly van think youre ready vanyel took a deep breath and tried to relax a little as ready as im ever likely to get he replied tylendel turned and took both vanyels hands in his he looked searchingly into vanyels eyes for a long moment van im going to have to force that link between us wide open for this to work i may hurt you ill try not to but i cant promise are you still willing to help me vanyel nodded thinking ive come this far it would be stupid to back out at this point besides he needs this how can i not give it to him tylendel closed his eyes his face froze into as impassive a mask as vanyel had ever worn vanyel waited trembling a little for something to happen for a long while nothing did then rage flamed up in him a consuming obsessive anger that left very little room for anything else one thing mattered staven was dead one goal drove him deal the same painful death to stavens murderers there was still a tiny corner of his mind that could think for itself and wonder at the overwhelming power of tylendels fury but that corner had been locked out of any position of control the truism ran pain shared is pain halved but this pain was doubled on being shared he turned to face the ancient doorway without any conscious decision to do so tylendel turning even as he did he saw tylendel raise his arms and cast a double handful of something powderlike on the ground before the door heard him begin a chant in some strange tongue and hold his now empty hands palm outward to face that similarly empty gap he felt something draining out of him like blood draining from a wound and felt that it was taking his strength with it the edges of the ruined doorway were beginning to glow the same sullen red as the magelight over tylendels head like the muted red of embers as if the edge of the doorway smoldered as more and more of vanyels energy and strength drained from him the ragged border brightened and tiny threads of angry scarlet wavered from them into the space where the door had stood more and more of these threads spun out waving like waterweeds in a current until two of the ends connected across the gap there was a surge of force out of him a surge that nearly caused his knees to collapse as the entire gap filled with a flare of bloodred light then the light vanished and the gap framed not a shadowed blackness but a garden a formal garden decorated for a festival and filled with people light and movement he had hardly a chance to see this before tylendel grabbed his arm and pulled him stumbling across the threshold there was a moment of total disorientation as though the world had dropped from beneath his feet then sound laughter music shouting he stood with tylendel facing that garden he had seen through the ruined doorway and beyond the garden a strange keep lanterns bobbed gaily in the branches of a row of trees that stood between them and the gathered people and trestle tables spread with food and lanterns were visible on the farther side near the trees was a lighted platform on which a band of motley musicians stood playing with a vigor that partially made up for their lack of skill before the platform a crowd of people were dancing in a ring laughing and singing along with the music vanyels knees would not hold him as soon as tylendel let go of his arm his legs gave way and he found himself halfkneeling on the ground dizzy weak and nauseated tylendel didnt notice his attention was on the people dancing theyre celebrating tylendel whispered and the anger vanyel was inadvertently sharing surged along the link between them stavens dead and theyre celebrating that small rational corner still left to vanyel whispered that this was only a harvestfest like any other that the leshara werent particularly gloating over an enemys death but that logical voice was too faint to be heard over the thunder of tylendels outrage a wave of dizziness clouded his sight with a red mist and he could hear his heart pounding in his ears when he could see again tylendel had stepped away from him and was standing between him and the line of trees with his hands high over his head from tylendels upraised hands came twin bolts of the same vermilion lightning that had lashed the pine grove a moon ago only this lightning was controlled and directed and it cracked across the garden and destroyed the trees standing between him and the gathered lesharakin in less time than it took to blink in the wake of the thunderbolt came startled screams the music ended in a jangle of snapped strings and the squawk of horns the dancers froze and clutched at each other in clumps of two to five tylendels magelight was blazing like a tiny scarlet sun above his head his face was hatefilled and twisted with frenzy tears streaked his face his voice cracked as he screamed at them hes dead you bastards hes dead and youre laughing youre singing damn you all ill teach you to sing a different song you want magic well heres magic for you vanyel couldnt move he seemed tethered to the stillglowing gate behind him he could only watch numbly as tylendel raised his hands again and this time it was not lightning that crackled from his upraised hands a glowing sphere appeared with a sound of thunder suspended high above him about the size of a melon it hung in the air rotating slowly a smoky sickly yellow it grew as it turned and drifted silently away from tylendel and toward the huddled lesharafolk descending as it neared them until it came to earth in the center of the blasted blackened place where the trees had been a moment before there it rested still turning still growing until it had swelled to twice the height of a man then between one heartbeat and the next it burst another wave of disorientation washed over him vanyel blinked eyes that didnt seem to be focusing properly where the globe had rested there seemed to be a twisting twining mass of shadowshapes shapes as fluid as ink as sinuous as snakes shapes that were there and not there at one and the same time then they slid apart those shapes separating into five writhing mistforms they solidified if some mad god had mated a viper and a coursinghound and grown the resulting offspring to the size of a calf the result might have looked something like the five creatures snarling and flowing lithely around one another in the gleaming of tylendels magelight in color they were a smoky black with skin that gave an impression of smooth scales rather than hair they had long long necks too long by far and arrowheadshaped heads that were an uncanny mingling of snake and greyhound with yellow pupilless eyes that glowed in the same way and with the same shifting color that the globe that had birthed them had glowed the teeth in those narrow muzzles were needlesharp and as long as a mans thumb they had bodies like greyhounds as well but the legs and tails seemed unhealthily stretched and unnaturally boneless they regarded tylendel with unwavering saffron eyes they seemed to be waiting for something he quavered out a single word his voice breaking on the final highpitched syllable and they turned as one entity to face the cowering folk of leshara mouths gaping in unholy parodies of a dogs foolish grin but before they had flowed a single step toward their victims a shrill scream of equine defiance rang out from behind vanyel and gala thundered through the gate at his back pounding past him then past tylendel ignoring the trainee completely she screamed again more anger and courage in her cry than vanyel had ever thought possible to hear in a horses voice and skidded to a halt halfway between tylendel and the things he had called up she was glowing just like she had during lenders fit a pure bluewhite radiance that attracted the eye in the same way that the yellow glow of the beasts eyes repelled she continued to ignore tylendels presence entirely turning her back to him rearing up to her full height and pawing the air with her forehooves trumpeting a challenge to the five creatures before her they reversed their positions in an instant as her hooves touched the ground again facing her with silent snarls of anger she pawed the earth and bared her teeth at them daring them to try to fight her gala tylendel cried in anguish his voice breaking yet again gaia dont she turned her head just enough to look him fully in the eyes and vanyel heard her mental reply as it rang through tylendels mind and heart and splintered his soul i do not know you she said coldly remotely you are not my chosen and with those words the bond that had been between them vanished vanyel could feel the emptiness where ithad been for he was still sharing everything tylendel felt tylendels rage shattered on the cold of those words and when the bond was broken what took its place was utter desolation vanyel moaned in anguish sharing tylendels agony and the torment and bereavement as he called after gaia with his mind and received not even the echo of a reply where there had been warmth and love and support there was now nothing not even a ghost of what had been the link between them surged with loss and vanyels vision darkened he heard tylendel cry out galas name in utter despair and willed his eyes to clear and to his horror he watched her fling herself at the five fiends heedless of her own safety they swarmed over and about her their darkness extinguishing her light he heard her shriek but this time in pain and saw the red splash of blood bloom vividly on her white coat he tried to stagger to his feet but had no strength his ears roared and he blacked out he barely felt himself falling again and only tylendels scream of anguish and loss penetrated enough to make him fight his way back to consciousness he found himself halfsprawled on the cold ground he shoved himself partially erect despite his spinning head and looked for gala but there was no companion no fight only a mutilated corpse sprawling torn and ravaged throat slashed to ribbons the light gone from the sapphire eyes tylendel was on his knees beside her stroking the ruined head weeping hoarsely beside her lifeless body lay one of the five monstrosities head a shapeless pulp the others flowed around the companions body as if waiting for the corpse to rise again so that they could attack it two of the others limped on three legs but two were still unharmed and given what they had done to gala in a few heartbeats two would be more than enough to slaughter every man woman and child of the leshara finally they left off their mindless sharklike circling and turned to face the terrified celebrants they took no more notice of tylendel than of the dead companion a man bolted from the crowd with a start vanyel recognized him for lord evan whether he meant to attack the beasts or simply to flee vanyel couldnt tell it really didnt matter much one of the beasts that was still unhurt flashed across the intervening space and caught him he did not even have time to cry out as it disembowled him a woman screamed and that seemed to signal the beasts to move again they began to ooze in a body toward their victims and a bolt of brilliantly white lightning cracked from behind vanyel to scorch the earth before the leader there was a pounding of hooves from the gate vanyel was momentarily blinded by the light and by another surge of weakness that sent him sagging back to the ground when his eyes cleared again there were three whiteclad heralds and their three companions closing on the fiends lightning crackling from their upraised hands they were using the lightnings to herd the beasts into a tight little knot and barring their path to their prey he barely had time to recognize two of the three as savil and jaysen before battle was joined once again he started to black out feeling as if something was trying to pull his soul out of his body he fought against unconsciousness though he felt as if he had nothing left to fight with both the rage and the despair were gone now leaving only an empty place a void that ached unbearably he felt a tiny inflowing of strength it wasnt much but it was enough to give him the means to fight the blackness away from his eyes to fight off the vertigo and to finally get a precarious hold on the world again the first thing he saw was tylendel still on his knees but no longer weeping he was vacanteyed white as bleached linen and staring at his own bloodsmeared hands where the five creatures had been there was now nothing only the mangled body of gala and the burned and churnedup earth taking her hand away from his shoulder was savil her face an unreadable mask savil pulled her attention away from tylendel who was slumped in a kind of trance of despair beside her and back to what vanyel was telling the other two heralds then she said i dont know you you arent my chosen the boy whispered eyes dull and mirroring his exhaustion voice colorless and she turned her back on him just turned away and charged those things buying time for us to get here jaysen murmured his voice betraying the pain he would not show oh gods the poor brave thing if she hadnt bought us those moments wed have come in on a bloodbath she repudiated him said lancir the queens own as if he did not believe it she repudiated him and then suicided savil supplied flatly her own heart in turmoil aching for tylendel for the loss of gala for all the things she should have seen and hadnt gods she suicaided she knew she had to know that no single companion could face a pack of wyrsa and survive tylendel sat where they had left him unseeing unspeaking all of hell in his eyes magelights of their own creation bobbed overhead pitilessly illuminating everything jaysen contemplated savils trainee for a long moment but said nothing only shook his head slightly then he spared a glance for vanyel and frowned savil heard his thought the boy is still tied to the gate sister he grows weaker by the moment if you want him undamaged unspoken but not unfelt was the vague thought that perhaps it would be no bad thing if vanyel were to be forgotten until it was too late to save him from the aftereffects of the gatemagic that undercurrent of thought told savil that jaysen placed all of the blame for this squarely on vanyels shoulders it wasnt his fault jaysen she answered heartsick and near to weeping but unable to be anything other than honest he didnt do anything worse than go along with what lendel wanted without telling me what happened was as much due to my negligence as anything he did jaysen gave a curt nod but a skeptical one in that case we need to get that gate closed down as soon as possible or the boy will sicken or worse no need to ask what that worse was vanyel was already looking drawn almost transparent as the gate pulled more and more of his lifeforce from him how tylendel halftrained and vanyel ungifted had managed that savil had no notion but they dared not break the link until they didnt need the gate anymore fine but what are we going to do about all that mess savil asked nodding her head at the milling crowd the mangled corpse of the single victim the wyrsa had killed and the pathetic body of the companion somebody had better take them in hand or no telling what theyll get up to go in for a wholesale slaughteringparty on tylendels people make up some kind of tale about heralds being in on this even a hair away from breaking down into tears she was still thinking she couldnt help it lll stay here lancir volunteered elspeth can do without me for a moon or so ill take care of the leshara and see to his thought faltered gala and youll get home how jaysen asked concerned were going to shut the gate from the other side as soon as were through and you arent up to gating by yourself these days like ordinary mortals he replied with a deathly seriousness on our feet what what are we going to do about savils eyes flicked to tylendel and back the boy was still staring vacantly into space his face pale and blank his eyes so full of inwardturned torment that she could scarcely bear to look into them for fear she would break down and cry i dont know lancir replied bleakly i just dont know theres no precedent get the boy home worry about it when youve got time to think about it ask your companions it was one of their number that died thats all i can think of but youd better get on with it if you expect to leave the other boy with a mind jays take tylendel will you savil said aloud reaching for vanyels arm and pulling him to his feet lance gods with you heartsibs said the queens own pity and compassion momentarily transforming his homely face into something close to saintly like that of a beautiful carved statue youll need their help taver his companion sidled up to him and held rockstill for jaysen to help him to mount like the queen like savil lancir was feeling his age these autumn days and needed the boost into place that jaysen gave him but once in the saddle he resumed the strength and dignity of a much younger queens own the man he had been twenty years ago taver tossed his head and walked with calm and quiet steps toward the shocked confused mob of leshara at the other end of the garden jaysen tugged on tylendels arm the boy rose but with the automatic movements of someone spellbound his attention still turned within himself the seneschals herald led the way to the gate followed closely by his companion and guiding the boy with a hand at his shoulder he cast a look back at savil i dont fancy the notion of the ride we have ahead of us too many things to go wrong on the way you know more about this spell than i do do you think you can reset this gate to bring us out at the palace she wrenched her attention away from the unanswerable problem of what to do about the boys and contemplated the structure of the gate the portal at this end was an ornamental gazebo in the center of the blasted garden through the arch of the entrance lay the dark of the ruinous cottage yard i dont see any problem she replied after study i can bring us out in the grove temple if thats all right that should do jaysen said eyeing the sky on the other side of the portal which was flickering with lightnings good gods why did that blow in there wasnt a storm due dont look so surprised jays she growled needed to lash out at something and using his absentmindedness to make him the target ive told you a dozen times that gating plays merry cob with the weather thats why i dont like to use gates its going to get worse when i reset it and all hell will break out when i collapse it he pursed his lips and frowned but didnt reply just waved at her with his free hand she let go of vanyel who sagged back to his knees too weakened to stay standing without her support she raised both her hands high above her head and made an intricately weaving little gesture filaments of dull red light floated from the gate toward her and were caught up on her fingers by that complex weaving when she had them fast she clenched her hands on them and sent her will coursing down them in a surge of pure commanding power the filaments turning from red to white as her will flowed back along them when the wave of white reached the gate the portal misted over then flared incandescently when the light died the scene framed in the gazebo arch was that of companions field seen by the fitful flashes of lightning as viewed from the porch of the grove temple savil reached down and caught the fabric of vanyels tunic pulling him to his feet again she dragged him with her as she followed closely on jaysens heels he hurried across the gate threshold pushing tylendel before him she halfran a step behind him dragging vanyel with her by main force the gatecrossing hit her with its alltoofamiliar sickening sensation of falling then hard smooth marble was beneath her feet and they were home lighting struck a nearby tree and thunder deafened her for a moment she cleared out of the path of the gate and kellan and felar darted across ears laid back as soon as she and vanyel were out of the way she let go of vanyel who stumbled the two steps to one of the pillars and clung to it she turned to face the gate even as another bolt struck nearby the gate was going unstable wavering from red to white and back again the instability in the energy fields mirrored in the increasing fury of the lightning storm overhead she raised her hands and began the dismissal and encountered unexpected resistance she tried again wincing at the crack of thunder directly above her there was something wrong something very wrong the gate was fighting her jays she shouted over the growl of thunder and the whine of the wind i need a hand here jaysen let go of tylendel to add his strength to hers their united wills worked at the spellknot forcing it to unravel faster than it could knit itself back up again with a surge of wild power that brought a halfdozen lightning strikes down on the belltower of the temple itself the gate collapsed then again the unexpected the gateenergy instead of dissipating back into the air and ground flared up and surged back down the one conduit left to it the forceline that had tied it into vanyel savil saw it but not in time to stop it vanyel screamed in agony convulsing clutching the pillar as the released power arced back into him and from him a second weaker arc leapt to tylendel tylendel jerked into sudden alertness and uttered the most painful cry of despair savil had ever heard it was a cry that would haunt her nightmares for the rest of her life she pivoted and grabbed for him as quickly as she could as vanyel collapsed in a moaning heap at the foot of the pillar but it was too late no longer held in deceptive docility by his shock he dodged her outstretched hand she saw his face in another of the lightning flashes his eyes were all pupil his face a twisted mask of nothing but pain he looked frantically about him with those terrible eyes that held no sanity at all dodged her again and then dashed past her into the tangled trees of the grove jaysen gave chase savil limped after both of them lightning was striking so often overhead now that the sky was almost as bright as day she tried to use the line of their shared magic to get at tylendels mind as she ran hoping to bring him back to her but stumbled in shock and fell when she touched his thoughts there was nothing to get a hold on the boy was a chaotic aching void of grief and loneliness it was so empty so unhuman that for a moment she could only crouch in the cold dry grass and listen to her overworked heart beat in panic it took every ounce of discipline she had to get her own mind back under control after touching that terrible allconsuming sorrow belatedly she thought of vanyel if anyone could reach tylendel surely he could she lurched painfully to her feet and stumbled back toward the temple in the lightning flashes she could make out the younger boy staggering blindly out of the temple clutching himself as if he were freezing saw him stumble and fall on his shoulder without trying to save himself then she saw tylendel dart out of the treeshadows to her right and race past her past his fallen lover and back into the temple itself and her heart went cold with a sudden premonition of disaster she forced her exhausted legs into a stumbling parody of a run but she wasnt fast enough just as she reached the place where vanyel lay panting and moaning in pain she saw his head snap up as if in response to a call only he could hear he seemed to be looking up at the tower that held the death bell she heard him cry out something unintelligible and followed his horrorstricken glance and saw tylendel poised against the lightingfilled sky arms spread as if to fly and saw him leap he seemed to hang in the air for a moment as if he had somehow mastered flight but only a moment in the next heartbeat he was falling falling she couldnt tell if the scream she heard was hers or vanyels or both it wasnt tylendels his eyes were closed and his mouth twisted and jaw clenched in a rictus of pure grief she felt the impact of his body with the unforgiving ground as if it had been her own body that had fallen and the scream ended jaysen stopped dead beside her frozen in midstep she whimpered in the back of her throat and jaysen walked slowly to the crumpled thing lying on the ground not twenty paces from where she now stood he went to his knees beside it then looked up and she saw him shake his head slowly confirming what she already knew and at that moment the death bell began solemnly tolling she stumbled to jaysens side each step costing her more in pain than she had felt in a lifetime of sacrifice to queen and circle she went heavily to her knees and gathered up the limp pitiable body to her breast she held him cradling him against her shoulder gently rocking a little as if she held a small child tears coursed silently down her face to mingle with the rain that was pouring from the sky it seemed that the whole world echoed her grief jaysen knelt beside her his head bowed his shoulders shaking with sobs as the companions gathered about them and the death bell tolled above them it was only when the rest of the heralds arrived to take their burden from them that they thought of vanyel and sent someone to look for him but the boy was gone nine vanyel stumbled through the pouring frigid rain he was halfblinded with grief with no hope of finding comfort anywhere in this world there was nothing left for him nothing hes dead oh gods hes dead and its all my fault his whole body seemed to be on fire a slow smoldering pain that was burning away at him from the inside the way the ice of his dream had chilled him there was no reason to fight ice or fire anymore let either or both eat him he couldnt care rain pounded him hail struck like slung stones his head reeled and pounded with his pulse he hurt but he welcomed the pain its all i deserve it was all my fault he couldnt see where he was going and he didnt give a damn he tripped and fell any number of times but bruises and cuts didnt matter he just picked himself back up and kept running in whatever direction he happened to be facing his whole universe had collapsed the moment tylendel had thrown himself off that tower somewhere down in the depths of his soul was the dim thought that if he ran far enough ran fast enough he might run off the edge of the world and into an oblivion where there would be no more feeling and no more pain he didnt run off the edge of the world quite he ran off the bank into the river the ground just disappeared under his feet and he flailed his arms wildly as he halffell halftumbled down the bank and somersaulted at the bottom into the icy water it closed over his head and the cold shocked him into an instant of forgetfulness he lost the desire for oblivion as instinct took over and he fought back to the surface he gulped air shook water out of his eyes and in a flash of lightning saw an oncoming tree limb too late to dodge it he managed to turn away from it but it hit him across the back of the head and knocked him under again the second time his head broke the surface he was dazed and unthinking in another glare of lighting he saw the branches of a bush beside him and grabbed at them they were too far away far out of his frantic reach then the hush shook violently and seemed to stretch toward him he snatched at the ends of the branches he caught them somehow they cut into his hand but he managed to pull himself into the shallows he had just enough strength left to crawl halfway up into the rainslick bank and just enough mind left to wonder why hed bothered to save himself he lay facedown in the sodden dead grass on the bank chilled and numb and growing colder and wracked with anguished guilt and mourning lendel lendel it was all my fault oh gods it was all my fault i should have told savil i should have tried to stop you he sobbed into the rough grass the dampsmelling earth longing inarticulately for the power of a god to reverse time to unmake all that had happened im sorry oh please someone take it all back if you have to have someone take me instead make it a dream oh gods please but it wasnt a dream no more than the rain that was diluting his tears or the icy water that tugged at his legs and no god intervened to unmake the past the wintry cold was closing in on him chilling the fire along his veins he was too weak to move and too tired and far too grief stricken to care it occurred to him then that he might die here as alone as tylendel had died it was no less than his deserts and he changed his prayers please he asked desperately of powers that were not answering please let me die he thought of every mistake he had made every wrong turning and moaned i deserve to die he thought in anguish closing his eyes i want to die nothe mindvoice was bright bright as a flame and sharp as steel piercing his dark hope for death no you must not you must live chosen he raised his head a little but couldnt get his eyes open and really didnt want to you dont know he thought bleakly back at the intruder let me alone no one wants me nobody should want me i kill everything i care for but someone grabbed him by the back of the collar and halfdragged him up the bank he tried to twist away but his body wouldnt work right anymore and all he did was thrash feebly heartbeats later the rain was no longer pounding his back and the greensmelling soft moss under his weakly moving hands was dry hed been pulled into some kind of shelter whatever had him let go of his collar after lowering him gently down onto the moss he managed to get his eyes open but with the lightning fading off in the distance he could see nothing but darkness something warm and large lay down beside him with a sigh a soft nose nuzzled his cheek like gala had the sensation brought up memories that cut him into little shreds he brought his knees up under his chest and curled up on himself sobbing uncontrollably driven to the edge of sanity by grief and loneliness but i am here he brought his head up a little and looked for the speaker with vision blurred by tears and in a last glare of the lightning met a pair of glowing sapphire eyeseyes so full of compassion and love that he knew their owner would forgive him anything that love reached out for him and flowed over into him it couldnt erase his loss but it could share the pain and it didnt blame him for what had happened he uncurled and groped for the smooth white neck and shoulder the way he had seized on the branches of the bush to keep from drowning he sobbed himself into exhaustion on that shoulder wept until he hadnt the strength to shed another tear and into a kind of fevered halfsleep and all the while that bright voice murmured like a litany over and over into his mind i am here my chosen i love you i will never leave you savil we found him mardic burst into the room that had been vanyels and tylendels dripping from head to toe and shivering in the draft from the door behind him as he turned to close the door savil dredged up energy she hadnt dreamed she still possessed and started to rise jaysen and healer andrel simultaneously seized her shoulders and pushed her back down into her chair where she demanded in a voice hoarsened by weeping who found him is he all right i dunno the companions found him yfandes did anyway mardic replied vaguely swaying with weariness looking colorless with exhaustion in the yellow candlelight she found him on the garden side of the river and dragged him into a grotto tantras thinks hes sick something like backlash but he cant tell for sure hes trying to persuade her to let him bring van back here so andrel can take care of him savil shook her head trying to make sense of his words mardic what are you trying to tell me what has yfandes got to do with anything she wont let anyone lay a finger on him savil mardic replied blinking and still shivering despite the warmth of the room shes adamant about it damned near took tantras hand off when he tried to get at van she told my fortin that she doesnt trust us to protect him and keep him under shield properly that we wont understand what weve got that hes hurt all torn up inside his mind and we cant begin to help him mardic jaysen said slowly are you saying that yfandes chose vanyel the only fullgrown companion in the field that hasnt chosen the companion that hasnt chosen for over ten years and now shes chosen vanyel she didnt come out and say so but i guess she did mardic said fatigue slurring his words as he slumped against the doorframe i dunno why in hell shed be curled up around him like he was her foal otherwise and not letting us near him we think hes unconscious he isnt moving and he isnt responding when we talk to him but yfandes wont let anyone close enough to get a good look at him savil exchanged startled looks with the seneschals herald but it was healer andrel who put their thoughts into words by the lady bright he murmured green eyes gone round with consternation what in the havens is this going to mean vanyel swam up out of a feverish fitful nightmare prodded by an insistent voice in his head he moaned and opened dry hot eyes that ached and burned his head still pounded and moving it even a little made his vision blur he felt as if his whole body was a hot tight painfully constrictive garment it felt like it didnt belong to him sunlight gleamed weakly in through a rocky opening he could see the river gurgling by just a few paces beyond it it looked as if he were in a cave but there were pink marble benches beside the entrance caves didnt have pink marble benches they didnt have cultivated mosscovered floors either then he recognized the place for what it was one of the garden grottoes set into the riverbank they were popular with courting couples or people seeking a moment of solitude from the court tylendel had often wistfully expressed the wish that they dared to use one tylendel grief closed around his throat and stopped his breath no vanyel chosen not now mourn later now get up without knowing quite how he had gotten there vanyel found himself on his feet leaning heavily on the silky shoulder of a companion his companion yfandes he tried to make sense of that but his head spun too much and he couldnt get a good grip on any of the thoughts that halfformed and then blew away you are ill said the worried voice inside his mind i cannot care for you i did not wish to let you away from my protection but i cannot help you you have fever you need a healer move your foot one step another he discovered that he was shaking and clung a little tighter to the companions back obedient to that voice in his head he put one hesitant foot in front of the other learning quickly that he had to rest most of his weight on the arm clinging to yfandes shoulder he had to close his eyes after the first couple of steps and trust to her to guide him he was so dizzy and nauseated he couldnt make any sense out of what he was seeing they emerged into sunlight that was far too much for his eyes he opened them once and shut them again quickly the companion suddenly stepped away from him and he literally fell into the arms of a strange herald and once out of contact with yfandes there were dozens of voices in his head all of them clamorous all of them confusing he whimpered tried to pull away and hid his head in his arms they hurt they hurt and he couldnt make out which were his own thoughts and which belonged to someone else tell your fool chosen to shield him delian that voice he recognized although yfandes had never spoken that sharply to him the stranger bit off a curse and touched vanyels forehead and the voices cut off vanyel opened his eyes again and wished he hadnt the world was spinning around with him as the center of the chaos he shut them immediately vowing not to reopen them let me tantras the soft voice was that of yet another stranger two cool hands rested lightly on his head and brought with them the promise of comfort and the peace of sleep he took what they offered falling into oblivion gratefully with any luck hed never wake up the bed looked far too big for the boy never tall he seemed to have collapsed in on himself he was as pale as the sheets and it might have been his dark hair and naturally fair complexion but it seemed to her that he looked worse than tylendel had after his fit that was something savil had not thought possible until now tylendel oh my lendel my poor poor lendel unshed tears made a hard knot in her throat and misted her eyes so she missed the moment that andrel took his hand away from the boys forehead and sagged back into his chair with a sigh of weariness his graying red hair damp with sweat his freckles twice as evident with his skin so washed out and pale it was that sigh that brought her back to the urgent present andrel she said softly can you tell me anything i did what i could for him and more ive got a line established the greenrobed healer to the heralds replied without looking up i want you to follow it or if you feel you cant find me a heraldmage your equal i dont believe what i saw to be frank and i want a confirmation savil tightened her jaw and told herself again that none of this had been vanyels fault besides she was the only heraldmage at the palace who was likely to have any feelings of charity toward the boy ill follow it have you got more to say or i want you in there first what i have to say is going to depend on whether you think ive gone over the edge or not savil raised one eyebrow in surprise but moved in to stand beside the healer she reached out for andrels soothing presence as easily as she could have reached for his hand theyd been lovers once and had worked together often both before and since they meshed auras exactly as hand would close on hand and savil followed the line the healer had established down past the churning chaos of vanyels sleeping surface mind to the dark griefstricken core of him the measure of that grief would have reconciled her to him even had she felt him blameworthy shed known the depth of tylendels feelings but it seemed as if vanyels had run at least as deep certainly his grief and loss were as profound as her own more oh gods its just what i warned lendel against hes lost hes utterly lost without lendel but that was not what rocked her back onto her heels with real shock savil had spent most of the past twenty years of her life as the one heraldmage most intimately involved in training young heraldmages and the one most often set to identify youngsters with active gifts and the potential of being chosen she had seen children with one two or most commonly no gifts tylendel had been unusual in having mindspeech fetching empathy and the magegift all at nearequal strength most heralds or heraldmages ftad one or two strong gifts and few had as many as three vanyel had them all each channel she tested with the sole exception of healing was open most of them had been forced open to their widest extent the boy had mindspeech fetching farsight foresight as much empathy as tylendel had shown even enough firestarting to ensure hed never need to use a tinderbox again and the allimportant magegift his mindspeech was even of both types thoughtsensing and projecting and irony of ironies as if the gods were taking with one hand and offering a pittance as compensation the bardic gift this boy had more gifts than any five full heralds and all of them had come into full activity in less than a day to her horror she could see that all the channels were as raw and sensitive as so many open wounds the channels had not been opened theyd been blasted open it was a wonder the boy wasnt mad with the pain alone savil came up out of vanyels mind with a rush like a startled fish jumping out of a stream and looked from the boy to the healer and back in a state of surprise that closely resembled shock great good gods she said what the hell happened to do that andrel shook his head your guess would be better than mine i never cared much where our powers came from i was just concerned with learning to use them effectively but do you see what im up against with this boy i think so savil replied groping for the bedpost and sitting down carefully on the foot of the bed let me add this up youve got backlash trauma from when the gateenergy got pulled from him and more trauma from when we sent it back into him youve got the problems inherent when you wake gifts late or early youve got the problems with them being at full power from the moment they woke worst of all youve got channels that were burned open or torn open instead of opening of themselves that and more mundane emotional trauma and physical shock i hope to the havens that he doesnt come down with pneumonia on top of it all i already fought off one fever one his own body produced when it couldnt handle the energyoverload andrel touched the back of his hand to the boys waxen cheek checking his temperature so far so good but its a real possibility and im fighting off the effects of exposure too savil the child is a mess lover you have a talent for understatement savil contemplated vanyels pinched grieftwisted face even in sleep he doesnt lose his pain now i see why yfandes was so reluctant to let him out of her care until she gets him firmly bonded to her hes going to have to be in physical contact with her for her to protect him but what can we do i cant fit her in here i cant put him in the stables not with the weather being what it is try and ill call you up on charges andrel replied and savil could tell that he was not joking do that in this chill and youll kill him its going to be touchy enough with him tucked up in a warm bed well how in hell do i protect him from his own powers put your own shields on him and hope nothing gets through i cant keep them up forever savil reminded him acidly im fairly well fagged out myself a couple of hours is about all i can manage at this point then go order two graves dammit the healer snarled in sudden frustration because youre going to lose this one too if you dont do everything right with him savil pulled back taken very much aback by the sudden explosion of temper i she faltered then as his words penetrated and she thought of what was lying in the grove temple at this moment lost her own precarious hold on calm she got up stumbling a little turned away from him and leaned against the doorframe her shoulders shaking with hersilent weeping savil strong but trembling hands on her shoulders turned her back to face the room and pulled her into an embrace against a bony chest covered in soft green wool savil im sorry andrel murmured into her hair i shouldnt have said that youre exhausted im exhausted and neither of us are up to facing the problem this boy represents is there anyone you can turn him over to for a day at least long enough for you to get some rest and a chance to think a white square of linen appeared just when she needed it she mopped at her eyes with the handkerchief he offered and blew her nose under any other circumstances id just let any of the others spell me but i dont know andy a lot of them still think hes responsible for all this even if they shield with gifts like his whats he going to pick up you of all people should know how leaky we all are to a new raw gift even when we arent stressed andrel sighed dearheart i dont think you have a real choice youll just have to hope that if surface thoughts leak past he wont be able to understand them yet if you dont get some rest youre going to collapse and even a novice healer would be able to tell you that she bowed her head feeling the weight of all her years and all her sorrows falling on her back all right she said acting against her better judgment but unable to see any other option open to her see if you can round up tantras for me will you at least he didnt know poor lendel all that well vanyel woke from a dream in which tylendel was alive again and had teased him gently about how much he had been grieving for a confused moment after waking he wasnt certain which had been the dream and which the reality then he opened his eyes and found that he was in his own bed and his own room now illuminated by carefully shaded candlelanterns and there was something odd about the room after a long moment he finally figured out what it was the feeling of tylendel the sense of his being there even when he wasnt physically present was missing that told him he swallowed a moan of despair and closed his eyes against the resurgence of tears and just in time for the door opened softly and closed again and he felt a new presence in the room with him he froze for a moment then sighed as if in sleep and turned onto his side hiding his face away from the light he was hearing things like someone talking to himself only only inside his head the way yfandes voice had been inside his head it hurt to listen but he couldnt stop the words from coming in and from the feel of that mindvoice he knew who it was that was sitting by his bedside too it was one of the heralds that had been with savil the one called jaysen and jaysen did not in the least care for vanyel gods vanyel heard a little garbled by the pain that came with the words trade this arrogant little toad for tylendel damn poor bargain vanyel could feel brooding eyes on him and the words in his head came clearer more focused no matter what savil said ill never believe he didnt have something to do with the boys death if theyd been all that close tylendel would have listened to him and even if lendel was crazed on revenge this one wasnt lendel may have loved him but he could never have cared for the lad in the same way or hed have stopped him lendel was just one more little addition to his stable of admirers if hed left lendel alone if he hadnt played on his weaknesses vanyel cringed beneath the pitiless words and the vision of himself that came with them arrogant selfcentered selfserving using tylendel not caring for him and worse worse than that feeding him what he craved like feeding a perpetual drunk the liquor he shouldnt have without thinking about it he reached beyond his room it was a little like straining his ears to hear a conversation in the distance and the pain that came with the effort felt like muscles pulling against a broken bone but he found he could catch other snatches of it must be thoughts that touched on him they could have been echoes of jaysens thoughts he pulled his awareness back as a child pulls its singed hand from the fire that has burned it there were only two creatures in all the world that he could be certain cared for him despite what he was tylendel and yfandes neither were to be trusted to know the truth about him the second was besotted by whatever magic had made her choose him the first was the first was dead and it was his fault jaysen was right if hed really cared for lendel hed have stopped him it wouldnt even have been hard if he hadnt agreed to get those books if he hadnt agreed to help with that spell tylendel would be alive at this moment and if he hadnt seduced lendel with his own needs none of this ever would have happened bad on top of worst now he was a burden on the heralds who hated him but felt honorbound to take him in tylendels place and he could never replace tylendel not ever even he knew that he had none of tylendels virtues and all of his vices and more he listened to the mindvoice of the one beside him with all his strength ignoring the pain it cost hoping beyond hope that the herald would somehow give him the chance to get away get away and do something to make this right if the herald would just go away for a moment or or better yet fall asleep jaysen was tired though hed done less magic than savil and had more time to rest he was still very weary hed set himself up in the rooms really comfortable chair the one tylendel had sometimes fallen asleep in vanyel could feel jaysens mind drifting over into slumber and held his breath hoping hed drift all the way because hed gleaned something else from those minds out there because the death bell had rung for him despite what hed done tylendel was being accounted a full herald and tomorrow would be buried with all the honors tomorrow but tonight he was in the temple in the grove and if he could get that far vanyel was going to try to right the wrongs he had done to all of them atoning with the only thing he had left to give jaysens thoughts slipped into the vague mumbles of sleep and in the next moment a gentle snore from the chair beside the bed told vanyel that he was completely gone vanyel turned over deliberately making noise jaysen continued to snore undisturbed vanyel sat up slowly taking stock of himself and his surroundings about a candlemark later he was dressed even if he had not needed to move slowly for fear of waking the herald he would have had to for weakness he had even needed to hold onto the furniture at first because his legs were so unsteady even now his legs trembled with every step he took but at least he was moving a bit more surely he stole soundlessly across the floor and unlatched the door opened it just enough to squeeze himself through and shut it again it was dark out here a still cloudless night he wouldnt be seen but it was a long way to the grove he steeled himself and stepped shakily onto the graveled path that ran from his door through the moonlit garden but someone had been waiting for him yfandes glided out of the darkness to his side almost before he had made five steps along that path no she said sternly barring his way you are ill you should be in bed for a moment he was ready to collapse right where he stood gods shes going to stop me then he saw a way to get yfandes to help him without her knowing she was doing so please he directed everything he could on part of the truth he couldnt lie mindtomind he knew that but he didnt have to reveal everything unless yfandes should ask a direct question about it and besides that the link to her was fading in and out and it hurt like everything else and he would bet she wouldnt want to force anything pleased yfandes i have to he faltered to say goodbye she bowed her head almost to the earth as he let his grief pour out over her very well he heard the mindvoice heavy with reluctance i will help you but you must rest after i will he promised meaning it though not in the way she had intended she went to her knees so that he could mount he once the best rider at forst reach could not drag himself onto her back without that help his arms and legs trembled with weakness as he clung to her back and if it had not been that she could have balanced a toddler there and not let it fall he would have lost his seat within the first few moments he concentrated on his weariness on how physically miserable he was feeling and spent not so much as an eyeblink on his real intentions he closed his eyes both to concentrate and because seeing the ground move by so fast in the moonlight was making him nauseated and disoriented again he had had no notion of how fast the companions could travel at a socalled walk she was stepping carefully up to the porch of the grove temple long before he had expected her to get there the clear ringing of her hooves on the marble surprised him into opening his eyes we are here she said and knelt for him to dismount the marble of the temple porch glistened wetly in the moonlight and he could see candlelight shining under the door he slid from yfandes back and listened with this new mental ear for other minds within the temple none he shivered in the cold wind hed dressed carefully in the black silk tunic and breeches tylendel had thought he looked best in and once off yfandes warm broad back the wind cut right through his clothing not for long she admonished as he clung to the doorframe and negotiated unlatching the door into the temple itself no yfandes he said sincerely not for long he got the door open and closed again then as quietly as he could locked it there was no clamor from the opposite side so he assumed she had not heard the bolt shoot home he turned bracing himself for what he was about to do and faced the altar the temple itself was tiny hardly bigger than the common room of their suite it had been built all of white marble within and without the walls took up the candlelight and reflected it until they fairly glowed there were only two benches in it and the altar behind the altar were stands thick with candles behind the candles the wall had been carved into a delicate basrelief swirling clouds the moon stars and the sun and in the clouds suggestions of male and female faces whose expressions changed with the flickering of the candles before the altar stood the bier vanyels legs trembled with every step he made his way unsteadily to that whitedraped platform and looked down on the occupant theyd dressed tylendel in full whites his eyes were closed and there was no trace of his grief or his madness in that handsome peaceful face his hands were folded across his waist those graceful strong hands that had held so much of comfort for his beloved he looked almost exactly as he had so many mornings when vanyel had awakened first his long golden curls were spread against the white of the pallet a few of them tumbled a little untidily over his right temple long darkgold lashes lay against his cheeks only the pose was wrong tylendel had never in all the time vanyel had known him slept in anything other than a sprawl vanyel reached out hesitantly to touch that smooth cheek almost believing even now that he had only to touch him to awaken him but the cheek was cold as cold as the marble of the altar and the eyes did not flutter open at his touch this was no childs tale where the sleeping one would wake again at the magic touch of the one who loved him please lendel forgive me he whispered to the quiet face and took the knife from the white sheath on tylendels belt i im going to try to pay for all of what i did to you his hands shook but his determination remained firm quickly before he could lose his courage he bent and kissed the cold lips hoping that this too would be forgiven and caught in a grief too deep for tears then he knelt on the icy white marble of the floor beside the bier and braced the hilt of the dagger between his knees clasping his hands with the dagger between his wrists resting them on either side of the bladeedge lendel theres nothing without you forgive me if you can he whispered again both to tylendel and the brooding faces behind the altar and before he could begin to be afraid he pulled both wrists up along the knifeedges slashing them simultaneously the dagger was as sharp as he had hoped sharper than he had expected he cut both wrists almost to the bone gasped as pain shot up his arms and the knife fell clattering to the marble released when his legs jerked involuntarily he sagged with sudden dizziness and fell forward over his bent knees his head bowed over his hands his arms lying limp on the marble floor blood began to spread on the white marble pooled before him under his slashed wrists he stared at it in morbid fascination red on white like blood on the snowit was only at that moment that yfandes seemed to realize what it was he was doing she screamed and began kicking at the door but it was far too late his eyes were no longer focusing properly anymore and his wrists didnt even hurt but he was feeling so cold so very cold im sorry he thought muzzily at the frantic companion beginning to black out and feeling himself falling over sideways yfandes im sorry youll find someone better than me worthy of you gone savils voice broke what the hell do you mean gone savil i swear to you the boy was asleep i dozed off for a breath or two and when i woke up he was gone jaysen answered one hand clutched at the side of his head on a fistful of hair his expression frantic and guiltridden i thought maybe hed gone to the privy or something but i cant find him anywhere savil swung her legs out of the bed and rubbed her eyes trying to think where would vanyel have gone and in the name of the gods why but in a heartbeat she had her answer the frightened frantic scream of a companion rang across the river and her kellans voice shrilled into her head savil the boy and an image of where he was and what he had done from the stricken look on jaysens face his own felar had given him the same information gods savil snatched her cloak from the chair beside her bed and ran out in her bare feet through the common room and headed for the door of vanyels room jaysen breathing down her neck she hit the garden door at a dead run and it was a damned good thing that it wasnt locked because if it had been shed have broken it off the hinges the cold of the night slapped her in the face like an impious hand that stopped her for a moment but only a moment in the next instant felar and kellan pounded up at a gallop felar skidded around in a tight pivot presenting his hindquarters to his chosen who leapfrogged up into his seat with an acrobatic skill that would have had savil muttering about showoffs had the situation been less precarious instead she waited for kellan to come to a dead halt and clambered onto her back anyhow her bedgown rucked up around her legs kellan launched herself into a full frantic gallop as savil clung on as best she could now savil was a breath behind jaysen as the young seneschals herald led the way across the nearest bridge and up the field to the temple of the grove nor were they the only two summoned by the frantic screaming mind and voice of yfandes heralds and trainees were boiling out of the palace like aroused fire ants rendezvousing with their companions and heading across the river at breakneck speed but jaysen and savil were the first two on the scene it was their dubious privilege to see yfandes trying to batter down the solid bronze door of the temple singlehandedly and not budging it by so much as a thumbsbreadth her hooves were screeching across the metal leaving showers of sparks in their wake and her anguished screams were far too like a humans for comfort jaysen vaulted off felars back and hit the ground at a run ducking fearlessly under yfandes flying hooves to make a trial of the door himself its locked from the inside he shouted unnecessarily as savil slid from kellans back to limp to his side he put his shoulder against the door and rammed it with no more luck than yfandes had had vanyel savil put her mouth up against the crack between door and frame and shouted through it van lad let us in she put her ear to the crack and listened but heard nothing kellan yfandes says hes still alive but unconscious and weakening came the grim reply as yfandes danced in place her sapphire eyes gone nearly black with anguish somebody get me a magelight on that damned tower it was mardic he had his hands on donnis shoulders and was staring up at the tower donni was holding a crossbow with a bulky missile cocked and ready savil responded first running far enough back from the door that she could see the top of the belltower it was glowing faintly but obviously too faintly for donni to make out a target savil raised her hands and sent up such a burst of power that the entire top of the tower flowered with light while mardic closed his eyes and scowled in concentration donni raised the crossbow squinted carefully along it and fired the oddlyshaped arrow flew strangely and slowly trailing something light colored behind it and in a moment savil realized why and what it was donni had been a bright little apprenticethief when shed been chosen this was a grapnelarrow meant to carry a light but strong line through an open window and catch on the sill mardic had a very weak but usable fetchinggift he had invoked it to help the arrow carry something heavier than a light line a climbingrope it lobbed through the loop of the bellhouse clanging ominously off the death bell itself savil felt a chill and made a wardinggesture nor was she the only one she could see most of the others shivering at the least and yfandes moaned like a dying thing at the sound of the bell donni normally mobile face gone blank was paying no attention to anything other than her arrow and line all her concentration was on the task in her hand she drew the rope to her with agonizing slowness savil fought down the urge to shout at her to hurry finally donnis careful pulling met resistance she tugged then pulled harder then yanked on the rope with all her might then before savil had time to blink she was swarming up it like a squirrel one or two of the trainees gave a ragged cheer donni ignored them she reached the opening and squeezed through and savil saw to her surprise that mardic was following her shed been so intent on donnis progress that shed missed seeing him altogether until he got into the glow of the magelight savil sprinted back for the door the crowd there parted to let her through and waited trembling with impatience with the rest hang on savil she heard mardics mindvoice in broadsendmode hes alive thank the gods he didnt know the right way to slit his wrists donnis got the blood stopped but we ii need a healer fast fandes warped the door pounding on it its going to take a bit of work to get it open a tall figure in healers greens pushed through to savils side as mardic began pounding on the door forcing the bolt back thumblength by thumblength andrel opened his arms and wrapped savil inside the warmth of his furlined cloak with him finally the door creaked open andrel deserted her leaving her suddenly in sole possession of the heavy cloak she followed inside hard on his heels donni knelt in front of the bier there was a frighteningly wide scarlet stain on the marble of the floor and her hands looked as if she had dipped them in vermilion dye she was holding vanyels wrists the boy was sprawled on the floor beside her at the foot of the bier his face as transparently white as the marble under his head and sickly unconscious andrel was just beginning to kneel in the pool of blood on the other side of the boy heedless of his robes and as savil limped across the floor toward them followed by the rest of the wouldbe rescuers he reached out and set his hands firmly over donnis bloodstained ones his face was fixed in a mask of absolute concentration and savil could feel the power beginning to flow from him but hed been hardpressed today and had little time to rest and she knew that his few reserves were not going to be enough she ran the last few steps and placed her hands on his shoulders as he began to falter sending energy coursing down into his center and in a moment she felt herself joined by jaysen then mardic then donni the four of them meshed in a union that was as nearly perfect as any magic shed ever witnessed and sent andrel all he needed and more in a steady steadfast stream finally the healer sighed and lifted his hands away from donnis the other three disengaged with something that was a little like reluctance it wasnt often that even heralds experienced the peace that came with a perfect healingmeld it was nearly a mystical experience and as close to the peace of the havens as savil ever wanted to get until she was called donni lifted her hands away from vanyels wrists and savil could see that the skin veins and tendons beneath were whole again for a moment the wrists were marred by angry red scars then gradually those scars faded to thin white lines jaysen moved swiftly to gather the unconscious boy in his arms blood from the boys sleeves stained the front of his whites but jaysen didnt seem to notice vanyels head sagged against the heralds chest despite being moved he showed no signs of reviving savil helped andrel to rise and go to him the healer reached out a hand that shook uncontrollably and checked the pulse at the hinge of vanyels jaw lifted an eyelid then shook his head nearer than i like and he lost too much blood given what hes been through andrel said grimacing jays can you and felar get him back into his bed as of a candlemark ago no savil interrupted no you leave that to me and yfandes jays give him to me as soon as i get mounted she pushed her way through the silent shocked crowd and found yfandes waiting as close to the open door as she could get the companion looked deeply into savils eyes her own eyes back to a quiet depthless sapphire then went to her knees for the herald to mount savil mounted and yfandes rose gracefully to her feet not in the least unsteady on the smooth marble savil held out her arms amazed by her own calm and jaysen lifted the limp form of vanyel up into place before her she cradled the boy against her shoulder wrapping andrels cloak about both of them he was no burden at all really almost too light a weight for the ease of her heart and conscience oh lad lad she sighed nudging yfandes lightly with her heels to tell her to go on poor little lad weve made a right mess of your life havent we and all for lack of listening to you i dont know who is guiltier me or withen she held him a bit tighter as yfandes headed at a gentle walk toward the beckoning beacon of the open door of her suite he was all the legacy tylendel had left to her and she pledged the silent sleeper in the temple behind her that she would take better care of him from this moment on and the first task is to put you back together my poor bewildered heartbroken lostling if ever i can ten years later or so it seemed savil finally crawled into some clothing she wanted she needed to collapse somewhere wanted rest as a starving man wants bread but dared not leave vanyel alone she finally dragged the chair jaysen had been using close to the bedside and wrapped herself in the first warm thing that came to hand which turned out to be andrels furlined cloak intending despite her exhaustion to stay awake as long as possible but she dozed off some time around dawn and woke at the sound of a strangled sob she fought her way out of the tangled embrace of the cloak when she got her head free of the folds of the hood the first things she saw were vanyels silver eyes looking at her with a kind of accusative sorrow why he whispered mournfully why did you stop me savil finally untangled the rest of her sat up in her chair and took a quick look around as shed ordered mardic was still standing weary guard over the door to the rest of the suite and donni was drowsing slumped against the door to the garden vanyel was not going to give them the slip a second time however unlikely the prospect seemed it hadnt seemed possible the last time she gave mardic a jerk of her head and a mindsent order out love this needs privacy and woke donni with a quick mindtouch donni came completely awake as soon as savil touched her a talent the heraldmage envied she pulled herself to her feet with the help of the doorframe at her back then both of them left for their own quarters closing the door into the common room of the suite behind them savil got up stiffly every joint aching and sat on the side of the bed taking both of vanyels hands in her own they were like ice and bloodlesslooking i stopped you because had to she replied because vanyel selfdestruction is no answer because weve already lost one we loved and i couldnt lose you too now but i deserve to die his voice was weak and broke on the last word and he wouldnt look her in the eyes oh gods what was going through that head of his what had he convinced himself of for what she asked her voice sounding roughedged even to her because you made some mistakes gods if that was worthy of a death sentence i should have been sharing that knife his hands were chilling hers she tried to warm them chafing them as gently as she could listen to me vanyel this whole wretched mess was one mistake piled on top of another i made mistakes i should have watched lendel more carefully i should have insisted he talk to lancir when his brother was killed thats one of lancirs jobs to keep our heads clear and our minds able to think straight dammit i knew what lendel was capable of where staven was concerned and he would not have been able to hide that obsession from a mindhealer lendel made mistakes the gods themselves know that he should have thought before he acted id been trying to get him to do that we the heralds accept mental evidence all he had to do was ask for a hearing and wed have had the material we needed from his own mind to put the leshara down you made mistakes yes but you made them out of love he needed help asked you for it and you tried to help him the only way anyone had ever taught you was right and gods even gala made mistakes her voice was harsh with tears and with her own guilt and she was not ashamed to let him hear it van van were only simple fallible mortals we arent saints we arent angels we fall on our faces and make errors and sometimes people die of them sometimes people we love dearly she choked on a sob and bowed her head he freed a hand and touched her cheek hesitantly his fingers were still snowcold she caught and held it and looked back up into his eyes seeing worse than grief there before he dropped them you thought the world would be better with you out of it is that it he nodded dumbly and his hands trembled in hers did you stop to think how i would feel you were lendels love didnt you think id come to care for you at least a bit if only for his sake how was she to reach him when shed never been good with words ive buried him today did you think id be indifferent about burying you as well what about jaysen id left him to watch you how do you think he feeis right now about his carelessness what do you think hed have felt if youd died and gods help us what did you think yfandes would do i i thought i thought shed find somebody better he faltered his voice quavering a bit shed die lad companions very seldom outlive their chosen and she chose you if you die she dies shed probably pine herself to death and she does not deserve that he shrank into himself pulling even farther away from her and she cursed her clumsy words her inability to tell him what she really meant without hurting him further van oh hell im not saying any of this the way i wanted to listen to me youre sick you need to rest and get well well deal with this later all right just dont take yourself out of this world right now there are folks wholl have holes in their lives if you go and im one of them he nodded he didnt look convinced but now she had exhausted what little eloquence she possessed and didnt know what else to say to him so she tried one last tactic let me just keep him alive if i can do that maybe we can help him will you promise me on your word of honor that you wont try to do yourself in again if you will ill trust you and i wont leave guards on your doors he swallowed pulled his hands out of hers and whispered haltingly i promise word of honor he still wouldnt look her in the face but she trusted that sworn word she nodded accepted now is there anything anything at all that i can do for you maybe need to talk he shook his head and she sensed his complete withdrawal and cursed again dammit just when i need lance the most hes not here sure she persisted even in the face of defeat that was her nature vanyel vanyel youre the only person ive got who knew lendel from the inside the way i did if if you need somebody to mourn with he shook his head again avoiding her eyes altogether and she sighed giving up if you change your mindwell rest lad get better call if you need anything mind or voice either ill hear you he nodded slightly and closed his eyes again leaning back and turning his face to the wall that face was as white as the pillows beneath it and it made her hurt all over again to see that lost look of his she waited for another response or a request of some kind but he slipped right back into an uneasy shallow slumber finally she eased off the bed gathered up andrels cloak from the chair and left him alone andrel arrived at sunset in response to her invitation to fetch his cloak and share food and thoughts theyd had more than one intimate little supper in their lives many of them in this very room but none so gloomridden mardic and donni had gone off to cautiously interview some of vanyels circle of admirers to see if there was someone else they could contact that might help to bring him out of this mental abyss savils hawkbrother masks on the wall behind andrels left shoulder gazed at her from dispassionate and empty eyeholes candles flickered on the table between them neither of them had much interest in food at the moment both their minds were on the boy sleeping behind the closed door behind savils chair what we need she told andrel glumly eating a dinner she did not taste is lancir we need his mindhealing the boys pulling farther away from touching with every moment hes awake and i cannot get him to let me inside hes barricading himself again a different kind of barricade than that old arrogance but its there all the same and lance bloody would be out of touch right now he sighed his breath making the candleflame flutter and pushed his own food around on his plate with his fork i have to agree with you is there no chance you can get lance back via gate she shook her head shoving her frustration back down out of her way shed already been over this with jaysen not without knowing where he is and hes not a strong enough thoughtsenser to read a broadcastsending and we dont know what route hes taking home could be one of half a dozen if something were wrong with elspeth we could afford to send out halfadozen heralds to look for him but vanyel just is not that important her tone turned acid or so ive been told andrel frowned and his eyebrows met he may become that important im shielding him as much as i can but his trauma is still leaking through half the trainees are depressed to the point of tears right now gifted bardic healer and herald and its all due to vanyels leakage well what do you expect she countered letting him see her very real anger you saw the strength and depth of his gifts even with raw channels hes broadsending without knowing it and he has no more notion of how to shield than how to fly and its not every day youve got one half of a lifebonded pair left after the other half suicides if he were trained hed be leaking but nobody else believes how strong he is they all think im letting my affection for tylendel magnify everything that was connected with him out of all proportion to reality gods he looked up from his plate with the expression of a stunned sheep vanyel and tylendel lifebonded she nodded unhappily im pretty damned sure of it whats more so are mardic and donni and if anyone would recognize a bonding it would be another bonded pair i expected grief mourning the natural responses for a youngster whos lost his first love under rotten bad circumstances i did not expect to find the kind of gaping emotional wounds i saw before he started shutting me out today ive never seen that depth of feeling before in anyone herald or no except mardic and donni so tell me what the hell do i do about a broken lifebond he shook his head obviously at a loss i cant tell you i dont know i dont heal minds i heal bodies and i dont know of anyone who heals hearts she sighed and looked down at her congealing dinner thats what i was afraid youd tell me i have more bad news the relationship between them was one where lendel was the leader and van the follower van had gotten totally dependent on lendel for all his emotional needs i tried to warn lendel but she shrugged and to put the snow on the mountain vans got some guilt hes hiding from me and all i can think is that hes convinced he cursed lendel because he seduced tylendel mind you he didnt from all i know im positive the seduction if seduction it was was mutual but there it is jaysen andrel said positively she nodded good bet my friend jays has got all those kleimar prejudices about samesex pairings he accepted lendel but mostly after i rammed his prejudices right up in his face but vanyel vanyel wasnt even a heraldcandidate when he and lendel paired jays hasnt said a word but you can bet on what he was thinking when he was keeping watch on him resentment that van is alive and lendel dead would be the least of it and vanyel picked it up andrel said sadly probably she took a bite found it catch in her throat and gave up trying to eat shoving the plate away from what i can tell hes sensitive enough to pick up things youve forgotten for years and do it right through your shielding ah gods she rested both elbows on the table and covered her sore eyes with her hands a moment later she felt one of andrels hands stroking her hair and dropped her own back on the table giving him a good long look across the candleflames his deeply green eyes were fixed on her face reflecting a profound concern and what about you he asked barely above a whisper i am trying to reach out to him she said feeling old and tired and about ready to give up i think ive convinced myself that none of this was any more his fault than it was anyone elses i bloody well hope so or hes going to be getting knives in the gut from me too and he doesnt deserve that the rest gods i dont know what to do that isnt what i meant he replied taking his hand away from her hair and reaching for her wrist i want to know how youre weathering this need a shoulder want the truth she tensed all over trying to keep from bawling like a little child yes i need a shoulder and no i am not taking this well i want lendel back andy he was my soulson and i loved him and i want him back with me her voice cracked she lost her veneer of calm and just dissolved into tears andrel got up gracefully and without letting go of her wrist he moved around the table and pulled her to her feet then led her over to the couch and gave her that shoulder she needed so badly the peaceful night rocked vanyel convulsed wailing his cry sounded like something in its death agonies and made savils hair stand on end the room trembled literally the walls shook as vanyels muscles spasmed his eyes were wide open but saw nothing and his pupils dilated with fear he convulsed again and the very foundation of the palace rocked the bed shook as if it were alive his lute fell from the wall landing with a sickening crack that surely meant it was broken past all repair his armorstand crashed over and scattered his equipment across the floor and savil was tossed from his bedside to the floor before she realized it she picked herself up off the floor beside his bed without thinking about safety or bruises and flung herself at him again he thrashed beneath her fighting her with a paranormal strength he couldnt know where he was or who she was all she could read from him was terrible agony and beneath the pain confusion panic entrapment she caught his wrists and tried to pinion them against the pillows then tried to pin him down with the blankets his chest arched against hers he screamed and the walls shook again mardic lay in the corner behind her quite unconscious donni had his head in her lap and she was trying to protect him from falling objects with her own body vanyel had thrown him against the wall when this nightmare or whatever it was had started and mardic had made the mistake of trying to touch his mind to wake him donni savil used a moment of lull to mindtouch her pupil taking a tiny fragment of her attention from the attempt attempt for it wasnt succeeding to shield vanyel to get him under some kind of control donni hows mardic hes all right just stunned came the reassuring reply i can spare you something catch this quick the girl threw her a mental line and began sending additional sorelyneeded energy down it as soon as savil caught it it helped to keep savil from blacking out as vanyel lashed out with his mind but that was about all jaysen was coming on the run savil could feel him reaching out to find out what the hell was going on and felt the panic in his mind when he realized they had a powerful gifted trapped in a painloop and hallucination he all but broke down the door trying to get in and flung himself into the affray without a second thought shield him dammit he shouted throwing himself across vanyels legs as the walls but thank the gods not the foundations again shook im trying she snapped back giving up on the uneven struggle to pin vanyel down and settling for securing his arms he breaks them as fast as i get them up jaysen succeeded in getting vanyel physically restrained where she being lighter had failed he added his strength to savils and donnis on the crumbling shields they were trying to get on the boy but it wasnt even stalemate they were losing him to his own nightmares andrel appeared savil didnt even see or sense him run in he was just there all in an instant but instead of flinging himself into the melee he grabbed their arms and pulled both of them off the boy then he reached down for something at his feet and came up with a bucket of icy water he doused the boy bed and all without a heartbeat of hesitation the convulsions stopped as vanyel came abruptly awake he sat up stared then he suddenly went limp the room stopped shaking savil get me a blanket andrel ordered quietly jays help me get him out of that wet bed before he goes into shock then get the bedding stripped before the mattress gets soaked by the time savil returned with the goosedown comforter from her bed the two men had pulled the halfstunned boy from the tangled mess of watersoaked bedcoverings and the bedding was piled on the floor andrel was carefully shaking the boys shoulders while jaysen supported him behind them mardic was groggily climbing to his knees donni steadying him but the two of them waved savil off when she made a halfstep in their direction were all right donni mindspoke iii get mardic into bed myself and then ill come make up the bed in here again savil turned her attention back to the boy knowing she could trust donni to deal with the situation if she had said she could come on vanyel andrel was saying coaxingly come on lad come back to us wake up come out of it vanyel blinked blinked again and sense came back into his eyes he looked about him momentarily confused then the destruction about him seemed to register on him he closed his eyes a soft hardly audible moan coming from the back of his throat and for one instant savil was nearly flattened beneath an overwhelming load of blackest despair terrible guilt and a grief so heavy she felt her knees start to give way beneath the weight of it then it was gone absolutely cut off and so completely that for a moment even she doubted that she had felt it but one look at andrel and jaysen convinced her otherwise the former was deeply shaken and the latter whitelipped she expected tenderness and concern from andrel but strangely enough it was jaysen who carefully got the boy into a chair wrapped in the comforter and from the chair back into the bed when donni had stripped it of the wet coverings and remade it it was jaysen who stayed beside him leaving savil free to see to it that mardic was truly all right savil wasnt in a mood to ask questions about his apparent change of heart mardic was fine and relatively cheerful ill have a godsawful headache he told her poor van thought i was going to kill him took me for an enemy in his dream when he realized it was a dream he pulled most of it most of it savil choked he flattened you and he pulled most of it near as i can tell mardic put both hands to his temples and massaged a little well when he pulled the blow the energy overflowed into those raw channels and hurt him and he went over the edge couldnt control anything then i think he lost his center and got lost in his own pain andrel had the right notion physical shock is what gave him something to home in on but you are going to be all right he gave her half a grin if youll let me get some sleep savil took the statement as an unsubtle request and made a hasty exit she got back just in time to see andrel give vanyel some kind of sedative to drink but it was jaysen who sat with the boy until andrels sedative took effect and it was jaysen who righted the armorstand and picked up the brokenbacked lute from the floor with a wince at seeing the fine instrument so ruined ill see to getting this fixed if it can be he said when he saw savil watching him before she knelt to put out the fire they darent have a fire here while vanyel was asleep nor candles burning either not unless andrel could do something to keep him from going into another fit jays what am i going to do with him she asked quietly standing up with a wince as a pulled muscle in her back told her what a fool shed been he motioned that she should precede him out the door and she half turned to see his face as she walked past him hes sick with backlash and hes getting sicker not better his channels are all raw you cant mindtouch him without doing that to him throwing him into convulsions that was what set all this off mardic trying to soothe him out of a bad dream what am i going to do the next time he has a nightmare jaysen shrugged helplessly and shut the door behind her she made a circuit of the common room setting candles erect and lighting them if you dont know be damned if i do andy can we keep him sedated long enough to heal andrel grimaced looking as if hed swallowed something sour with any other patient id tell you where to put that question what i just gave the boy was argonel jaysen and savil both started with surprise and in savils case the surprise was not unmixed with shock great good gods andy ease up hes safe enough andrel interrupted her throwing himself down on the couch with his usual lack of concern for the furniture he groaned stretched and then raised an eyebrow at the seneschals herald jaysen may i mention that you have lovely legs jaysen who was attired only in shirt and hose and only just now really realized this blushed a furious scarlet but refused to be distracted argonel andy he began taking a chair and crossing his legs primly hes burning it off at a respectable rate or i wouldnt have given it to him andrel replied the benefit of it is that its a muscle relaxant and a sedative he wont be able to go into convulsions again even if you mindtouch him i wont speak for him tossing the palace around but he wont go into physical convulsions as for him healing well that depends entirely on what you mean savil took another chair flopping down into it with a tired thud as loud as the one andrel had made connecting with the couch cushions physically she said flatly pure physical healing backlash symptoms exhaustion blood loss ill worry about raw channels later yes i can keep him sedated long enough for the effects of backlash to wear off for his physical energy to recover and for him to replace the blood he lost i can combine the argonel with jervain and dull out all the giftsenses enough so that they arent so sensitive that might let the channels heal i dont know for sure ive never seen nor read of anything like this gifts being blasted open like his were mentally jaysen prodded frowning emotionally at this point i dont think even lance can help him andrel replied sadly you both felt jaysen nodded ruefully thats i think perhaps i picked up something more than either of you he said a shadow of guilt crossing his face he he thinks that everything he touches is doomed cursed because of what he and lendel were and i know exactly where he got that particularly poisonous little thought only it isnt a little thought anymore its as much an obsession as tylendels was he hung his head and wouldnt look at her i never thought he faltered i never guessed i thought he was just a user savil was not feeling charitable just now damn right you never thought she snapped you never thought at all you and your damned provincial savil andrel said warningly his head turned slightly to the side nodding at the door to vanyels room she subsided if she got angry van might pick it up it might set him off again sorry jays she finally said grudgingly not feeling sorry at all at least you didnt send somebody out to cut their wrists he answered unhappily she winced no i just hell this isnt getting us anywhere andy you think you can get him physically recovered right candlelight reflected in his eyes which had gone inwardlooking i would say yes cautiously lets worry about that then for a couple of days i have a germ of an idea but whether or not i can pull it off is going to depend very strongly on whether or not you can get vanyel fit to ride if i cant get him to that point in the next couple of weeks or so its never going to happen andrel replied whats the chance we can do something about the way hes barricading himself or even help him get some of his power under his own control he pondered her question while the fire crackled beside him why dont you ask your companions he may be able to barricade against you but i doubt he can do much against yfandes she pressed her hand to her eyes and shook her head gods why in hell didnt i think of that and at the same time mindsent kellan knowing that jaysen was doing the same with felar here came the reply immediately she sent their dilemma in a complicated thoughtburst and waited while kellan digested the information and possibly conferred with felar and yfandes yfandes says that the bonding is weak came the reply flavored with the acid tang of concern it fades in and out and it hurts the boy sometimes to speak with her can we do anything about that jaysen fell into the rapport and if there was anything other than genuine distress there on vanyels behalf savil couldnt feel it through him she could hear felar physical contact felar said shortly kellan agreed as much as possible that is what strengthens the bonding now she cannot help him to get control of what he does and if the bond is strengthened jaysen asked perhaps said felar a hope added kellan jaysen looked into savils eyes from across the room and nodded a little grimly at this point they would accept even a hope however tenuous nothing hurt much now not since hed drunk that fiery stuff the redhaired healer had given him those places inside him the mindthings that had burned so they still burned but remotely as if the hurting belonged to somebody else he couldnt concentrate on much of anything for very long and none of it really seemed to matter only the empty place in him was pretty much the same only that continued to ache in a way the healers potions couldnt seem to touch the place where tylendel had been and now but the potions let him sleep a sleep without dreams and hed had the snowdreams again that was what had thrown him into that fit oh gods hed thought hed thought theyd never come again hed thought lendel had driven them away but they werent the dreams about being walled in by ice so maybe lendel had maybe not he couldnt tell it was the other dream anyway clear vivid as no other dream hed dreamed had ever been and much more detailed than the last time hed had it hed been in a canyon a narrow mountain pass with walls that were peculiarly smooth hed known in the dream that this was no real pass that this passage had been created cut armlength by armlength by magic hed known too that the magic had been wrong skewed it had an aura of pain and death about it as if every thumblength of that canyon had been paid for in spilled blood it had been night cloudy with a smell of snow on the wind where he stood the canyon had narrowed momentarily choked by avalanches on either side hed been very cold despite the heavy weight of a fur cloak on his shoulders his feet had been like blocks of the ice that edged the canyon walls he had felt a feeling of grim satisfaction when hed seen that at this one point the passage was wide enough for two men but no more and he knew that he had somehow caused those blockages to create a place where one man could conceivably hold off an army because an army was what was coming down that canyon hed sent for help sent yfandes and tylendel tylendel but tylendel was dead but hed also known that help was unlikely to arrive in time he had waited until they were almost on him suspecting nothing and knowing that they could not see him yet because he willed it so then he had raised his right hand high over his head and a magelight had flared on it so bright that the front ranks of that terrible army winced back and their shadows fell black as the heart of night on the snow behind them he had said nothing nothing needed to be said he barred the way that was all the challenge required they were heavily armored those fighters armor of some dull black stuff and helms of the same they carried the weight of that armor as easily as vanyel wore his own white fur cloak they bore unornamented round shields again of the same dull black material and carried long broadswords for the rest what could be seen of their clothing under the armor and their cloaks over it they were a motley lot but they moved with a kind of sensitivity to the presence of the nextinline that had told vanyel in the dream that they had been drilled together by a hand more merciless than ever jervis had been they stared at him and none of them moved for a very long time until the front ranks parted and the wizard stepped through wizard he was and no doubt vanyel could feel the power heavy within him but it was power of the same kind as that which had cut this canyon paid for in agony and when it was gone there would be no more until the wizard could torture and kill again vanyel had all the power of life itself behind him the power of the sleeping earth of the living forest he spread his arms and the lifeenergy flowed from him creating a barricade across the valley like the barricade across his heart and a shield behind which he could shelter he faced the wizard head held high defiance in the slightest movement daring him to try and pass but the ranks of the fighters parted again and the first wizard was joined by a second and a third and vanyel felt his heart sinking seeing his own death sentence written in those threetoone odds still he had stood his ground until mardic touched his mind it had hurt that touch salt on raw flesh hed interpreted it as an attack of the wizards and had struck back struck to kill and only as hed made his strike had realized that a dream oh gods its a dream it isnt real and thats mardic and had tried to pull the blow had pulled the blow but that sent the aborted power coursing back down places that burned in agony when it touched them and hed tried to stop the flow but that had only twisted things up inside him until he was a thrashing knot of anguish and he didnt know where he was or what he was doing it all hurt everything hurt everything burned and he was trapped in the pain in the torment crying out and knowing no one could hear him and lost he couldnt feel his body anymore couldnt hear or see he was foundering in a sea of agony then a shock like being struck he found himself gasping for breath frozen to his teeth but back in a normal body that hurt in a normal way then he had blacked out for a moment came to with the healer shaking him talking to him he was soaking wet and shivering mardic what about mardic the herald jaysen was holding him upright more than half supporting him tylendel dead crumpled at jaysens feet my fault oh gods my fault the grieving came down on him full force but somewhere at the back of his mind he knew that they were feeling what he was feeling and he clamped down on it closed that line off in the stunned mental silence he heard jaysens anguished thoughts as clearly and intimately as if he was speaking them into vanyels ear gods oh gods i didnt know i didnt guess i thought he was playing with the boy i thought he was oh gods what have i done he shuddered away from the unwanted sympathy from the mindwords that were like acid in his wounds and blocked that line just as ruthlessly then had come the potions and the numbness the blessed unfeeling he drifted nothing to hold him not even his worry for mardic it was pitchy dark they hadnt left a single flame in the room which under the circumstances was probably wise scraps of what he now knew were thoughts drifted over to him now savils mindvoice now jaysens dark with guilt and vanyel wondered why now mardics if he had been on his feet he would have staggered with relief at hearing that last i didnt kill him thank the gods i didnt kill him he drifted farther until he couldnt hear anything anymore until he lost even his own thoughts until there was nothing left but sleep and the sorrow that never ever left him savil stood beside the garden door with one hand on the frame and prayed she didnt pray often most heralds didnt praying usually meant asking for something and the kind of person that became a herald tended to be the kind that didnt look outside of himself for help until the last hope had been exhausted for savil at least it had gotten to that point just beyond the window bundled in quilts and blankets and halflying against yfandes side vanyel dozed in the sun still kept in a sleepy halfdaze by andrels potions jaysen had carried him out there with his own mind so tightly shielded against leaking his thoughts that savil fair saw him quivering under the strain jaysen would be back for the boy in another two candlemarks which was all andrel would allow in this cold this was the third day of the routine there had been no real repetition of the crisis that had precipitated it but savil more than half expected one every night vanyel sighed in sleep and one arm stole out of the blankets to circle around yfandes neck the companion nuzzled his ear and instead of pulling away he cuddled closer to her but before savil had a chance to really take in this first positive sign that the heraldcompanion bond was taking root in the boy someone pounded on her outer door she halfturned and heard donni pattering across the common room to answer it there was a murmur too indistinct to make but the voice from outside the door strengthened please im vans sister let me at least talk to my aunt savil started and strode quickly across vanyels room pulling open the door there could only be one of vanyels sisters likely to show up on her doorstep at this point the one that had fostered out in hopes of a career in the guard let her in donni savil said and blinked in surprise the girl in the doorway could have been herself at seventeen or eighteen god help her no wonder she went for the guard savil thought irrelevantly shes got that damned ashkevron nose evidently the same thought was running through the girls mind you must be my aunt savil she said forthrightly standing at what was almost attention in the doorway you have the nose im lissa can i help savil decided that she liked this blunt girl perhaps i dont know yet she replied first lissa come in and tell me what youve heard lissa turned away from the garden door with a shudder he looks like hes been dragged through the nine hells facedown she said and at that he looks better than he did three days ago savil replied she would have said more but there was another pounding on the suite door and a voice she knew only too well rumbled angrily when donni answered it like bloody hell shes too busy lord withen ashkevron snarled i didnt bloody ride my best horse to foundering to be put off with atoo damned busy now where in hell is she savil with lissa at her side strode across to the door flung it open and stood facing withen with her back pokerstraight feet slightly apart arms crossed over her chest what do you want withen she asked flatly narrowing her eyes in mingled annoyance and apprehension what the hell do you think i want he growled ignoring lissa and donni as if they werent there placing his fists on his hips and taking an aggressive widelegged stance i want to know what the hell youve been doing with the boy i sent you i sent him down here for you to make a man out of him not turn him into a perverted little catamite his face darkened and his voice rose with every word i i think thats more than enough withen she snapped cutting him off before he could build up to whatever climax he had in mind i i i dammit you blustering peabrain is that all you ever think of yourself vanyel almost died four days ago he almost died again three days ago and he could die or go mad in the next candlemark and all you can think of is that he did something your backcountry prejudices dont approve of gods above and below you cani even call him by his bloody name just the boy she advanced on him with such anger in her face that he actually fell back a pace alarm and surprise chasing themselves across his eyes lissa moved with her and stood beside her with every muscle tensed and her fists clenched into hard knots you come storming in here when weve maybe maybe got him stable without so much as a please or a may i you dont even ask if hes in any shape to put two words together in a sensible fashion oh no all you can do is scream that i ve made him into a catamite when you sent him to be made into a man a man she laughed a harsh cawing sound that clawed its way up out of her throat my gods what the hell did you think he was tell me withcn what kind of a man would send his son into strange hands just because the poor thing didnt happen to fit his image of masculinity savil ran out of things to say but lissa hadnt what kind of a man would let a brutal bully break his sons arm for no damned reason the girl snarled what kind of a man would drive his son into becoming an emotional eunuch because every damned time the boy looked for a little bit of paternal love he got slapped in the face what kind of a man would take anyones word over his sons with no cause to ever think the boy was a liar lissa faced down her father as if he had become her enemy you tell me father what right do you have to demand anything of him what did you ever give him but scorn when did you ever give him a single thing he really needed or wanted when did you ever tell him hed done well when did you ever say you loved him withen backed up another two paces his back against the wall beside the door his expression that of someone who has just been poleaxed savil found her tongue again a man may all the gods give you what you deserve you fathead what kind of a man would care more for his own reputation than his sons life she was backing him into the corner now unleashing on withen all the pain and frustration and anger shed been keeping bottled up inside her over the past week he had gone pale and started to try to say something but she cut him off let me tell you this withen she hissed everything that vanyels become you had a hand in making and mostly because you didnt want a son you just wanted a little toy copy of yourself to parade around so that people could congratulate you on your bedroom prowess you helped make him what he is gave him a set of values so distorted its a wonder he even recognized love when he saw it and taught him that he had to keep everything he felt secret because adults couldnt be trusted and now i have one boy dead and one a hair from dying and all you care about is that somebody might think you werent manly enough to father manly sons oh get out of here get out of my sight she turned away from him before he could see the tears in her eyes lissa put a steadying hand on her shoulder and glared at her father as if she would be perfectly happy to take a piece out of him if he said one wrong word sssavil i i he stammered they said but i didnt believe is vanyel one wrong word one wrong move and he will die withen she said flatly her eyes shut tightly as she reestablished control over herself one wrong thought almost killed him he slit his wrists because he discovered that someone he trusted believed that his love was the reason tylendel died are you pleased with what you made it was certainly the honorable thing for him to do wasnt it i i i am very gratified to be able to tell you that he isnt yours anymore withen hes mine hes been chosen if he lives that long hell be a heraldtrainee and as such he is my charge youve forfeited any claim on him so you can have what youve always wanted little mekeal can be your heirdesignate and you can wash your hands of vanyel with a clear conscience withen flinched at her pitilessly accurate words and seemed to almost shrink in size savil i didnt mean i didnt want you didnt she raised an ironic eyebrow he winced savil can i see him i wont hurt him i dammit hes still my son lissa do you think we should lissa looked at her father as one looks at a notparticularlytrustworthy stranger i dont know that he can behave himself withens face darkened you ungrateful little lissa shrugged and said to savil see what i mean savil nodded i see but he has a point maybe he ought to see his handiwork she nodded toward the door to vanyels room follow me withen and keep a rein on that mouth of yours or ill have you thrown out he stopped dead at the garden door and pressed his hands and face against the glass in stunned disbelief my gods he gasped they said but i didnt believe them savil ive seen men dead a week that looked better than that lissa snorted savil pushed him away from the door impatiently and opened it flinching a bit as the cold air hit her she looked back at him hed made no move to follow are you coming or not she asked keeping her voice low so as not to startle vanyel he swallowed his own face set and very white and followed her with slow hesitant steps she walked quickly to the patch of sheltered sungilded brown grass where the boy was lying with yfandes he hadnt moved since shed left he didnt seem to notice she was there as she knelt in the harsh dry grass that prickled her knees through the cloth of her breeches and hose van van wake up a little can you she said softly not touching him at all either with hand or mind van he moved his head a little and blinked in a kind of halfdazed parody of sleepiness aaunt he murmured your fathers here withen he wants to see you vanyel he cant take you home he has no power over you now that youre chosen you dont have to see him if you dont want to vanyel blinked again showing a little more alertness nno sall right fandes says sall right says i should savil rose quickly and returned to where withen waited uncertainly on the worn path halfway between the door and where the boy lay go ahead she said roughly dont raise your voice and speak slowly weve got him pretty heavily drugged so keep that in mind you might trigger more than you want to hear if you arent careful she followed a few steps behind him with lissa behind her and remained within earshot as he knelt heavily in the dry grass and started to reach out to touch vanyels shoulder she very nearly snapped at him but vanyel roused a bit more and waved the blunt fingers away vanyel the man said seeming at a complete loss for words vanyel i i heard you were sick vanyel gave a pitiful little croak of a laugh you hheard i was playin ewe t lendens ram ymean don lie t me father you lied t me all mlife an i couldn prove it but i know when people lie tme now withen flushed but vanyel wasnt through yet yre thinkin now that i im pervrtd unclean or somethin an that i im just bad an ungrateful an i nnever pppleased you an dammit all i ev wanted was fr you t tell me i did somethin right just once father jjjust one time an all you ever dddid was let jjjervis knock me flat an then kick me yrself lendel loved me an i loved him an you can stop thinkin those god damned rotten things withen pulled back and started to his feet opened his mouth like he was about to roar at his son but that was as far as he got vanyels eyes blazed his face went masklike with rage and before withen could utter a single syllable vanyel surged up out of his cocoon of blankets and knocked withen head over heels into the bushes with the untrained halfdrugged power of his mind alone withen struggled up vanyel knocked him flat lissa made as if to go to one or the other of them but savil caught her arm look at yfandes she said shes calm she hasnt even moved let them have this out between us i think yfandes and i could keep the lad from killing his father but that isnt what he wants to do twice more withen tried to get his feet and twice more vanyel flung him back he was crying now silent unnoticed tears streaking his white cheeks hows it feel father am i strong enough now hows it feel t get knocked down an stepped on by somethin you cant reason with an cant fight you happy im as big a bully as jjjervis now does that make you bloody happy withens mouth worked but no sound came out of it vanyel stared at him then the angry light faded from his eyes and was replaced by a disgusted bitterness it doesnt make me happy father he said quietly and clearly the last of the drughaze gone from his speech knowing i can do this to you just makes me sick nothing makes me happy anymore nothing ever will again he sank back down to the ground pulled his blankets around himself and turned his face into yfandes shoulder go away father he said voice muffled just go away withen got slowly and awkwardly to his feet he stood shaken and pale looking down at his son for a long time would it make any difference if i said i was sorry he asked finally from the bewildered expression on his face acutely troubled and more than that vaguely aware that he had just had his entire world knocked headoverheels and was entirely uncertain of what to do or say or even be next maybe someday came the voice thickened with tears not now go away father please leave me alone dear withen i think you are right for once in your life the boy is not a boy anymore he never was the boy you thought he was if you can adapt yourself to treating him as an adult and an acquaintance rather than your offspring i think you can come to some kind of a reconciliation with him eventually savil savil looked up mardic peeked around savils halfopen door uncertainty in his very posture huh im getting better at reading people she gave a quick glance out her window vanyel was sitting on the bench just outside it talking with lissa yfandes hovering over both of them bless the child i dont know what id do without her for a moment she forgot mardic a terrible weariness bowed down her shoulders like a tooheavy cloak gods what am i going to do hes not getting better just a little stronger he keeps trying to make me or liss into a substitute for lendel into someone else to follow i cant let him do that it ii just make things ultimately worse but when we try and push him into standing on his own feet he goes into a sulk she sighed it makes me so angry at him that i want to slap him into next week and hes had too much of that already he doesnt really deserve it either hellfires those sulks are the closest hes ever gotten to normal behavior oh gods mardic cleared his throat and she jumped im sorry lad im woolgathering must be getting old come on in he edged into the room crabwise savil donni and i want to ask you something he faltered hands behind his back rubbing his left foot against his right ankle we savil youre the best there is but vanyel needs you more than we do gods she sighed rubbing her right temple i have been shorting you two i am sorry no really we dont mind donni interrupted poking her curly head past the edge of the door just behind mardics shoulder i was wondering when youd put in your silverworth savil replied we do come as a set she pointed out no savil you havent been shorting us its more that were afraid youre going to split yourself in half trying to do too many things vanyel needs you weve finally got what we needed from you there wasnt anybody else likely to be able to teach us to work in concert but look mardic moved farther into the room donni stayed by the door they reached out to one another arms extended and hands not quite touching and where there had been two auras there was now one a goldengreen flow over and around them that was seamless and considerably more than either aura had been alone savil blinked in surprise just when did you two start to do that she asked the night when we had to get the temple open mardic supplied when we had to get the arrow up and then even more when we meshed in the healingmeld thats when what youd been showing us sort of fell into place so well now any heraldmage could teach us and really given what we do together it probably ought to be jaysen or lancir but jaysen hasnt got anyone right now piffle youd make a threehour tale of a limerick donni sniffed savil we asked jaysen he said hed take us if you allow it savil put down her pen and closed her gaping mouth i think i may kiss you both she replied as donni gave mardic an i told you so grin i was trying to think of a way to get you another mentor and coming up blank because i m the only one who knows how to teach concert work bless you loves she rose and took both of them in her arms they returned the embrace their support as much mental as physical savil donni said quietly as she released them with real reluctance what are you going to do with vanyel hes hes still so broken and everything here has just got to keep reminding him of lendel its too bad you cant take him somewhere really different gods thats only too true she replied really different gods oh gods thank you for bright little proteges donni she said slowly i think you may just have found my answer for me now im even more grateful to you for finding yourselves a new teacher youve got an idea savil nodded and kill two birds with one stone those things the leshara had brought in they had to be from the pelagirs just like what lendel conjured in retribution id have had to go out there anyway to find out whos been tampering so what im going to do is take vanyel there to some friends of mine the hawkbrothers theyre selfappointed guardians of the pelagirs so they should be told if theres been a mage tampering with their creatures and they follow a different discipline maybe they can help van and if they cant i know they can at least contain him but you really think they can help him donni asked hopefully well i cant i know for a fact that starwind is better than i am besides if we keep van drugged much longer andrel is afraid hell become addicted but if we take him off he could wreck the palace mardic nodded solemnly when are you taking him when within the next few days i think the sooner the better she looked over his head to the wingsister talisman on her wall the only problem is that to find starwind ktreva and moondance ktreva ill have to go to them because they dont ever come out of the pelagirs that means two things ill have to build a gate and ill have to hope that i still know how to find them eleven gods i hate gating savil muttered to andrel squinting against the glare of sun on snow as she scanned the sky for even a hint of cloud why other than the recent rotten associations its damned dangerous at the best of times it plays fast and loose with local weather systems for one thing its a spell that sets up a local energy field a kind that disrupts any kind of highenergy weather pattern thats around it usually for the worse she closed her eyes centered and grounded and extended her magegift sense up and out looking farther afield for anything that might move in while she had the gate up to her vast relief there didnt seem to be anything of consequence anywhere nearby the only energypatterns she could read were a few rising air currents over warm spots too small to be any hazard she sighed well the weathers not going to cause any problems how was the lad drugged to his teeth and i would stake my arm that he wont be able to count to one before some time tonight and i am damned glad you told me that you were planning on gating out of here andrel tucked his long sensitive hands inside his cloak and peered across the open field through the sunlight since it was gateenergy that blew his channels open probably savil interrupted all right probably blew his channels open hes going to be doubly sensitive to it for the rest of his life hell likely know when someones opening a gate within a league of him and actually going through one may touch off another fit which is why you drugged him to the teeth i have no objection its a little awkward but thats why we have the kind of saddles for our companions that we do they crunched their way across companions field now covered with the first snowfall of the season savil repeated a quieting exercise for every step she made for she knew she needed to establish absolute calm within herself she would be gating to her absolute physical limits in terms of the distance she planned to cover and that would take every reserve she had in light of that she had turned everything other than establishing the gate itself over to the hands of others mardic and donni had done all her packing lissa had taken care of vanyels and lissa had taken charge of the boy once andrel was finished with him they were all waiting at the grove temple at this very moment so why else dont you like gating andrel asked while the field around them glowed under the sun because when i get there im going to be pretty damned worthless she replied dryly and id better hope the talisman performs the way starwind claimed it was supposed to or well be a pretty pathetically helpless pair vanyel and i why dont you do what tylendel did use someone elses energy because i dont really know what he did she said after a long pause that was punctuated only by the sound of their footsteps breaking through the light crust of snow none of us do that may be why we ended up feeding the energy back through poor van instead of grounding and dissipating it i personally do not care to take the chance of doing that to another living soul and neither do any of the others vanyel lived through it someone else might not and it may well be that you have to have a lifebound pair to carry it off at all so she shrugged we do this the hard way and i fall on my nose on the other side they entered the grove the leafless trees making a lacework of dark branches against the bright blue sky the peace of the grove never left it no matter what the season was that was one reason why savil had chosen to set up the gate here the other was that it was the safest place on the palace grounds that she could put a gate no one but heralds ever came here without invitation there should be no accidents caused by a stranger wandering by at the wrong moment the group waiting by the temple which looked today as if it had been newlymade of the same pure snow that covered the ground around it was a small one jaysen donni and mardic and lissa there were only two companions there kellan and yfandes companions tended to avoid the grove except when a herald died vanyel was slumped over in yfandes saddle wrapped in the warmest cloak savil could find and strapped down securely enough that his companion could fight or flee without losing him avert savil thought a little superstitiously let there be no reason for her to have to fight weve had enough bad fortune without that she went first to his side his hands had been loosely tied together at the wrist and the bindings were hooked over the pommel of the saddle the stirrupirons were gone probably stored in one of the packs bundled behind his saddle the stirrupleathers had been turned into straps binding his calves to the saddle itself he was belted twice at the waist once to the pommel once to the high cantle using rings on the saddle meant for exactly that purpose he was not going to come off andrel reached her side he reached up and pried open one of vanyels eyelids the boy didnt react at all and his pupils were mere pinpoints the healers eye unfocused for a moment as he read the boy then he nodded with satisfaction he should be all right savil no more drugs though after this not even if those friends of yours savil shook her head they dont like this kind of drug not for any reason drugs like youve been giving him are too easy to abuse i dont like them either but there are times youve got no other choice and this was one of them andrel touched the boys hand his green eyes darkened as he brooded for a moment gods i hope youre right about these people his channels havent healed at all not really if they cant help us no one can savil turned her back on her semiconscious charge and faced the door of the temple and put herself into the right mindset to invoke her spell to build a gate it was the most personal of spells only one person could build a gate because only one mind could direct the energy needed to build it the spellwielder had to have a very exact notion of where the gate was to exit and no two people ever had precisely the same mental image of a place in any event only savil had ever been in the ktreva territory of the pelagirs she couldnt be fed by another heraldmage since she would need every bit of her attention for the gate itself and would have none to spare to channel incoming energy lastly because the energy had to be so intimately directed it could come from only one place from within the builder of the gate or perhaps one soulbound to the builder of the gate a lifebond was at such a deep level that it wasnt conscious so perhaps that was why tylendel had succeeded in using vanyel as his source of energy the kind of power needed to build a gate was the kind that could be stored could be planned for but like a vessel that could only hold so much liquid a mage could only hold so much energy within himself savil had prepared for this she could replenish herself within a day when the spell was completed and the gate dismissed but for that critical period of twentyfour candlemarks she would be exhausted physically mentally and magically no time to think of that get to it woman first the portal then the weaving the temple door had been used so many times before as one end of a gate that it needed no special preparation she needed only to reach she raised her hands closed her eyes and centered herself so exactly that everything about her vanished from her attention there was only the power within her and the place where the gate would begin i call upon the portal she molded the power into a frame upon the physical frame of the doorway building it layer upon layer until it was strong enough to act as an anchor to hold this place when she warped space back upon itself then she began spinning out threads of energy from the framework they drifted outward seeking this is the place she told them silently willing them to find the realworld counterpart of the image in her mind where the rocks are so and the trees grow thus and the feel of the earth is in this manner they spun out longer finer more attenuated when they weakened she fed them from within herself spinning her own substance out and feeling it drawn out of her now she was losing strength it felt exactly as if she were bleeding from an open wound and the power was not merely draining from her anymore it was being pulled from her by the gate itself this was the point of greatest danger for a heraldmage she was having to fight the gate to keep from being drained right down to unconsciousness then one of those questing powerthreads caught on something out beyond the farthest range of her sensing another followed there was a silent explosion of light that she could see even through her closed lids and the gate wove itself in an instant into a temporary but stable whole she dropped her hands opened her eyes and swayed with uttermost exhaustion kellan was there beside her in time for her to catch the pommel of her saddle to keep from falling the door of the temple was no longer within the doorframe instead the white marble glowing now even in the bright sunlight framed a strange and twisted bit of landscape thats where youre going jaysen said doubtfully looking at the weird shapes of rock snow and sand that lay beyond the portal it was snowing there from black lowering clouds fat flakes drifting down through still dark air savil nodded thats it thats the edge of the pelagirs near starwinds territory the other end is a cave entrance so well have some shelter on the other side until starwind and moondance get there and if they dont jaysen asked savil i dont like to think of you two alone out in a place like that the boy is next to useless and youre exhausted jays its quite possible that theyd take one look at you and kill you if they didnt see me right there with you she said clinging to the saddle and trying to muster enough strength to climb into it theyre unbelievably territorial and secretive and for good reasons think for a minute will you they have to have known someone was tampering stealing creatures they thought safely locked up if they see a stranger and sense hes magegifted theyre likely to strike first and ask questions of the corpse and i mean that literally im taking enough risk bringing the boy in and hes plainly in need of help and branded as mine she gave up trying to be selfsufficient boost me up will you she asked humbly jaysen went her one better with the help of andrel he lifted her into place have you got everything you need i think so in actual fact she was too tired to think it was all she could do to keep her mind on the next step of the journey toss the firewood through four heavy bundles of dry seasoned wood went through the gate to land in the snow on the other side vanyel whimpered beside her she could see his face was creased with lines of pain hes feeling it like andy thought he might better hurry mardic she said quietly donni savils proteges came solemnly to her stirrup she held out her hands to them and shared a moment of mindmelded intimacy with them that was more than farewell it was a sharing of gifts her pride in them and love and blessing and their love and wellwishing for her lissa the girl came to stand beside her students i cant begin to thank you savil began awkward as ever with words thank me by bringing van home well lissa replied earnestly thats all i want she reached up and squeezed savils hand once then backed away the youngsters moved out of the way and jaysen and andrel came to take their place without any prompting she gave a hand to each closing her eyes again and opening herself to them in a melding even more intimate than she had shared with her students for there were no secrets among the three of them and nothing held back what she had not told mardic and donni was that there might be no returning from this journey if she failed with vanyel he might well destroy both of them his gifts were that powerful even now he moaned again in his druginduced slumber feeling the gate energies despite a dose of narcotic that would have rendered a less sensitive gifted unconscious for a week for a moment she was angry he could kill us and do it without knowing what he was doing oh gods gods you owe him dammit youve taken his love at the least give him something in return but she was too tired too depleted to sustain even her anger at fate or the gods or whatever especially when this might really be farewell so this was a moment when she asked forgiveness of her friends for anything she might have done in the past and they asked for and received the same from her when she raised her heavy weary head the two pairs of eyes green and gray that met hers were bright with tears that would not be shed at least not now she squeezed their hands and let go they stepped away from her as she straightened in her saddle took a deep breath and faced the gate and the gray landscape beyond it it looked no more welcoming now than it had before and dallying wasnt going to make the leaving easier all right kellan she mindspoke lets go and they rode into the stomachchurning vertigo she had come to hate savil huddled beside the fire with her legs curled under her forcing herself to stay awake there was thank the gods no wind the cave was warming fairly quickly it smelled of damp though and of the musty taint of the halfrotten leaves that had blown in here with the autumn winds that damp meant that if she let the fire die it would chill down very quickly a chill that would penetrate even their thick wool cloaks once shed taken the gate down shed had just enough strength to lay the fire and start it with the coal shed brought in a firesafe after that shed sunk to the sand next to it pulling vanyel close in beside her he was curled up against her now bundled with her inside her cloak his head in her lap he shook like a reed in the wind from time to time he moaned and his hand groped for something that seemed to elude him she soothed him back into sleep stroking his hair until he finally recognized that she was still with him and calmed a little the gatecrossing had been hard on him as hard as shed feared when shed gone to take him from yfandes back hed been halfroused out of his drugged daze his eyes had been wide open his jaws clenched he had been held paralyzed not by the drugs but by unfocused and overwhelming terror and pain it had taken a candlemark to get him soothed down again somewhere just outside were kellan and yfandes standing a watchful guard in the falling snow still in their tack poor things shed barely been able to get vanyel unstrapped from the saddle before collapsing beside him she had nearly forgotten to activate the wingsister talisman it had taken kellans sharp reminder to shake her out of her fog of exhaustion long enough to stab her finger and let the prescribed three drops of her blood fall on it memory came then as sharply defined as if she had bid farewell to the hawkbrothers scant days ago instead of years blood calls to blood and heart to heart starwind told her gravely his iceblue eyes focused inward he held his slashed palm above the wingsister talisman of silver wire and crystals and his blood dripped onto the heartstone of the piece dyeing the clear crystal a vivid ruby savil watched silently feeling the power flowing and weaving itself into the intricate design of rainbow crystal and silver wire this was nothing like the kind of magic she was used to using it really wasnt much like that the hawkbrothers had taught her either this was older magic much older dating perhaps from the times of the mage wars the wars that had wrecked the world and left the pelagirs a twisted magicriddled ruin she shivered a little and starwind looked up one of his brief and infrequent smiles lighting his face for a moment he closed his hand moondance touched the back of it and he opened it again the slash in his palm had been healed with the speed of a thought at eighteen the young outlander now calling himself moondance was well on his way to becoming that rarest of mages a healeradept starwind fixed the talisman in its place on the mask of feathers and crystal beads it resembled a palmsized diadem perched on the brow of the mask above the eyeslits he handed the whole mask to her and nodded at the talisman when you need us again come to us and let three drops of your own blood fall upon the heartstone i shall know and come to you in all those years since the heartstones bright scarlet had not faded she only hoped that the setspell had not faded either it did seem to her that the heartstone began pulsing with a dim inner light from the moment that her blood touched it but that could have been the flickering of the fire or the wavering of her own vision she was too spent to tell and too drained to begin to sense power even if it was moving under her own nose vanyel stirred at her side curling his knees tighter against his chest she shifted a bit glad that the floor of the cave was covered in several inches of dry soft sand poor child she thought her mind dark with despair im at a loss for what to do with you you keep reaching out to me for support and i want to give it to you and i cant i mustnt if i do youii just fall right back into the pattern you danced with poor lendel she stroked the fine silky hair beneath her hand and her heart ached for him you dont know what to think anymore do you youre afraid to touch again afraid to open yourself youre full of such fear and such pain gods when you told withen that nothing would ever make you happy again she swallowed the lump in her throat that threatened to choke her and blinked at the dancing flames then closed her stinging eyes and felt tears bead up on her lashes starwind old friend she thought desperately where are you im out of my depth i dont know what to do i need your help and you have it sisterofmyheart she started there was a swirl of snow at the cave entrance whitegold and shadow in the dancing firelight there had been no alert from either companionbut when the snow settled and cleared he was there he hadnt changed not at all the sword of ice she had called him when shed first seen him flowing silver hair still reached past his waist when he put backthe hood of his white cloak and let the silky mass of it tumble free there still were no wrinkles in his face not even around the obliquelyslanting iceblue eyes he was still tall and unbent still slender as a boy only the cool deeps of his eyes showed his age and the aura of power that pulsed about him no mage would ever have any doubts that this was an adept and a powerful one he smiled at her and held out his hands welcome heartsister wingsister savil he said in the liquid tayledras tongue gliding to her to take the hands she held up to him in his own always welcome and well come thou art starwind shaydra her sight darkened for a momerit and when it cleared the tayledras adept was kneeling at her side holding her upright savil you stubborn headstrong woman he chided as she felt an inrushing of energy from his center to hers she swayed a little and he held her upright what need could possibly have been so great that you drain yourself to a wraith to gate yourself here this need she pulled back her cloak to show him the boy curled against her side his face taut with pain god of my fathers he reached out with his free hand and barely touched vanyels brow he pulled back his hand as if it had been burned goddess of my mothers what have you brought me sister i dont know she said slumping wearily against him hes been blasted open and he cant heal more than that im too tired to tell you right now so much has happened and to both of us i just cant think what to do anymore all i know is that hes hurting and i cant help him and if id left him where he was hed have destroyed himself at the best and half the capital at the worst there is nothing wrong with your judgment i pledge you that starwind replied sitting back on his heels and regarding the boy dubiously there is such potential there he frightens me and such darkness of the soulno wingsister not evil there is nothing evil in him just darkness despair is a part of it but denial of what he is and must become is another selfwilled darkness he wills himself not to see i think you see more than i do she told him rubbing her aching forehead i havent the right to ask it of you but will you help me with him can you help me the firelight turned the ice of his eyes to bluegold flame you have the right sister to brother to ask what you will of me did you not gift me with the greatest of all gifts in the person of my shaykrethashke she had to smile a little at that bringing starwind another boy long ago had been one of the few unalloyed good things shed ever done where is moondance anyway moondance stands in the snow defending his head and his lifeblood telling the strangerlashakaladra not to eat me came the laughterflavored reply i frightened her she does not trust me i think kellan savil mindspoke tiredly he popped up right under yfandes nose and scared the liver out of her chosen kellan replied apologetically she went for him before we knew who it was its all right now hes just making amends bright havens kelt you know him at least she snapped her tiredness making her impatient not anymore i fear i have greatly changed wingsister moondance said contritely from the entrance and i also fear i had forgotten the fact savil looked over starwinds shoulder and felt her mouth gaping starwind put one finger beneath her chin and shut it for her with a chuckle great good gods she said after a moment of stunned silence you have changed the moondance she had known he hadnt had the name moondance for long at that point had been brownhaired and browneyed and as ordinary as a peasant hut not surprising for one of peasant stock but now now the hair was as long and as silver and the eyes as iceblue as starwinds the lines of his face were still the same square to starwinds triangle but the cheekbones were far more prominent than savil remembered and the body had grown out of adolescent gawkiness and into a slender grace so like starwinds that they could have been brothers by birth instead of by blood he even smells different kellan complained how did you do that savil demanded moondance made a fluid shrug and tossed the sides of his white cape over his shoulders showing that he wore only thin gray breeches and a sleeveless gray leather jerkin with matching boots savil shivered at this reminder that the tayledras never seemed to notice the cold its the magic we use he said it makes us into what it wants us to be i think as always an oversimplification starwind correcled him fondly kasheeleth savil has brought us a problem come look at this boy moondance drifted over to savils other side sat on his heels beside her and studied vanyels face for several breaths haiyasha he breathed shayachern hmm and lovelost no it goes deeper than that he reached out as starwind had and touched vanyels forehead but unlike starwind did not pull away aisheva holiest mothers the pain his jaw tightened and the pupils of his eyes contracted to pinpoints reft and bereft of shay kreth ashke his face took on the tranquillity of a statue pawn he is now pawn he has been he said his tone flat his voice dropping half an octave pawn to what he is and what he wills not to be but will or no the pawn is in play and the play is a trial and what of the game starwind asked in a whisper moondance hesitated then life came back to his face as he shrugged again and his pupils went back to normal no way of knowing he replied slowly taking his hand from vanyels forehead that depends entirely upon whether he is willing to become more than a pawn but yours to be the teaching i think he said looking up sharply at the adept it is like your powers that he holds as for healing i think that half of it will be his doing if he heals at all and the other half yours the adept stated with an ironic smile moondance turned vanyels wrist up showing the scar across it then turned over his own hand and the firelight picked out the scar that ran from the goldskinned hand halfway to the elbow a scar that followed the course of the blue vein pulsing beneath the skin who better he asked we have something in common i think savil swayed again caught in a sudden dizziness and starwind took hold of her shoulders to steady her you need rest he said in concern will you have it here or can you ride savil thought longingly of just lying down where she was and then reflected on being able to do so in a bed and also on the companions out there in the snow and cold and still in their harnesses the companions can and will carry double she sighed feeling just about ready to fade away if youre willing to ride them or strap us in i dont much care which but id like them in the warm then we ride starwind said as moondance scooped vanyel up in his arms as if he weighed next to nothing the older adept rose to his feet and offered her his hand and it took every scrap of will she had left to her to stumble erect it is not far wingsister i hope not she told him earnestly staggering out into the snow while moondance put the fire out with a single backward glance because if it isnt youre going to be carrying me as well as the boy first there was darkness and the peace that came with being so drugged that there was no thought at all it was the only time he felt anything like peace these days and he welcomed the drugs and the redhaired healer who brought them there were times without counting when he hoped that this time the healer had miscalculated that this time he wouldnt wake then there was pain unfocused but somewhere near at hand like the touch of sun on skin already reddened and burned it got past the drugs somehow he tried to push it away but it continued to throb in those halfhealed places in his mind promising him more pain to come then nothing but pain fire in his veins and under his skin flames dancing along his nerves and scorching his mind gatefire gateenergy it was unmistakable and unbearable and yet it continued long past the moment he thought his sanity would shatter or his heart stop he screamed or thought he did he was lost in it and there was no way out not even death for the pain would not let him die then it was gone but it left him aching all the channels burned raw again and worse all the memories replaying themselves over and over gala dying tylendel throwing himself from the tower tylendel lying in state in the temple then without warning the dream he stood blocking the way a onemage barricade across crookback pass magelight from his upraised hand reflected from the impassive faces and hollow empty eyes of the three wizards who opposed him this was not like the old dream the dream of being alone in the ice this was something else he could sense things shards of meaning just under the surface of it but couldnt seem to bring them out to where he could read them but it felt real fearfully real why do you bother with this nonsense the voice from behind the wizards was sweet lilting one more figure paced forward as the ranks of the army backing the wizards parted to let him pass you are quite alone heraldmage vanyel one of the wizards stepped two paces to the side to allow the newcomer through to the center to face vanyel he was beautiful there was no other word for him a perfectly sculptured face and body hair and eyes of twilight shadow a confidence poise and power so complete they were works of art except for the dark eyes he could have been vanyels brother except that he was too perfect he could almost have been a younger vanyel he was clad in dull black armor like his soldiers but carried no weapon he didnt need one he was a weapon he was a weapon with no other purpose than the destruction and death he molded into his power unlike the knife which could cut to heal or harm this weapon would never serve any other purpose than pain vanyel knew that as well as he knew himself you are the beautiful young man repeated smiling choosing his words to hurt quite alone vanyel nodded you tell me nothing i was not already aware of i know you you are leareth the word meant darkness leareth laughed i am darkness and these are my servants a quaint conceit dont you think vanyel said nothing every moment he kept leareth here was one more moment speeding yfandes down the road with tylendel but tylendel was dead you need not remain alone leareth continued moistening his lips with his tongue sensuously you have only to stretch out your hand to me vanyel and take my darkness to you and you would never be alone again we could accomplish much together we two or if you wish i could even he stepped forward a pace two i could even bring back your longlost love to you think of him vanyel think of tylendel alive and once more at your side no he struck at the terrible beautiful face struck with all the power at his command and wept as he struck dreams young vanyela bluegreen voice froze him in midstrike nothing but dreams they vanish into mist if you will it the army the pass leareth all whirled away from him into another kind of darkness this was a darkness that soothed and he embraced it as eagerly as he had repudiated the other cool greengold music threaded into the darkness not dispelling it but complementing it it wound its way into his mind and wherever it went it left healing behind it in all the raw bleeding places in all the burning channels it flowed through him and he sank into it drifting drifting and content to drift it surrounded him bathed him in balm until there was nothing left of hurt in him except the place tylendel had left behind the place that still ached so emptily the greengold music was joined by another a bluegreen harmony like the voice that had spoken to dispel the dream and this music was no longer letting him drift aimlessly it was leading him it had wound around his soul and he had no choice but to follow where it wanted him to go the bluegreen music took the melody the greengold faded to a descant and the voice spoke in his dreams again look you wish control here is your center so to center and so to ground the music led him in a dance wherein he found a balance he hadnt known he craved until he found it the music spun him around he spun with it and he knew that having found this point of equilibrium he would not lose it again so so so exactly so the music chuckled now you would protect yourself thus the barrier see dense and it keeps all out flexible to your will always your will young vanyel it is will and nothing less it spun him walls to keep others out of his mind he saw the way of it and spun them thicker harder then raveled them again down to the thinnest of barricades knowing he could build them up again when he wanted to then the bluegreen music faded leaving the greengold to carry the melody alone it sang to him then sang of rest sang of peace and he dreamed dreamed of waking moving to anothers will to drink and care for himself and sleep again but no more dreams that hurt only dreams full of the verdant music then he woke truly woke not dreams of waking to the sound of it breathy haunting notes that wandered into and out of melodies that he half recognized but couldnt identify there was a scent of ferns a smell of growing things a whiff of freshlyturned earth and a hint of something metallic behind the music he heard the sound of gently falling water he was no longer drugged and the mindchannels within him no longer burned and tormented him he opened his eyes slowly he thought for one mad moment that he was somehow suspended in a tree he was surrounded on all sides by greenery and luxuriantlyleaved branches hung over his head then he saw that while the branches were real and the leaves they were not the same organism the branches supported huge ferns whose fronds draped down like a living canopy over his bed and the greenery about him was a curtaining of multilayered multishaded green fabric hung from a framework of more branches each layer as light and transparent as a spiderweb and cut to resemble a cascade of leaf shapes he had never in his life imagined that there could be so many colors of green weak beams of sunlight threaded past the fern fronds the blankets if that was what they were were a darker green like moss and felt as soft as velvet but were thick and heavy he tried to sit up and discovered that he couldnt he was absolutely spent with no strength left at all the music beyond the curtains finished with a breathless upwardspiraling run and a few moments later the curtains parted vanyel blinked in surprise at the young man who stood there framed by the green of the curtain material he knew he was staring and rudely but he couldnt help himself hed never seen anyone who looked like this a young man silverhaired as any oldster with hair longer than most women had and with eyes of light blue that measured and weighed him full of secrets and thoughts that vanyel couldnt begin to read he wore a sleeveless green jerkin and breeches of a darker green and in the hand that held back the curtains there was a white flute that looked as if it had been carved from luminescent opaque crystal vanyel suddenly realized that indeed he couldnt read the young mans thoughts there was presence there but nothing spilling over into his own mind he stammered out the first things in his mind not terribly clever and certainly not original but wwwhere am i wwwho are you the young man tilted his head to one side a little and vanyel saw a faint hint of smile as he replied very slowly and with a strange accent well where am i you ask me better than i had feared i had half dreaded hearing who am i young vanyel he tilted his head the other way and this time the smile was definite you are in ktreva territory in the pelagir hills and before you ask your aunt our wingsister savil brought you here we are her friends she asked us to help her with your troubles i am moondance ktreva i am tayledras and i have been your healer that is my bed you are lying in do you like it starwind says it is a foolish piece of conceit but i think that this is only because he did not think of it first vanyel could only blink at him in bewilderment moondance shook his head ruefully i go too fast for you simple things first are you hungry thirsty would you like to bathe all at once he was hungry and thirsty and disgustingly aware that his skin was crawling with the need for a bath all three he said a little hesitantly then we remedy all three moondance pulled the curtains back to the foot and the head of the bed and and reached to pull off the blankets at which point vanyel realized that he was quite nude beneath the bedcoverings he flushed and clutched at the blanket moondance gave him an amused look who do you think it was that undressed you and put you where you are he asked i pledge you it was not the eastern wind vanyel flushed again but did not release the blanket so so here my modest one moondance reached up to one side among the hangings and detached something which he tossed onto the blankets vanyel reached for it a wraprobe of something green and silken that was thankfully much more substantial than the hangings as moondance pointedly turned his back he eased out of the bed and wrapped it around himself and reached for one of the bedsupports as dizziness made the room spin around him that will never do there was a cool touch between his eyes and the room steadied come moondance was just in front of him holding out his hands encouragingly keep your eyes on me yes a step another you have been long abed young vanyel you must almost learn to walk again the tayledras healer walked backward slowly as vanyel followed looking only at his eyes but he did not move to give the boy support in any way except the one time vanyel stumbled and nearly fell then moondance caught him held him until he could find his balance again and only when vanyel was standing firmly again did he draw away vanyel was vaguely aware that they had crossed a threshold into another room but just walking was costing him so much sweating concentrated effort he didnt dare look around any it seemed to take years before moondance stopped caught his elbow and guided him to a seat on a smooth rock ledge that rimmed a raised pool of water so hot that it steamed now look about you moondance waved at the pool and the rest of the room this is the pool for washing here is soap when you are clean go there the pool for resting though the pool vanyel was sitting beside was deep it was quite small next to the pool for washing was another much larger much deeper and slightly above it with an opening in the side that spilled hot water down into this pool both pools looked natural rocksided and sandybottomed i think even weak as you are you shall be able to find your way there i shall return with food and drink the young man hesitated a moment then with the swiftness of a stooping hawk leaned over and kissed vanyel full on the lips you are very welcome young vanyel he said before vanyel had a chance to get over his surprise we are pleased to have you starwind and i and not just for the sake of wingsister savil he vanished before vanyel had a chance to react vanyel found that if he moved slowly and carefully he didnt exhaust himself he shed the robe and eased himself into the water with a sigh and soaped and rinsed until he finally felt clean again his pool emptied itself over the side and down a channel in the floor and where the water went from there he couldnt say he had figured by now that this was some kind of hot spring which accounted for the metallic tang in the air with moondance gone he had a chance to get a good look around while trying to sort himself out there didnt appear to be any doors as such in this dwelling just doorways this bathing room was multileveled highest level was the pool for resting which cascaded to the next level and the pool for washing which in turn was above the floor and the channel carrying the water away that was cut into it there were no windows in the walls of natural rock the whole was lit by a skylight taking up the entire ceiling and there were green and flowering plants and ferns standing and hanging everywhere there was only one entrance into this room that led back to the bedroom also rockwalled and roofed with a skylight from what vanyel could see of it the ledge between the pools was not that high though it took far more of vanyels strength to get over it than he would have believed once in the larger pool he discovered that his surmise was right crystalline hot water bubbled up from the sand in the center of the pool someone had improved on nature by forming the rock of the pool sides below the waterline into smooth benches it was wonderful the water was about as hot as was comfortable and was forcing him to relax whether or not he wanted to he closed his eyes and sat back deliberately thinking of absolutely nothing and only opened them again when he heard light footsteps crossing the stone floor below him it was as he expected moondance who had brought with him an earthenware beaker of what proved to be cider and a plate of sliced bread and cheeses and fruit eat lightly the young man warned climbing to vanyels level and setting his burdens down on the rim of the pool at vanyels right hand you have been three weeks without true food and spent more than one of those days drugged three weeks moondance shrugged you needed healing of a kind your good healer andrel could not give you i think perhaps no healer among your folk could have given you such healing they know nothing of the healing of hurts caused by magic only of illness and wounding that is a study only a few have made and most of those few tayledras eat young vanyel there are herbs in the bread and the drink to strengthen you where where is savil he asked suddenly a little worried at being alone with a stranger with starwind she was very weary both in body and in soul this thing that has happened it has been a deep grief to her as well to you her heart is as sore i think they are old friends my shaykrethashke and savil and there are no secrets between them and much love she has need of such love perhaps more than you for she has had no one to lend her support vanyel had looked up at him sharply at that with the word ashke striking him with the force of a cold slap in the face making his heart pound painfully moondance looked down at him something speculative in his glance he weighed vanyel for a moment then cleared his throat and looked away deliberately i have a thing to say to you a thing i wish you to think upon vanyel put down his cider and waited apprehensively to hear the rest i have shared your thoughts i know more of you than anyone except perhaps your shaykrethashke moondance changed his position so that he was sitting with his back to the pool leaning his weight against his hands and staring up at the clouds visible through the skylight he was being very careful not to look at vanyel as you have guessed from my words he said i am shayachern as is starwind as you now he gave vanyel a very brief sidelong glance i am a healeradept and i heal more than people i heal places i know the natural world as only one who wishes to restore it to its rightful balances can this is the thing i wish to tell you in all the world there are more creatures than just man that make lifetime matings among them some of the noblest wolves swans geese the great raptorsall creatures man could do worse than emulate in many many ways and with all of them all there are those pairings from time to time within the same gender not often but not unheard of either vanyel found himself unable to move and unable to anticipate the direction this was taking now moondance dropped his eyes to catch and hold vanyels in a joining of glances and wills that was unbreakable there is in you a fear a shame placed there by your own doubts and the thoughts of one who knew no better i tell you to think on this the shay a chern pairing occurs in nature how then unnatural usual no and not desirable for the species else it would die out for lack of offspring but not unnatural the beasts of the fields are innocent as man can never be who has the knowledge of good and evil and the choice between and they do not cast out of their ranks the shay a chern there was between you and your shay kreth ashke much love only love there is no shame in loving vanyel couldnt breathe he could only see those iceblue eyes this i think i have learned where there is love the form does not matter and the gods are pleased this i have observed what occurs in nature comes by the hand of nature and if the gods did not approve it would not be there i give you these things as food for your heart and mind once again before vanyel could move he bent deliberately and kissed him but this time on the forehead i leave you for a moment with both kinds of nourishment he smiled and gave vanyel a slow wink since you are not to stay in the pool forever i must needs find you clothing i would not mind but your aunt grows anxious and wishes to see you awake and aware and we would not wish to put her to the blush hmm and with that he jumped down from the pool ledge to the floor and vanished again twelve here moondance a crease of worry between his brows was back in a few moments with a towel and what looked like folded clothing green like his own you shall have to care for yourself i fear there is trouble and i have been called to deal with it starwind and savil will be with you shortly he hesitated a moment visibly torn forgive me i must go he put his burdens down on the pool edge and ran back out the doorway before vanyel could do more than blink gods i feel like somebody in a tale going to sleep and waking up a hundred years later it seems so hard to think like im still half asleep he dressed slowly trying to collect his thoughts and making heavy work of it he did remember vaguely savil telling him that he was too ill for andrel to help and he definitely remembered despite the fog of drugs about the words being told that she was going to take him to some friends of hers he hadnt much cared what was happening at that point hed either been too drugged to care or been hurting too much presumably moondance and the absent starwind were the friends she meant they were fully as strange as those weird masks of beads and feathers that savil had on her wall as was this place wherever it was he pulled the deep green tunic over his head and suddenly realized something he wasnt drugged and he wasnt hurting either those places in his mind that had burned he could still feel them but they werent giving him pain moondance said he healed me is that why it feels like i halfway know him tayledras didnt aunt savil tell us stories about them i thought that was all those were stories not real he looked around at the strange room halfstructure halfnatural each half fitting into the other so well he could scarcely tell where the hand of nature left off and the hand of man began real gods if i were to describe this place nobody would ever believe me this ii s all so different i even feel different he could sense some kind of barrier around him around his thoughts at first it made him wary but he tested it tentatively and found that it was a barrier that he could control when he thinned it he became aware of presences what must be minds out beyond the limits of this room animals surely and birds for their thoughts were dim and herecentered then two close together very bright but opaque and unreadable one felt like savil and the other must be the mysterious starwind then two more just as bright just as opaque but one he recognized by the feel as being yfandes then a scattering of others yfandes a companion my companion so it was no hallucination then he had somehow gotten heraldgifts and a companion gifts i never wanted at a cost i never thought id pay id trade them and half my life to have him back again that hit like a blow to the gut he descended from the level of the uppermost pool to the floor and sat heavily on one of the stone benches around the edge of the room too tired and depressed to move oh lendel gods he thought bleak despair overcoming him what am i doing here why didnt they just let me die do you hate me chosen said a bright reproachful voice in his mind do you hate me for wishing you to live yfandes he remembered what savil had said about how his companion would pine herself to death if he died and sagged with guilt oh gods yfandes no no im sorry i just hed been able to notthink about it when hed been drugged hed been able to concentrate on nothing more complicated than the next moment now now his mind was only too clear he couldnt ignore the reality of tylendel being gone and there were no drugs to keep him in a vague fog of forgetting you miss himshe replied gently you need him and you miss him like my arm like my heart i just cant imagine going on without him i dont know what to do with myself where to go what to do next if yfandes had a reply he never heard it just at that moment savil and a second tayledras this one in white breeches soft low boots and jerkin entered the room vanyel started to stand savil motioned for him to stay where he was she and the stranger walked slowly across the stone floor and took places on the bench beside him vanyel was shocked at her appearance although her hair had always been a pure silvery white shed never looked old before now she did she looked every year of her age and more he recalled what moondance had said about tylendels death being as hard on her as it was on vanyel now he believed it aunt savil he said hesitantly as she and the stranger arranged themselves comfortably beside him are you all right i mean looking particularly haglike am i she asked dryly no dont bother to apologize ive got a mirror i dont bounce back from strain the way i used to he flushed embarrassed and feeling guilty van this is starwind ktreva she continued he and moondance are the tayledras adepts i told you younglings about a time or two this she waved her hand around her is his mostly being as hes ktreva speaker in so much as any tayledras can own the land starwind noted with one raised eyebrow his voice calling up images of ancient rocks and deep still water it would be as correct wingsister to say that this place owns me point taken this is ktrevas voorthayshen thats how would you translate that shayana the tayledras at her side had a triangular face and his long hair was arranged with two plaits at each temple instead of one like moondance and he felt older somehow at least that was how he felt to vanyel clan keep i think would be closest starwind said although ktreva is not a clan as your people know the meaning of the word it is closer to the shinain notion of clan his voice was a little deeper in pitch than moondances and after a moment vanyel recognized the feel of him as being the same as the bluegreen music in his dreams my lord vanyel began hesitantly there are no lords here young vanyel the adept replied i speak for ktreva but each ktreva rises or falls on his own vanyel nodded awkwardly why am i here sir he asked then added apprehensively what did you do to me i forgive me for being rude but i know you did something i feel different you are here because you have very powerful magegifts awakened painfully awakened late and out of control the adept replied his expression was calm but grave and held just a hint of worry your aunt decided and rightly that there was no way in which you could be taught by the heralds that would not pose a danger to you and those about you moondance and i are used to containing dangerous magics we do this constantly it is part of what we do we can keep you contained and savil believes we can teach you effectively and if we cannot teach you control then she knows that we can and will contain you in such a way that you will pose no danger to others moondance had not looked like this so impersonal so implacable vanyel shivered at the detached calm in starwinds eyes he wasnt certain what the adept meant by containing him but he wasnt eager to find out as to what we have done with you moondance healed your channels which are the conduits through which you direct energy and i have taught you a little while you were in healing trance i could not teach you a great deal in trance but what i have given you is very important and will go a great way toward making you safe around others i have taught you where your center is how to ground yourself and how to shield so that now at least you are no longer out of balance and you may guard yourself against outside thoughts and keep your own inside your mind where they belong and there will be no more shaking of the earth because of dreams so that was what had happened with the music the colors and this new barricade around his mind star wind leaned forward a little and his expression became far more human concerned and earnest young vanyel we moondance and i we are perfectly pleased to have you with us to help you but that is all we can do to help you you must learn control we cannot force it upon you you must learn the use of your gifts or most assuredly they will use you magic is that kind of force i beg you to believe me for i know this to be true if you do not use it it will use you and if it begins to use you his eyes grew very cold it must be dealt with vanyel shrank back from that chill but this is neither the place nor the time to speak of such things starwind concluded rising we have you under shield and you are too drained to cause any problems for the nonce youngling can you walk if you can you would do well with exercise and air and i would take you to a vantage to show you our home and tell you a little of what we do here vanyel nodded not eager to be left to his aching memories again he found on rising that he was feeling considerably stronger than he had thought he couldnt move very fast but as long as starwind and savil stayed at a slow walk he could keep up with them they went from the bathing room back through the bedroom it looked even more like a natural grotto than the bathing room had vanyel almost couldnt distinguish the real foliage from the fabric around the bed and the furniture irregularly shaped chairs benches and tables with thick green cushions and frames of bent branches fitted in with the plants so well as to frequently seem part of them there was a curtained alcove with more of those leafmimicking curtains that seemed to be a wardrobe for the curtains had been drawn back at one side enough to display a bit of clothing from there they passed into a third most peculiar room there was no furniture and in the center of it growing up from the stone floor was the living trunk of a tree one a dozen people could not have encircled with their arms attached to the trunk was a kind of spiral staircase they climbed this vanyel feeling weak at the knees and clinging to the railing for most of the climbto a kind of covered balcony that gave them a vantage point to see all of starwinds little kingdom this was a valley no a canyon the walls were nearly perpendicular of hot springs vanyel saw steam rising from the lush growth in more places than he could count although there was snow rimming the lip of the canyon high above vegetation within the bowl ran riot ktreva starwind said indicating the entire valley with a wave of his hand though mostly only moondance and i dwell herebelow beneath the livingspaces for the hertasi and those who do not wish the trees vanyel looked over the edge of the balcony below him was a collection of rooms mostly windowless but with skylights the whole too random to be called a house there are other living places above which is where most of us dwell starwind continued with an ironic smile moondance is not tayledras enough to be comfortable above the ground the hertasi you may or may not see they serve us we protect them and allow them to dwell here they are shy of strangers even of tayledras really only moondance is a friend to all of them they are something like a large lizard but they are full human in wit if you should see one i pray you strive not to frighten it and although you may go where you will herebelow pray do not come hereabove without invitation vanyel looked up but couldnt see any sign of these living places only the staircase spiraling farther up the trunk and vanishing into the branches the very thought of being up that high was dizzying and he thought it was likely to take a great deal more than an invitation to get him to climb above tchah i stand on moondances side savil replied i remember the first time i was here and you made me try to sleep up in one of your perches never again my friend you have no sense of adventure starwind countered putting his palms down on the rail and leaning forward a little the last thing one that you may sense so that you know it is indeed there the barrier about the vale it protects us from that which we would not have pass within and it keeps the vale always warm and sheltered so this is ktreva what we do here two things firstly we make places where the magic creatures of the pelagirs may live in peace secondly we take the magic out of those places where they do not live making the land safe for man we use the magic we take to make boundaries about the places of refuge so that none may pass who do not belong that is what the kvarda the mageclans of the tayledras do we guard the pelagirs from despoilers as our cousins the shinain guard the dhorisha plains as i keep saying youre like we are you guard the pelagirs as the heralds guard valdemar savil said starwind nodded his braids swaying aye save that your heralds concern themselves with the people and the tayledras with the land valdemar is the people we could pack up and flee again as we did at the founding and still be valdemar i suspect the same would be true of you if youd only admit it na the tayledras are bound to the land cannot live outside the pelagirs we must starwind was interrupted by the scream of a hawk somewhere above his head he threw up his forearm and a large white raptor plunged down out of the canopy of leaves to land on starwinds arm vanyel winced then saw that the tayledras wore white leather forearm guards which served to keep the wicked talons from his flesh it was a gyrefalcon its wings beat the air for a moment before it settled its golden eyes fixed on starwinds face the tayledras smoothed its head with one finger then stared into the hawks eyes for a long long time seeming to be reading something there then without warning he flung up his arm launching it back into the air from his wrist the falcons wings beat against the thick damp air then it gained height and vanished back up into the tree branches bad news savil asked nay good the situation is not so evil as we feared moondance is wearied but he shall return by sunrise im glad to hear something is going right for someone savil replied sighing indeed the adept replied turning those strange unreadable eyes on vanyel indeed young vanyel i would advise you to walk about regain your health eat and rest when moondance returns and is at full strength your schooling will begin so he did as he was told to do exploring what starwind called the vale from one end to the other it was shaped like a teardrop and smaller than it seemed there were so many pools and springs waterfalls and geysers and all cloaked in incredible greenery that effectively hid paths that came within whispering distance of each other that it gave the illusion of being an endless wilderland it kept him occupied at least the vale was so exotic so strange that he could lose himself in it for hours and forget in watching the brightly colored birds and fish how very much alone he was half of him longed for the time before tylendel the isolation of that dreamscape the other half shrank from it he no longer knew what he wanted anymore or what he was he certainly didnt know what to do about yfandes he needed her he loved her but that very affection was a point of vulnerability another place waiting to be hurt she seemed to sense his confusion and kept herself nearby but not at hand mindspeaking only when he initiated the contact savil was staying clear of him which helped when moondance finally made an appearance he made some friendly overtures but didnt go beyond them vanyel was perfectly content to leave things that way when he asked the younger tayledras acted as a kind of guide around the vale pointing out things vanyel had missed explaining how the magebarrier kept the cold and other things out of the vale the elusive hertasi never appeared although their handiwork was everywhere clothing vanished and returned cleaned and mended food appeared at regular intervals rooms seemed to sweep themselves when the vale became too familiar vanyel tried to catch a glimpse of them anything to keep from thinking then he was given something else to think about you fail starwind said in clear mindspeech he was seated crosslegged on the rock of the floor beyond the glowing bluegreen barrier imperturbable as a glacier again youngling but vanyel protested from the midst of the barriercircle the adept had cast around him i he was having a hard time shaping his thoughts into mindspeech you starwind nodded exactly so only you until you match your barrier and merge it with mine mine will remain and while mine remains you cannot pass it and i will not take you from this room vanyel drooped with weariness it seemed that the tayledras mage had been schooling him without pause or pity for days not mere hours this was the seventh or was it eighth such test the adept had put him to starwind would go into his head somehow show him what was to be done once then vanyel fumbled his way through whatever it was as quickly as vanyel mastered something the adept sprang a trial of it on him there was no sign of exit or entrance in this barren rockwalled room where hed been taken and no clue as to where in the complex of groundlevel rooms it was there was only starwind his pointed face as expressionless as the rock walls vanyel didnt know what to think anymore these new senses of his they told him things he wasnt sure he wanted to know for instance there was something in this valley a power a living power it throbbed in his mind in time with his own pulse he had told savil thinking he must be ill and imagining it she had just nodded and told him not to worry about it he hadnt asked her much or gone to her often if i dont touch i cant be hurt again the halfunconscious litany was the same but the meaning was different iii dont open myself i wont be open to loss either the tayledras starwind and moondance alternately frightened and fascinated him they were like no one hed ever known before and he couldnt read them starwind in particular was an enigma moondance seemed easier to reach but there was always that danger dont reach dont touch whispered the part of him that still hurt dont try there had been a point back at haven when hed tried to reach out first to savil then to lissa hed wanted someone to depend on to tell him what to do but the moment hed tried to get them to make his decisions for him theyd pushed him gently away now no more all he wanted was to be left alone it seemed however that the tayledras had other plans savil had come to get him in the morning after several days of wandering about on his own reminding him of what starwind had said about being schooled in controlling these unwanted powers of his hed followed her through three or four rooms he hadnt seen before into something he wasnt sure what it was it had felt a little like a gate but there was no portal just a spot marked on the floor hed stumbled across it whatever it was and found himself on the floor of this room a room with no doorways savil had appeared behind him but before he could say anything shed just given him a troubled look said to starwind dont hurt him shayana and left stepped into thin air and was gone left him alone with this this madman this unpredictable creature whod been forcing him all morning to do things he didnt understand using the powers he hadnt even come to terms with possessing much less comprehending why are you doing this to me he cried ready to weep with weariness starwind ignored the words as if they had never been spoken mindspeech chosen came yfandes calm thought that is part of his testing use mindspeech he braced himself sharpened his thoughts into a kind of dagger and flung them at starwinds mind why are you doing this to me gently came the unruffled reply gently or i shall not answer you well that was more than hed gotten out of the adept in hours why he pleaded you are a heap of dry tinder starwind replied serenely you are a danger to yourself and those around you it requires only a spark to send you into an uncontrolled blaze i teach you control so that the fires in you come when you will and where you willhe stared at vanyel across the shimmering magebarrier would you have this again he flung into vanyels face memories that could only have come from savil a clutch of heraldtrainees weeping hysterically infected with his grief mardic flying through the air hitting the wall and sliding down it to land in an unconscious heap the very foundations of the palace shaking no he shuddered there could be worse starwind showed him what he meant by worse a vivid picture of withen dead crushed like a beetle beneath a boot by the powers vanyel did not yet comprehend and could not direct no he tried to deny the very possibility that he could do anything of the kind rejecting the image with a violence that that made the floor beneath him tremble you see starwind said still unperturbed you see without control without understanding you can and will kill without ever meaning to now vanyel hung his head and wearily tried to match the barrier one more time savil ran for the passthrough in response to starwinds urgent summons moondance a bare pace behind her she hit the permanent setspell a kind of lowpower gate at a run there was the usual eyeblink of vertigo and she stumbled onto the slate floor of starwinds work room and right into the middle of a royal mess starwind was only now picking himself up off the floor behind her there was a smell of scorched rock and the acrid taint of ozone in the air and small wonder the area around all around vanyel in the center of the work room was burned black lying sprawled at one side of the burned area was the boy himself scorched and unconscious moondance popped through the passthrough glanced from one fallen body to the other and made for the boy as needing him the most that left starwind to savil she gave him her hands and helped him to his feet he shook his head to clear it then pulled his hair back over his shoulders god of my fathers he said passing his hand over his brow i feel as if i have been kicked across a river savil ran a quick check over him noted a channelpulse and cleared it for him what happened she asked urgently keeping one hand on his elbow to steady him it looks like a magewar in here i believe i badly frightened the boy starwind said unhappily checking his hands for damage i intended to frighten him a little but not so badly as i did he was supposed to be calling lightning and he was balking he plainly refused to use the power he had called i grew impatient with him and i cast the image of wyrsa at him he panicked and not only threw his own power he pulled power from the valleynode then he realized what he had done and aborted it the only way he could at that point pulling it back on himself starwind gave her a reproachful glance you told me he could sense the node but you did not tell me he could pull from it i didnt know he could myself great good gods shayana it was wyrsa that his shay kreth ashke called down on his enemies didnt i tell you savils gut went cold she bit her lip and looked over her shoulder at moondance and his patient the healeradept was kneeling beside the boy with both hands held just above his brow lord and lady no wonder he nearly blew the place apart starwind looked stricken to the heart as moondance took his hands away from the boys forehead and put his arm under vanyels shoulder to pick him up and support him in a halfsitting position you told me but i had forgotten goddess of my mothers what did i do to the poor child ashke what did you do moondance called worriedly one hand now on vanyels forehead the other arm holding him the childs mind is in shock only the worst possible starwind groaned i threw at him an image of the things his love called for vengeance shethka well no help for it what is done cannot be unmade ashke i will put him to bed and call his companion and we will deal with him we will see what comes of this he picked the boy up and strode through the passthrough without a backward glance ah gods this was going well until this moment starwind mourned he was gaining true control gods how could i have been so stupid it happens savil sighed and with van more so than with anyone else it seems he almost seems to attract ill luck shayana why did you throw anything at him much less wyrsa he finally is willing enough to learn the controls the defensive exercises but not the offensive starwind put his palms to his temples and massaged for a moment a paincrease between his eyebrows and if he does not master the offensive the offensive magics will remain without control savil said grimly the smell of scorched rock still strong about her like tylendel i couldnt get past his trauma to get those magics fully under conscious lock i should have brought him to you wingsister hindsight is ever perfect starwind spared a moment to send a thread of wordless compassion her way and she smiled wanly the thing with this boy i told you he had the lightnings in his hand i could see him holding them but he would not cast them i thought to frighten him into taking the offense he lowered his hands and looked helplessly at savil he is a puzzle to me i cannot fathom why he will not fully utilize his powers because he still doesnt understand why he should i suppose savil brooded rocking back and forth on her heels he cant see any reason to use those powers he doesnt want to help anyone all he wants now is to be left alone starwind looked aghast but so strong how can he not he hasnt got the hunger yet shayana or if hes got it everything else hes feeling has so overwhelmed him that all he can register is his own pain savil shook her head that mostly would be my guess maybe its that he hasnt ever seen a reason to care for anyone he doesnt personally know maybe its that right now he has no energy to care for anyone but himself kellan tells me yfandes would go through fire and flood for him so there has to be something there maybe moondance can get through to him only if he survives what we do to him starwind replied motioning her to precede him into the passthrough and sunk in gloom vanyel woke with an ache in his heart and tears on his face the image of the wyrsa had called up everything he wanted most to forget he could tell that he was lying on his bed still clothed but his hands and forearms felt like theyd been bandaged and the skin of his face hurt and felt hot and tight the full moon sent silver light down through the skylight above his head he saw the white rondel of it clearly through the fronds of the ferns his head hurt and his burned hands but not so much as the empty place inside him or the guilt the terrible guilt lendel lendel my fault he heard someone breathing beside him a mindtouch confirmed that it was moondance he did not want to talk with anyone right now he just wanted to be left ajone he started to turn his face to the wall when the soft oddly youngsounding voice froze him in place i would tell you of a thing vanyel wet his lips and turned his head on the pillow to look at the argentandblack figure seated beside him on one of the strange chairs he favored moondance might have been a statue a silvered god sitting with one leg curled beneath him resting his crossed arms on his upraised knee face tilted up to the moon moonlight flowed over him in a flood of liquid silver there was a boy moondance said quietly his name was tallo his parents were farmers simple people good people in their way really very tied to their ways to their land to the cycle of the seasons this tallo was not he felt things inside him that were at odds with the life they had they did not understand their son who wanted more than just the fields and the harvests they did love him though they tried to understand they got him learning as best they could they tried to interest the priest in him they didnt know that what the boy felt inside himself was something other than a vocation it was power but power of another sort than the priests the boy learned at last from the books that the priest found for him that what he had was what was commonly called magic and from those few books and the tales he heard he tried to learn what to do with it this made him very different from his former friends and he began to walk alone his parents did not understand this need for solitude they did not understand the strange paths he had begun to walk and they tried to force him back to the ways of his fathers there were arguments anger a great deal of it on both sides and there was another thing they wished him to wed and begin a family but the boy tallo had no yearning toward young women but young men that was another tale moondance sighed and in the moonlight vanyel saw something glittering wetly on his eyelashes then the summer of the worst of the arguments there came a troupe of gleemen to the village and there was a young man among them a very handsome young man and the boy tallo found that he was not the only young man in the world who had yearnings for his own sex they quickly became lovers tallo thought he had never been so happy he planned to leave with the gleemen to run away and join them when they left his village and his lover encouraged this but it happened that they were found together the parents the priest the entire village was most wroth for such a thing as shayachern was forbidden even to speak of much less to be they beat tallo very badly they beat the young gleeman then they cast tallo and his lover out of the village then it was that the young gleeman spurned tallo said in anger and in pain what he did not truly mean that he wanted nothing of him and tallo became wild with rage he too was in pain he had suffered for this lover been cast out of home and family for his sake and now he had been rejected and he called the lightning down with his halflearned magic he did not mean to do anything more than frighten the young man but that was not what happened he killed him struck him dead with the power that he could not control moonlight sparkled silver on the tears that slowly crept down moondances face tallo had heard his lovers thoughts and knew that the young man had not meant in truth the hurtful things he had said tallo had wanted only for the boy to say with words what he had heard in the others mind so he called the lightning to frighten him but he learned that the lightning would not obey him when called by anger and not by skill and he heard the boy crying out his name as he died crying out in fear and terrible pain and tallo unable to save him tallo could not live with what he had done with the dagger from his lovers belt he slashed his own wrist and waited to die for he felt that only with his own death could he atone for murdering his love moondance raised his left arm to push some of his heavy hair back from his face and the moon picked out the white scar that ran from his wrist halfway to his elbow there was however a stranger on the road an outlander who had sensed the surge of power and read the signs and knew that it was uncontrolled she came as quickly as she could though not quickly enough to save both she found the young men one dead one nearly she saved the one she could and brought him to a friend who she thought might understand moondance was so silent and for so long that vanyel thought he was through speaking he stared up at the moon eyes and cheeks shining wetly like a marble statue in the rain then he spoke again and every syllable carried with it a sense of terrible pain so here is the paradox if the boy tallo had not misused his fledgling powers and struck down his lover they would have gone off together and in time parted tallo would likely have been found by a mage and taught or who knows gotten as far as valdemar and been taken by a companion those with the power are not left long to themselves it might even have been that the mage that found him was a dark one and tallo might have turned for a time or for all time to evil but that is not what happened the boy killed murdered in ignorance and was brought to ktreva and in ktreva he found forgiveness and the learning he needed as the seed needs the spring rain and one thing more he found his shaykrethashke in your tongue that means lifebonded vanyel started moondance nodded without turning to look at him you see paradox had things not fallen as they did tallo would never have met with starwind the tayledras are very secretive and wingsister savil is one of the first to see one of us much less to see ktreva in years beyond counting the two meant to be lifebonded would never have found each other there would be no healeradept in ktreva and much tayledras work would have gone undone because of that so much good has come of this and much love but it has its roots in murder murder unintentional but murder all the same moondance sighed again so what is the boy tallo to think starwinds solution was to declare the boy tallo dead by his own hand a fitting expiation for his guilt and to bring to life a new person altogether one moondance ktreva so there is no more tallo and there is one that magic has changed into a man so like tayledras that he might have been born to the blood but sometimes the boy tallo stirs in the heart of moondance and he wonders and he weeps and he mourns for the wrongs he has done he turned his head then and held out his hand to vanyel kechara would you share grief with tallo weeping alone brings no comfort and your heart is as sore as mine vanyel started to reach for that hand then hesitated if i dont touch if you do not touch said moondance as if he read vanyels thought you do not live if you seal yourself away inside your barriers you seal out the love with the pain and though love sometimes brings pain you have no way of knowing if the pain you feel now might not bring you to love again tylendels dead there hed said it said it out loud it was real and couldnt be changed the tight burned skin on his face hurt as he held back tears nothing is going to bring him back ill never be anything but alone moondance nodded slowly and left his hand resting on the edge of the bed vanyel couldnt see his face shadowed as it was by the white wing of his hair the great love is gone there are still little lovesfriend to friend brother to sister student to teacher will you deny yourself comfort at the hearthfire of a cottage because you may no longer sit by the fireplace of a palace will you deny yourself to those who reach out to you in hopes of warming themselves at your hearthfire that is cruel and i had not thought you to be cruel vanyel and what of yfandes she loves you with all her being would you lock her out of your regard as well that is something more than cruel why are you telling me asking me this the words were torn out of him unwilling because i nearly followed the road you are walking the tayledras shifted slightly in his chair and vanyel heard the wood creak a little better i thought not to touch at all than to touch and bring hurt upon myself and others better to do nothing than to make a move and have it be the wrong one but even deciding to not touch or to be nothing is a decision vanyel and by deciding not to touch so as to avoid hurt i then hurt those who tried to touch me he waited but vanyel could not bring himself to answer him moondances expression grew alien unreadable and he shrugged again it is your decision it is your life a healer cannot live so it may be that you can he uncoiled himself from his chair and in a kind of seamless motion was standing on his feet shaking back his hair the tears were gone from his eyes and his expression was as serene as if they had never been there as he looked down on vanyel if you are in pain mindcall and i shall come before vanyel could blink he was gone morning came but the expected summons to starwinds work room did not the sun rose he wandered from room to empty room in the small area that he knew without finding anyone he began to wonder if his rejection of moondance last night had led them all to abandon him here finally he found a way out into the valley itself and stood by the rockarch of the doorway blinking a little at the bright sunlight unfiltered by the tinted skylight there were ferns the size of a small room bushes and small trees with leaves he could have used as a rain shelter and the larger trees while not matching the one growing up through the middle of the house in girth were still large enough that it would take five people to encircle their trunks with their arms yfandes he mindcalled tentatively he wasnt at all sure hed get a reply but he did here she said and a few moments later she came frisking through the undergrowth tail and spirits held bannerhigh she nuzzled his cheek are your hands better he had unwrapped them this morning from their bandages and aside from a little soreness they seemed fine certainly nothing near as painful as they had been last night i think sohe rested his forehead against her neck it was incredibly comforting just to be in her presence and hard to remember to barricade himself around her where is everybody savil is up above in starwinds placeshe gave him a mental picture of a kind of manywindowed room perched in the limbs of what could only be the tree growing up through the center of the house she doesnt much care for it and having her up there makes kellan nervy but he was upset over the accident yesterday and he feels happier up in the boughs theyre talking with the other ktreva i think perhaps wheres moondance by himself thinking yfandes said fandes did i he swallowed did i do something wrong last night she looked at him reproachfully yes i think you ought to talk to him you hurt him more deeply last night than he showed hes never told that story to anyone savil and starwind know it but he never told them and hes never even told starwind how badly he still feels it cost him a great deal to tell it to you his first reaction was guilt his second was anger by his own admission moondances tragic affair had been nothing more than that an affair doomed to be brief how could he even begin to compare his hurt with vanyels moondance wasnt alone moondance hadnt murdered starwind just some stupid gleeman who would have passed out of his life in a few weeks a common player and no great love moondance still had starwind would always have starwind vanyel would be alone forever so how could moondance compare the two of them yfandes seemed to sense something of what was going on in his mind she pulled away from him a little and looked or was it felt offended that only made him angrier without another word spoken or thought he turned on his heel and ran away from her away from the tayledras away from all of them ran to a little corner at the end of the vale a sullen grove of dark fleshyleaved trees and ferns where very little light ever came he pushed his way in among them and curled up around his misery and his anger his stomach churning his eyes stinging they dont give a damn about me just about what i can do they dont care how much i hurt all they want is for me to do what im told savil just wants to see me tricked into being a herald thats all they dont any of them understand they dont any of them know how much i he began crying silently lendel lendel they dont know how much of me died with you all i want is to be left alone why cant they leave me alone why cant they stop trying to make me do what they want theyre all alike dammit theyre just like father the only thing different is what they want out of me oh lendel i need you so much he stayed there crying off and on until full darkthen crept as silently as he could back to the buildingpart of him hoping to find them waiting for him only to find it as vacant as when hed left it in fact only the nightlamps were burning and those were only left for the benefit of any of the tayledras who might care to come down to the ground during the night it didnt even look as if hed been missed they dont care he thought forlornly surveying the empty illlit rooms they really dont care oh gods his stomach knotted up into a hard squirming ball no one cares no one ever did except lendel and no one ever will again his shoulders slumped and a second hard lump clogged his throat he made another circuit of the rooms but they stayed achingly echoingly empty no sign of anyone no sign anyone would ever come back after pacing through the place until the echoes of his own footsteps were about to drive him into tears he finally crawled into bed and cried himself to sleep thirteen leareth laughed his icy laughter echoed off the cliffs as he held up one hand and made the simplest of gestures a magestorm swirled into being precisely at the edge of vanyels defenses vanyel poured power into his shielding this was the last the very last of his protections he was drained the energysources were drained and he himself had taken far more damage in the duel than he would allow leareth to know he was no match for the scouring blast that peeled his shields away faster than he could replace them leareth smiled behind his magestorm as if he knew that vanyel was weakening by the moment sweat ran into his eyes and started to freeze there he went to his knees still fighting and knowing he was going to lose leareth seemed not even wearied a final blast struck down the last of his protections vanyel screamed as agony such as hed never known before arced through his body vanyel woke up the bed was soaking with sweat and he was shaking so hard the ferns over his head quivered he was afraid that he had screamed out loud but when no one came running into the room he knew that he hadnt that everything had been in the dream at least this time he hadnt awakened anyone and hadnt been trapped in the dream dream oh gods it isnt just a dream he shivered despite the warmth of the room and stared up through the fern fronds at the descending moon the nightmare had him in a grasp of iron claws and would not let him go this is going to be real it feels real its foresight it has to be leareth calls me heraldmage vanyel and im in whites im dreaming my own death this is what is going to happen to me how im going to die if i become a herald alone in terrible pain and all alone fighting a doomed battle he shivered harder chilled by the cold of the dream chilled even more with fear he finally threw the covers back grabbed his robe and padded into the room with the hot pools finding his way by moonlight and habit for this was not the first time hed awakened in the middle of the night dreamchilled and needing warmth this was just the first time since hed arrived here that the dream had been clear enough to remember he climbed into the uppermost pool easing himself down into the hot water with a sigh and a shiver oh gods i dont want to die like that they cant want me to have to face that can they if they knew about this dream would they still want me to be a herald gods i know the answer to that he eased a little farther down into the hot water until it lapped at his chin he was fighting blind unreasoning panic and losing what am i going to do oh gods i cant think i have to get away i cant stay here if i do they ii try and talk me around where can i go i dont even know where home is from here but i cant stay iii just go ill just pack up and go and hope something turns up its all i can do it means leaving yfandes for a moment that thought was more than he could bear but fear was stronger its lose her or lose my life no i cant i cant face an end like that besides he choked on a sob she just wants me to be a herald too he looked up judging the hour by the moon ive got a few hours until dawn i can be out of the valley and well away before they even start looking for me and they might not starwind still isnt ready to deal with me again they might just think ive gone off somewhere to be alone especially if i block yfandes out now and keep her out he climbed out of the pool and dried himself with his robe he knew exactly where the clothing hed arrived in was hung the far end of moondances closet he pulled it on as quickly as he could taking the heavy cloak and draping it over one arm one of the packs was in there too the one with the rest of his winter clothes they were too warm to wear in the valley so hed never unpacked them wearing instead moondances outgrown things there was always food out in the room beside the one with the staircase tayledras sometimes kept odd hours he niched enough bread and cheese to last several days and stuffed it into the pack with his clothing it took him most of a candlemark to reach the entrance to the valley if it hadnt been snowing he might have turned back at that moment but it was lightly enough to cover his tracks he swung the heavy cloak over his shoulders braced himself for the shock of the temperature change and stepped out into the dark and cold remembering just in time to put up a shield so that he could not be tracked by his own aura two steps forward one step back moondances voice drifted up the ladder savil refused to call anything that steep a staircase to starwinds ekele it was a good three breaths before moondance himself appeared his head poked through the hatchway in the gleaming wooden floor just as a gust of wind made the whole tree sway and creak savil gulped and gripped the arms of her low chair looking resolutely away from the windows and their view of the birds flying by below them starwind never would tell her what it was they used in those windows instead of glass which wouldnt have lasted ten breaths in a high wind it was the same thing they used for the skylights only thinner some kind of tough flexible transparent membrane and savil could not bring herself to believe that it would hold if you fell against it the ekele creaked again and she shuddered as she saw the windowstuff ripple a little with the warping of the window frames would you mind explaining that cryptic remark she asked as the rest of moondance emerged from the entrance oh thy pupil wingsister he said at his most formal closing the hatchway against another gust of chill air the ladder was sheltered but not entirely enclosed that would have been impractical and starwind couldnt see wasting a magebarrier on the entrance to his nest when the hatchway served perfectly well most of the time bright the day masterashke wind to thy wings starwind replied automatically turning away from the window his gloom brightening a little shaykrethashke there is no master here for thee nay till the day thy wings bear thee upwards thourt my master moondance glided across the unsteady floor to starwinds side as surefooted as a sailor on a moving deck enough im drowning savil groaned gods lifebonded its enough to make me celibate what about my pupil and will you please come away from that window i keep thinking the next gust is going to pitch you out the window would hold besides no tayledras has fallen from his ekele in years beyond counting wingsister starwind said turning his back to the window and leaning on the ledge so the time is long past for it to happen and i dont want it to be you all right another gust made the whole tree groan and she clutched at the arms of the chair her knuckles going white very well starwind was actually smiling as he stepped away from the window and folded himself bonelessly into one of the chairs bolted to the floor of his ekele he got a certain amount of pleasure out of teasing savil about her acrophobia each ekele was something like an elaborate treehouse there was one for each major branch of the king tree some twenty in all not all were tenanted and they were mostly used for meditation sleeping teaching and recreation for everything else the place below served far better but when a tayledras needed to think he frequently retreated to his ekele sometimes for weeks touching foot to ground only when he needed to an ekele consisted of a single windowed room varying in size made of polished wood so light in color that it was almost white and furnished at most with a few chairs bolted to the floor a table likewise bolted and rolled pads stored in one corner for sleeping starwinds was one of the highest hence one of the smallest the view was majestic it was wasted on savil moondance took a third chair and sat in it sideways legs draped over the arms well savil demanded are you going to explain yourself your pupil first we strive to bring him to not depend upon others so then he pulls in upon himself confiding not even in his companion hiding his pain within then i try to bring him to confess the pain to share it to reach out so moondance shrugged and savil sensed he hadnt told everything what did you tell him moondances moods could be read from his eyes they were a murky grayblue i told him of myself i thought if he could see that he is not the only soul in the world that feels pain he might be brought to share it savils eyes narrowed moondance was unhappy shayana did he hurt you if he did na the only one who hurt me was myself his eyes cleared and he gave her a wry smile he only pushed me away is all so he hides all day and this morning he is hiding again his bed is empty the hertasi say he went to the end of the vale and his companion says he has blocked her out entirely to put it rudely wingsister he is sulking savil sighed forgetting to clutch the arms of the chair gods what are we to do with him starwinds expression sobered again and he began to answer but was interrupted both tayledras snapped to attention their heads swung to face the window as if a single string had pulled them in that direction two birds shot up from below and hovered there just outside that window the white gyrefalcon and a second of normal plumage starwind leaped out of his chair and flung the window open the birds swirled in on the blast of wind that entered and he slammed the window shut again moondance had jumped to his feet holding both arms out ready for the birds the moment starwind went for the window the falcons homed for him unerringly and were settling on the leather guards on his forearms before starwind had finished latching the window closed the elder tayledras held out his arm and the burl falcon lofted to his forearm with a flutter of pinions settling immediately both tayledras stared into their birds eyes in silent communion savil kept as still as she could while the bond between hawkbrother and his birds was a strong one and the magicbred birds were considerably more than their wild brethren their minds were something less than that of a very young child perhaps a trifle superior to a cat and it didnt take much to distract them the white falcon mantled the buff cried the tayledras eyes refocused and savil read trouble in the grim lines of their mouths what she asked first tampering as you had reported it to us but this time on our grounu and not on kvala starwind said soothing his bird by stroking its breastfeathers a clutch of colddrakes from the look of it something has made them move so when we deal with the drakes we shall have to look farther afield there are folk settled in that direction under ktreva protection this is the first time we have caught the culprit in the act and i do not intend to take this lightly i hope youre counting me in that we a clutch of drakes needs every mage you can muster she said getting carefully to her feet and bracing herself against the sway of the ekele if you would you would be welcome starwind looked relieved but vanyel if hes hiding hell only come out when hes ready hes not going to come to any harm while hes in the vale how far are these monsters anyway haifa days footpace perhaps less moondance replied the which i do not like it speaks for them being harried or even gated in which case why and who good questions both of them savil agreed who can we count on nothing under an adept not with drakes not even journeymen should handle drakeswarms at least not to my mind shethka dont tell me were the only three in any shape to take them on right sunsong is still recovering from moving the firebirds to sanctuary brightwind is too old to travel stormwing is pregnant lord and lady lock her up savil exclaimed no fear shes steadied since she reached adept no more headlong races into danger just for the thrill so rainstar is out already with another call from the kyree as is fireflight and that is the total of ktreva adepts starwind grimaced if this were summer if this were summer it wouldnt be colddrakes ashke moondance reminded him we work with what we have and grateful that wingsister savil is with us lets get on with it savil said steadying herself for the long climb down as the tayledras transferred their birds from forearm to shoulder for the descent so far as im concerned ill take a colddrake over your bedamned ladder any time the snow cleared just before dawn and the sun rose pale and glorious shining through the bare branches of the trees the forest was filled with light with the light came a resurgence of vanyels good sense he sat down on a stump tired and winded and suddenly seemed to wake out of the hold of his nightmare what am i doing out here he thought panting i dont know where im going i dont know what im going to do when i get there i have no idea where i am i just hared off into nowhere like a complete idiot he put his pack down at his feet and scooped up some of the new snow in his mitten and ate it it numbed his tongue but it didnt do much for his thirst i cant believe i did anything this stupid he wrapped his cloak tighter and tucked his knees up under his chin staring at the delicate tracery of white branches against the painfully blue sky he began to think things through slowly one small painful step at a time he flushed with shame i cant believe i did this dammit i know how much savil loves me ive felt it and yfandes and damn i am a rotten fool moondance was just trying to say that its easier to have other people around who hurt when you hurt not that he thought he hurt worse than me i hurt him by pushing him away his blush deepened worst of it is hell likely forgive me without my asking they didnt abandon me yesterday they were busy probably over my welfare they gave me exactly what i wanted to be left alone i should have been knocked up against a wall he brooded watching the birch branches swaying in the breeze he was alone completely alone as he had not been since he left forst reach the only thing breaking the silence was the whisper of the breeze and the occasional call of a winter bird it was the kind of solitude he had sought and not found in the icedream and now that he had it he didnt want it not that this place wasnt peaceful but a sanctuary as he had discovered with his little hideaway at the keep could all too easily become a prison when you lock things out he thought slowly you lock yourself in i think maybe that was what moondance was trying to tell me he stared at the white branches not seeing them and not really thinking just letting things turn over in the back of his mind there was a halfformed thought back there an important one but it wasnt quite ready to come out yet finally he sighed and turned his thoughts back to his own stupidity even if that dream is foresight theres probably ways around it nobodys going to force me into being a herald i could probably stay here if i asked to there was no reason to go running off into the wilderness with nothing but what i could carry and no weapons gods what a fool i am he swiveled around to look down his backtrail even as he watched the brisk breeze was filling in the last of his tracks with the light powdery snow he groaned aloud oh fine just fine i probably wont be able to find my way back now i dont need teachers i need nursemaids then he blinked caught in sudden astonishment at the tone of his own thoughts he sat up a little straighter and took stock of himself and found that he was feeling alive again feeling ready to be alive its like ive been sick fevered and the fever just broke like ive been broken inside somehow and im finally starting to feel healed i havent felt this good since tylendel died he closed his eyes expecting pain at that thought there was pain but not the debilitating agony of loss it had been lendel he thought with a tinge of wonder i still miss you it still hurts you not being here but i guess moondance was right i have to get on with my life even though you arent here to share it he opened his eyes on the snowsparkling forest and actually managed a weak smile at his own folly i really am an idiot a right royal moon calf and youd have been the first to laugh at me wouldnt you lendel he shook his head at himself all right i guess id better figure out how to find my way back without a trail to follow then the answer came to him and he laughed at his own stupidity lord and lady its a good thing you take care of fools all i have to do is look for mages its not like theres too many enclaves of mages out here after all the power should be there for even a dunderhead like me to see he closed his eyes again and took a deep breath of the cold crisp air center ground and open well just like i figured there they are the surge of gateenergy hit him with a shock knocking him senseless when vanyel came to again the sun was high overhead shining down on his cheek it was noon or nearly he was lying where hed fallen on his side braced between his pack and the stump hed curled up around the pack and the roots from the stump were digging into his side and leg his ears were ringing or was it his head whatever it felt as if hed been graced with one of jervis better efforts gods he glanced up at the sun and winced that was a gate nothing else feels like that oh i hurt its a good thing i was wrapped up in this cloak when i fell over or id have frozen he pushed the pack away and rolled over onto his stomach that at least got the sun out of his eyes he got his knees under him and pushed himself up off the snow with his arms he was stiff and cold but otherwise intact only his head hurt and that in the peculiar inside way that meant hed bruised those new senses of his he knelt where he was for a moment then pushed his hood back and looked around it looked as if hed fallen right over sideways when the shock hit him guess id better get moving before i turn into a snowstatue he pulled himself to his feet with the help of the stump then stamped around the snow for several moments trying to get his blood moving again i hope nobody noticed im gone i hope that gate wasnt somebody out looking for me i feel enough of a fool as it is he hitched his pack over his shoulder and took his bearings all right lets try again center and ground and open and if i find out that moondance had anything to do with this ill his head rang again and he swayed and almost fell but this time the shock was a clear urgent and unmistakable wordless cry for help it sobered him as quickly as andrels bucket of cold water there was no presence to the cry not like any of the gifted or the tayledras had it was just simple and desperate this was no trained mage or herald it could only be an ordinary person in mortal fear gods his head swiveled toward the source of the cry as a needle to a lodestone and without any clear notion of why he was doing so except that it was a cry for help and he had to answer it vanyel began stumbling toward the source at a clumsy run he had been following a gametrail now he was right off any path he ran into a tangle of bushes and could find no way around it driven nearly frantic by the call in his head he finally shoved his way through it then he was in a beech grove there was little or no growth between the straight white columns of the trunks and he picked up his pace until he was at an allout run but the clear growthfree area was too soon passed his breath was burning in his lungs as the forest floor became rougher liberally strewn with tangles of briar and rocks and hillier as well his cloak kept hanging up on things no matter how hard he tried to keep it close to his body he tripped stumbled wildly into the trunk of a tree and picked himself up only to trip a second time and fall flat in the snow the breath was knocked out of him for a moment but that panicked pleading voice in his ear within would not let him give up he scrambled to his feet pulled his cloak loose from a bramble and started running again he must have tripped and fallen a good dozen times over obstacles hidden in the snow and he surely made enough noise to have warned anything that wasnt deaf of his coming anything that wasnt deaf or very busy winded floundering blindly and unable to focus on anything more than a few feet ahead of him he fell over a root just as he reached the crest of a low hill and dropped into a thicket of bushes that crowned it he saw the danger before he got up and broke through their protective cover he froze where he was the danger was too intent on its victims to have paid any attention to the racket hed been making likely an entire cavalry troupe could have come on it unawares this was the very edge of the cleared lands of some smallholder a fertile rivervalley wellwatered sheltered from the worst of the winter weather and summer storms arable land like this could well tempt an enterprising farmer out into the possible perils of the pelagirs there had been a stockade around the house and barns to guard against those hazards that could be foreseen but the stockade of whole tree trunks planted in a ring around the buildings was flattened and uprooted it could not have held more than a few moments against what had come at the settlers out of the bright winter morning vanyel had never seen a colddrake but he knew what it was from descriptions in far too many songs and tales to count less like a lizard and more like a snake with short stubby legs it was the largest living creature vanyel had ever seen from nose to tail it was easily as long as six carts placed endtoend its equine head was the size of a wine barrel it had row upon row of silvery needlesharp spines along its crest and down its back and more spines formed a frill around its neck it snarled silently baring teeth as long as vanyels hand and white and sharp as icicles its wickedly curved claws had torn the earth around it vanyel knew what those looked like moondance had a dagger made from one those claws were longer than his hand and as sharp as the teeth huge deeppurple eyes like perfect cabochon amethysts were fixed unwaveringly upon its prey a young woman and her two children it was a pure silverwhite like the cleanest of snow and its scales sparkled in the sunlight it was at least as beautiful as it was deadly as one mangled body beneath its forefeet testified the creature knew very well how to use its wickedly sharp claws and teeth but neither tail nor fangs and claws was what held the terrified woman and her two children paralyzed almost within reach it was the colddrakes primary weapon the hypnotic power of its eyes it stared at them in complete silence a silence so absolute that vanyel could hear the woman panting in fear where he lay the drake was not moving it was going to bring its prey to within easy reaching distance of it vanyel hadnt reshielded since hed first been impaled upon that dreadful dagger of the womans fear he could still sense her thoughts incoherent hysteric and hopeless her mind wailed and scratched at the walls that the colddrakes violet gaze had set up around it she was trapped they were trapped their wills gone their bodies no longer obeying them that was how her husband the childrens father had died walking right into the creatures grasp his body obedient to its will not his own the beast was slow that was the true horror of it if they could just distract it for a crucial moment break its gaze they could escape it vanyel could hear other minds too out there on the opposite side of the clearing the rest of the extended family there must have been dozens of them had made it past the slowmoving drake to the safety and shelter of the woods only these four had not the woman burdened with her toddlers and the man staying to protect them he could hear bits of their anguish like a chorus wailing beneath the womans keening fear vanyel stared at the trapped three just as paralyzed as they were his mouth was dry and his heart hammered with fear he couldnt seem to think it was as if those violet eyes were holding him captive too there was movement at the edge of his field of vision no not all had fled to the woods from around the corner of the barn came a man limping painfully slowly but moving so quietly that the snow didnt even creak beneath his boots he was stalking the drake a new set of thoughts invaded vanyels mind fragmentary but enough to tell him what the man was about get close enough to stick im it was an old man a tired old man it was the womans grandfather hed been caught in the barn when the thing attacked and knocked the stockade flat and hed seen his granddaughters husband walk into the things jaws hed recognized the drake for what it was and hed armed himself with the only weapon he could find a pitchfork ridiculous against a colddrake get them eyes off er an she kin run fer it the colddrake was paying no attention to anything except the prey right before it the old man crept up behind it without it ever noticing he was there the old man knew with calm certainty that he was going to die he knew that his attack was never going to do anything more than anger the creature but it would break the things concentration it would make it turn its head away for one crucial moment his attack was suicidal but it would give his granddaughter and her children a chance to live he came within an arms length of the colddrake he poised the pitchfork as casually as if he were about to stab a haybale and he struck burying the pitchfork tines in the colddrakes side with a sound like a knife burying itself to the hilt in a block of wood the drake screamed its whistling shriek shattered the dreadful silence and nearly shattered vanyels eardrums it whipped its head around on its long snaky neck and it seized the old man before he even let go of the pitchfork with a snap of its jaws that echoed even above its shrill screeching it bit the old mans head neatly off his shoulders vanyel screamed as he felt the old man die and the oldsters desperate courage proved to be too much of a goad for him to resist anger fear other emotions he couldnt even name all caught him up raised him to his feet drove him out into the open and exploded out of him with a force that dwarfed the explosion hed caused when starwind had tried to make him call lightning he was thinking just enough to throw up a shield around the woman and her children with one shouted word then he hit the drake with everything he had in him the blast of raw power caught the drake in the side and sent it hurtling up over the roof of the house high into the sky and held it suspended there for one agonizing moment while vanyels insides felt as if they were tearing loose then the power ran out and it fell to the earth bleeding in a hundred places every bone in its body shattered and vanyel dropped to his knees then his hands then collapsed completely to lie spent in the open field under the pale winter sun gasping for breath and wondering what he had done savil surveyed the last of the colddrake carcasses and turned to starwind biting her lip in anxiety wheres the queendrake no sign of her he replied shortly holding to his feet with pure will hed taken the brunt of the attack and he was dizzy and weak from the effort of holding the center while savil and moondance closed the jaws of the trap about the colddrake swarm i have not seen her either moondance called up the hill he was checking each carcass in case one should prove to be an immature queen it was unlikely to see a swarm with a juvenile queen but it wasnt unheard of either yfandes had consented to carry the tayledras double the need to get to the place where the drake swarm was before the swarm reached inhabited areas was too great for any other consideration starwind had then served as the bait afoot while moondance on yfandes and savil on kellan had been the arms of the trap no queens he said flatly having checked the sixth and final body the fight had stripped the snow from the hilltop exposing the blackened slope the six drakes lay upon the scorched turf in twisted silver heaps like the baroque silver ornaments of a careless giantess strewn across black velvet ashke are you well moondance asked anxiously leaving the last of the bodies and climbing the hill with a certain amount of haste starwind looked as if his legs were going to give out on him at any moment and yfandes had moved up to lend him her shoulder as support he leaned on it with a murmur of gratitude as the healeradept reached his side i will do well enough once i have a chance to breathe the elder tayledras replied as moondance added his support to yfandes i am more worried that we did not find the queen do you suppose savil began then all three of them felt an incredible surge of raw wild power and it had vanyels presence laced through it mlord someone was tugging at his shoulder vanyel lifted his head from his arms that was just about the limit of his capabilities right now gods he said dazedly as the stocky young cloakshrouded woman at his side tried to get him to sit up oh please just dont do that right now mlord ye be hurt she asked thick brows knitting with concern ye baint hurt best ye get inside fore nother them things comes arent anymore he replied heavily giving in to her urging and hauling himself into a sitting position the sun seemed very bright and and just on the verge of being painful to his watering eyes gods its one of the holders shes going to lay into me for not coming sooner he thought squinting at her and already wincing in anticipation of harsh words shes going to want to know why i didnt save the old man or come in time to save the young one what can i tell her how can i tell her it was because i was too scared to move until the old man threw himself at the thing ye saved us mlord she said brown eyes wide the awe in her voice plain even to vanyels exhausted ears ye came t save us i dunno how ye knew but mlord i baint got no way t thank ye he stared at her in amazement but be ye with the birdlords mlord ye baint their look but they be the only mages abaht that give a bent nail fer folks good birdlords he repeated stupidly tchah menfreetis only a boy an hes flat paid out the newcomer was an older woman a bit wrinkled and weathered but with a kindly if careworn face she bunched her cloak around her arms and bent over him na lad ye come in ye get warm an less amuddled an then ye tell yer tale hrom she took vanyels elbow and he perforce had to get up or else pull her down beside him the next thing he knew he was being guided across the ruts of the plowed field past the carcass of the colddrake he shuddered as he saw the size of it up close up to the battered porch of the house and into the shadowed doorway he was not only confused with exhaustion but he was feeling more than a little awkward and out of place these were the kind of people he had most tried to avoid at home those mysterious inscrutable peasantfarmers whose needs and ways he did not understand surely they would turn on him in a moment for not being there when they needed help but they didnt the older woman pushed him down onto a stool beside the enormous fireplace at the heart of the kitchen the younger took his cloak and pack and a boy brought him hot sweetened tea when one of the bearded darkclad men started to question him the older woman shooed him away pulling off her own dun cloak and throwing it over a bench ye leave th boy be fer a bit magnus i seen this bfore with one a them birdladdies they does the magickin then theys amaundered a whiles she patted vanyel on the head in a rather proprietary sort of fashion he said there aint no more critters so ye git on with takin care a poor old kern an tansys man an let this lad get hisself sorted vanyel huddled on the stool and watched them blinking in the halfdark of the kitchen as they got their lives put back together with a minimum of fuss someone went to deal with the bodies someone saw to the hysterical young mother someone else planned of rites yes they were mourning the deaths simply and sincerely without any of the kind of hysterics hed half feared but they were not allowing their grief to get in the way of getting on with their lives not were they allowing it to cripple their efforts at getting their protections back in place their simple courage made him somehow feel very ashamed of himself it was in that introspective mood that the others found him i know it was a stupid thing to do to run off like that but vanyel shrugged i wont make any excuses ive been doing a lot of stupid things lately i wasnt thinking well dont be too hard on yourself foresight dreams have a way of doing that to people savil said crossing her legs and settling back on her stool beside the hearth they tend to get you on the boil and then lock up your ability to think you wouldnt be the first to go charging off in some wildhare direction after waking up with one and you probably wont be the last no thank you megan she said to the wideeyed child who offered her tea were fine if the settlers had been awed by vanyel theyd been struck near speechless by the sight of the tayledras they didnt know a herald from a birch tree but they knew who and what the hawkbrothers were and had accorded them the deference due a crowned head all three of the adults were weary and relief at finding both that vanyel was intact and that the queendrake was indisputably deceased had them just about ready to collapse so theyd taken the settlers hospitality with gratitude settling in beside the hearth and accepting tea and shelter without demur vanyel had waited just long enough for them to get settled before launching into a full confession so when i finally managed to acquire some sense he continued i figured the best way to find my way back would be to look for where all the mageenergy was i did everything like you told me master starwind and i opened up and the next thing i knew it was nearly noon somebodyd opened up a gate i think somewhere nearby and it knocked me put cold ha i told you those things were gated in savil exclaimed sorry lad i didnt mean to interrupt you then what well i didnt think there was anyone around here but tayledras so i thought one of them had done it i started to open up again to find the vale and i heard a call for help i got here and when i saw that colddrake kill the old man i just i just couldnt stand by and not do anything i didnt even think about it i wish i had i think i overdid it with a colddrake particularly a queen better overkill savil replied exchanging a look of veiled satisfaction with starwind you may have acted a fool but it put you in the right place at the right time and i am not going to berate you for it aunt savil i he flushed and hunched himself up a little i got here before the old man came out i didnt do anything until he i mean i was just hiding in the bushes i guess he said in a very small voice i guess fathers right i am a coward i could have saved him and i didnt did you know you could have saved him moondance asked quietly his square face still did you know that your magepowers would work against the drake well no you ran toward the danger when you mindheard the call for help right savil asked not away well yes and you simply froze when you saw the strange monster you did not flee starwind raised one long eyebrow i guess thats what happened i think perhaps you have mistaken inexperience for cowardice young vanyel starwind said with conviction a coward would have run away from a plea for help a coward would have fled at the first glimpse of the drake you were indecisive but you remained it is experience that makes one decisive and you have precious little of that mlord starwind one of the homespunclad men of the settlement was standing diffidently at the tayledras elbow phellip i wish you would not call me lord starwind sighed shaking his head you hold your lands under our protection yes but it is a simple matter of barter foodstuffs for guardianship and no more than that aye m master starwind master this drake she just be chancecome or be there anythin more to it starwind turned to look at him more closely and with some interest why do you ask that phellip coughed and flushed well mlord i was born n bred west a here mpeople held land a magelord grenvis he were all right but well when is neighbors had a notion t play war they useta bring in drakes an th like aforehand and you think something of the sort might be in the offing phellip i congratulate you on your foresight the thought had only just occurred to me da one of the boys couldnt contain himself any longer and bounced up beside his father da there gonna be a war with fightin an magic an phellip grabbed the loose cloth of the boys tunic and pulled him close jo i want ye t lissen t what mlord starwind is gonna tell ye mlord you tell im e don believe is of man that fightin aint good fer nothin but fillin up graveyards young man starwind fixed the boy with an earnest stare there is nothing fine about warfare there is nothing glorious about battle all that a war means to such as you and i is that people we know and love will die probably senselessly others will be crippled for life and the fools who began it all will sit back in their high castles and plot a way to get back what they lost if there were to be a war which trust me phellip i shall try most earnestly to prevent the very best you could hope for young man would be to see these lovely fields around you put to the torch so that you would face a very hungry winter that is what warfare is all about the only justifiable fight is a defensive one and in any fight it is the innocents who ultimately suffer the most the boy didnt look convinced vanyel cleared his throat and the boy shot a look at him pretty exciting the way that drake just nipped off that fool old mans head wasnt it starwind he drawled in exaggerated imitation of some of the young courtiers of his own circle the boy paled then reddened but before he could burst into either tears or angry words vanyel looked him straight in the eyes so fiercely that he could not look away thats what youll see in a war jo he said harshly not people in tales getting killed your people getting killed younglings oldsters everybody and some fool at the rear crowing about how exciting it all is thats what its about now jo looked stricken and perhaps convinced out of the corner of his eye vanyel saw the farmer nodding in approval out of nowhere vanyel felt a sudden rush of kindred feeling for these people suddenly they werent faceless inscrutable monoliths anymore suddenly they were people people who were in some ways a great deal more like him than his own relatives were they had lives and loves and cares their outlook on warfare was certainly closer to his than that of any of his blood relations they arent that much different than me except except that i can do something they cant i can i can protect them when they cant protect themselves and they can do things i cant but i could learn to grow a carrot if i had to it probably wouldnt be a very good carrot but i could grow one they wont ever be able to blast a colddrake what does that mean really what does that say about my life why can i do these things and not someone else and what about the people out there who who send drakeswarms out to eat helpless farmers if i can protect people like this from people like them doesnt that mean that i really have to he looked up and saw his aunts eyes she was watching the children at their chores cleaning and chopping vegetables for a stew her expression was at once protective and worried its the way savil feels its got to be thats why shes a herald and suddenly tylenders words came back to him so clearly that it seemed for a moment as if tylendel were sitting beside him again murmuring into his ear its a kind of hunger i cant help it ive got these abilities these gifts and i cant not use them i couldnt sit here knowing that there were people out there who need exactly the kind of help i can give them and not make the effort to find them and take care of them now he understood those words oh the irony of it this part of tylendel that he had never been able to comprehend now it was clear now that tylendel was gone now he understood oh godshe closed his eyes against the sting of tears oh yes now he understood because now he felt that way too too late to share it fourteen well to all appearances savil was asleep beside the settlers stone hearth as she mindspoke starwind in privatemode in actuality despite her weariness she was anything but sleepy and was watching the fire through halfslitted eyes as she waited for the opportunity to confer with him her single word contained a world of overtones that she was fairly certain hed pick up interesting on several levels he replied he was lying on his back arms beneath his head his eyes also closed the settlers savil had learned before the evening was over that they were calling their lands garthhold and that there were seven looselyrelated families in the group had offered the tayledras and their friends unlimited hospitality all four of them were bonetired even after rest and tea and it was agreed among the three adults that it would be no bad thing to take them up on it they refused however to put anyone out of his bed so after a dinner of bread and stew they made it plain that they intended to sleep by the fireside the four of them were currently rolled up in their cloaks on sacks of straw to keep them off the stone of the floor beside the glowing coals of the kitchen hearth vanyel was genuinely asleep savil wasnt certain of moondance he was curled on his side his face to the fire as peaceful and serene as a childs by all rights he should really be asleep thered been several injuries related to the colddrakes attack and the hasty escapes and moondance had had his hands full healing them then he had delegated himself magical assistant to getting the stockade back up it had saved the garthholders no end of effort to have the logs spellraised back into place he should have been exhausted so savil thought until he mindspoke both of them may i enter the conversation i assume there is one so much for moondance being weary be welcome but keep it in private she replied among other things were discussing the boy starwind go on please from the small things to the great i think perhaps you may cease to fear for the boy i think he now feels the hunger you spoke of and understanding has been attained herein the question is if the boy can conquer his fears i wondered about that hes been wearing a very odd look on his face this evening and ive never known him to be as friendly with common folk as he was tonightshe opened her eyes wide and stared at the glowing embers of the hearth without really seeing them poor van if that dream of his is foresight thats a hell of a burden to carry around it still may never come to be moondance reminded them and the straw of his bedding crackled as he shifted we still see only the thing most likely at this moment and the moment is always changing i would change the subject we have a more urgent consideration those colddrakes were gated here that speaks of great trouble to come starwind replied his mindvoice dark and grim there is no doubt in my mind at this moment that the drakes were sent to harry this area in advance of a fighting forcethe fire popped once this has gone beyond tampering there was a village to the west of here under tacit k treva protection i can no longer sense it it is under a foreign shield someone moved in and took it over hmm savil brooded on that a moment what would you say to us organizing a little surprise for whoever sent those drakes i doubt anyone is expecting k treva response this soon by rights dividing the swarm should have kept us busy for a week starwinds mindvoice was troubled i would say that you are not ktreva and i would reply that i am wingsister which makes me just as much k treva as moondance i would say also that two mages tampering in this area is a very unlikely coincidence ft is far more likely that this is the same mage who was hired by the leshara of valdemar which makes it the more my fight more straw rustled and savil moved her head slightly just enough to see starwinds ironic gaze bent on her for a long moment and i moondance put in would say that my shaykrethashke is unlikely to win a battle of wills with such a stubborn one as i know the wingsister to be i would also say that three adepts are better in this than two starwind sighed i fear i am defeated ere i begin what do we do with the boy then we cannot leave him here and i mislike taking the time to take him back to the vale that will lose us the element of surprise he may prove useful moondance said unexpectedly he did defeat the queendrake we bring him i suppose savil agreed though with some misgiving surely yfandes can be counted on to keep him out of serious trouble i cannot like it but i must agree starwind replied reluctantly this is a great deal of danger to be taking one so untested and so newlyhealed into i know savil said wishing the coals burning in the fireplace didnt look so much like a burning town believe me i know it had been snowing all day not heavily but steadily the air felt almost warm the companions moved like white spirits through the drifts of flurries each carrying double white horses white riders all but one the one riding pillion behind the second companion was in smoky black and dark gray a shadow to a ghost you all look like heralds vanyel said from the pillionpad behind moondance everyone does except me how so moondance asked somewhat surprised its your white outfits savil supplied as kellan lagged a little so that she could reply without having to turn her head heralds always wear white uniforms when theyre on duty ah youngling tayledras always wear the colors best suited to blend into the treetops in winter white in summer obviously green moondance was carefully plaiting a new bowstring using both hands he wasnt even bothering with the reins he had those looped up on the pommel of the saddle vanyel didnt much care for riding pillion but it wasnt bad behind moondance the younger tayledras didnt mind talking to him as vanyel had suspected he had forgiven vanyel even before he made his apology to the tayledras which he had done as soon as he could get moondance alone it only seemed right now it was as if the incident had never occurred moondance even seemed to welcome his questions and encouraged him to ask them theyd talked about vanyels gifts mostly vanyel hadnt actually talked about them to anyone savil hadnt had much opportunity to do so and starwind had just gone directly into his head showed him what to do and then expected him to do it so what were we up to moondance asked foresight vanyel shivered moondance i dont like it i dont want to know whats going to happen is there any way i can block it now that it is active not to my knowledge but you must not let it cripple you kechara you are not seeing the irrevocable future you see the future as it may be if nothing changes the most likely at this moment these things may change you can change them i can vanyel perked up at this assuredly but it may be that the cost of such a change is to dissolve a friendship or a love you would not willingly forgo you may feel such a bond is worth the price he smiled crookedly back over his shoulder if i were to have the certain knowledge that my lifebond to starwind would send me to my death tomorrow i would go willingly to that fate but i would not tell starwind of my foreknowledge think on that if you will vanyel did brood on that for several furlongs it was moondance in yfandes saddle and not vanyel because if they were surprised by an attack vanyel had been ordered to drop off the pillion pad and stay out of the fight it was humiliating but sensible vanyel was rather more acutely interested in sensible than in humiliating at the moment if an attack came hed obey those orders hed learned his lesson with the colddrake well are there no more questions kechara vanyel shook his head then i have one for you starwind has said that when you were frightened in practice you pulled power from the valleynode is this true whats the valleynode savil did not tell you moondance made a face no patience that one you surely have felt that all things have energy about them yes even rocks geteva if you sense that then your magegift is a most strong one even i have some difficulty with seeing that so have you seen that this energy flows along lines as rainwater to streams vanyel hadnt but when he closed his eyes and extended he could see that moondance was right i do now then follow a stream to the place where it meets another he did there was a kind of knot a concentration of power he told moondance so that is a node moondance nodded tayledras can direct the course of these streams on occasion which is how we take the magic from places where the wars left it and move it to a place where it is useful we build our strongholds over places where two or more powerful streams meet nodes the energy of the node is such that all of us can use it but we have found that amany outland mages not only cannot sense the streams they cannot sense nor use the nodes this may be something only those outsiders at the level of our adepts do well i think it is perhaps unique to the tayledras that all of us from the time we start to feel our gifts awaken manipulate this energy as easily as a child plays with building bricks there was a time very long ago when the tayledras adopted outlanders very commonly and it is said that these outlanders changed even as i have i think that the key to change is using this magic under the direction of tayledras born so of outland adepts we have known only wingsister savil can link into the nodes as well as tayledras her gift is very strong so it seems is yours vanyel was confused as to where all this was leading but what does that mean moondance for now you exhausted yourself when you killed the colddrake that is something you need not do quite so quickly if you remember that you can pull from the lifeenergy nodes within your sensing range when they are drained then you use your own strength thats what ive been trying to tell you yfandes said unexpectedly in his mind that gave him food for thought for several more candlemarks theyd journeyed westward from garthhold with the rising of the sun stopping three times on the way to question folk starwind knew the first had been a fur trapper whod told them of rumors of a renegade wizard who was halfhuman halfpelagir changeling and had sorcerous skills and a taste for worldly power the second was a kyree a wolflike creature with a mind fully the equal of any human he stopped them mindspeaking to warn them of of the same wizard but his stories were more than mere rumors to his certain knowledge the changeling was planning to carve himself a realm of his own as quickly as he could and had already begun that task the third had been one of ktrevas borderguards not tayledras herself but another of the pelagir changelings a tervardi a kind of flightless birdwoman she was no longer among the living when starwind had been unable to mindcall her they had detoured to the grove of trees that held her ekele there was no sign of a struggle but they found the fragile whiteplumaged wraith in her ekele dead without a mark upon her but with her bow in her hand bowstring snapped and her empty glazed eyes wide with what vanyel assumed was fear starwind spent some moments beside the body working some kind of subtle magic vanyel could feel things stirring even if he couldnt yet read them what it was starwind found he would not tell vanyel but the three adults grew very grim and moondance took the bow and its arrows when they left they had been riding all day cutting crosscountry at the groundeating pace only a companion could maintain it was nearing sunset when they slowed on coming to what looked to be a fairly welltraveled road savil and kellan halted while they were still within the cover of the forest and yfandes came up beside them as silently as it was possible for something the size and weight of a companion to do the snowladen branches of an enormous evergreen shielded them from the view of anyone on that road although the road itself looked deserted there didnt seem to be any new tracks on it and all the old ones had been softened with a layer of new undisturbed snow the road was lined on both sides by a row of these evergreens though and anything could lie in wait undetected behind them the village of covia lies a few furlongs up that road starwind whispered as the sun sank in sullen glory ahead of them there is still a shield upon it and i do not like the feel of the power behind that shield i do not however sense that the power is presently in the village nor i replied savil after a moment nothing yfandes said to vanyel fandes says she doesnt feel anything either he reported feeling rather in the way my thought is to enter the village and see how much is amiss and what the people know then vanyel it is in my mind to leave you with the villagers you have enough magetraining to be some protection to them and they may be of some physical protection to you i yes master starwind he replied not much liking the idea but not seeing any other choice what about fandes i dont like it but ill go with them yfandes said reluctantly if you need me ill know and they need a second mount vanyel reported yfandes words with a sinking heart starwind nodded i think she has the right of it we can cover more ground mounted well he peered up the road through the gathering evening gloom i think it is time to see the handiwork of our enemy vanyel was doing his best not to be sick again hed already lost control over his stomach once just outside of covia when theyd found the wizards warnoff it was well after sundown and pitchy dark outside of the village square the entire population of the village upwards of seventy people was jammed into the tiny square many of them had brought lanterns and torches they were crowding about the four strangers and two companions like baby chicks seeking the shelter of the hens wings although they were paying scant attention to savil and less than that to vanyel and the companions the herald was a dubious and unknown quantity and the boy and the horses were being dismissed out of hand the party had made a kind of impromptu dais out of the low porch of the temple which was barely large enough to hold the four humans the companions were serving as living barricades on either side to keep them from being totally overwhelmed as it was it was getting a little cramped behind the two tayledras but vanyel was beginning to be rather glad he was being ignored between the tales the villagers were telling starwind and the physical evidences they were displaying in the flickering of the torchlight to substantiate those storiesit wasnt easy for vanyel to control his nausea this had been a pleasant little village as safe as any place inside the pelagirs people could feel comfortable about raising children had time for celebrations now and again it was no longer pleasant nor safe it was now a place under siege with no way out two weeks ago a stranger had come to the village mounted on something that was not a horse and accompanied by a retinue of some of the pelagirs least attractive denizens he had announced that the town and its inhabitants were now his and had helped himself to whatever he wanted after one demonstration of his power had left a heap of ash where the village inn had once stood these folk had more sense than to resist but they had attempted to send for help the remains of their messenger were found the next morning impaled on a stake in the middle of the outbound road the frozen corpse was still there the companions had passed it on the way in from the look of the man simple impalement had come as a relief he had come back about every other night each time taking both goods and victims the villagers told starwind that they had been praying for help they assumed he was the answer to those prayers he seemed to vanyel at least to be agreeing with that assumption vanyel was just grateful that the fitful torchlight wasnt bright enough for him to see much of the details of what had been done to some of the wizards victims he was equally grateful that he was in the dark at the back of the porch behind savil thiss the last master starwind the swarthy unshaven headman said wearily his redrimmed eyes those of one who had seen far too much of horror in the past few days this girl he pushed a mousy blonde female right up onto the porch where vanyel couldnt avoid looking at her the young woman would still have been attractive if she hadnt been vacanteyed and drooling she was filthy her hair matted and hanging in lank snarls starwind flinched at the sight of her but moondance fearlessly took her face in both his slender hands and gazed into her blank brown eyes for a long time when he finally released her his face and voice were tight with anger i think that brightwind may be able to bring her mind back he said slowly and carefully as if he was trying to keep from saying something he had rather not speak aloud it will require many months and she will never be able to bear the touch of a man she has been too far hurt within even so all those channels meant for pleasure have been warped and now can only carry pain i do not know if even i can heal that i do not think that anything will be able to heal her heart and soul of what was done to her not entirely it may be it is better not to try it may be that it is better to wipe all away and begin with her as with a small child the balding headman nodded as if that was what he had expected to hear she was one of the first he took he said heavily her and her mother her father was the messenger we sent we never found anything of her mother and he grows stronger this krebain with every person he takes starwind asked the torches wavered in the wind casting weird shadows across the mans hollowcheeked face as he nodded vanyel could scent the coming of more snow in that wind he seems to seems to me hes doing bloodmagic wouldnt you say master starwind starwind nodded and narrowed his eyes in thought aye gallen you know your lore well i think so this krebain has retreated to whatever place he has made for a fastness and it is bound to be somewhere near i think we shall continue with my original plan gallen i shall leave young vanyel here with you he knows something of material strategy and warfare he is also magegifted vanyel shivered at the thought of being left alone here the headman cast one doubtful look at him and ventured a protest vanyel didnt much blame him master starwind i beg you this is only a boy he destroyed a queen colddrake alone and unaided moondance said quietly pushing vanyel forward and putting one hand on vanyels shoulder it is in my mind that he could deal with more than you would reckon he did this time the look headman gallen gave him was a little less doubtful but it was still not overly confident gallen i do not expect vanyel to have to defend you from this krebain starwind said patiently he could never be a match for a bloodbound adept and i would not expect it of him i expect him to have to deal with some of this renegades creatures at worst my thought is that the three of us shall find krebain and deal with him and that when his control over his slaves is gone some of them may think to attack here i see no reason why among you you folk and vanyel could not defend yourselves against such lesser dangers does that content you it didnt that was obvious but it was all that headman gallen was going to get and he well knew it vanyel attempted to put himself into the mindset of a warleader he didnt feel particularly successful at it van see what you can do about organizing these folk savil said quietly you know most of those old ballads by heart and theres lots of good advice in them thats why we make you learn them i dont want you to try anything more than a token defense if something does come at you that you cant handle just call yfandes for help and delay things as long as you can for the rest the creatures theyve described are strong but not particularly bright barricades across the road and fire should keep most of them at bay you took that queen colddrake remember that you can take just about anything else except this krebain himself so long as it isnt a small army vanyel gulped and tried to look competent and brave this is what it all comes down to doesnt it this is what i have to do i have to like lendel said because these people need me yes aunt he said carefully barricades and fire savil looked worried and preoccupied do your best lad remember that voice i used to stop you and lendel fighting it makes people listen goes right to their guts imitate that if you can she mounted kellan from the porch starwind took yfandes saddle but moondance hesitated a moment before taking the pillion behind him vanyel kechara remember what i told you about the nodes use them there are he paused and his eyes unfocused for a moment there are three that i can sense that you should be able to use i wish you could reach the valleynode as we can but i think it is beyond your strength for now none of the three nearby are as strong as the valleynode but taken together they should serve he took vanyels face between his hands and kissed him on the forehead gods be with you youngling with fortune this will be no more than an interesting exercise for you he mounted behind starwind and the crowd of villagers parted to let them through vanyel watched them vanish into the darkness with a heavy heart if he hadnt been so frightened himself hed have lost his temper a dozen times over he had to keep explaining to these people time and time again exactly what he wanted of them and why he wanted it and would turn his back on one group thinking that he had finally gotten through to them only to return to find theyd abandoned the project and were staring apprehensively off into the darkness it wasnt that they were stupid it was that they were so completely without hope they couldnt see any chance of holding off anything and so they had abandoned any thought of being able to do so after all their best efforts hadnt done anything but get folks killed vanyel who was counting on them to be as much protection for him as he would be for them was nearly frantic it took hours before he was finally able to get them going under their own power then there was the matter of defense when dawn came and he asked for their weaponry he got as illused and motley an assortment of nearjunk as hed ever seen and there wasnt a one of them who knew how to use any of it these were farmers born and farmers bred most of them off lands held of lords or magelords who were bound to protect them the ktreva had bartered protection for madestuffs and foodstuffs and they had never thought theyd need to raise a blade in their own defense so vanyel was faced with the task of showing rank amateurs the way of the sword forget teaching them pointwork forget the finer points of defense in the end he padded them to the eyebrows and set them to bashing at each other teach them to hold something long and poke with it or hold something heavy and smash with it and if it was something with an edge hope that the edge rather than the flat connected by the second day of this he was tired to the bone halfmad with frustration and frantic with the fear he dared not show so when veth gallens halfgrown son came at him wide open for the hundredth time he lost his temper completely and hit him with a full force blow he had not consciously intended to deliver and tried to pull it too late to do any good he knocked the boy halfway across the square veth landed sprawled on his back and didnt move and vanyels heart stopped and in his mind he saw jervis standing over him oh gods vanyels sword went flying his helm followed it as he ran to kneel at veths side in the cold dust of the square oh gods oh gods ive done to him what jervis did to me oh please gods please dont let me have hurt him he unlaced the boys helm and pulled it off about then veth blinked up at him and started to sit up of himself and vanyel nearly cried with relief veth please veth im sorry i i lost my temper i didnt mean it the boy looked at him with bewilderment eh master van i be all right i been kicked by our old mule worse nor this just let me get a bit of a drink eh vanyel sagged back on his heels shutting his eyes against the harsh sunlight limp with relief the boy got gingerly to his feet oh gods i im as bad as jervis im worse than jervis i know better oh gods vanyel young sir he looked up it was reva veths mother her tired face anxious he winced and waited for her to give him the tonguelashing he deserved it didnt come if youll forgive me for being an interfering old hen she said with a little quirk of her mouth i think youve about worn yourself into uselessness young sir i know you havent eaten since last night now here she offered him her hand astounded he took it and to his utter befuddlement she hauled him to his feet now she put one arm around his shoulders the other about veths i think its time you both got a bit of food in you the time it takes to eat wont make veth a better fighter nor you a better teacher she hugged them both as if they were both her sons then released them the words he had thrown into withens face was it only a year ago came back to shame him further let every man that must go to battle fight within his talents and not be forced to any one school ive been treating them exactly the way jervis treated me forcing them to use things they dont know to go outside of their talents i am a complete and incompetent fool vanyel blushed and stammered i im no kind of a teacher mistress reva or id not have chosen what i did to teach he raised his voice so the rest of those practicing in the square could hear him this is getting us nowhere its like you trying to teach me to to plow and spin for a midsummer contest a week away we havent the time and im a fool now please what are your real weapons any of you know the use of bow or sling boarspear maybe it was not his imagination there were looks of real relief all across the square and the beginnings of smiles but in the end all his preparations were in vain the villagers willing to fight were on the barricades there were really only two blockades there was only one road going through the village and it led directly through the poundeddirt square the square itself was fairly defensible now not even a colddrake would have been able to get past the buildings the folk too frightened or unable to defend themselves had faded away into the shadows as they did every night to scatter and hide in the cellars and attics of the buildings around the square headman gallen had by now come to the conclusion that vanyel knew something of what he was about he and two or three of the other folk not too cowed to take a stand including the old herbwitch who took a dim view of this young upstart wizard taking over her village were having a hasty conference with vanyel on supplies when a surge of gateenergy invoked practically under vanyels nose knocked him to his knees and very nearly knocked him out the only thing that saved him from unconsciousness this time was that he was completely under shield he found himself gasping for breath and completely disoriented for a moment his eyes had flashing lights in front of them and he shook his head to try and clear it that was a mistake his head reacted poorly to the abrupt movement he could hardly think much less see gods what in what do we have here the clear musical tenor voice sounded amused and vanyel froze the voice carried clearly the petrified silence in the square was as deltas the nine pits he looked up when his eyes cleared and found that all he could see were the backs of people the members of his erstwhile warcouncil were standing huddled together as if to keep him hidden in the shadows behind them vanyel got hold of the splintery side of the storehouse and pulled himself cautiously to his feet ducking his head behind gallens and standing on tiptoe to peek over the shoulders of the men in front of him his gut went cold when he saw the flamboyantly dressed stranger in the middle of the cleared square this could only be the wizard krebain the torches falling from the hands of the stunned villagers were unneeded the wizard had brought his own magelight with him it hung over his head a tiny greenyellow sun people were slowly backing away until they ran into the walls and the barricades leaving the stranger standing in arrogant isolation in the exact center of the dusty square the wizard was a gaudy sight he wore scarlet and gold skintight breeches closecut goldembroidered velvet tunic scarlet cloak with clothofgold lining even his boots and velvet gloves were scarlet he had a scarlet helm that was more than half mask ornamented with a preposterous crest of a rampant dragon in gold with one hand on his hip he tapped at his chin with a gloved finger as he turned to survey the people surrounding the square a rebellion i do believe this is a rebellion how droll he laughed it had a nasty sound to it he was graceful slim and very tall whiteblond hair tumbled from beneath the helm in wavy shining cascades what could be seen of his face was like elegantly sculptured marble vanyel found himself caught by the wizards sheer charismatic beauty none of the villagers had said anything about that vanyel felt almost sick evil such as had been described to him shouldnt be beautiful but then he thought artificial that really is what he is hes changed himself im sure of it like painting his face only more so if i had a lot of power and didnt care how i used it i suppose id make myself beautiful too i wonder what could have roused you worms to think to stand against me krebain mused aloud none of you had half an ounce of courage before this but then none of you smelled of the mageborn before this either other than that foolish old witch of yours over there he smiled slyly i think i detect a stranger among you hmm now where have you hidden him ice crawled up vanyels spine all they have to do is point a finger at me and even if they dont if i call yfandes for help he ii know where i am oh gods can i hide i cant challenge him they cant expect it of me im no match for him but to his surprise not a single one of those remaining in the square answered the wizards question in fact the men standing in front of vanyel moved closer together as if to shield him from the wizards chance sight the wizards voice sharpened with impatience i grow weary curs where is the stranger i sensed silence except for the herbwitch who whispered back at vanyel with the merest breath stay quiet boy youre no fit opponent for him and we know it wont do any of us any good for you to get caught and he just may take us apart for spite even if he gets you maybe if he gets bored hell go away i said i want to know where the stranger is the wizard looked about him both hands on his hips now and anger in his pose very well i see its time you learned another lesson he turned slightly so that he was staring right at the group clustered in front of vanyel and raised his left hand you gallen he made a little summoning motion come here gallen made a staggering step then another he was fighting the wizard with his will but losing sweat popped out all over his brow and he made a whimpering noise in the back of his throat behind him the group closed ranks still shielding vanyel from view before him the wizard grinned sadistically you really havent a hope of fighting me you know he said pleasantly its like a babe challenging an armed warrior come along theres a good dog gallen ran the last few steps coming to a trembling halt at the wizards side krebain strolled around him looking him over carefully the magelight followed in faithful attendance above his head lets see i believe you have a wife he swept his gaze over the rest of the villagers yes indeed and there she is reva my goodness a wouldbe swordlady are you come here my dear he crooked his finger and dusky reva stumbled out of the group at the barricade on the west road still clutching her improvised pike of a knife strapped to the end of a staff her face was strained white and a mask of despair krebain shook his head really my dear you have no use for a weapon like that take it from her gallen gallen did not move sweat poured down his face glistening in the magelight i said take it krebains voice sharpened with command and gallens gnarled hands slowly reached forward to take the pike from his wife now just rest the point of that wicked little knife on her stomach why dont you gallen his face reflecting his agony lowered the pike until the point of the blade touched his wifes stomach he whimpered again as krebains will made him brace it krebains smile grew broader of course reva it would be very painful if you were to walk forward just now vanyel couldnt bear it he gathered what little there was of his courage and shouted his voice breaking stop it he pushed his protectors aside and walked out from behind them to stand in the open a pace or two in front of them and in the moment when krebain turned to face him licking his lips he mindcalled with all his strength yfandes the mage hes here fandes thats enough child vanyel felt a barrier close down around the village a barrier that allowed no thought to escape and no further call for help he raised his chin with the same bleak defiance that had served him against his father let them alone wizard he said his voice trembling despite his efforts to keep it steady he could feel sweat trickling coldly down the back of his neck and his mouth was dry and sour with fear im the one you wanted krebain made a dismissing gesture and reva and gallen staggered as his hold over them was released gallen threw down the pike and seized her shoulders and together they melted into the crowd at krebains back come where i can see you the wizard said mildly vanyel walked with slow and hesitant steps into the area where the magelight was striking what a pleasant surprise unless krebain was feigning it which was possible he was surprised and pleased if vanyel could keep him in that mood maybe he could keep them all safe a little longer he began to feel a tiny stirring of hope what a truly pleasant surprise my wouldbe enemy is a beautiful young man what is your name lovely one vanyel saw no reason not to answer him if nothing else if yfandes had heard him hed be buying time for help to arrive he allowed himself a moment to hope a little more then replied vanyel ashkevron vanyel i do not believe this vanyel ashkevron the wizard laughed throwing back his head what a joke what a magnificent jest i come ahunting you and you walk unarmed into my very hand vanyel shook his head bewildered the wizard grinned dear lovely boy you have enemies you know enemies with no appreciation of beauty and a great deal of coin to spend wester leshara holds you to blame for the death of his cousin evan didnt you know that he sent me an additional commission to deal with you as i had with young staven frelennye i had thought to attend to my own pursuits a while here then deal with you at my leisure allowing matters to cool first but now i dont know that i am going to oblige him by killing you not when you turn out to be so very beautiful come closer would you vanyel felt no magical coercion which rather surprised him if you dont mind he said carefully id really rather not this time krebains smile held a hint of real humor then i shall have to come to you beautiful vanyel he paced gracefully across the pounded dirt of the village square taking each step as though he walked on a carpet of petals strewn especially for his benefit the magelight continued to follow him faithfully he strolled around vanyel as he had walked around gallen but his expression this time was less cruelly cheerful and more acquisitive his path was an inwardturning spiral with vanyel as the center so that he completed his circuit facing vanyel and less than a handspan away he reached out with one crimsongloved hand ignoring the presence of everyone in the square as if he and vanyel were alone together and laid it along vanyels cheek vanyel looked steadily into his blueblack eyes within the shadowed eyeholes of the helmmask and did not flinch away those eyes were the first indication he had seen that the wizard was something other than human those dark and frightening eyes were slitted like a cats and under the velvet of the glove vanyel could feel something very sharp and talonlike resting on his cheek my goodness krebain breathed silver eyes rare and beautiful vanyel ashkevron how wonderful and how strange that you should be here at this moment and i wonder now given what i know of tylendel frelennye were you only the friend of tylendel or were you something more than friend still ignoring everyone else he leaned forward and kissed vanyel passionately and deeply vanyel trembled with an unexpected reaction comprised of both revulsion and desire half of him wanted to pull away and strike at this creature who could casually force a man to stab his own wife who could regard the villagers about them so lightly as to totally ignore them at this moment the other half of him wanted to melt into the wizards arms he fought the temptation to yield this dammit its nothing but sex thats all it is i know what real love feels like and this isnt close he closed his eyes as his knees went to water a dreamflash surrender to me heraldmage vanyel leareth said take my darkness to you had that dream been not foresight but a warning he fought to think clearly battling silently but daring to give no outward sign of his struggle it was at that moment that he realized that whatever other powers this wizard had he did not share vanyels mindgifts like thoughtsensing for instance the shield over the village was spellcast not mindcast which meant that vanyel should be able to read the wizard without krebain knowing he was being read krebain finally brought an end to the kiss pulling away slowly and reluctantly taking his hand from vanyels cheek with a tender caress of his velvetclad fingers oh he whispered his eyes halfshut the slits in them narrowed to nearinvisibility oh beautiful and rare lovely vanyel come with me come with me be my love i can teach you more than you have ever dreamed i could carve you a kingdom give you power pleasure anything you desired name it and it would be yours the temptation was incredible and the thought i could guide him i could bring him to compassion he doesnt have to be this way i could make him into something better couldnt i even if i dont love him wouldnt that be worthwhile wouldnt that be a worthy goal and i dont love him but i could care for him i think theres a mutual need isnt that enough his heart raced i have to know what is krebain truly made of if theres something there to work with something i can influence krebain smiled i could even he whispered grant you the finest revenge upon wester leshara the world has ever witnessed a revenge so complete that it would even satisfy tylendels lover the wizards mind was open to vanyels at that crucial instant completely open and unguarded vanyel saw how krebain had gotten his power how and from what he had learned it and the uses he had put it to and how he had enjoyed what he had done there was nothing there that was human or humane gods never never would i give myself to that utter revulsion killed all trace of desire and now vanyel flinched away his nausea plain for anyone to read krebain stepped back an involuntary pace his face flushed he frowned with anger and his expression hardened i will have you vanyel ashkevron with or without a mind vanyel had that much warning to get a shield up had that much warning to scream run at the villagers at least he thought he screamed that warning at them they certainly scattered as quickly as if he had scrambling up and over the barricades that they had built to keep the menace out leaving him alone with the wizard who called the lightnings down on him vanyels body screamed with pain despite the shielding his hair stood on end and fire ran along his nerves he went to his knees beneath the onslaught reinforced his shielding and felt it weakening and then remembered what moondance had said about the powernodes he reached desperately found them tapped into them and felt their power flowing into him giving him a heady surge of strength driving out the pain and renewing the will to fight this monster in human guise he staggered to his feet backed up a pace and deflected krebains own lightnings back into his face the fires arced across the square and the wizard retreated getting his own shields up just in time vanyel did not give him a chance to recover from his surprise but launched an attack of his own not lightnings this time but a vise of power a glowing shroud that he closed around the wizard and began tightening but krebain broke it after a moments struggle and countered with a circle of flame that roared up about him and began eating its way inward vanyel could smell his bootsoles scorching and his skin tightened and hurt vanyel in his turn sweating with the heat and his fear and effort called upon the dust of the square to rise and snuff the flames this time krebain gave him no chance to invoke a counterattack but summoned a magestorm like the one in vanyels dream it howled down out of the night sky and surrounded him in a cloud of wind and energy crackling with it screaming with it and like the one in vanyels dream this one ate away at his shields as fast as he could bring them up the whirlwind howled and raged obscuring sight he couldnt see couldnt see anything anymore just the flickering storm of power shrieking around him coming closer by the moment one by one the nodes went drained and dead now there was only his own strength left he went to his knees holding the last of his shields up with little more than desperation left to sustain him and a final hammerblow blew the storm away and smashed him to the earth vanyel lay stunned in the sudden silence of the square broken and bleeding he was sprawled half on his back and the silence howled in his ears as the storm had the square was deserted now but for the silent scarlet figure of the wizard vanyel was utterly spent and everything hurt so much he could hardly think he coughed and tasted blood and when he tried to breathe he felt stabbing pains in his chest and back he was oddly conscious of little things of a pebble digging into his cheek of his ankle bending the wrong way of a strand of hair tickling his nose of blood running into his eyes of a single flake of snow spiraling down into the magelight his vision began to darken as krebain strode toward him from across the square he seemed to be seeing things through a shadowy mist the wizard stood over him and strangely he felt like laughing gods all that being afraid of that dream for nothing he saw the wizards expression and sobered so this is what it comes to this is how it ends at least he looks a little tired at least i put up some kind of a fight he thought he heard someone something whimper please gods let those people have gotten away dont let this have been for nothing let the others come in time to save them i told you vanyel ashkevron that i would have you with or without a mind krebain said softly but i would rather you were mine wholly and of your own will you see i can be merciful i can be kind to those i love i give you another chance beautiful vanyel surrender to me and i will heal your hurts and give you all that i promised you will you come with me now no not ever not at the cost of my life he looked up at those inhuman chillingly cold eyes and it will be at the cost of my life but gods i cant let it cost more lives than my own he reached as far as he could hoping for a tiny bit of energy left in the powernodes hoping to find another node undrained and touched the valleynode instead gods it isnt possible for a moment he thought he saw a way out not only for the villagers but for himself but when he assessed his own capabilities he saw that to use the raw elemental force of the vale would surely kill him he no longer had the strength to control it the effect would be like what he had done to himself in practice with starwind only a hundred times worse he could die painlessly letting the wizard destroy his mind and soul or he could die in agony saving the people of covia i was willing to die before for lendel why would i be afraid of pain and dying now he thought with a catch in his throat i surely owe a price for not stopping lendel all right gods let this be my expiation give me this last strength to stop him no he breathed never the wizards face twisted with anger and he stepped back to deliver the final blow vanyel closed his eyes and reached in this last moment peace came to him a strange and hearttight inner stillness born of total acceptance that what he was about to do would kill him without moondance near to heal what he would do to himself with a feeling oddly like the lifting of his heart he opened himself to the valleynode and focused and the raw power poured through him and blasted from his eyes he screamed in agony but his own cry was lost in the shriek krebain made as the bolt of power caught him unshielded in the face then vanyel fell into true peace and darkness oh lendel wherever you are im coming please please be there dear withen i think you would be very proud of your son today a faint sound from the ferncanopied bed beside her made savil set down her pen and paper beside her chair unwrap herself from her cloak rise and draw the silky hangings aside vanyel bandaged splinted and bruised and looking very pale against the dark green of moondances bedding moved his head again on the pillow and opened dazed eyes savil swallowed hard he looked so battered so bewildered oh my little love we so nearly lost you this time so close so close i half expect you to ask me to let you stay here sheltered and safe and the gods know youve earned it he blinked as if he didnt quite believe what he sdw aunt savil he said faintly are you real she sat carefully on the edge of the bed and touched his cheek giving him a faint smile that real enough for you he nodded and blinked again the people the villagers gallen and reva are they all right theyre fine kechara she replied her heart filling with pride and love at the question his first thought for others theres no doubt starwind was right there is no doubt of him we got there just in time for moondance to keep you from getting away from us gods its a good thing that bastard wasnt still alive i dont think ive ever seen him so angry in my life and yfandes was whitehot with rage there wasnt much left for us to do basically all i did was make a gate to get us all back to ktreva so moondance could put you back together again then everyones all right he asked insistently as if he didnt quite dare to believe her are they protected now are you and starwind and moondance all right too that wizard he was the one leshara hired he told me so he told me later she soothed tell me all that later were all fine ktreva sent out some of the journeyman tayledras to help get covia back on
