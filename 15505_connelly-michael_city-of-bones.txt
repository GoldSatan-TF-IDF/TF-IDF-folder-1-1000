michael connelly city of bones the eighth book in the harry bosch series chapter the old lady had changed her mind about dying but by then it was too late she had dug her fingers into the paint and plaster of the nearby wall until most of her fingernails had broken off then she had gone for the neck scrabbling to push the bloodied fingertips up and under the cord she broke four toes kicking at the walls she had tried so hard shown such a desperate will to live that it made harry bosch wonder what had happened before where was that determination and will and why had it deserted her until after she had put the extension cord noose around her neck and kicked over the chair why had it hidden from her these were not official questions that would be raised in his death report but they were the things bosch couldnt avoid thinking about as he sat in his car outside the splendid age retirement home on sunset boulevard east of the hollywood freeway it was pm on the first day of the year bosch had drawn holiday callout duty the day more than half over and that duty consisted of two suicide runsone a gunshot the other the hanging both victims were women in both cases there was evidence of depression and desperation isolation new years day was always a big day for suicides while most people greeted the day with a sense of hope and renewal there were those who saw it as a good day to die somelike the old ladynot realizing their mistake until it was too late bosch looked up through the windshield and watched as the latest victims body on a wheeled stretcher and covered in a green blanket was loaded into the coroners blue van he saw there was one other occupied stretcher in the van and knew it was from the first suicidea thirtyfouryearold actress who had shot herself while parked at a hollywood overlook on mulholland drive bosch and the body crew had followed one case to the other boschs cell phone chirped and he welcomed the intrusion into his thoughts on small deaths it was mankiewicz the watch sergeant at the hollywood division of the los angeles police department you finished with that yet im about to clear anything a changedmymind suicide you got something else yeah and i didnt think i should go out on the radio with it must be a slow day for the mediagetting more whatshappening calls from reporters than i am getting service calls from citizens they all want to do something on the first one the actress on mulholland you know a deathofahollywooddream story and theyd probably jump all over this latest call too yeah what is it a citizen up in laurel canyon on wonderland he just called up and said his dog came back from a run in the woods with a bone in its mouth the guy says its humanan arm bone from a kid bosch almost groaned there were four or five call outs like this a year hysteria always followed by simple explanation animal bones through the windshield he saluted the two body movers from the coroners office as they headed to the front doors of the van i know what youre thinking harry not another bone run youve done it a hundred times and its always the same thing coyote deer whatever but listen this guy with the dog hes an md and he says theres no doubt its a humerus thats the upper arm bone he says its a child harry and then get this he said there was silence while mankiewicz apparently looked for his notes bosch watched the coroners blue van pull off into traffic when mankiewicz came back he was obviously reading the bones got a fracture clearly visible just above the medial epicondyle whatever that is boschs jaw tightened he felt a slight tickle of electric current go down the back of his neck thats off my notes i dont know if i am saying it right the point is this doctor says it was just a kid harry so could you humor us and go check out this humerus bosch didnt respond sorry had to get that in yeah that was funny mank whats the address mankiewicz gave it to him and told him he had already dispatched a patrol team you were right to keep it off the air lets try to keep it that way mankiewicz said he would bosch closed his phone and started the car he glanced over at the entrance to the retirement home before pulling away from the curb there was nothing about it that looked splendid to him the woman who had hung herself in the closet of her tiny bedroom had no next of kin according to the operators of the home in death she would be treated the way she had been in life left alone and forgotten bosch pulled away from the curb and headed toward laurel canyon chapter bosch listened to the lakers game on the car radio while he made his way into the canyon and then up lookout mountain to wonderland avenue he wasnt a religious follower of professional basketball but wanted to get a sense of the situation in case he needed his partner jerry edgar bosch was working alone because edgar had lucked into a pair of choice seats to the game bosch had agreed to handle the call outs and to not bother edgar unless a homicide or something bosch couldnt handle alone came up bosch was alone also because the third member of his team kizmin rider had been promoted nearly a year earlier to robberyhomicide division and still had not been replaced it was early third quarter and the game with the trail blazers was tied while bosch wasnt a hardcore fan he knew enough from edgars constant talking about the game and begging to be left free of callout duty that it was an important matchup with one of the los angeles teams top rivals he decided not to page edgar until he had gotten to the scene and assessed the situation he turned the radio off when he started losing the am station in the canyon the drive up was steep laurel canyon was a cut in the santa monica mountains the tributary roads ranged up toward the crest of the mountains wonderland avenue deadended in a remote spot where the halfmilliondollar homes were surrounded by heavily wooded and steep terrain bosch instinctively knew that searching for bones in the area would be a logistical nightmare he pulled to a stop behind a patrol car already at the address mankiewicz had provided and checked his watch it was and he wrote it down on a fresh page of his legal pad he figured he had less than an hour of daylight left a patrol officer he didnt recognize answered his knock her nameplate said brasher she led him back through the house to a home office where her partner a cop whom bosch recognized and knew was named edgewood was talking to a whitehaired man who sat behind a cluttered desk there was a shoe box with the top off on the desk bosch stepped forward and introduced himself the whitehaired man said he was dr paul guyot a general practitioner leaning forward bosch could see that the shoe box contained the bone that had drawn them all together it was dark brown and looked like a gnarled piece of driftwood he could also see a dog lying on the floor next to the doctors desk chair it was a large dog with a yellow coat so this is it bosch said looking back down into the box yes detective thats your bone guyot said and as you can see he reached to a shelf behind the desk and pulled down a heavy copy of grays anatomy he opened it to a previously marked spot bosch noticed he was wearing latex gloves the page showed an illustration of a bone anterior and posterior views in the corner of the page was a small sketch of a skeleton with the humerus bone of both arms highlighted the humerus guyot said tapping the page and then we have the recovered specimen he reached into the shoe box and gently lifted the bone holding it above the books illustration he went through a pointbypoint comparison medial epicondyle trochlea greater and lesser tubercle he said its all there and i was just telling these two officers i know my bones even without the book this bone is human detective theres no doubt bosch looked at guyots face there was a slight quiver perhaps the first showing of the tremors of parkinsons are you retired doctor yes but it doesnt mean i dont know a bone when i see im not challenging you dr guyot bosch tried to smile you say it is human i believe it okay im just trying to get the lay of the land here you can put that back into the box now if you want guyot replaced the bone in the shoe box whats your dogs name calamity bosch looked down at the dog it appeared to be sleeping when she was a pup she was a lot of trouble bosch nodded so if you dont mind telling it again tell me what happened today guyot reached down and ruffled the dogs collar the dog looked up at him for a moment and then put its head back down and closed its eyes i took calamity out for her afternoon walk usually when i get up to the circle i take her off the leash and let her run up into the woods she likes it what kind of dog is she bosch asked yellow lab brasher answered quickly from behind him bosch turned and looked at her she realized she had made a mistake by intruding and nodded and stepped back toward the door of the room where her partner was you guys can clear if you have other calls bosch said i can take it from here edgewood nodded and signaled his partner out thank you doctor he said as he went dont mention it bosch thought of something hey guys edgewood and brasher turned back lets keep this off the air okay you got it said brasher her eyes holding on boschs until he looked away after the officers left bosch looked back at the doctor and noticed that the facial tremor was slightly more pronounced now they didnt believe me at first either he said its just that we get a lot of calls like this but i believe you doctor so why dont you continue with the story guyot nodded well i was up on the circle and i took off the leash she went up into the woods like she likes to do shes well trained when i whistle she comes back trouble is i cant whistle very loud anymore so if she goes where she cant hear me then i have to wait you see what happened today when she found the bone i whistled and she didnt come back so she was pretty far up there yes exactly i waited i whistled a few more times and then finally she came down out of the woods next to mr ulrichs house she had the bone in her mouth at first i thought it was a stick you see and that she wanted to play fetch with it but as she came to me i recognized the shape i took it from herhad a fight over that and then i called you people after i examined it here and was sure you people bosch thought it was always said like that as if the police were another species the blue species which carried armor that the horrors of the world could not pierce when you called you told the sergeant that the bone had a fracture absolutely guyot picked up the bone again handling it gently he turned it and ran his finger along a vertical striation along the bones surface thats a break line detective its a healed fracture okay bosch pointed to the box and the doctor returned the bone doctor do you mind putting your dog on a leash and taking a walk up to the circle with me not at all i just need to change my shoes i need to change too how about if i meet you out front right away im going to take this now bosch put the top back on the shoe box and then carried it with two hands making sure not to turn the box or jostle its contents in any way outside bosch noticed the patrol car was still in front of the house the two officers sat inside it apparently writing out reports he went to his car and placed the shoe box on the front passenger seat since he had been on call out he had not dressed in a suit he had on a sport coat with blue jeans and a white oxford shirt he stripped off his coat folded it inside out and put it on the backseat he noticed that the trigger from the weapon he kept holstered on his hip had worn a hole in the lining and the jacket wasnt even a year old soon it would work its way into the pocket and then all the way through more often than not he wore out his coats from the inside he took his shirt off next revealing a white tshirt beneath he then opened the trunk to get out the pair of work boots from his crime scene equipment box as he leaned against the rear bumper and changed his shoes he saw brasher get out of the patrol car and come back toward him so it looks legit huh think so somebody at the mes office will have to confirm though you going to go up and look im going to try to not much light left though probably be back out here tomorrow by the way im julia brasher im new in the division harry bosch i know ive heard of you i deny everything she smiled at the line and put her hand out but bosch was right in the middle of tying one of the boots he stopped and shook her hand sorry she said my timing is off today dont worry about it he finished tying the boot and stood up off the bumper when i blurted out the answer in there about the dog i immediately realized you were trying to establish a rapport with the doctor that was wrong im sorry bosch studied her for a moment she was midthirties with dark hair in a tight braid that left a short tail going over the back of her collar her eyes were dark brown he guessed she liked the outdoors her skin had an even tan like i said dont worry about it youre alone bosch hesitated my partners working on something else while i check this out he saw the doctor coming out the front door of the house with the dog on a leash he decided not to get out his crime scene jumpsuit and put it on he glanced over at julia brasher who was now watching the approaching dog you guys dont have calls no its slow bosch looked down at the maglite in his equipment box he looked at her and then reached into the trunk and grabbed an oil rag which he threw over the flashlight he took out a roll of yellow crime scene tape and the polaroid camera then closed the trunk and turned to brasher then do you mind if i borrow your mag i uh forgot mine no problem she slid the flashlight out of the ring on her equipment belt and handed it to him the doctor and his dog came up then ready okay doctor i want you to take us up to the spot where you let the dog go and well see where she goes im not sure youll be able to stay with her ill worry about that doctor this way then they walked up the incline toward the small turnaround circle where wonderland reached a dead end brasher made a hand signal to her partner in the car and walked along with them you know we had a little excitement up this way a few years ago guyot said a man was followed home from the hollywood bowl and then killed in a robbery i remember bosch said he knew the investigation was still open but didnt mention it it wasnt his case dr guyot walked with a strong step that belied his age and apparent condition he let the dog set the pace and soon moved several paces ahead of bosch and brasher so where were you before bosch asked brasher what do you mean you said you were new in hollywood division what about before oh the academy he was surprised he looked over at her thinking he might need to reassess his age estimate she nodded and said i know im old bosch got embarrassed no i wasnt saying that i just thought that you had been somewhere else you dont seem like a rookie i didnt go in until i was thirtyfour really wow yeah got the bug a little late what were you doing before oh a bunch of different things travel mostly took me a while to figure out what i wanted to do and you want to know what i want to do the most bosch looked at her what what you do homicide he didnt know what to say whether to encourage her or dissuade her well good luck he said i mean dont you just find it to be the most fulfilling job ever look at what you do you take the most evil people out of the mix the mix society yeah i guess so when we get lucky they caught up to dr guyot who had stopped with the dog at the turnaround circle this the place yes i let her go here she went up through there he pointed to an empty and overgrown lot that started level with the street but then quickly rose into a steep incline toward the crest of the hills there was a large concrete drainage culvert which explained why the lot had never been built on it was city property used to funnel storm water runoff away from the homes on the street many of the streets in the canyon were former creek and river beds when it rained they would return to their original purpose if not for the drainage system are you going up there the doctor asked im going to try ill go with you brasher said bosch looked at her and then turned at the sound of a car it was the patrol car it pulled up and edgewood put down the window we got a hot shot partner double d he nodded toward the empty passenger seat brasher frowned and looked at bosch i hate domestic disputes bosch smiled he hated them too especially when they turned into homicides sorry about that well maybe next time she started around the front of the car here bosch said holding out the maglite ive got an extra in the car she said you can just get that back to me you sure he was tempted to ask for a phone number but didnt im sure good luck you too be careful she smiled at him and then hurried around the front of the car she got in and the car pulled away bosch turned his attention back to guyot and the dog an attractive woman guyot said bosch ignored it wondering if the doctor had made the comment based on seeing boschs reaction to brasher he hoped he hadnt been that obvious okay doctor he said let the dog go and ill try to keep up guyot unhooked the leash while patting the dogs chest go get the bone girl get a bone go the dog took off into the lot and was gone from sight before bosch had taken a step he almost laughed well i guess you were right about that doc he turned to make sure the patrol car was gone and brasher hadnt seen the dog take off you want me to whistle nah ill just go in and take a look around see if i can catch up to her he turned the flashlight on chapter the woods were dark long before the sun disappeared the overhead canopy created by a tall stand of monterey pines blocked out most of the light before it got to the ground bosch used the flashlight and made his way up the hillside in the direction in which he had heard the dog moving through the brush it was slow moving and hard work the ground contained a footthick layer of pine needles that gave way often beneath boschs boots as he tried for purchase on the incline soon his hands were sticky with sap from grabbing branches to keep himself upright it took him nearly ten minutes to go thirty yards up the hillside then the ground started to level off and the light got better as the tall trees thinned bosch looked around for the dog but didnt see her he called down to the street though he could no longer see it or dr guyot dr guyot can you hear me yes i hear you whistle for your dog he then heard a threepart whistle it was distinct but very low having the same trouble getting through the trees and underbrush as the sunlight had bosch tried to repeat it and after a few tries thought he had it right but the dog didnt come bosch pressed on staying on the level ground because he believed that if someone was going to bury or abandon a body then it would be done on even ground as opposed to the steep slope following a path of least resistance he moved into a stand of acacia trees and here he immediately came upon a spot where the earth had recently been disturbed it had been overturned as if a tool or an animal had been randomly rooting in the soil he used his foot to push some of the dirt and twigs aside and then realized they werent twigs he dropped to his knees and used the light to study the short brown bones scattered over a square foot of dirt he believed he was looking at the disjointed fingers of a hand a small hand a childs hand bosch stood up he realized that his interest in julia brasher had distracted him he had brought no means with him for collecting the bones picking them up and carrying them down the hill would violate every tenet of evidence collection the polaroid camera hung on a shoelace around his neck he raised it now and took a closeup shot of the bones he then stepped back and took a wider shot of the spot beneath the acacia trees in the distance he heard dr guyots weak whistle bosch went to work with the yellow plastic crime scene tape he tied a short length of it around the trunk of one of the acacia trees and then strung a boundary around the trees thinking about how he would work the case the following morning he stepped out of the cover of the acacia trees and looked for something to use as an aerial marker he found a nearby growth of sagebrush he wrapped the crime scene tape around and over the top of the bush several times when he was finished it was almost dark he took another cursory look around the area but knew that a flashlight search was useless and the ground would need to be exhaustively covered in the morning using a small penknife attached to his key chain he began cutting fourfoot lengths of the crime scene tape off the roll making his way back down the hill he tied the strips off at intervals on tree branches and bushes he heard voices as he got closer to the street and used them to maintain his direction at one point on the incline the soft ground suddenly gave way and he fell tumbling hard into the base of a pine tree the tree impacted his midsection tearing his shirt and badly scratching his side bosch didnt move for several seconds he thought he might have cracked his ribs on the right side his breathing was difficult and painful he groaned loudly and slowly pulled himself up on the tree trunk so that he could continue to follow the voices he soon came back down into the street where dr guyot was waiting with his dog and another man the two men looked shocked when they saw the blood on boschs shirt oh my what happened guyot cried out nothing i fell your shirt is theres blood comes with the job let me look at your chest the doctor moved in to look but bosch held his hands up im okay who is this the other man answered im victor ulrich i live there he pointed to the house next to the lot bosch nodded i just came out to see what was going on well nothing is going on at the moment but there is a crime scene up there or there will be we probably wont be back to work it until tomorrow morning but i need both you men to keep clear of it and not to tell anybody about this all right both of the neighbors nodded and doctor dont let your dog off the leash for a few days i need to go back down to my car to make a phone call mr ulrich i am sure we will want to talk to you tomorrow will you be around sure anytime i work at home doing what writing okay well see you tomorrow bosch headed back down the street with guyot and the dog you really need me to take a look at your injury guyot insisted itll be fine bosch glanced to his left and thought he saw a curtain quickly close behind a window of the house they were passing the way you are holding yourself when you walkyouve damaged a rib guyot said maybe youve broken it maybe more than one bosch thought of the small thin bones he had just seen beneath the acacia trees theres nothing you can do for a rib broken or not he said i can tape it youll breathe a hell of a lot easier i can also take care of that wound bosch relented okay doc you get out your black bag im going to get my other shirt inside guyots house a few minutes later the doctor cleaned the deep scratch on the side of boschs chest and taped his ribs it did feel better but it still hurt guyot said he could no longer write a prescription but suggested bosch not take anything more powerful than aspirin anyway bosch remembered that he had a prescription bottle with some vicodin tablets left over from when hed had a wisdom tooth removed a few months earlier they would smooth out the pain if he wanted to go that way ill be fine bosch said thanks for fixing me up dont mention it bosch pulled on his good shirt and watched guyot as he closed up his firstaid kit he wondered how long it had been since the doctor had used his skills on a patient how long have you been retired he asked twelve years next month you miss it guyot turned from the firstaid kit and looked at him the tremor was gone every day i dont miss the actual workyou know the cases but it was a job that made a difference i miss that bosch thought about how julia brasher had described homicide work earlier he nodded that he understood what guyot was saying you said there was a crime scene up there the doctor asked yes i found more bones ive got to make a call see what were going to do can i borrow your phone i dont think my cell will work around here no they never do in the canyon use the phone on the desk there and ill give you some privacy he headed out carrying the firstaid kit with him bosch went behind the desk and sat down the dog was on the ground next to the chair the animal looked up and seemed startled when she saw bosch in the masters spot calamity he said i think you lived up to your name today girl bosch reached down and rubbed the scruff of the dogs neck the dog growled and he quickly took his hand away wondering if it was the dogs training or something about himself that had caused the hostile response he picked up the phone and called the home of his supervisor lt grace billets he explained what had happened on wonderland avenue and his findings up on the hill harry how old do these bones look billets asked bosch looked at the polaroid he had taken of the small bones he had found in the dirt it was a bad photo the flash overexposing it because he was too close i dont know they look old to me id say were talking years here okay so whatevers there at the scene isnt fresh maybe freshly uncovered but no its been there thats what im saying so i think we should stick a pin in it and gear up for tomorrow whatever is up there on that hill its not going anywhere tonight yeah bosch said im thinking the same thing she was silent a moment before speaking these kind of cases harry what they drain the budget they drain manpower and theyre the hardest to close if you can close them okay ill climb back up there and cover the bones up ill tell the doctor to keep his dog on a leash come on harry you know what i mean she exhaled loudly first day of the year and were going to start in the hole bosch was silent letting her work through her administrative frustrations it didnt take long it was one of the things he liked about her okay anything else happen today not too much a couple suicides thats it so far okay when are you going to start tomorrow id like to get out there early ill make some calls and see what i can get going and get the bone the dog found confirmed before we start anything okay let me know bosch agreed and hung up the phone he next called teresa corazon the county medical examiner at home though their relationship outside of work had ended years before and she had moved at least two times since she had always kept the same number and bosch knew it by heart it came in handy now he explained what he had going and that he needed an official confirmation of the bone as human before he set other things in motion he also told her that if it was confirmed he would need an archeological team to work the crime scene as soon as possible corazon put him on hold for almost five minutes okay she said when she came back on the line i couldnt get kathy kohl shes not home bosch knew that kohl was the staff archeologist her real expertise and reason for her inclusion as a fulltime employee was retrieving bones from the body dump sites up in the desert of the north county which was a weekly occurrence but bosch knew she would be called in to handle the search for bones off wonderland avenue so what do you want me to do i want to get this confirmed tonight just hold your horses harry you are always so impatient youre like a dog with a bone no pun intended its a kid teresa can we be serious just come here ill look at this bone and what about tomorrow ill get things in motion i left a message for kathy and as soon as we hang up here ill call the office and have her paged shell head up the dig as soon as the sun is up and we can get in there once the bones are recovered there is a forensic anthropologist at ucla we have on retainer and i can bring him in if hes in town and ill be there myself are you satisfied this last part gave bosch pause teresa he finally said i want to try to keep this as low profile as i can for as long as i can and what are you implying that im not sure that the medical examiner for los angeles county needs to be there and that i havent seen you at a crime scene without a cameraman in tow for a long time harry he is a private videographer okay the film he takes is for future use by me and controlled solely by me it doesnt end up on the six oclock news whatever i just think we need to avoid any complications on this one its a child case you know how they get just get over here with that bone im leaving in an hour she abruptly hung up bosch wished he had been a little more politic with corazon but was glad hed made his point corazon was a personality regularly appearing on court tv and network shows as a forensic expert she had also taken to having a cameraman follow her so that her cases could be turned into documentaries for broadcast on any of the cop and legal shows on the vast cable and satellite spectrum he could not and would not let her goals as a celebrity coroner interfere with his goals as an investigator of what might be the homicide of a child he decided hed make the calls to the departments special services and k units after he got confirmation on the bone he got up and left the room looking for guyot the doctor was in the kitchen sitting at a small table and writing in a spiralbound notebook he looked up at bosch just writing a few notes on your treatment ive kept notes on every patient ive ever treated bosch just nodded even though he thought it was odd for guyot to be writing about him im going to go doctor well be back tomorrow in force id expect we might want to use your dog again will you be here ill be here and be glad to help how are the ribs they hurt only when you breathe right thatll last about a week thanks for taking care of me you dont need that shoe box back do you no i wouldnt want that back now bosch turned to head toward the front door but then turned back to guyot doctor do you live alone here i do now my wife died two years ago a month before our fiftieth anniversary im sorry guyot nodded and said my daughter has her own family up in seattle i see them on special occasions bosch felt like asking why only on special occasions but didnt he thanked the man again and left driving out of the canyon and toward teresa corazons place in hancock park he kept his hand on the shoe box so that it would not be jostled or slide off the seat he felt a deep sense of dread rising from within he knew it was because fate had certainly not smiled on him this day he had caught the worst kind of case there was to catch a child case child cases haunted you they hollowed you out and scarred you there was no bulletproof vest thick enough to stop you from being pierced child cases left you knowing the world was full of lost light chapter teresa corazon lived in a mediterraneanstyle mansion with a stone turnaround circle complete with koi pond in front eight years earlier when bosch had shared a brief relationship with her she had lived in a onebedroom condominium the riches of television and celebrity had paid for the house and the lifestyle that came with it she was not even remotely like the woman who used to show up at his house unannounced at midnight with a cheap bottle of red wine from trader joes and a video of her favorite movie to watch the woman who was unabashedly ambitious but not yet skilled at using her position to enrich herself bosch knew he now served as a reminder of what she had been and what she had lost in order to gain all that she had it was no wonder their interactions were now few and far between but as tense as a visit to the dentist when they were unavoidable he parked on the circle and got out with the shoe box and the polaroids he looked into the pond as he came around the car and could see the dark shapes of the fish moving below the surface he smiled thinking about the movie chinatown and how often they had watched it the year they were together he remembered how much she enjoyed the portrayal of the coroner he wore a black butchers apron and ate a sandwich while examining a body bosch doubted she had the same sense of humor about things anymore the light hanging over the heavy wood door to the house went on and corazon opened it before he got there she was wearing black slacks and a creamcolored blouse she was probably on her way to a new years party she looked past him at the slickback he had been driving lets make this quick before that car drips oil on my stones hello to you too teresa thats it she pointed at the shoe box this is it he handed her the polaroids and started taking the lid off the box it was clear she was not asking him in for a glass of new years champagne you want to do this right here i dont have a lot of time i thought youd be here sooner what moron took these that would be me i cant tell anything from these do you have a glove bosch pulled a latex glove out of his coat pocket and handed it to her he took the photos back and put them in an inside pocket of his jacket she expertly snapped the glove on and reached into the open box she held the bone up and turned it in the light he was silent he could smell her perfume it was strong as usual a holdover from her days when she spent most of her time in autopsy suites after a fivesecond examination she put the bone back down in the box human you sure she looked up at him with a glare as she snapped off the glove its the humerus the upper arm id say a child of about ten you may no longer respect my skills harry but i do still have them she dropped the glove into the box on top of the bone bosch could roll with all the verbal sparring from her but it bothered him that she did that with the glove dropping it on the childs bone like that he reached into the box and took the glove out he remembered something and held the glove back out to her the man whose dog found this said there was a fracture on the bone a healed fracture do you want to take a look and see if you no im late for an engagement what you need to know right now is if it is human you now have that confirmation further examination will come later under proper settings at the medical examiners office now i really have to go ill be there tomorrow morning bosch held her eyes for a long moment sure teresa have a good time tonight she broke off the stare and folded her arms across her chest he carefully put the top back on the shoe box nodded to her and headed back to his car he heard the heavy door close behind him thinking of the movie again as he passed the koi pond he spoke the films final line quietly to himself forget it jake its chinatown he got in the car and drove home his hand holding the shoe box secure on the seat next to him chapter by nine oclock the next morning the end of wonderland avenue was a law enforcement encampment and at its center was harry bosch he directed teams from patrol k the scientific investigation division the medical examiners office and the special services unit a department helicopter circled above and a dozen police academy cadets milled about waiting for orders earlier the aerial unit had locked in on the sagebrush bosch had wrapped in yellow crime scene tape and used it as a base point to determine that wonderland offered the closest access to the spot where bosch had found the bones the special services unit then swung into action following the trail of crime scene tape up the hillside the sixman team hammered and strung together a series of wooden ramps and steps with rope guidelines that led up the hillside to the bones accessing and exiting the site would now be much easier than it had been for bosch the evening before it was impossible to keep such a nest of police activity quiet also by am the neighborhood had become a media encampment the media trucks were stacked behind the roadblocks set a half block from the turnaround circle the reporters were gathering into press conferencesized groups and no fewer than five news helicopters were circling at an altitude above the departments chopper it all created a background cacophony that had already resulted in numerous complaints from residents on the street to police administrators at parker center downtown bosch was getting ready to lead the first group up to the crime scene he first conferred with jerry edgar who had been apprised of the case the night before all right were going to take the me and sid up first he said pronouncing the acronyms as emmy and sid then well take the cadets and the dogs up i want you to oversee that part of it no problem you see your pal the mes got her damn cameraman with her nothing we can do about it at the moment lets just hope she gets bored and goes back downtown where she belongs you know for all we know these could be old indian bones or something bosch shook his head i dont think so too shallow bosch walked over to the first group teresa corazon her videographer and her fourperson dig team which consisted of archeologist kathy kohl and three investigators who would do the spadework the dig team members were dressed in white jumpsuits corazon was in an outfit similar to what she was wearing the night before including shoes with twoinch heels also in the group were two criminalists from sid bosch signaled the group into a tighter circle so he could speak privately to them and not be overheard by all the others milling about okay were going to go up and start the documentation and recovery once we have all of you in place well bring up the dogs and the cadets to search the adjacent areas and possibly expand the crime scene you guys he stopped to reach his hand up to corazons cameraman turn that off you can film her but not me the man lowered his camera and bosch gave corazon a look and then continued you all know what you are doing so i dont need to brief you the one thing i do want to say is that it is tough going getting up there even with the ramps and the stairs so be careful hold on to the ropes watch your footing we dont want anybody hurt if you have heavy equipment break it up and make two or three trips if you still need help ill have the cadets bring it up dont worry about time worry about safety all right everybody cool he got simultaneous nods from everybody bosch signaled corazon away from the others and into a private conversation youre not dressed right he said look dont you start telling you want me to take my shirt off so you can see my ribs the side of my chest looks like blueberry pie because i fell up there last night those shoes youve got on arent going to work it might look good for the camera but not im fine ill take my chances anything else bosch shook his head i warned you he said lets go he headed toward the ramp and the others followed special services had constructed a wooden gateway to be used as a checkpoint a patrol officer stood there with a clipboard he took each persons name and affiliation before they were allowed through bosch led the way the climbing was easier than the day before but his chest burned with pain as he pulled himself along on the rope guides and negotiated the ramps and steps he said nothing and tried not to show it when he got to the acacia trees he signaled the others to hold back while he went under the crime scene tape to check first he found the area of overturned earth and the small brown bones he had seen the night before they appeared undisturbed okay come on in here and have a look the group members came under the tape and stood over the bones in a semicircle the camera started rolling and corazon now took charge all right the first thing were going to do is back out and take photos then were going to set up a grid and dr kohl will supervise the excavation and recovery if you find anything photograph it nine ways from sunday before you collect it she turned to one of the investigators finch i want you to handle the sketches standard grid document everything dont assume we will be able to rely on photos finch nodded corazon turned to bosch detective i think weve got it the less people in here the better bosch nodded and handed her a twoway radio ill be around if you need me use the rover cell phones dont work up here but be careful what you say he pointed up at the sky where the media helicopters were circling speaking of which kohl said i think were going to string a tarp up off these trees so we can have some privacy as well as cut down on the sun glare is that okay with you its your crime scene now bosch said run with it he headed back down the ramp with edgar behind him harry this could take days edgar said and maybe then some well theyre not going to give us days you know that right right i mean these cases well be lucky if we even come up with an id right bosch kept moving when he got down to the street he saw that lt billets was on the scene with her supervisor capt levalley jerry why dont you go get the cadets ready bosch said give them the crime scene oneohone speech ill be over in a minute bosch joined billets and levalley and updated them on what was happening detailing the mornings activities right down to the neighborhood complaints about noise from the hammers saws and helicopters weve got to give something to the media levalley said media relations wants to know if you want them to handle it from downtown or you want to take it here i dont want to take it what does media relations know about it almost nothing so you have to call them and theyll work up the press release captain im kind of busy here can i make the time detective keep them off our backs when bosch looked away from the captain to the reporters gathered a half block away at the roadblock he noticed julia brasher showing her badge to a patrol officer and being allowed through she was in street clothes all right ill make the call he started down the street to dr guyots home he was headed toward brasher who smiled at him as she approached ive got your mag its in my car down here i have to go down to dr guyots house anyway oh dont worry about it thats not why im here she changed direction and continued with bosch he looked at her attire faded blue jeans and a tshirt from a k charity run youre not on the clock are you no i work the threetoeleven i just thought you might need a volunteer i heard about the academy call out you want to go up there and look for bones huh i want to learn bosch nodded they walked up the path to guyots door it opened before they got there and the doctor invited them in bosch asked if he could use the phone in his office again and guyot showed him the way even though he didnt have to bosch sat down behind the desk how are the ribs the doctor asked fine brasher raised her eyebrows and bosch picked up on it had a little accident when i was up there last night what happened oh i was just sort of minding my own business when a tree trunk suddenly attacked me for no reason she grimaced and somehow managed to smile at the same time bosch dialed media relations from memory and told an officer about the case in very general terms at one point he put his hand over the phone and asked guyot if he wanted his name put in the press release the doctor declined a few minutes later bosch was finished and hung up he looked at guyot once we clear the scene in a few days the reporters will probably stick around theyll be looking for the dog that found the bone is my guess so if you want to stay out of it keep calamity off the street or theyll put two and two together good advice guyot said and you might want to call your neighbor mr ulrich and tell him not to mention it to any reporters either on the way out of the house bosch asked brasher if she wanted her flashlight and she said she didnt want to bother carrying it while she was helping search the hillside get it to me whenever she said bosch liked the answer it meant he would get at least one more chance to see her back at the circle bosch found edgar lecturing the academy cadets the golden rule of the crime scene people is dont touch anything until it has been studied photographed and charted bosch walked into the circle okay we ready theyre ready edgar said he nodded toward two of the cadets who were holding metal detectors i borrowed those from sid bosch nodded and gave the cadets and brasher the same safety speech he had given the forensic crew they then headed up to the crime scene bosch introducing brasher to edgar and then letting his partner lead the way through the checkpoint he took up the rear walking behind brasher well see if you want to be a homicide detective by the end of the day he said anythings got to be better than chasing the radio and washing puke out of the back of your car at the end of every shift i remember those days bosch and edgar spread the twelve cadets and brasher out in the areas adjacent to the stand of acacia trees and had them begin conducting sidebyside searches bosch then went down and brought up the two k teams to supplement the search once things were under way he left edgar with the cadets and went back to the acacias to see what progress had been made he found kohl sitting on an equipment crate and supervising the placement of wooden stakes into the ground so that strings could be used to set the excavation grid bosch had worked one prior case with kohl and knew she was very thorough and good at what she did she was in her late thirties with a tennis players build and tan bosch had once run across her at a city park where she was playing tennis with a twin sister they had drawn a crowd it looked like somebody hitting the ball off a mirrored wall kohls straight blonde hair fell forward and hid her eyes as she looked down at the oversized clipboard on her lap she was making notations on a piece of paper with a grid already printed on it bosch looked over her shoulder at the chart kohl was labeling the individual blocks with letters of the alphabet as the corresponding stakes were placed in the ground at the top of the page she had written city of bones bosch reached down and tapped the chart where she had written the caption why do you call it that she shrugged her shoulders because were setting out the streets and the blocks of what will become a city to us she said running her fingers over some of the lines on the chart in illustration at least while were working here it will feel like it our little city bosch nodded in every murder is the tale of a city he said kohl looked up at him who said that i dont know somebody did he turned his attention to corazon who was squatting over the small bones on the surface of the soil studying them while the lens of the video camera studied her he was thinking of something to say about it when his rover was keyed and he took it off his belt bosch here edgar better come on back over here harry we already have something right edgar was standing in an almost level spot in the brush about forty yards from the acacia trees a half dozen of the cadets and brasher had formed a circle and were looking down at something in the twofoothigh brush the police chopper was circling in a tighter circle above bosch got to the circle and looked down it was a childs skull partially submerged in the soil its hollow eyes staring up at him nobody touched it edgar said brasher here found it bosch glanced at her and the humor she seemed to carry in her eyes and mouth were gone he looked back at the skull and pulled the radio off his belt dr corazon he said into it it was a long moment before her voice came back yes im here what is it we are going to have to widen the crime scene chapter with bosch acting as the general overseeing the small army that worked the expanded crime scene the day progressed well the bones came out of the ground and the hillside brush easily as if they had been impatiently waiting a very long time by noon three blocks in the grid were being actively excavated by kathy kohls team and dozens of bones emerged from the dark soil like their archeological counterparts who unearthed the artifacts of the ancients the dig team used small tools and brushes to bring these bones gently to light they also used metal detectors and vapor probes the process was painstaking yet it was moving at an even faster pace than bosch had hoped for the finding of the skull had set this pace and brought a sense of urgency to the entire operation it was removed from its location first and the field examination conducted on camera by teresa corazon found fracture lines and surgical scarring the record of surgery assured them they were dealing with relatively contemporary bones the fractures in and of themselves were not definitive in the indication of homicide but when added to the evidence that the body had been buried they gave a clear sense that the tale of a murder was unfolding by two oclock when the hillside crews broke for lunch almost half of the skeleton had already been recovered from the grid a small scattering of other bones had been found in the nearby brush by the cadets additionally kohls crew had unearthed fragments of deteriorated clothing and a canvas backpack of a size most likely used by a child the bones came down the hillside in square wooden boxes with rope handles attached on the sides by lunch a forensic anthropologist was examining three boxes of bones in the medical examiners office the clothing most of it rotten and unrecognizable and the backpack which had been left unopened were transported to lapds scientific investigation division lab for the same scrutiny a metal detector scan of the search grid produced a single coina quarter minted in found at the same depth as the bones and approximately two inches from the left wing of the pelvis it was assumed that the quarter had been in the left front pocket of pants that had rotted away along with the bodys tissue to bosch the coin gave one of the key parameters of time of death if the assumption that the coin had been buried with the body was correct the death could not have happened before patrol had arranged for two construction site lunch wagons to come to the circle to feed the small army working the crime scene lunch was late and people were hungry one truck served hot lunches while the other served sandwiches bosch waited at the end of the line for the sandwich truck with julia brasher the line was moving slowly but he didnt mind they mostly talked about the investigation on the hillside and gossiped about department brass it was gettoknowyou conversation bosch was attracted to her and the more he heard her talk about her experiences as a rookie and a female in the department the more he was intrigued by her she had a mixture of excitement and awe and cynicism about the job that bosch remembered clearly from his own early days on the job when he was about six people from the order window of the lunch truck bosch heard someone in the truck asking one of the cadets questions about the investigation are they bones from a bunch of different people i dont know man we just look for them thats all bosch studied the man who had asked the question were they all cut up hard to tell bosch broke from his spot with brasher and walked to the back of the truck he looked through the open door at the back and saw three men wearing aprons working in the truck or appearing to work they did not notice bosch watching two of the men were making sandwiches and filling orders the man in the middle the one who had asked the cadet questions was moving his arms on the prep counter below the order window he wasnt making anything but from outside the truck it would appear he was creating a sandwich as bosch watched he saw the man to the right slice a sandwich in half put it on a paper plate and slide it to the man in the middle the middle man then held it out through the window to the cadet who ordered it bosch noticed that while the two real sandwich makers wore jeans and tshirts beneath their aprons the man in the middle had on cuffed slacks and a shirt with a buttondown collar protruding from the back pocket of his pants was a notebook the long thin kind that bosch knew reporters used bosch stuck his head in the door and looked around on a shelf next to the doorway he saw a sport jacket rolled into a ball he grabbed it and stepped back away from the door he went through the pockets of the jacket and found an lapdissued press pass on a neck chain it had a picture of the middle sandwich maker on it his name was victor frizbe and he worked at the new times holding the jacket to the side of the door bosch rapped on the outside of the truck and when all three men turned to look he signaled frizbe over the reporter pointed to his chest with a who me look and bosch nodded frizbe came to the door and bent down yes bosch reached up and grabbed him by the top bib on the apron and jerked him out of the truck frizbe landed on his feet but had to run several steps to stop from falling as he turned around to protest bosch hit him in the chest with the balledup jacket two patrol officersthey always ate firstwere dumping paper plates into a nearby trash can bosch signaled them over take him back to the perimeter if you see him crossing it again arrest him each officer took frizbe by an arm and started marching him down the street to the barricades frizbe started protesting his face growing as red as a coke can but the patrol officers ignored everything about him but his arms and marched him toward his humiliation in front of the other reporters bosch watched for a moment and then took the press card out of his back pocket and dropped it in the trash can he rejoined brasher in line now they were just two cadets away from being served what was that all about brasher asked healthcode violation didnt wash his hands she started laughing im serious the laws the law as far as im concerned god i hope i get my sandwich before you see a roach or something and close the whole thing down dont worry i think i just got rid of the roach ten minutes later after bosch lectured the truck owner about smuggling the media into the crime scene they took their sandwiches and drinks to one of the picnic tables special services had set up on the circle it was a table that had been reserved for the investigative team but bosch didnt mind allowing brasher to sit there edgar was there along with kohl and one of the diggers from her crew bosch introduced brasher to those who didnt know her and mentioned she had taken the initial call on the case and helped him the night before so wheres the boss bosch asked kohl oh she already ate i think she went off to tape an interview with herself or something bosch smiled and nodded i think im going to get seconds edgar said as he climbed over the bench and left with his plate bosch bit into his blt and savored its taste he was starved he wasnt planning to do anything but eat and rest during the break but kohl asked if it was all right if she gave him some of her initial conclusions on the excavation bosch had his mouth full after he swallowed he asked her to wait until his partner came back they talked in generalities about the condition of the bones and how kohl believed that the shallow nature of the grave had allowed animals to disinter the remains and scatter the bonespossibly for years were not going to get them all she said we wont come close were going to quickly reach a point where the expense and the effort wont be worth the return edgar returned with another plate of fried chicken bosch nodded to kohl who looked down at a notepad she had on the table to her left she checked some of her notations and started talking the things i want you to be mindful of are the grave depth and location terrain i think these are key things theyre going to have to play somehow into who this child was and what happened to him him bosch asked the hip spacing and the waistband of the underwear she explained that included in the rotten and decomposed clothing was the rubber waistband which was all that was left of the underwear that had been on the body when it was buried decomposition fluids from the body had led to the deterioration of the clothing but the rubber waistband was largely intact and appeared to have come from a style of underwear made for males okay bosch said you were saying about grave depth yes well we think that the hip assembly and lower spinal column were in undisturbed position when we uncovered them going on that were talking about a grave that wasnt more than six inches to a foot deep a grave this shallow reflects speed panic a host of things indicative of poor planning but she held up a finger by the same token the locationvery remote very difficultreflects the opposite it shows careful planning so you have some kind of contradiction going on here the location appears to have been chosen because it was damn hard to get to yet the burial appears to have been fast and furious this person was literally just covered with loose topsoil and pine needles i know pointing all of this out isnt necessarily going to help you catch the bad guy but i want you to see what im seeing here this contradiction bosch nodded its all good to know well keep it in mind okay good the other contradictionthe smaller oneis the backpack burying it with the body was a mistake the body decomposes at a much faster rate than the canvas so if you get identifiers off the bag or its contents it becomes a mistake made by the bad guy again poor planning in the midst of good planning youre smart detectives im sure youll figure all this out she smiled at bosch and then studied her pad again lifting the top page to look beneath it i think thats it everything else we talked about up at the site i think things are going very well up there by the end of the day well have the main grave done tomorrow well do some sampling in the other grids but this should probably wrap by tomorrow like i said were not going to get everything but we should get enough to do what we need to do bosch suddenly thought of victor frizbes question to the cadet at the lunch wagon and realized that the reporter might have been thinking ahead of bosch sampling you think theres more than one body buried up there kohl shook her head i have no indication of that at all but we should make sure well do some sampling sink some gas probes its routine the likelihoodespecially in light of the shallow graveis that this is a singular case but we should be sure about it as sure as we can be bosch nodded he was glad he had eaten most of his sandwich because he was suddenly not hungry the prospect of mounting an investigation with multiple victims was daunting he looked at the others at the table that doesnt leave this table i already caught one reporter sniffing around for a serial killer we dont want media hysteria here even if you tell them what were doing is routine and just to make sure it will be the top of the story all right everyone nodded including brasher bosch was about to say something when there was a loud banging from the row of portable toilets on the special services trailer on the other side of the circle someone was inside one of the phone boothsized bathrooms pounding on its thin aluminum skin after a moment bosch could hear a womans voice behind the sharp banging he recognized it and jumped up from the table bosch ran across the circle and up the steps to the trucks platform he quickly determined which toilet the banging was coming from and went to the door the exterior haspused for securing the toilet for transporthad been closed over the loop and a chicken bone had been used to secure it hold on hold on bosch yelled he tried to pull the bone out but it was too greasy and slipped from his grip the pounding and screaming continued bosch looked around for a tool of some kind but didnt see anything finally he took his pistol out of his holster checked the safety and used the butt of the weapon to hammer the bone through the hasp careful all the time to aim the barrel of the gun at a downward angle when the bone finally popped out he put the gun away and flipped the hasp open the door burst outward and teresa corazon charged out almost knocking him over he grabbed her to maintain his balance but she roughly pushed him away you did that what no i didnt i was over there the whole i want to know who did it bosch lowered his voice he knew everyone in the encampment was probably looking at them the media down the street as well look teresa calm down it was a joke okay whoever did it did it as a joke i know you dont like confined spaces but they didnt know that somebody just wanted to ease the tension around here a little bit and you just happened to be its because theyre jealous thats why what of who i am what ive done bosch was nonplussed by that whatever she headed for the stairs then abruptly turned around and came back to him im leaving you happy now bosch shook his head happy that has nothing to do with anything here im trying to conduct an investigation and if you want to know the truth not having the distraction of you and your cameraman around might be a help then youve got it and you know that phone number you called me on the other night bosch nodded yeah what about burn it she walked down the steps angrily hooked a finger at her cameraman and headed toward her official car bosch watched her go when he got back to the picnic table only brasher and edgar remained his partner had reduced his second order of fried chicken to bones he sat with a satisfied smirk on his face bosch dropped the bone he had knocked out of the hasp onto edgars plate that went over real well he said he gave edgar a look that told him he knew he had been the one who did it but edgar revealed nothing the bigger the ego the harder they fall edgar said i wonder if her cameraman got any of that action on tape you know it would have been good to keep her as an ally bosch said to just put up with her so that she was on our side when we needed her edgar picked up his plate and struggled to slide his large body out of the picnic table ill see you up on the hill he said bosch looked at brasher she raised her eyebrows you mean he was the one who did it bosch didnt answer chapter the work in the city of bones lasted only two days as kohl had predicted the majority of the pieces of the skeleton had been located and removed from the spot beneath the acacia trees by the end of the first day other bones had been found nearby in the brush in a scatter pattern indicative of disinterment over time by foraging animals on friday the searchers and diggers returned but a daylong search of the hillside by fresh cadets and further excavation of the main squares of the grid found no more bones vapor probes and sample digs in all the remaining squares of the grid turned up no bones or other indications that other bodies had been buried beneath the acacia trees kohl estimated that sixty percent of the skeleton had been collected on her recommendation and with teresa corazons approval the excavation and search were suspended pending further developments at dusk on friday bosch had not objected to this he knew they were facing limited returns for a large amount of effort and he deferred to the experts he was also anxious to proceed with the investigation and identification of the boneselements which were largely stalled as he and edgar had worked exclusively on wonderland avenue during the two days supervising the collection of evidence canvassing the neighborhood and putting together the initial reports on the case it was all necessary work but bosch wanted to move on on saturday morning he and edgar met in the lobby of the medical examiners office and told the receptionist they had an appointment with dr william golliher the forensic anthropologist on retainer from ucla hes waiting for you in suite a the receptionist said after making a call to confirm you know which way that is bosch nodded and they were buzzed through the gate they took an elevator down to the basement level and were immediately greeted by the smell of the autopsy floor when they stepped out it was a mixture of chemicals and decay that was unique in the world edgar immediately took a paper breathing mask out of a wall dispenser and put it on bosch didnt bother you really ought to harry edgar said as they walked down the hall do you know that all smells are particulate bosch looked at him thanks for that jerry they had to stop in the hallway as a gurney was pushed out of an autopsy suite there was a body on it wrapped in plastic harry you ever notice that they wrap em up the same way they do the burritos at taco bell bosch nodded at the man pushing the gurney thats why i dont eat burritos really bosch moved on down the hall without answering suite a was an autopsy room reserved for teresa corazon for the infrequent times she actually left her administrative duties as chief medical examiner and performed an autopsy because the case had initially garnered her handson attention she had apparently authorized golliher to use her suite corazon had not returned to the crime scene on wonderland avenue after the portable toilet incident they pushed through the double doors of the suite and were met by a man in blue jeans and a hawaiian shirt please call me bill golliher said i guess its been a long two days say that again edgar said golliher nodded in a friendly manner he was about fifty with dark hair and eyes and an easy manner he gestured toward the autopsy table that was in the center of the room the bones that had been collected from beneath the acacia trees were now spread across the stainless steel surface well let me tell you whats been going on in here golliher said as the team in the field has been collecting the evidence ive been here examining the pieces doing the radiograph work and generally trying to put the puzzle of all of this together bosch stepped over to the stainless steel table the bones were laid out in place so as to form a partial skeleton the most obvious pieces missing were the bones of the left arm and leg and the lower jaw it was presumed that these were the pieces that had long ago been taken and scattered distantly by animals that had rooted in the shallow grave each of the bones was marked the larger pieces with stickers and the smaller ones with string tags bosch knew that notations on these markers were codes by which the location of each bone had been charted on the grid kohl had drawn on the first day of the excavation bones can tell us much about how a person lived and died golliher said somberly in cases of child abuse the bones do not lie the bones become our final evidence bosch looked back at him and realized his eyes were not dark they actually were blue but they were deeply set and seemed haunted in some way he was staring past bosch at the bones on the table after a moment he broke from this reverie and looked at bosch let me start by saying that we are learning quite a bit from the recovered artifacts the anthropologist said but i have to tell you guys ive consulted on a lot of cases but this one blows me away i was looking at these bones and taking notes and i looked down and my notebook was smeared i was crying man i was crying and i didnt even know it at first he looked back at the outstretched bones with a look of tenderness and pity bosch knew that the anthropologist saw the person who was once there this one is bad guys real bad then give us what youve got so we can go out there and do our job bosch said in a voice that sounded like a reverent whisper golliher nodded and reached back to a nearby counter for a spiral notebook okay golliher said lets start with the basics some of this you may already know but im just going to go over all of my findings if you dont mind we dont mind bosch said good then here it is what you have here are the remains of a young male caucasoid comparisons to the indices of maresh growth standards put the age at approximately ten years old however as we will soon discuss this child was the victim of severe and prolonged physical abuse histologically victims of chronic abuse often suffer from what is called growth disruption this abuserelated stunting serves to skew age estimation what you often get is a skeleton that looks younger than it is so what i am saying is that this boy looks ten but is probably twelve or thirteen bosch looked over at edgar he was standing with his arms folded tightly across his chest as if bracing for what he knew was ahead bosch took a notebook out of his jacket pocket and started writing notes in shorthand time of death golliher said this is tough radiological testing is far from exact in this regard we have the coin which gives us the early marker of nineteen seventyfive that helps us what i am estimating is that this kid has been in the ground anywhere from twenty to twentyfive years im comfortable with that and there is some surgical evidence we can talk about in a few minutes that adds support to that estimation so weve got a ten to thirteenyearold kid killed twenty to twentyfive years ago edgar summarized a note of frustration in his voice i know i am giving you a wide set of parameters detective golliher said but at the moment its the best the science can do for you not your fault doc bosch wrote it all down despite the wide spread of the estimation it was still vitally important to set a time frame for the investigation gollihers estimation put the time of death into the late seventies to early eighties bosch momentarily thought of laurel canyon in that time frame it had been a rustic funky enclave part bohemian and part upscale with cocaine dealers and users porno purveyors and burned out rockandroll hedonists on almost every street could the murder of a child have been part of that mix cause of death golliher said tell you what lets get to cause of death last i want to start with the extremities and the torso give you guys an idea of what this boy endured in his short lifetime his eyes locked on boschs for a moment before returning to the bones bosch breathed in deeply producing a sharp pain from his damaged ribs he knew his fear from the moment he had looked down at the small bones on the hillside was now going to be realized he instinctively knew all along that it would come to this that a story of horror would emerge from the overturned soil he started scribbling on the pad running the ballpoint deep into the paper as golliher continued first of all we only have maybe sixty percent of the bones here he said but even still we have incontrovertible evidence of tremendous skeletal trauma and chronic abuse i dont know what your level of anthropological expertise is but im going to assume much of this will be new to you im going to give you the basics bones heal themselves gentlemen and it is through the study of bone regeneration that we can establish a history of abuse on these bones there are multiple lesions in different stages of healing there are fractures old and new we only have two of the four extremities but both of these show multiple instances of trauma in short this boy spent pretty much most of his life either healing or being hurt bosch looked down at the pad and pen clutched tightly in his hands his hands were turning white you will be getting a written report from me by monday but for now if you want a number i will tell you that i found fortyfour distinct locations indicating separate trauma in various stages of healing and these were just his bones detectives it doesnt cover the damage that could have been inflicted on vital organs and the tissue but it is without a doubt that this boy lived probably day in and day out with a lot of pain bosch wrote the number down on the pad it seemed like a meaningless gesture primarily the injuries i have catalogued can be noted on the artifacts by subperiosteal lesions golliher said these lesions are thin layers of new bone that grow beneath the surface in the area of trauma or bleeding subperihow do you spell that bosch asked what does it matter it will be in the report bosch nodded take a look at this golliher said golliher went to the xray box on the wall and flipped on the light there was already film on the box it showed an xray of a long thin bone he ran his finger along the stem of the bone pointing out a slight demarcation of color this is the one femur that was collected he said the upper thigh this line here where the color changes is one of the lesions this means that this areathe boys upper leghad suffered a pretty strong blow in the weeks before his death a crushing blow it did not break the bone but it damaged it this kind of injury would no doubt have caused surface bruising and i think affected the boys walk what i am telling you is that it could not have gone unnoticed bosch moved forward to study the xray edgar stayed back when he was finished golliher removed the xray and put up three more covering the entire light box we also have periosteal shearing on both of the limbs present this is the stripping of the bones surface primarily seen in child abuse cases when the limb is struck violently by the adult hand or other instrument recovery patterns on these bones show that this particular type of trauma occurred repeatedly and over years to this child golliher paused to look at his notes then he glanced at the bones on the table he picked up the upper arm bone and held it up while he referred to his notes and spoke bosch noticed he wore no gloves the humerus golliher said the right humerus shows two separate and healed fractures the breaks are longitudinal this tells us the fractures are the result of the twisting of the arm with great force it happened to him once and then it happened again he put the bone down and picked up one of the lower arm bones the ulna shows a healed latitudinal fracture the break caused a slight deviation in the attitude of the bone this was because the bone was allowed to heal in place after the injury you mean it wasnt set edgar asked he wasnt taken to a doctor or an emergency room exactly this kind of injury though commonly accidental and treated every day in every emergency room can also be a defensive injury you hold your arm up to ward off an attack and take the blow across the forearm the fracture occurs because of the lack of indication of medical attention paid to this injury my supposition is that this was not an accidental injury and was part of the abuse pattern golliher gently returned the bone to its spot and then leaned over the examination table to look down at the rib cage many of the rib bones had been detached and were lying separated on the table the ribs golliher said nearly two dozen fractures in various stages of healing a healed fracture on rib twelve i believe may date to when the boy was only two or three rib nine shows a callus indicative of trauma only a few weeks old at the time of death the fractures are primarily consolidated near the angles in infants this is indicative of violent shaking in older children this is usually indicative of blows to the back bosch thought of the pain he was in of how he had been unable to sleep well because of the injury to his ribs he thought of a young boy living with that kind of pain year in and year out i gotta go wash my face he suddenly said you can continue he walked to the door shoving his notebook and pen into edgars hands in the hallway he turned right he knew the layout of the autopsy floor and knew there were rest rooms around the next turn of the corridor he entered the rest room and went right to an open stall he felt nauseous and waited but nothing happened after a long moment it passed bosch came out of the stall just as the door opened from the hallway and teresa corazons cameraman walked in they looked warily at each other for a moment get out of here bosch said come back later the man silently turned and walked out bosch walked to the sink and looked at himself in the mirror his face was red he bent down and used his hands to cup cold water against his face and eyes he thought about baptisms and second chances of renewal he raised his face until he was looking at himself again im going to get this guy he almost said it out loud when bosch returned to suite a all eyes were on him edgar gave him his notebook and pen back and golliher asked if he was all right yeah fine he said if it is any help to you golliher said i have consulted on cases all over the world chile kosovo even the world trade center and this case he shook his head its hard to comprehend he added its one of those where you have to think that maybe the boy was better off leaving this world that is if you believe in a god and a better place than this bosch walked over to a counter and pulled a paper towel out of a dispenser he started wiping his face again and what if you dont golliher walked over to him well you see this is why you must believe he said if this boy did not go from this world to a higher plane to something better then then i think were all lost did that work for you when you were picking through the bones at the world trade center bosch immediately regretted saying something so harsh but golliher seemed unfazed he spoke before bosch could apologize yes it did he said my faith was not shaken by the horror or the unfairness of so much death in many ways it became stronger it brought me through it bosch nodded and threw the towel into a trash can with a footpedal device for opening it it closed with an echoing slam when he took his foot off the pedal what about cause of death he said getting back to the case we can jump ahead detective golliher said all injuries discussed and not discussed here will be outlined in my report he went back to the table and picked up the skull he brought it over to bosch holding it in one hand close to his chest in the skull we have the badand possibly the good golliher said the skull exhibits three distinct cranial fractures showing mixed stages of healing here is the first he pointed to an area at the lower rear of the skull this fracture is small and healed you can see here that the lesions are completely consolidated then next we have this more traumatic injury on the right parietal extending to the frontal this injury required surgery most likely for a subdural hematoma he outlined the injury area with a finger circling the forward top of the skull he then pointed to five small and smooth holes which were linked by a circular pattern on the skull this is a trephine pattern a trephine is a medical saw used to open the skull for surgery or to relieve pressure from brain swelling in this case it was probably swelling due to the hematoma now the fracture itself and the surgical scar show the beginning of bridging across the lesions new bone i would say this injury and subsequent surgery occurred approximately six months prior to the boys death its not the injury causing death bosch asked no this is golliher turned the skull one more time and showed them another fracture this one in the lower left rear of the skull tight spider web fracture with no bridging no consolidation this injury occurred at the time of death the tightness of the fracture indicates a blow with tremendous force from a very hard object a baseball bat perhaps something like that bosch nodded and stared down at the skull golliher had turned it so that its hollow eyes were focused on bosch there are other injuries to the head but not of a fatal nature the nose bones and the zygomatic process show new bone formation following trauma golliher returned to the autopsy table and gently placed the skull down i dont think i need to summarize for you detectives but in short somebody beat the shit out of this boy on a regular basis eventually they went too far it will all be in the report to you he turned from the autopsy table and looked at them there is a glimmer of light in all of this you know something that might help you the surgery bosch said exactly opening a skull is a very serious operation there will be records somewhere there had to be followup the roundel is held back in place with metal clips after surgery there were none found with the skull i would assume they were removed in a second procedure again there will be records the surgical scar also helps us date the bones the trephine holes are too large by todays standards by the mideighties the tools were more advanced than this sleeker the perforations were smaller i hope this all helps you bosch nodded and said what about the teeth anything there we are missing the lower mandible golliher said on the upper teeth present there is no indication of any dental work despite indication of antemortem decay this in itself is a clue i think it puts this boy in the lower levels of social classification he didnt go to the dentist edgar had pulled his mask down around his neck his expression was pained when this kid was in the hospital with the hematoma why wouldnt he tell the doctors what was happening to him what about his teachers his friends you know the answers to that as well as me detective golliher said children are reliant on their parents they are scared of them and they love them dont want to lose them sometimes there is no explanation for why they dont cry out for help what about all these fractures and such why didnt the doctors see it and do something thats the irony of what i do i see the history and tragedy so clearly but with a living patient it might not be apparent if the parents came in with a plausible explanation for the boys injury what reason would a doctor have to xray an arm or a leg or a chest none and so the nightmare goes unnoticed unsatisfied edgar shook his head and walked to the far corner of the room anything else doctor bosch asked golliher checked his notes and then folded his arms thats it on a scientific levelyoull get the report on a purely personal level i hope you find the person who did this they will deserve whatever they get and then some bosch nodded well get him edgar said dont you worry about that they walked out of the building and got into boschs car bosch just sat there for a moment before starting the engine finally he hit the steering wheel hard with the heel of his palm sending a shock down the injured side of his chest you know it doesnt make me believe in god like him edgar said makes me believe in aliens little green men from outer space bosch looked over at him edgar was leaning his head against the side window looking down at the floor of the car how so because a human couldnt have done this to his own kid a spaceship mustve come down and abducted the kid and done all that stuff to him only explanation yeah i wish that was on the checklist jerry then we could all just go home bosch put the car into drive i need a drink he started driving out of the lot not me man edgar said i just want to go see my kid and hug him until this gets better they didnt speak again until they got over to parker center chapter bosch and edgar rode the elevator to the fifth floor and went into the sid lab where they had a meeting set up with antoine jesper the lead criminalist assigned to the bones case jesper met them at the security fence and took them back he was a young black man with gray eyes and smooth skin he wore a white lab coat that swayed and flapped with his long strides and always moving arms this way guys he said i dont have a lot but what i got is yours he took them through the main lab where only a handful of other criminalists were working and into the drying room a large climatecontrolled space where clothing and other material evidence from cases were spread on stainless steel drying tables and examined it was the only place that could rival the autopsy floor of the medical examiners office in the stench of decay jesper led them to two tables where bosch saw the open backpack and several pieces of clothing blackened with soil and fungus there was also a plastic sandwich bag filled with an unrecognizable lump of black decay water and mud got into the backpack jesper said leached in over time i guess jesper took a pen out of the pocket of his lab coat and extended it into a pointer he used it to help illustrate his commentary weve got your basic backpack containing three sets of clothes and what was probably a sandwich or some kind of food item more specifically three tshirts three underwear three sets of socks and the food item there was also an envelope or what was left of an envelope you dont see that here because documents has it but dont get your hopes up guys it was in worse shape than that sandwichif it was a sandwich bosch nodded he made a list of the contents in his notebook any identifiers he asked jesper shook his head no personal identifiers on the clothing or in the bag he said but two things to note first this shirt here has a brandname identifier solid surf says it across the chest you cant see it now but i picked it up with the black light might help might not if you are not familiar with the term solid surf i can tell you that it is a skateboarding reference got it bosch said next is the outside flap of the bag he used his pointer to flip over the flap cleaned this up a little bit and came up with this bosch leaned over the table to look the bag was made of blue canvas on the flap was a clear demarcation of color forming a large letter b at the center it looks like there was some kind of adhesive applicate at one time on the bag jesper said its gone now and i dont really know if that occurred before or after this thing was put in the ground my guess is before it looks like it was peeled off bosch stepped back from the table and wrote a few lines in his notebook he then looked at jesper okay antoine good stuff anything else not on this stuff then lets go to documents jesper led the way again through the central lab and then into a sublab where he had to enter a combination into a door lock to enter the documents lab contained two rows of desks that were all empty each desk had a horizontal light box and a magnifying glass mounted on a pivot jesper went to the middle desk in the second row the nameplate on the desk said bernadette fornier bosch knew her they had worked a case previously in which a suicide note had been forged he knew she did good work jesper picked up a plastic evidence pouch that was sitting in the middle of the desk he unzipped it and removed two plastic viewing sleeves one contained an unfolded envelope that was brown and smeared with black fungus the other contained a deteriorated rectangular piece of paper that was broken into three parts along the folds and was also grossly discolored by decay and fungus this is what happens when stuff gets wet man jesper said it took bernie all day just to unfold the envelope and separate the letter as you can see it came apart at the folds and as far as whether well ever be able to tell what was in the letter it doesnt look good bosch turned on the light box and put the plastic sleeves down on it he swung the magnifier over and studied the envelope and the letter it had once contained there was nothing remotely readable on either document one thing he noted was that it looked like there was no stamp on the envelope damn he said he flipped the sleeves over and kept looking edgar came over next to him as if to confirm the obvious woulda been nice he said what will she do now bosch asked jesper well shell probably try some dyes some different lights try to get something that reacts with the ink brings it up but she wasnt too optimistic yesterday so like i said i wouldnt be getting my hopes up about it bosch nodded and turned off the light chapter near the back entrance to the hollywood division station was a bench with large sandfilled ashtrays on either side it was called the code after the radio call for outofservice or on break at pm on saturday night bosch was the only occupant on the code bench he wasnt smoking though he wished he was he was waiting the bench was dimly lit by the lights over the stations back door and had a view of the parking lot jointly shared by the station and the firehouse on the back end of the city complex bosch watched as the patrol units came in from the threetoeleven shift and the officers went into the station to change out of uniforms shower and call it a night if they could he looked down at the maglite he held in his hands and rubbed his thumb over the end cap and felt the scratchings where julia brasher had etched her badge number he hefted the light and then flipped it in his hand feeling its weight he flashed on what golliher had said about the weapon that had killed the boy he could add flashlight to the list bosch watched a patrol car come into the lot and park by the motor pool garage a cop he recognized as julia brashers partner edgewood emerged from the passenger side and headed into the station carrying the cars shotgun bosch waited and watched suddenly unsure of his plan and wondering if he could abandon it and get into the station without being seen before he decided on a move brasher got out of the drivers side and headed toward the station door she walked with her head down the posture of someone tired and beat from a long day bosch knew the feeling he also thought something might be wrong it was a subtle thing but the way edgewood had gone in and left her behind told bosch something was off since brasher was a rookie edgewood was her training officer even though he was at least five years younger than her maybe it was just an awkward situation because of age and gender or maybe it was something else brasher didnt notice bosch on the bench she was almost to the station door before he spoke hey you forgot to wash the puke out of the back seat she looked back while continuing to walk until she saw it was him she stopped then and walked over to the bench i brought you something bosch said he held out the flashlight she smiled tiredly as she took it thank you harry you didnt have to wait here to i wanted to there was an awkward silence for a moment were you working the case tonight she asked more or less started the paperwork and we sort of got the autopsy earlier today if you could call it an autopsy i can tell by your face it was bad bosch nodded he felt strange he was still sitting and she was still standing i can tell by the way you look that you had a tough one too arent they all before bosch could say anything two cops fresh from showers and in street clothes came out of the station and headed toward their personal cars cheer up julia one of them said well see you over there okay kiko she said back she turned and looked back down at bosch she smiled some people from the shift are getting together over at boardners she said you want to come um thats okay i just thought maybe you could use a drink or something i could i need one actually thats why i was waiting here for you i just dont know if i want to get into a group thing at a bar well what were you thinking then bosch checked his watch it was now eleventhirty depending on how long you take in the locker room we could probably catch the last martini call at mussos she smiled broadly now i love that place give me fifteen minutes she headed toward the station door without waiting for a reply from him ill be here he called after her chapter musso and franks was an institution that had been serving martinis to the denizens of hollywoodboth famous and infamousfor a century the front room was all red leather booths and quiet conversation with ancient waiters in red halfcoats moving slowly about the back room contained the long bar where most nights it was standing room only while patrons vied for the attention of bartenders who could have been the fathers of the waiters as bosch and brasher came into the bar two patrons slipped off their stools to leave bosch and brasher quickly moved in beating two blackclad studio types to the choice spots a bartender who recognized bosch came over and they both ordered vodka martinis slightly dirty bosch was already feeling at ease with her they had spent lunch together at the crime scene picnic tables the last two days and she had never been far from his sight during the hillside searches they had ridden over to mussos together in his car and it seemed like a third or fourth date already they smalltalked about the division and the details bosch was willing to part with about his case by the time the bartender put down their martini glasses along with the sidecar carafes he was ready to forget about bones and blood and baseball bats for a while they clinked glasses and brasher said to life yeah bosch said getting through another day just barely bosch knew that now was the time to talk to her about what was troubling her if she didnt want to talk he wouldnt press it that guy you called kiko in the back lot whyd he tell you to cheer up she slumped a little and didnt answer at first if you dont want to talk about no its not that its more like i dont want to think about it i know the feeling forget i asked no its okay my partners going to write me up and since im on probation it could cost me write you up for what crossing the tube it was a tactical expression meaning to walk in front of the barrel of a shotgun or other weapon held by a fellow officer what happened i mean if you want to talk about it she shrugged and they both took long drinks from their glasses oh it was a domestici hate domesticsand the guy locked himself in the bedroom with a gun we didnt know if he was going to use it on himself his wife or us we waited for backup and then we were going to go in she took another drink bosch watched her her inner turmoil showed clearly in her eyes edgewood had shotgun kiko had the kick fennel kikos partner and i had the door so we did the deed kikos big he opened the door with one kick fennel and i went in the guy was passed out on the bed seemed like no problem but edgewood had a big problem with me he said i crossed the tube did you i dont think so but if i did then so did fennel and he didnt say jack to him youre the rookie youre the one on probation yeah and im getting tired of it thats for sure i mean how did you make it through harry right now youve got a job that makes a difference what i do just chasing the radio all day and night going from dirtbag to dirtbag its like spitting on a house fire were not making any headway out there and on top of that ive got this uptight male asshole telling me every two minutes how i fucked up bosch knew what she was feeling every cop in a uniform went through it you wade through the cesspool every day and soon it seems that that is all there is an abyss it was why he could never go back to working patrol patrol was a bandaid on a bullet hole did you think it would be different when you were in the academy i mean i dont know what i thought i just dont know if i can make it through to a point where i think im making any difference i think you can the first couple years are tough but you dig in and you start seeing the long view you pick your battles and you pick your path youll do all right he didnt feel confident giving her the rahrah speech he had gone through long stretches of indecision about himself and his choices telling her to stick it out made him feel a little false lets talk about something else she said fine with me he said he took a long drink from his glass trying to think of how to turn the conversation in another direction he put his glass down turned and smiled at her so there you were hiking in the andes and you said to yourself gee i wanna be a cop she laughed seemingly shaking off the blues of her earlier comments not quite like that and ive never been in the andes well what about the rich full life you lived before putting on the badge you said you were a world traveler never made it to south america is that where the andes are all this time i thought they were in florida she laughed again and bosch felt good about successfully changing the subject he liked looking at her teeth when she laughed they were just a little bit crooked and in a way that made them perfect so seriously what did you do she turned in the stool so they were shoulder to shoulder looking at each other in the mirror behind all the colored bottles lined along the back wall of the bar oh i was a lawyer for a whilenot a defense lawyer so dont get excited civil law then i realized that was bullshit and quit and just started traveling i worked along the way i made pottery in venice italy i was a horse guide in the swiss alps for a while i was cook on a daytrip tourist boat in hawaii i did other things and i just saw a lot of the worldexcept for the andes then i came home to la born and raised you same queen of angels cedars she held out her glass and they clinked to the few the proud the brave she said bosch finished off his glass and poured in the contents of his sidecar he was way ahead of brasher but didnt care he was feeling relaxed it was good to forget about things for a while it was good to be with somebody not directly related to the case born at cedars huh he asked whered you grow up dont laugh bel air bel air i guess somebodys daddy isnt too happy about her joining the cops especially since his was the law firm she walked out of one day and wasnt heard from for two years bosch smiled and raised his glass she clicked hers off it brave girl after they put their glasses down she said lets stop all the questions okay bosch said and do what just take me home harry to your place he paused for a moment looking at her shiny blue eyes things were moving lightning fast greased on the smooth runners of alcohol but that was often the way it was between cops between people who felt they were part of a closed society who lived by their instincts and went to work each day knowing that how they made their living could kill them yeah he finally said i was just thinking the same thing he leaned over and kissed her on the mouth chapter julia brasher stood in the living room of boschs house and looked at the cds stored in the racks next to the stereo i love jazz bosch was in the kitchen he smiled when he heard her say it he finished pouring the two martinis out of a shaker and came out to the living room and handed her a glass who do you like ummm lately bill evans bosch nodded went to the rack and came up with kind of blue he loaded it into the stereo bill and miles he said not to mention coltrane and a few other guys nothing better as the music began he picked up his martini and she came over and tapped it with her glass rather than drink they kissed each other she started laughing halfway through the kiss what he said nothing im just feeling reckless and happy yeah me too i think it was you giving me the flashlight bosch was puzzled what do you mean you know its so phallic the look on boschs face made her laugh again and she spilled some of her drink on the floor later when she was lying face down on his bed bosch was tracing the outline of the flaming sun tattooed on the small of her back and thinking about how comfortable and yet strange she felt to him he knew almost nothing about her like the tattoo there seemed to be a surprise from every angle of view he had on her what are you thinking about she asked nothing just wondering about the guy who got to put this on your back i wish it had been me i guess how come because there will always be a piece of him with you she turned on her side revealing her breasts and her smile her hair was out of its braid and down around her shoulders he liked that too she reached up and pulled him down into a long kiss then she said thats the nicest thing thats been said to me in a long time he put his head down on her pillow he could smell the sweet scent of perfume and sex and sweat you dont have any pictures on your walls she said photos i mean he shrugged his shoulders she turned over so her back was to him he reached under her arm and cupped one of her breasts and pulled her back into him can you stay till the morning he asked well my husband will probably wonder where i am but i guess i could call him bosch froze then she started laughing dont scare me like that well you never even asked me if i was involved with anyone you didnt ask me you were obvious the lone detective type and then in a deep male voice just the facts maam no time for dames murder is my business i have a job to do and i am he ran his thumb down her side over the indentations of her ribs she cut off her words with laughter you lent me your flashlight he said i didnt think an involved woman would have done that and ive got news for you tough guy i saw the mag in your trunk in the box before you covered it up you werent fooling anybody bosch rolled back on the other pillow embarrassed he could feel his face getting red he brought his hands up to hide it oh god mr obvious she rolled over to him and peeled back his hands she kissed him on the chin i thought it was nice kinda made my day and gave me something to maybe look forward to she turned his hands back and looked at the scarring across the knuckles they were old marks and not very noticeable anymore hey what is this just scars i know that from what i had tattoos i took them off it was a long time ago how come they made me take them off when i went into the army she started to laugh why what did it say fuck the army or something no nothing like that then what come on i want to know it said hold on one hand and fast on the other hold fast what does hold fast mean well its kind of a long story i have time my husband doesnt mind she smiled come on i want to know its not a big deal when i was a kid one of the times i ran away i ended up down in san pedro down around the fishing docks and a lot of those guys down there the fishermen the tuna guys i saw they had this on their hands hold fast and i asked one of them about it and he told me it was like their motto their philosophy its like when they were out there in those boats way out there for weeks and the waves got huge and it got scary you just had to grab on and hold fast bosch made two fists and held them up hold fast to life to everything that you have so you had it done how old were you i dont know sixteen thereabouts he nodded and then he smiled what i didnt know was that those tuna guys got it from some navy guys so a year later i go waltzing into the army with hold fast on my hands and the first thing my sergeant told me was to get rid of it he wasnt going to have any squid tattoo on one of his guys hands she grabbed his hands and looked closely at the knuckles this doesnt look like laser work bosch shook his head they didnt have lasers back then so what did you do my sergeant his name was rosser took me out of the barracks and over to the back of the administration building there was a brick wall he made me punch it until every one of my knuckles was cut up then after they were scabbed up in about a week he made me do it again jesus fucking christ thats barbaric no thats the army he smiled at the memory it wasnt as bad as it sounded he looked down at his hands the music stopped and he got up and walked through the house naked to change it when he came back to the bedroom she recognized the music clifford brown he nodded and came toward the bed he didnt think he had ever known a woman who could identify jazz music like that stand there what let me look at you tell me about those other scars the room was dimly lit by a light from the bathroom but bosch became conscious of his nakedness he was in good shape but he was more than fifteen years older than her he wondered if she had ever been with a man so old harry you look great you totally turn me on okay what about the other scars he touched the thick rope of skin above his left hip this this was a knife whered that happen a tunnel and your shoulder bullet where he smiled a tunnel ouch stay out of tunnels i try he got into the bed and pulled the sheet up she touched his shoulder running her thumb over the thick skin of the scar right in the bone she said yeah i got lucky no permanent damage it aches in the winter and when it rains thats about it what did it feel like being shot i mean bosch shrugged his shoulders it hurt like hell and then everything sort of went numb how long were you down about three months you didnt get a disability out it was offered i declined how come i dont know i like the job i guess and i thought that if i stuck with it someday id meet this beautiful young cop whod be impressed by all my scars she jammed him in the ribs and the pain made him grimace oh poor baby she said in a mocking voice that hurt she touched the tattoo on his shoulder whats that supposed to be mickey mouse on acid sort of its a tunnel rat her face lost all trace of humor whats the matter you were in vietnam she said putting things together ive been in those tunnels what do you mean when i was on the road i spent six weeks in vietnam the tunnels theyre like a tourist thing now you pay your money and you can go down into them it mustve been what you had to do mustve been so frightening it was more scary afterward thinking about it they have them roped off so they can sort of control where you go but nobody really watches you so i went under the rope and went further in it got so dark in there harry bosch studied her eyes and did you see it he asked quietly the lost light she held his eyes for a moment and nodded i saw it my eyes adjusted and there was light almost like a whisper but it was enough for me to find my way lost light we called it lost light we never knew where it came from but it was down there like smoke hanging in the dark some people said it wasnt light that it was the ghosts of everybody who died in those things from both sides they spoke no more after that they held each other and soon she was asleep bosch realized he had not thought about the case for more than three hours at first this made him feel guilty but then he let it go and soon he too was asleep he dreamed he was moving through a tunnel but he wasnt crawling it was as if he were underwater and moving like an eel through the labyrinth he came to a dead end and there was a boy sitting against the curve of the tunnels wall he had his knees up and his face down buried in his folded arms come with me bosch said the boy peeked his eyes over one arm and looked up at bosch a single bubble of air rose from his mouth he then looked past bosch as if something was coming up behind him bosch turned around but there was only the darkness of the tunnel behind him when he looked back at the boy he was gone chapter late sunday morning bosch drove brasher to the hollywood station so she could get her car and he could resume work on the case she was off duty sundays and mondays they made plans to meet at her house in venice that night for dinner there were other officers in the parking lot when bosch dropped her next to her car bosch knew that word would get around quickly that it appeared they had spent the night together im sorry he said i should have thought it out better last night i dont really care harry ill see you tonight hey look you should care cops can be brutal she made a face oh police brutality yeah ive heard of it im serious its also against regs on my part im a dthree supervisor level she looked at him a moment well thats your call then ill see you tonight i hope she got out and closed the door bosch drove on to his assigned parking slot and went into the detective bureau trying not to think of the complications he might have just invited into his life it was deserted in the squad room which was what he was hoping for he wanted time alone with the case there was still a lot of office work to do but he also wanted to step back and think about all the evidence and information that had been accumulated since the discovery of the bones the first thing to do was put together a list of what needed to be done the murder bookthe blue binder containing all written reports pertaining to the casehad to be completed he had to draw up search warrants seeking medical records of brain surgeries at local hospitals he had to run routine computer checks on all the residents living in the vicinity of the crime scene on wonderland he also had to read through all the callin tips spawned by the media coverage of the bones on the hill and start gathering missing person and runaway reports that might match the victim he knew it was more than a days work if he labored by himself but decided to keep with his decision to allow edgar the day off his partner the father of a thirteenyearold boy had been greatly upset by gollihers report the day before and bosch wanted him to take a break the days ahead would likely be long and just as emotionally upsetting once bosch had his list together he took his cup out of a drawer and went back to the watch office to get coffee the smallest he had on him was a fivedollar bill but he put it in the coffee fund basket without taking any change he figured hed be drinking more than his share through the day you know what they say someone said behind him as he was filling the cup bosch turned it was mankiewicz the watch sergeant about what fishing off the company dock i dont know what do they say i dont know either thats why i was asking you mankiewicz smiled and moved toward the machine to warm up his cup so already it was starting to get around bosch thought gossip and innuendoespecially anything with a sexual tonemoved through a police station like a fire racing up a hill in august well let me know when you find out bosch said as he started for the door of the watch office could be useful to know will do oh and one other thing harry bosch turned ready for another shot from mankiewicz what just stop fooling around and wrap up your case im tired of my guys having to take all the calls there was a facetious tone in his voice in his humor and sarcasm was a legitimate complaint about his officers on the desk being tied up by the tip calls yeah i know any good ones today not that i could tell but youll get to slog through the reports and use your investigative wiles to decide that wiles yes wiles like wile e coyote oh and cnn mustve had a slow morning and picked up the storygood video all you brave guys on the hill with your makeshift stairs and little boxes of bones so now were getting the longdistance calls topeka and providence so far this morning its not going to end until you clear it harry were all counting on you back here again there was a smileand a messagebehind what he was saying all right ill use all my wiles i promise mank thats what were counting on back at the table bosch sipped his coffee and let the details of the case move through his mind there were anomalies contradictions there were the conflicts between location choice and method of burial noticed by kathy kohl but the conclusions made by golliher added even more to the list of questions golliher saw it as a child abuse case but the backpack full of clothes was an indication that the victim the boy was possibly a runaway bosch had spoken to edgar about it the day before when they returned to the station from the sid lab his partner was not as sure of the conflict as bosch but offered a theory that perhaps the boy was the victim of child abuse both at the hands of his parents and then an unrelated killer he rightfully pointed out that many victims of abuse run away only to be drawn into another form of abusive relationship bosch knew the theory was legitimate but tried not to let himself go down that road because he knew it was even more depressing than the scenario golliher had spun his direct line rang and bosch answered expecting it to be edgar or lt billets checking in it was a reporter from the la times named josh meyer bosch barely knew him and was sure hed never given him the direct line he didnt let on that he was annoyed however though tempted to tell the reporter that the police were running down leads extending as far as topeka and providence he simply said there was no further update on the investigation since fridays briefing from the media relations office after he hung up he finished his first cup of coffee and got down to work the part of an investigation bosch enjoyed the least was the computer work whenever possible he gave it to his partners to handle so he decided to put the computer runs at the end of his list and started with a quick look through the accumulated tip sheets from the watch office there were about three dozen more sheets since he had last looked through the pile on friday none contained enough information to be helpful or worth pursuing at the moment each was from a parent or sibling or friend of someone who had disappeared all of them permanently forlorn and seeking some kind of closure to the most pressing mystery of their lives he thought of something and rolled his chair over to one of the old ibm selectrics he inserted a sheet of paper and typed out four questions do you know if your missing loved one underwent any kind of surgical procedure in the months before his disappearance if so what hospital was he treated at what was the injury what was the name of his physician he rolled the page out and took it to the watch office he gave it to mankiewicz to be used as a template of questions to be asked of all callers about the bones that wily enough for you bosch asked no but its a start while he was there bosch took a plastic cup and filled it with coffee and then came back to the bureau and dumped it into his cup he made a note to ask lt billets on monday to procure some help in contacting all the callers of the last few days to ask the same medical questions he then thought of julia brasher he knew she was off on mondays and would volunteer if needed but he quickly dismissed it knowing that by monday the whole station would know about them and bringing her into the case would make matters worse he started the search warrants next it was a matter of routine in homicide work to need medical records in the course of an investigation most often these records came from physicians and dentists but hospitals were not unusual bosch kept a file with search warrant templates for hospitals as well as a listing of all twentynine hospitals in the los angeles area and the attorneys who handled legal filings at each location having all of this handy allowed him to draw up twentynine search warrants in a little over an hour the warrants sought the records of all male patients under the age of sixteen who underwent brain surgery entailing the use of a trephine drill between and after printing out the requests he put them in his briefcase while normally it was proper on a weekend to fax a search warrant to a judges home for approval and signature it would certainly not be acceptable to fax twentynine requests to a judge on a sunday afternoon besides the hospital lawyers would not be available on a sunday anyway boschs plan was to take the warrants to a judge first thing monday morning then divide them with edgar and handdeliver them to the hospitals thereby being able to push the urgency of the matter with the lawyers in person even if things went according to plan bosch didnt expect to start receiving returns of records from the hospitals until midweek or later bosch next typed out a daily case summary as well as a recap of the anthropological information from golliher he put these in the murder book and then typed up an evidence report detailing the preliminary sid findings on the backpack when he was finished bosch leaned back and thought about the unreadable letter that had been found in the backpack he did not anticipate that the documents section would have any success with it it would forever be the mystery shrouded in the mystery of the case he gulped the last of his second cup of coffee and opened the murder book to the page containing a copy of the crime scene sketch and chart he studied the chart and noted that the backpack had been found right next to the spot kohl had marked as the probable original location of the body bosch wasnt sure what it all meant but instinctively he knew that the questions he now had about the case should be kept foremost in his mind as new evidence and details continued to be gathered they would be the screen through which everything would be sifted he put the report into the murder book and then finished the updating of the paperwork by bringing the investigators logan hourbyhour time chart with small entry blocksup to date he then put the murder book in his briefcase bosch took his coffee cup to the sink in the rest room and washed it out he then returned it to its drawer picked up his briefcase and headed out the back door to his car chapter the basement of parker center the headquarters of the los angeles police department serves as the record archives for every case the department has taken a report on in the modern era until the midnineties records were kept on paper for a period of eight years and then transferred to microfiche for permanent storage the department now used computers for permanent storage and was also moving backward putting older files into digital storage banks but the process was slow and had not gone further back than the late eighties bosch arrived at the counter in archives at one oclock he had two containers of coffee with him and two roast beef sandwiches from philippes in a paper bag he looked at the clerk and smiled believe it or not i need to see the fiche on missing person reports nineteen seventyfive to eightyfive the clerk an old guy with a basement pallor whistled and said look out christine here they come bosch smiled and nodded and didnt know what the man was talking about there appeared to be no one else behind the counter the good news is they break up the clerk said i mean i think its good news you looking for adult or juvy records juveniles then that cuts it up a bit thanks dont mention it the clerk disappeared from the counter and bosch waited in four minutes the man came back with ten small envelopes containing microfiche sheets for the years bosch requested altogether the stack was at least four inches thick bosch went to a microfiche reader and copier set out a sandwich and the two coffees and took the second sandwich back to the counter the clerk refused the first offer but then took the sandwich when bosch said it was from philippes bosch went back to the machine and started ficheing wading first into the year he was looking for missing person and runaway reports of young males in the age range of the victim once he got proficient with the machine he was able to move quickly through the reports he would scan first for the closed stamp that indicated the missing individual had returned home or been located if there was no stamp his eyes would immediately go to the age and sex boxes on the form if they fit the profile of his victim hed read the summary and then push the photocopy button on the machine to get a hard copy to take with him the microfiche also contained records of missing person reports forwarded to the lapd by outside agencies seeking people believed to have gone to los angeles despite his speed at the task it took bosch more than three hours to go through all the reports for the ten years he had requested he had hard copies of more than three hundred reports in the tray to the side of the machine when he was finished and he had no idea whether his effort had been worth the time or not bosch rubbed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose he had a headache from staring at the machines screen and reading tale after tale of parental anguish and juvenile angst he looked over and realized he hadnt eaten his sandwich he returned the stack of microfiche envelopes to the clerk and decided to do the computer work in parker center rather than drive back to hollywood from parker center he could jump on the freeway and shoot out to venice for dinner at julia brashers house it would be easier the squad room of the robberyhomicide division was empty except for the two oncall detectives who were sitting in front of a television watching a football game one of them was boschs former partner kizmin rider the other bosch didnt recognize rider stood up smiling when she saw it was bosch harry what are you doing here she asked working a case i want to use a computer that all right that bone thing he nodded i heard about it on the news harry this is rick thornton my partner bosch shook his hand and introduced himself i hope she makes you look as good as she did me thornton just nodded and smiled and rider looked embarrassed come on over to my desk she said you can use my computer she showed him the way and let him sit in her seat were just twiddling our thumbs here nothing happening i dont even like football dont complain about the slow days didnt anybody ever tell you that yeah my old partner only thing he ever said that made any sense i bet anything i can do to help im just running the namesthe usual he opened his briefcase and took out the murder book he opened it to a page where he had listed the names addresses and birth dates of residents on wonderland avenue who had been interviewed during the neighborhood canvas it was a matter of routine and due diligence to run the name of every person investigators came across in an investigation you want a coffee or something rider asked nah im fine thanks kiz he nodded in the direction of thornton who had his back to them and was on the other side of the room how are things going she shrugged her shoulders every now and then he lets me do some real detective work she said in a whisper well you can always come back to hollywood he whispered back with a smile he started typing in the commands for entering the national crime index computer immediately rider made a sound of derision harry youre still typing with two fingers its all i know kiz ive been doing it this way for almost thirty years you expect me to suddenly know how to type with ten fingers im still not fluent in spanish and dont know how to dance either youve only been gone a year just get up dinosaur let me do it youll be here all night bosch raised his hands in surrender and stood up she sat down and went to work behind her back bosch secretly smiled just like old times he said dont remind me i always get the shit work and stop smiling she hadnt looked up from her typing her fingers were a blur above the keyboard bosch watched in awe hey its not like i planned this i didnt know you were going to be here yeah like tom sawyer didnt know he had to paint a fence what never mind tell me about the boot bosch was stunned what is that all you can say you heard me the rookie youre uh seeing how the hell do you know about it already im a highly skilled gatherer of information and i still have sources in hollywood bosch stepped away from her cubicle and shook his head well is she nice thats all i wanted to know i dont want to pry bosch came back yes shes nice i hardly know her you seem to know more about her and me than me you havin dinner with her tonight yeah im having dinner with her hey harry riders voice had lost any note of humor what you got a pretty good hit here bosch leaned down and looked at the screen after digesting the information he said i dont think im going to make it to dinner tonight chapter bosch pulled to a stop in front of the house and studied the darkened windows and porch figures edgar said the guy aint even going to be home probably already in the wind edgar was annoyed with bosch who had called him in from home the way he figured it the bones had been in the ground twenty years what was the harm of waiting until monday morning to talk to this guy but bosch said he was going by himself if edgar didnt come in edgar came in no hes home bosch said how dyou know i just know he looked at his watch and wrote the time and address down on a page in his small notebook it occurred to him then that the house they were at was the one where he had seen the curtain pulled closed behind a window on the evening of the first call out lets go he said you talked to him the first time so you take the lead ill jump in when it feels right they got out and walked up the driveway to the house the man they were visiting was named nicholas trent he lived alone in the house which was across the street and two houses down from the hillside where the bones had been found trent was fiftyseven years old he had told edgar during his initial canvas of the neighborhood that he was a set decorator for a studio in burbank he was unmarried and had no children he knew nothing about the bones on the hill and could offer no clues or suggestions that were helpful edgar knocked hard on the front door and they waited mr trent its the police he said loudly detective edgar answer your door please he had raised his fist to hit the door again when the porch light went on the door was then opened and a white man with a shaved scalp stood in the darkness within the light from the porch slashed across his face mr trent its detective edgar this is my partner detective bosch we have a few followup questions for you if you dont mind bosch nodded but didnt offer his hand trent said nothing and edgar forced the issue by putting his hand against the door and pushing it open all right if we come in he asked already halfway across the threshold no its not all right trent said quickly edgar stopped and put a puzzled look on his face sir we just have a few more questions wed like to ask yeah and thats bullshit excuse me we all know what is going on here i talked to my attorney already your act is just that an act a bad one bosch could see they were not going to get anywhere with the trickortreat strategy he stepped up and pulled edgar back by the arm once his partner had cleared the threshold he looked at trent mr trent if you knew wed be back then you knew wed find out about your past why didnt you tell detective edgar about it before it could have saved us some time instead it gives us suspicion you can understand that im sure because the past is the past i didnt bring it up i buried the past leave it that way not when there are bones buried in it edgar said in an accusatory tone bosch looked back at edgar and gave him a look that said use some finesse see trent said this is why i am saying go away i have nothing to tell you people nothing i dont know anything about it mr trent you molested a nineyearold boy bosch said the year was nineteen sixtysix and i was punished for it severely its the past ive been a perfect citizen ever since i had nothing to do with those bones up there bosch waited a moment and then spoke in a calm and quieter tone if that is the truth then let us come in and ask our questions the sooner we clear you the sooner we move on to other possibilities but you have to understand something here the bones of a young boy were found about a hundred yards from the home of a man who molested a young boy in nineteen sixtysix i dont care what kind of citizen hes been since then we need to ask him some questions and we will ask those questions we have no choice whether we do it in your home right now or with your lawyer at the station with all of the news cameras waiting outside thats going to be your choice he paused trent looked at him with scared eyes so you can understand our situation mr trent and we can certainly understand yours we are willing to move quickly and discreetly but we cant without your cooperation trent shook his head as though he knew that no matter what he did now his life as he knew it was in jeopardy and probably permanently altered he finally stepped back and signaled bosch and edgar in trent was barefoot and wearing baggy black shorts that showed off thin ivory legs with no hair on them he wore a flowing silk shirt over his thin upper body he had the same build as a ladder all hard angles he led them to a living room cluttered with antiques he sat down in the center of a couch bosch and edgar took the two leather club chairs opposite bosch decided to keep the lead he didnt like the way edgar had handled the door to be cautious and careful i am going to read you your constitutional rights he said then ill ask you to sign a waiver form this protects you as well as us i am also going to record our conversation so that nobody ends up putting words in anybody elses mouth if you want a copy of the tape i will make it available trent shrugged and bosch took it as reluctant agreement when bosch had the form signed he slipped it into his briefcase and took out a small recorder once he started it and identified those present as well as the time and date he nodded to edgar to assume the lead again this was because bosch thought that observations of trent and his surroundings were going to be more important than his answers now mr trent how long have you lived in this house since nineteen eightyfour he then laughed what is funny about that edgar asked nineteen eightyfour dont you get it george orwell big brother he gestured toward bosch and edgar as the front men of big brother edgar apparently didnt follow the statement and continued with the interview rent or own own uh at first i rented then i bought the house in eightyseven from the landlord okay and you are a set designer in the entertainment industry set decorator there is a difference what is the difference the designer plans and supervises the construction of the set the decorator then goes in and puts in the details the little character strokes the characters belongings or tools like that how long have you done this twentysix years did you bury that boy up on the hillside trent stood up indignantly absolutely not ive never even set foot on that hill and you people are making a big mistake if you waste your time on me when the true killer of that poor soul is still out there somewhere bosch leaned forward in his chair sit down mr trent he said the fervent way in which trent delivered the denial made bosch instinctively think he was either innocent or one of the better actors he had come across on the job trent slowly sat down on the couch again youre a smart guy bosch said deciding to jump in you know exactly what were doing here we have to bag you or clear you its that simple so why dont you help us out instead of dancing around with us why dont you tell us how to clear you trent raised his hands wide i dont know how i dont know anything about the case how can i help you when i dont know the first thing about it well right off the bat you can let us take a look around here if i can start to get comfortable with you mr trent then maybe i can start seeing it from your side of things but right now like i said ive got you with your record and ive got bones across the street bosch held up his two hands as if he was holding those two things in them it doesnt look that good from where im looking at things trent stood up and threw one hand out in a gesture toward the interior of the house fine be my guest look around to your hearts content you wont find a thing because i had nothing to do with it nothing bosch looked at edgar and nodded the signal being that he should keep trent occupied while bosch took a look around thank you mr trent bosch said as he stood up as he headed into a hallway that led to the rear of the house he heard edgar asking if trent had ever seen any unusual activity on the hillside where the bones had been found i just remember kids used to play up he stopped apparently when he realized that any mention he made of kids would only further suspicion about him bosch glanced back to make sure the red light of the recorder was still on did you like watching the kids play up there in the woods mr trent edgar asked bosch stayed in the hallway out of sight but listening to trents answer no i couldnt see them if they were up in the woods on occasion i would be driving up or walking my dogwhen he was aliveand i would see the kids climbing up there the girl across the street the fosters next door all the kids around here its a cityowned rightofwaythe only undeveloped land in the neighborhood so they went up there to play some of the neighbors thought the older ones went up there to smoke cigarettes and the concern was they would set the whole hillside on fire how long ago are you talking about like when i first moved here i didnt get involved the neighbors who had been here took care of it bosch moved down the hall it was a small house not much bigger than his own the hallway ended at a conjunction of three doors bedrooms on the right and left and a linen closet in the middle he checked the closet first found nothing unusual and then moved into the bedroom on the right it was trents bedroom it was neatly kept but the tops of the twin bureaus and bed tables were cluttered with knickknacks that bosch assumed trent used on the job in helping to turn sets into real places for the camera he looked in the closet there were several shoe boxes on the upper shelf bosch started opening them and found they contained old wornout shoes it was apparently trents habit of buying new shoes and putting his old ones in the box then shelving them bosch guessed that these too became part of his work inventory he opened one box and found a pair of work boots he noticed that dirt had dried hard in some of the treads he thought about the dark soil where the bones had been found samples of it had been collected he put the boots back and made a mental note of it for the search warrant his current search was just a cursory look around if they moved to the next step with trent and he became a fullfledged suspect then they would come back with a search warrant and literally tear the place apart looking for evidence tying him to the bones the work boots might be a good place to start he was already on tape saying he had never been up on that hillside if the dirt in the treads matched the soil samples from the excavation then theyd have trent caught in a lie most of what sparring with suspects was about was the locking in of a story it was then that the investigator looked for the lies there was nothing else in the closet that warranted boschs attention same with the bedroom or the attached bathroom bosch of course knew that if trent was the killer hed had many years to cover his tracks he would also have had the last three dayssince edgar first questioned him during the canvasto doublecheck his trail and be ready the other bedroom was used as an office and a storage room for his work on the walls hung framed one sheets advertising the films bosch assumed trent had worked on bosch had seen some of them on television but rarely went to theaters to see movies he noticed that one of the frames held the one sheet for a film called the art of the cape years before bosch had investigated the murder of that films producer he had heard that after that the one sheets from the movie had become collector items in underground hollywood when he was finished looking around the rear of the house bosch went through a kitchen door into the garage there were two bays one containing trents minivan the other was stacked with boxes with markings on them corresponding to rooms in a house at first bosch was shocked at the thought that trent had still not completely unpacked after moving in nearly twenty years before then he realized the boxes were work related and used in the process of set decoration when he turned around he was looking at an entire wall hung with the heads of wild game their black marble eyes staring at him bosch felt a nerve tickle run down his spine all of his life he had hated seeing things like that he wasnt sure why he spent another few minutes in the garage mostly going through a box in the stack that was marked boys room it contained toys airplane models a skateboard and a football he took the skateboard out for a few moments and studied it all the while thinking about the shirt from the backpack with solid surf printed on it after a while he put the skateboard back in the box and closed it there was a side door to the garage that led to a path that went to the backyard a pool took up most of the level ground before the yard rose into the steep wooded hillside it was too dark to see much and bosch decided he would have to do the exterior look during daylight hours twenty minutes after he left to begin the search bosch returned to the living room emptyhanded trent looked up at him expectantly satisfied im satisfied for now mr trent i appreciate your you see it never ends satisfied for now you people will never let it go will you i mean if i was a drug dealer or a bank robber my debt would be cleared and you people would leave me alone but because i touched a boy almost forty years ago i am guilty for life i think you did more than touch him edgar said but well get the records dont worry trent put his face in his hands and mumbled something about it being a mistake to have cooperated bosch looked at edgar who nodded that he was finished and ready to go bosch stepped over and picked up his recorder he slid it into the breast pocket of his jacket but didnt turn it off hed learned a valuable lesson on a case the year beforesometimes the most important and telling things are said after an interview is supposedly over mr trent thank you for your cooperation were going to go but we might need to talk to you tomorrow are you working tomorrow god no dont call me at work i need this job and youll ruin it youll ruin everything he gave bosch his pager number bosch wrote it down and headed toward the front door he looked back at edgar did you ask him about trips hes not planning to go anywhere is he edgar looked at trent mr trent you work on movies you know how the dialogue goes you call us if you plan to go out of town if you dont and we have to find you youre not going to like it very much trent spoke in a flatline monotone his eyes focused forward somewhere far away im not going anywhere at all now please leave just leave me alone they walked out the door and trent closed it hard behind them at the bottom of the driveway was a large bougainvillea bush in full bloom it blocked boschs view of the left side of the street until he got there a bright light suddenly flashed on and in boschs face a reporter with a cameraman in tow moved in on the two detectives bosch was blinded for a few moments until his eyes started to adjust hi detectives judy surtain channel four news is there a break in the bones case no comment edgar barked no comment and turn that damn light off bosch finally saw her in the glare of the light he recognized her from tv and from the gathering at the roadblock earlier in the week he also recognized that a no comment was not the way to leave this situation he needed to diffuse it and keep the media away from trent no he said no breakthrough were just following routine procedures surtain shoved the microphone she was carrying toward boschs face why are you out here in the neighborhood again were just finishing the routine canvas of the residents here i hadnt had a chance to talk to the resident here before we just finished up thats all he was talking with a bored tone in his voice he hoped she was buying it sorry he added no big story tonight well was this neighbor or any of the neighbors helpful to the investigation well everyone here has been very cooperative with us but as far as investigative leads go it has been difficult most of these people werent even living in the neighborhood when the bones were buried that makes it tough bosch gestured toward trents house this gentleman for example we just found out that he didnt buy his home here until nineteen eightyseven and were pretty sure those bones were already up there by then so then its back to the drawing board sort of and thats really all i can tell you good night he pushed past her toward his car a few moments later surtain was on him at the car door without her cameraman detective we need to get your name bosch opened his wallet and took out a business card the one with the general station number printed on it he gave it to her and said good night again look if there is anything you can tell me you know off the record i would protect you surtain said you know off camera like this whatever you want to do no there is nothing bosch said as he opened the door have a good night edgar cursed the moment the doors of the car were closed how the hell did she know we were here probably a neighbor bosch said she was out here the whole two days of the dig shes a celebrity she made nice with the residents made friends plus were sitting in a goddamn shamu might as well have called a press conference bosch thought of the inanity of trying to do detective work in a car painted black and white under a program designed to make cops more visible on the street the department had assigned detectives in the divisions to blackandwhites that didnt carry the emergency lights on top but were just as noticeable they watched as the reporter and her cameraman went to trents door shes going to try to talk to him edgar said bosch quickly went into his briefcase and got out his cell phone he was about to dial trents number and tell him not to answer when he realized he couldnt get a cell signal goddammit he said too late anyway edgar said lets just hope he plays it smart bosch could see trent at his front door totally bathed in the white light from the camera he said a few words and then made a waving gesture and closed the door good edgar said bosch started the car turned it around and headed back through the canyon to the station so whats next edgar asked we have to pull the records on his conviction see what it was about ill do that first thing no first thing i want to deliver the search warrants to the hospitals whether trent fits our picture or not we need to id the kid in order to connect him to trent lets meet at van nuys courthouse at eight we get them signed and then split em up bosch had picked van nuys court because edgar lived nearby and they could separate and go from there in the morning after the warrants had been approved by a judge what about a warrant on trents place edgar said you see anything while you were looking around not much hes got a skateboard in a box in the garage you know with his work stuff for putting on a set i was thinking of our victims shirt when i saw that and there were some work boots with dirt in the treads it might match the samples from the hill but im not counting on a search coming through for us the guy has had twenty years to make sure hes clear if hes the guy you dont think so bosch shook his head timings wrong eightyfour is on the late side the far edge of our window i thought we were looking at seventyfive to eightyfive we are in general but you heard gollihertwenty to twentyfive years ago thats early eighties on the high side i dont know about eightyfour being early eighties well maybe he moved to that house because of the body he buried the kid there before and wanted to be close by so he moves into the neighborhood i mean harry these are sick fucks these guys bosch nodded theres that but i just wasnt getting the vibe from the guy i believed him harry your mojos been wrong before oh yeah i think its him hes the guy hear how he said just because i touched a boy probably to him sodomizing a nineyearold is reaching out and touching somebody edgar was being reactionary but bosch didnt call him on it he was a father bosch wasnt well get the records and well see we also have to go to the hall to check the reverses see who was on that street back then the reverses were phone books that listed residents by address instead of by name a collection of the books for every year was kept in the hall of records they would allow the detectives to determine who was living on the street during the to range they were looking at as the boys time of death thats going to be a lot of fun edgar said oh yeah bosch said i cant wait they drove in silence the rest of the way bosch became depressed he was disappointed with himself for how he had run the investigation so far the bones were discovered wednesday and the full investigation took off on thursday he knew he should have run the namesa basic part of the investigationsooner than sunday by delaying it he had given trent the advantage hed had three days to expect and prepare for their questions he had even been briefed by an attorney he could have even been practicing his responses and looks in a mirror bosch knew what his internal lie detector said but he also knew that a good actor could beat it chapter bosch drank a beer on the back porch with the sliding door open so he could hear clifford brown on the stereo almost fifty years before the trumpet player made a handful of recordings and then checked out in a car crash bosch thought about all the music that had been lost he thought about young bones in the ground and what had been lost and then he thought about himself and what he had lost somehow the jazz and the beer and the grayness he was feeling about the case had all mixed together in his mind he felt on edge like he was missing something that was right in front of him for a detective it was just about the worst feeling in the world at pm he came inside and turned the music down so he could watch the news on channel judy surtains report was the third story after the first break the anchor said new developments in the laurel canyon bone case we go to judy surtain at the scene ah shit bosch said not liking the sound of the introduction the program cut to a live shot of surtain on wonderland avenue standing on the street in front of a house bosch recognized as trents im here on wonderland avenue in laurel canyon where four days ago a dog brought home a bone that authorities say was human the dogs find led to the discovery of more bones belonging to a young boy who investigators believe was murdered and then buried more than twenty years ago boschs phone started ringing he picked it up off the arm of the tv chair and answered it hold on he said and then held the phone down by his side while he watched the news report surtain said tonight the lead investigators on the case returned to the neighborhood to speak to one resident who lives less than one hundred yards from the place where the boy was buried that resident is nicholas trent a fiftysevenyearold hollywood set decorator the program cut to tape of bosch being questioned by surtain that night but it was used as visual filler while surtain continued her report in a voiceover dub investigators declined to comment on their questioning of trent but channel four news has learned bosch sat down heavily on the chair and braced himself that trent was once convicted of molesting a young boy the sound was then brought up on the street interview just as bosch said thats really all i can tell you the next jump was to video of trent standing in his doorway and waving the camera off and closing the door trent declined comment on his status in the case but neighbors in the normally quiet hillside neighborhood expressed shock upon learning of trents background as the report shifted to a taped interview of a resident bosch recognized as victor ulrich bosch hit the mute button on the tv remote and brought the phone up it was edgar you watching this shit he asked oh yeah we look like shit we look like we told her they used your quote out of context harry were going to be fucked by this well you didnt tell her right harry you think id tell some no i dont i was confirming you didnt tell her right right and neither did i so yeah were going to take some shit but were clear on it well who else knew i doubt trent was the one who told her about a million people now know hes a child molester bosch realized the only people who knew were kiz who had gotten the records flag while doing the computer work and julia brasher whom bosch told while he was making his excuse for missing dinner suddenly a vision of surtain standing at the roadblock on wonderland came to him brasher had volunteered her help during both days of the hillside search and excavation it was entirely possible that she had connected with surtain in some way was she the reporters source the leak there didnt have to be a leak bosch said to edgar all she needed was trents name she could have gotten any cop she knew to run it on the box for her or she could have looked it up on the sexual offenders cd its public record hold on he had gotten a callwaiting beep on the phone he switched over and learned it was lt billets calling he told her to hold while he got off the other line he clicked over jerry its bullets i gotta call you back its still me billets said oh sorry hold on he tried again and this time made the switch back he told edgar hed call him back if billets said anything he needed to know right away otherwise go with the plan he added see you at van nuys at eight he switched back over to billets bullets she said is that what you guys call me what you said bullets when you thought i was edgar you called me bullets you mean just now yes just now i dont know i dont know what youre talking about you mean when i was switching over to never mind it doesnt matter i assume you saw channel four yeah i saw it and all i can tell you is that it wasnt me and it wasnt edgar that woman got a tip that we were out there and we no commented our way out of there how she came up with his harry you didnt no comment your way out of there they have you on tape your mouth moving and then i hear you say thats all i can say if you say thats all that means you gave her something bosch shook his head even though he was on the phone i didnt give her shit i just bullshitted my way by i told her we were just finishing up the routine canvas of the neighborhood and i hadnt talked to trent before was that true not really but i wasnt going to say we were there because the guys a child molester look she didnt know about trent when we were there if she did she would have asked me she found out later and how i dont know thats what jerry and i were just talking about there was silence for a moment before billets continued well you better have your shit together on this tomorrow because i want a written explanation from you that i can send up the line before that report on four was even over i got a call from captain levalley and she said she had already gotten a call from deputy chief irving yeah yeah typical right on down the food chain look you know that leaking the criminal record of a citizen is against departmental policy whether that citizen is the target of an investigation or not i just hope you have your story straight on this i dont need to tell you that there are people in the department just waiting for you to make a mistake they can sink their teeth into look im not trying to downplay the leak it was wrong and it was bad but im trying to solve a murder here lieutenant and now ive got a whole new obstacle to overcome and thats whats typical there is always something thrown in the way then you should be more careful next time careful of what what did i do wrong im following leads where they go bosch immediately regretted the explosion of frustration and anger of those people in the department waiting for his selfdestruction billets certainly wasnt on the list she was only the messenger here in the same moment he realized his anger was also selfdirected because he knew billets was right he should have handled surtain differently look im sorry he said in a low even tone its just the case its got its hooks you know i think i do billets answered just as quietly and speaking of the case what exactly is going on this whole thing with trent came out of left field for me i thought you were going to keep me up to date it all came up today late i was just going to fill you in in the morning i didnt know channel four would be doing it for me and doing it for levalley and irving as well never mind them for now tell me about trent chapter it was well after midnight by the time bosch got to venice parking on the little streets near the canals was nonexistent he drove around looking for ten minutes and ended up parking in the lot by the library out on venice boulevard and then walking back in not all of the dreamers drawn to los angeles came to make movies venice was the centuryold dream of a man named abbot kinney before hollywood and the film industry barely had a pulse kinney came to the marshlands along the pacific he envisioned a place built on a network of canals with arched bridges and a town center of italian architecture it would be a place emphasizing cultural and artistic learning and he would call it venice of america but like most of the dreamers who come to los angeles his vision was not uniformly shared or realized most financiers and investigators were cynical and passed on the opportunity to build venice putting their money into projects of less grand design venice of america was dubbed kinneys folly but a century later many of the canals and the arched bridges reflected in their waters remained while the financiers and doomsayers and their projects were long swept away by time bosch liked the idea of kinneys folly outlasting them all bosch had not been to the canals in many years though for a short period in his life after returning from vietnam he had lived there in a bungalow with three other men he knew from overseas in the years since many of the bungalows had been erased and modern two and threestory homes costing a million dollars or more had replaced them julia brasher lived in a house at the corner of the howland and eastern canals bosch expected it to be one of the new structures he guessed she probably used her lawfirm money to buy it or even build it but as he came to the address he saw that he was wrong her house was a small bungalow made of white clapboard with an open front porch overlooking the joining of the two canals bosch saw lights on behind the windows of her house it was late but not that late if she worked the threetoeleven shift then it was unlikely she was used to going to bed before two he stepped up onto the porch but hesitated before knocking on the door until the doubts of the last hour had crept in he had gotten only good feelings about brasher and their fledgling relationship he knew he now had to be careful there could be nothing wrong and yet he could spoil everything if he misstepped here finally he raised his arm and knocked brasher answered right away i was wondering if you were going to knock or stand out there all night you knew i was standing here the porch is old it creaks i heard it well i got here and then figured it was too late i should have called first just come in is anything wrong bosch came in and looked around he didnt answer the question the living room had an unmistakable beach flavor to it right down to the bambooandrattan furniture and the surfboard leaning in one corner the only deviation was her equipment belt and holster hanging on a wall rack near the door it was a rookie mistake leaving it out like that but bosch assumed she was proud of her new career choice and wanted to remind friends outside the cop world of it sit down she said i have some wine open would you like a glass bosch thought a moment about whether mixing wine with the beer hed had an hour earlier would lead to a headache the next day when he knew hed have to be focused its red uh ill take just a little bit got to be sharp tomorrow huh i guess she went into the kitchen while he sat down on the couch he looked around the room and now saw a mounted fish with a long sharp point hanging over the white brick fireplace the fish was a brilliant blue shading to black with a white and yellow underside mounted fish didnt bother him the way the heads of mounted game did but he still didnt like the eye of the fish always watching you catch this thing he called out yeah off cabo took me three and a half hours to bring it in she then appeared with two glasses of wine on fiftypound test line she said that was a workout what is it black marlin she toasted the fish with her glass and then toasted bosch hold fast bosch looked at her thats my new toast she said hold fast it seems to cover everything she sat down on the chair closest to bosch behind her was the surfboard it was white with a rainbow design in a border running along the edges it was a short board so you surf the wild waves too she glanced back at the board and then at bosch and smiled i try to picked it up in hawaii you know john burrows she shook her head lot of surfers in hawaii what beach does he surf no i mean here hes a cop he works homicide out of pacific division lives on a walk street by the beach not too far from here he surfs on his board it says to protect and surf she laughed thats cool i like that ill have to get that put on my board bosch nodded john burrows huh ill have to look him up she said it with just a touch of teasing in her voice bosch smiled and said and maybe not he liked the way she kidded him like that it all felt good to bosch which made him feel all the more out of sorts because of his reason for being there he looked at his wine glass ive been fishing all day and didnt catch a thing he said microfiche mostly i saw you on the news tonight she said are you trying to put the squeeze on that guy the child molester bosch sipped his wine to give himself time to think she had opened the door he now just had to step through very carefully what do you mean he asked well giving that reporter his criminal background i figured you must be making some kind of play you know turning up the heat on him to make him talk or something it seems kind of risky why well first of all trusting a reporter is always risky i know that from back when i was a lawyer and got burned and second and second you never know how people are going to react when their secrets are no longer secrets bosch studied her for a moment and then shook his head i didnt give it to her he said somebody else did he studied her eyes for any kind of tell there was nothing theres going to be trouble over it he added she raised her eyebrows in surprise still no tell why if you didnt give her the information why would there she stopped and now bosch could see her put it together he saw the disappointment fill her eyes oh harry he tried to back out through the door what dont worry about it ill be fine it wasnt me harry is that what youre here about to see if im the leak or the source or whatever youd call it she abruptly put her wine glass down on the coffee table red wine lapped over the edge and onto the table she didnt do anything about it bosch knew there was no use trying to avoid the collision he had screwed up look only four people knew and i was one of them so you thought youd come here undercover and find out if it was me she waited for a response finally all bosch could do was nod well it wasnt me and i think you should go now bosch nodded and put down his glass he stood up look im sorry i screwed it up i thought the best way to not mess anything up you know between you and me was to he made a helpless gesture with his hands as he headed to the door was to do the undercover thing he continued i just didnt want to mess it up thats all but i had to know i think if you were me you wouldve felt the same way about it he opened the door and looked back at her im sorry julia thanks for the wine he turned to go harry he turned back she came to him and reached up and grabbed the lapels of his jacket with both hands she slowly pulled him forward and then pushed him backward as if roughing up a suspect in slow motion her eyes dropped to his chest as her mind worked and she came to a decision she stopped shaking him but kept her grasp on his jacket i can get over it she said i think she looked up to his eyes and pulled him forward she kissed him hard on the mouth for a long time and then pushed him back she let go i hope call me tomorrow bosch nodded and stepped through the door she closed it bosch went down the porch to the sidewalk next to the canal he looked at the reflection of the lights of all the houses on the water an arched footbridge lighted by the moon and nothing else crossed the canal twenty yards away its reflection perfect on the water he turned and walked back up the steps to the porch he hesitated at the door again and soon brasher opened it the porch creaks remember he nodded and she waited he wasnt sure how to say what he wanted to say finally he just began one time when i was in one of those tunnels we were talking about last night i came up headon with some guy he was vc black pajamas greased face we sort of looked at each other for a split second and i guess instincts took over we both raised up and fired at the same time simultaneous and then we fucking ran in opposite directions both of us scared shitless screaming in the dark he paused as he thought about the story seeing it more than remembering it anyway i thought he had to have hit me it was almost pointblank too close to miss i thought my gun had backfired and jammed or something the kick had felt wrong when i got up top the first thing i did was check myself no blood no pain i took all of my clothes off and checked myself nothing he had missed pointblank and somehow the guy had missed she stepped over the doors threshold and leaned against the front wall beneath the porch light she didnt say anything and he pressed on anyway then i checked my fortyfive for a jam and i found out why he hadnt hit me the guys bullet was in the barrel of my gun with mine we had pointed at each other and his shot went right up the barrel of my gun what were the chances of that a million to one a billion as he spoke he held his empty hand out as a gun pointing at her his hand was extended directly in front of his chest the bullet that day in the tunnel had been meant for his heart i guess i just want you to know that i know how lucky i was with you tonight he nodded and then turned and went down the steps chapter death investigation is a pursuit with countless dead ends obstacles and colossal chunks of wasted time and effort bosch knew this every day of his existence as a cop but was reminded of it once again when he got to the homicide table shortly before noon monday and found his mornings time and effort had most likely been wasted while a brandnew obstacle awaited him the homicide squad had the area at the rear corner of the detective bureau the squad consisted of three teams of three each team had a table consisting of the three detectives desks pushed together two facing each other the third along one side sitting at boschs table in the slot left vacant by kiz riders departure was a young woman in a business suit she had dark hair and even darker eyes they were eyes sharp enough to peel a walnut and they held on bosch his whole way through the squad room can i help you he asked when he got to the table harry bosch thats me detective carol bradley iad i need to take a statement from you bosch looked around there were several people in the squad room trying to act busy while surreptitiously watching statement about what deputy chief irving asked our division to determine if the criminal record of nicholas trent was improperly divulged to the media bosch still hadnt sat down he put his hands on the top of his chair and stood behind it he shook his head i think its pretty safe to assume it was improperly divulged then i need to find out who did it bosch nodded im trying to run an investigation here and all anybody cares about is look i know you think its bullshit and i may think its bullshit but ive got the order so lets go into one of the rooms and put your story on tape it wont take long and then you can go back to your investigation bosch put his briefcase on the table and opened it he took out his tape recorder he had remembered it while driving around all morning delivering search warrants at the local hospitals speaking of tape why dont you take this into one of the rooms and listen to it first i had it on last night it should end my involvement in this pretty quick she hesitantly took the recorder and bosch pointed to the hallway that led to the three interview rooms im still going to need to fine listen to the tape then well talk your partner too he should be in anytime now bradley went down the hall with the recorder bosch finally sat down and didnt bother to look at any of the other detectives it wasnt even noon but he felt exhausted he had spent the morning waiting for a judge in van nuys to sign the search warrants for medical records and then driving across the city delivering them to the legal offices of nineteen different hospitals edgar had taken ten of the warrants and headed off on his own with fewer to deliver he was then going downtown to conduct record searches on nicholas trents criminal background and to check the reverse directories and property records for wonderland avenue bosch noticed that waiting for him was a stack of phone messages and the latest batch of callin tips from the front desk he took the phone messages first nine out of twelve of them were from reporters all no doubt wanting to follow up on channel s report on trent the night before and then rebroadcast during the morning news program the other three were from trents lawyer edward morton he had called three times between and am bosch didnt know morton but expected he was calling to complain about trents record being given to the media he normally wasnt quick to return calls to lawyers but decided it would be best to get the confrontation over with and to assure morton that the leak had not come from the investigators on the case even though he doubted that morton would believe anything he said he picked up the phone and called back a secretary told him that morton had gone to a court hearing but was due to check in at any moment bosch said he would be waiting for him to call again after hanging up bosch dropped the pink slips with the reporters numbers on them into the trash can next to his spot at the table he started going through the callin sheets and quickly noticed that the desk officers were now asking the questions he had typed out the morning before and given to mankiewicz on the eleventh report in the pile he came across a direct hit a woman named sheila delacroix had called at am that morning and said she had seen the channel report that morning she said her younger brother arthur delacroix disappeared in in los angeles he was twelve years old at the time and was never heard from since in answer to the medical questions she responded that her brother had been injured during a fall from a skateboard a few months before his disappearance he suffered a brain injury that required hospitalization and neurosurgery she did not remember the exact medical details but was sure the hospital was queen of angels she could not recall the name of any of the doctors who treated her brother other than an address and callback number for sheila delacroix that was all the information on the report bosch circled the word skateboard on the sheet he opened his briefcase and got out a business card bill golliher had given him he called the first number and got a machine at the anthropologists office at ucla he called the second and got golliher while he was eating lunch in westwood village got a quick question the injury that required surgery on the skull the hematoma right could that have been caused by a fall from a skateboard there was silence and bosch let golliher think the clerk who took the calls to the general lines in the squad room came up to the homicide table and shot bosch a peace sign bosch covered his receiver who is it kiz rider tell her to hold he uncovered the receiver doc you there yes im just thinking it might be possible depending on what it was he hit but a fall just to the ground i would say its not likely you had a tight fracture pattern which indicates a small area of surfacetosurface contact also the location is high up on the cranium its not the back of the head which you would normally associate with fall injuries bosch felt some of the wind going out of his sails he had thought he might have an id on the victim is this a particular person you are talking about golliher asked yeah we just got a tip are there xrays surgical records im working on it well id like to see them to make a comparison as soon as i get them what about the other injuries could they be from skateboarding of course some of them could be from that golliher said but i would say not all the ribs the twist fracturesalso some of these injuries dated to very early childhood detective there arent many threeyearolds on skateboards i would think bosch nodded and tried to think if there was anything else to ask detective you do know that in abuse cases the reported cause of injury and the true cause are not often the same i understand whoever brought the kid into the emergency room wouldnt volunteer he hit him with a flashlight or whatever right there would be a story the child would adhere to it skateboard accident its possible okay doc i gotta go ill get you the xrays as soon as i get them thanks he punched line two on the phone kiz harry hi howre you doing busy whats up i feel awful harry i think i fucked up bosch leaned back in his chair he would have never guessed it was her channel four yeah i uh yesterday after you left parker and my partner stopped watching the football game he asked what was up with you being in there so i told him im still trying to establish the relationship harry you know i told him i ran the names for you and there was a hit one of the neighbors had a molestation record thats all i told him harry i swear bosch breathed out heavily he actually felt better his instinct about rider had been right on she was not the leak she had simply trusted someone she should have been able to trust kiz i got iad sitting up here waiting to talk to me about this how do you know thornton gave it to channel four i saw the report on tv this morning when i was getting ready i know thornton knows that reporter surtain thornton and i worked a case a few months agoan insurance murder on the westside it got some media play and he was feeding her stuff off the record i saw them together then yesterday after i told him about the hit he said he had to go to the can he picked the sports page up and went down the hall but he didnt go to the can we got a call out and i went down and banged on the door to tell him we were rolling he didnt answer i didnt really think anything about it until i saw the news today i think he didnt go to the can because he went into another office or down to the lobby to use a phone to call her well it explains a lot im really sorry harry that tv report didnt make you look good at all im going to talk to iad just hold on to that kiz for now ill let you know if i need you to talk to iad but what are you going to do get a new partner i cant work with this guy be careful you start jumping partners and pretty soon youll be all alone id rather work alone than with some asshole i cant trust theres that what about you the offer still stand what im an asshole you can trust you know what i mean the offer stands all you have to do is hey harry i gotta go here he comes okay bye bosch hung up and rubbed his mouth with his hand as he thought about what to do about thornton he could tell kizs story to carol bradley but there was still too much room in it for error he wouldnt feel comfortable going to iad with it unless he was sure the actual idea of going to iad about anything repulsed him but in this instance someone was harming boschs investigation and that was something he could not let pass after a few minutes he came up with a plan and checked his watch it was ten minutes before noon he called kiz rider back its harry is he there yeah why repeat after me in a sort of excited voice you did harry great who was he you did harry thats great who was he okay now youre listening listening listening now say how did a tenyearold get here from new orleans how did a tenyearold get all the way here from new orleans perfect now hang up and dont say anything if thornton asks you tell him we idd the kid through dental records he was a tenyearold runaway from new orleans last seen in nineteen seventyfive his parents are on a plane heading here now and the chief is going to have a press conference about it all today at four okay harry good luck you too bosch hung up and looked up edgar was standing across the table from him he had heard the last part of the conversation and his eyebrows were up no its all bullshit bosch said im setting up the leak and that reporter the leak who is the leak kizs new partner we think edgar slid into his chair and just nodded but we do have a possible id on the bones bosch said he told edgar about the callin sheet on arthur delacroix and his subsequent conversations with bill golliher nineteen eighty thats not going to work with trent i checked the reverses and property records he wasnt on that street until eightyfour like he said last night something tells me he isnt our guy bosch thought about the skateboard again it wasnt enough to alter his gut feeling tell that to channel four boschs phone rang it was rider he just went to the can you tell him about the press conference i told him everything he kept asking questions the dipshit well if he tells her that everybody will have it at four shell go out with the exclusive on the noon news im going to go watch let me know he hung up and checked his watch he still had a few minutes he looked at edgar by the way iad is in one of the rooms back there were under investigation edgars jaw dropped like most cops he resented internal affairs because even when you did a good and honest job the iad could still be on you for any number of things it was like the internal revenue service the way just seeing a letter with the irs return address in the corner was enough to pull your guts into a knot relax its about the channel four thing we should be clear of it in a few minutes come with me they went into lt billetss office where there was a small television on a stand she was doing paperwork at her desk you mind if we check out channel fours noon report bosch asked be my guest im sure captain levalley and chief irving are going to be watching as well the news program opened with a report on a sixteencar pileup in the morning fog on the santa monica freeway it wasnt that significant a storyno one was killedbut they had good video so it led the program but the dog bone case had moved up to second billing the anchor said they were going to judy surtain with another exclusive report the program cut to surtain sitting at a desk in the channel newsroom channel four has learned that the bones found in laurel canyon have been identified as those of a tenyearold runaway from new orleans bosch looked at edgar and then at billets who was rising from her seat with an expression of surprise on her face bosch put out his hand as if to signal her to wait a moment the parents of the boy who reported him missing more than twentyfive years ago are en route to los angeles to meet with police the remains were identified through dental records later today the chief of police is expected to hold a press conference where he will identify the boy and discuss the investigation as reported by channel four last night police are focusing on bosch turned the tv off harry jerry whats going on billets asked immediately all of that was bogus i was smoking out the leak who kizs new partner a guy named rick thornton bosch explained what rider had explained to him earlier he then outlined the scam he had just pulled wheres the iad detective billets asked one of the interview rooms shes listening to a tape i had of me and the reporter last night a tape why didnt you tell me about it last night i forgot about it last night all right ill take it from here you feel kiz is clean on this bosch nodded she has to trust her partner enough to tell him anything he took that trust and gave it to channel four i dont know what hes getting in return but it doesnt matter hes fucking with my case all right harry i said i would handle it you go back to the case anything new i should know about weve got a possible idthis one legitthat well be running down today what about trent were letting that sit until we find out if this is the kid if it is the timing is wrong the kid disappeared in nineteen eighty trent didnt move into the neighborhood until four years later great meantime weve taken his buried secret and put it on tv last i heard from patrol the media was camped in his driveway bosch nodded talk to thornton about it he said oh we will she sat down behind her desk and picked up the phone it was their cue to leave on the way back to the table bosch asked edgar if he had pulled the file on trents conviction yeah i got it it was a weak case nowadays the da probably wouldnt have even filed on it they went to their respective spots at the table and bosch saw that he had missed a callback from trents lawyer he reached for the phone but then waited until edgar finished his report the guy worked as a teacher at an elementary school in santa monica he was caught by another teacher in a stall in the bathroom holding an eightyearolds penis while he urinated he said he was teaching the kid how to aim it that the kid kept pissing on the floor what it came down to is the kids story was all over the place but didnt back his and the parents said the boy already knew how to aim by the time he was four trent was convicted and got a two plus one he served fifteen months of it up at wayside bosch thought about all of this his hand was still on the phone its a long ass jump from that to beating a kid to death with a baseball bat yeah harry im beginning to like your mojo better all the time i wish i did he picked up the phone and punched in the number for trents attorney edward morton he was transferred to the lawyers cell phone he was on his way to lunch hello detective bosch bosch yes i want to know where he is who dont play this game detective ive called every holding jail in the county i want to be able to speak to my client right now im assuming you are speaking about nicholas trent have you tried his job home and work no answer pager too if you people have him hes entitled to representation and i am entitled to know im telling you now if you fuck with me on this i will go right to a judge and the media we dont have your man counselor i havent seen him since last night yes he called me after you left then again after watching the news you people fucked him overyou should be ashamed of yourself boschs face burned with the rebuke but he didnt respond to it if he didnt personally deserve it then the department did hed take the bullet for now do you think he ran mr morton why run if you are innocent i dont know ask oj a horrible thought suddenly shot into boschs gut he stood up the phone still pressed to his ear where are you now mr morton sunset heading west near book soup turn around and come back meet me at trents house i have a lunch im not going meet me at trents house im leaving now he put the phone in its cradle and told edgar it was time to go hed explain on the way chapter there was a small gathering of television reporters in the street in front of nicholas trents house bosch parked behind the channel van and he and edgar got out bosch didnt know what edward morton looked like but didnt see anyone in the group who looked like an attorney after more than twentyfive years on the job he had unerring instincts that allowed him to identify lawyers and reporters over the top of the car bosch spoke to edgar before the reporters could hear them if we have to go in well do it around backwithout the audience i gotya they walked up to the driveway and were immediately accosted by the media crews who turned on cameras and threw questions that went unanswered bosch noticed that judy surtain of channel was not among the reporters are you here to arrest trent can you tell us about the boy from new orleans what about the press conference media relations doesnt know anything about a press conference is trent a suspect or not once bosch was through the crowd and on trents driveway he suddenly turned back and faced the cameras he hesitated a moment as if composing his thoughts what he really was doing was giving them time to focus and get ready he didnt want anyone to miss this there is no press conference scheduled bosch said there has been no identification of the bones yet the man who lives in this house was questioned last night as was every resident of this neighborhood at no time was he called a suspect by the investigators on this case information leaked to the media by someone outside of the investigation and then broadcast without being checked first with the actual investigators has been completely wrong and damaging to the ongoing investigation thats it thats all im going to say when there is some real and accurate information to report we will give it to you through media relations he turned back around and headed up the driveway to the house with edgar the reporters threw more questions at them but bosch gave no indication of even hearing them at the front door edgar knocked sharply and called out to trent telling him it was the police after a few moments he knocked again and made the same announcement they waited again and nothing happened the back edgar asked yeah or the garage has a door on the side they walked across the driveway and started heading down the side of the house the reporters yelled more questions bosch guessed they were so used to throwing questions that were not answered at people that it simply became natural for them to do it and natural for them to know they would not be answered like a dog barking in the backyard long after the master has left for work they passed the side door to the garage and bosch noted that he was correct in remembering that there was only a single key lock on the knob they continued into the backyard there was a kitchen door with a dead bolt and a key lock on the knob there was also a sliding door which would be easy to pop open edgar stepped over to it but looked down through the glass to the interior sliding track and saw that there was a wooden dowel in place that would prevent the door from being opened from the outside this wont work harry he said bosch had a small pouch containing a set of lock picks in his pocket he didnt want to have to work the dead bolt on the kitchen door lets do the garage unless he walked over to the kitchen door and tried it it was unlocked and he opened the door in that moment he knew they would find trent dead inside trent would be the helpful suicide the one who leaves the door open so people dont have to break in shit edgar came over pulling his gun from its holster youre not going to need that bosch said he stepped into the house and they moved through the kitchen mr trent edgar yelled police police in the house are you here mr trent take the front bosch said they split up and bosch went down the short hallway to the rear bedrooms he found trent in the walkin shower of the master bath he had taken two wire hangers and fashioned a noose which he had attached to the stem pipe of the shower he had then leaned back against the tiled wall and dropped his weight and asphyxiated himself he was still dressed in the clothes he had worn the night before his bare feet were on the floor tiles there were no indications at all that trent had had second thoughts about killing himself being that it was not a suspension hanging he could have stopped his death at any time he didnt bosch would have to leave it for the coroners people but he judged by the darkening of the bodys tongue which was distended from the mouth that trent had been dead at least twelve hours that would put his death in the vicinity of the very early morning not long after channel had first announced his hidden past to the world and labeled him a suspect in the bones case harry bosch nearly jumped he turned around and looked at edgar dont do that to me man what edgar was staring at the body as he spoke he left a threepage note out on the coffee table bosch stepped out of the shower and pushed past edgar he headed toward the living room taking a pair of latex gloves from his pocket and blowing into them to expand the rubber before snapping them on did you read the whole thing yeah he says he didnt do the kid he says hes killing himself because the police and reporters have destroyed him and he cant go on like that theres some weird stuff too bosch went into the living room edgar was a few steps behind him bosch saw three handwritten pages spread side by side on the coffee table he sat down on the couch in front of them this how they were yup i didnt touch them bosch started reading the pages what he presumed were trents last words were a rambling denial of the murder of the boy on the hillside and a purging of anger over what had been done to him now everybody will know you people have ruined me killed me the blood is on you not on me i didnt do it i didnt do it no no no i never hurt anyone never never never not a soul on this earth i love the children love no it was you who hurt me you but it is i who cant live with the pain of what you have ruthlessly caused i cant it was repetitive and almost as if someone had written down an extemporaneous diatribe rather than sat down with pen and paper and wrote out their thoughts the middle of the second page was blocked off and inside the box were names under a heading of those found responsible the list started with judy surtain included the anchor on the channel nightly news and listed bosch edgar and three names bosch didnt recognize calvin stumbo max rebner and alicia felzer stumbo was the cop and rebner was the da on the first case edgar said in the sixties bosch nodded and felzer dont know that one the pen with which the pages were apparently written was on the table next to the last page bosch didnt touch it because he planned to have it checked for trents fingerprints as he continued to read bosch noticed that each page was signed at the bottom with trents signature at the end of the last page trent made an odd plea that bosch didnt readily understand my one regret is for my children who will care for my children they need food and clothes i have some money the money goes to them whatever i have this is my last will and testament signed by me give the money to the children have morton give the money and dont charge me anything do it for the children his children bosch asked yeah i know edgar said weird what are you doing here where is nicholas they looked at the doorway from the kitchen to the living room a short man in a suit who bosch guessed was a lawyer and had to be morton stood there bosch stood up hes dead it looks like a suicide where master bath but i wouldnt morton was already gone heading to the bathroom bosch called after him dont touch anything he nodded to edgar to follow and make sure bosch sat back down and looked at the pages again he wondered how long it took trent to decide that killing himself was all that he had left and then to labor over the threepage note it was the longest suicide note he had ever encountered morton came back into the living room edgar just behind him his face was ashen and his eyes held on the floor i tried to tell you not to go back there bosch said the lawyers eyes came up and fixed on bosch they filled with anger which seemed to restore some color to mortons face are you people happy now you completely destroyed him give a mans secret to the vultures they put it on the air and this is what you get he gestured with a hand in the direction of the bathroom mr morton youve got your facts wrong but essentially it looks like thats what happened in fact youd probably be surprised by how much i agree with you now that hes dead that must be very easy for you to say is that a note did he leave a note bosch got up and gestured for him to take his spot on the couch in front of the three pages just dont touch the pages morton sat down unfolded a pair of reading glasses and started studying the pages bosch walked over to edgar and said in a low voice im going to use the phone in the kitchen to make the calls edgar nodded better get media relations on it the shit is going to hit that fan yeah bosch picked up the wall phone in the kitchen and saw it had a redial button he pushed it and waited he recognized the voice that answered as mortons it was an answering machine morton said he wasnt home and to leave a message bosch called lt billetss direct line she answered right away and bosch could tell she was eating well i hate to break this to you while youre eating but were up here at trents place it looks like he killed himself there was silence for a long moment and then she asked bosch if he was sure im sure hes dead and im pretty sure he did it himself hung himself with a couple of wire hangers in the shower theres a threepage note here he denies anything to do with the bones he blames his death on channel four and the police mostlyme and edgar in particular youre the first one ive called well we all know it wasnt you who thats okay lieutenant i dont need the absolution what do you want me to do here you handle the routine call outs ill call chief irvings office and tell him what has transpired this is going to get hot yes what about media relations theres already a gang of reporters out on the street ill call them did you do anything about thornton yet already in the pipeline the woman from iad bradley is running with it with this latest thing id bet thornton not only leaked his way out of a job but they might want to go after him with a charge of some kind bosch nodded thornton deserved it he still had no second thoughts about the scam he had devised all right well well be here for a while at least let me know if you find anything there that connects him to the bones bosch thought of the boots with the dirt in the treads and the skateboard you got it he said bosch clicked off the call and then immediately made calls to the coroners office and sid in the living room morton had finished reading the note mr morton when was the last time you talked to mr trent bosch asked last night he called me at home after the news on channel four his boss had seen it and called him bosch nodded that accounted for the last call you know his bosss name morton pointed to the middle page on the table right here on the list alicia felzer she told him she was going to seek his termination the studio makes movies for children she couldnt have him on a set with a child you see the leaking of his record to the media destroyed this man you recklessly took a mans existence and let me ask the questions mr morton you can save your outrage for when you go outside and talk to the reporters yourself which i know youll do what about that last page he mentions the children his children what does that mean i have no idea he obviously was emotionally distraught when he wrote this it may mean nothing bosch remained standing studying the attorney why did he call you last night why do you think to tell me you had been here that it was all over the news that his boss had seen it and wanted to fire him did he say whether he buried that boy up there on the hill morton put on the best indignant look he could muster he certainly said that he did not have a thing to do with it he believed he was being persecuted for a past mistake a very distant mistake and id say he was correct about that bosch nodded okay mr morton you can leave now what are you talking about im not going to this house is now a crime scene we are investigating your clients death to confirm or deny it was by his own hand you are no longer welcome here jerry edgar stepped over to the couch and waved morton up come on time to go out there and get your face on tv itll be good for business right morton stood up and left in a huff bosch walked over to the front windows and pulled the curtain back a few inches when morton came down the side of the house to the driveway he immediately walked to the center of the knot of reporters and started talking angrily bosch couldnt hear what was said he didnt need to when edgar came back into the room bosch told him to call the watch office and get a patrol car up to wonderland for crowd control he had a feeling that the media mob like a virus replicating itself was going to start growing bigger and hungrier by the minute chapter they found nicholas trents children when they searched his home following the removal of his body filling the entire two drawers of a small desk in the living room a desk bosch had not searched the night before were files photographs and financial records including several thick bank envelopes containing canceled checks trent had been sending small amounts of money on a monthly basis to a number of charitable organizations that fed and clothed children from appalachia to the brazilian rain forest to kosovo trent had been sending checks for years bosch found no check for an amount higher than twelve dollars he found dozens and dozens of photographs of the children he was supposedly helping as well as small handwritten notes from them bosch had seen any number of publicservice ads for the charities on latenight television he had always been suspicious not about whether a few dollars could keep a child from going hungry and unclothed but about whether the few dollars would actually get to them he wondered if the photos trent kept in the drawers of his desk were the same stock shots sent to everybody who contributed he wondered if the thankyou notes in childish printing were fake man edgar said as he surveyed the contents of the desk this guy its like i think he was paying a penance or something sending all his cash to these outfits yeah a penance for what we may never know edgar went back to searching the second bedroom bosch studied some of the photos he had spread on the top of the desk there were boys and girls none looking older than ten though this was hard to estimate because they all had the hollow and ancient eyes of children who have been through war and famine and indifference he picked up one shot of a young white boy and turned it over the information said the boy had been orphaned during the fighting in kosovo he had been injured in the mortar blast that killed his parents his name was milos fidor and he was ten years old bosch had been orphaned at age eleven he looked into the boys eyes and saw his own at pm they locked trents home and took three boxes of seized materials to the car a small group of reporters lingered outside during the whole afternoon despite word from media relations that all information on the days events would be distributed through parker center the reporters approached them with questions but bosch quickly said that he was not allowed to comment on the investigation they put the boxes in the trunk and drove off heading downtown where a meeting had been called by deputy chief irvin irving bosch was uncomfortable with himself as he drove he was ill at ease because trents suicideand he had no doubts now that it washad served to deflect the forward movement of the investigation of the boys death bosch had spent half the day going through trents belongings when what he had wanted to be doing was nailing down the id of the boy running out the lead he had received in the callin reports whats the matter harry edgar asked at one point on the drive what i dont know youre acting all morose i know thats probably your natural disposition but you usually dont show it so much edgar smiled but didnt get one in return from bosch im just thinking about things this guy might be alive today if we had handled things differently come on harry you mean like if we didnt investigate him there was no way we did our job and things ran their course nothing we could do if anybodys responsible its thornton and hes gonna get his due but if you ask me the worlds better off without somebody like trent in it anyway my conscience is clear man crystal clear good for you bosch thought about his decision to give edgar the day off on sunday if he hadnt done that edgar might have been the one to make the computer runs on the names kiz rider wouldve been out of the loop and the information would have never gotten to thornton he sighed everything always seemed to work on a domino theory if then if then if then whats your gut say on this guy he asked edgar you mean like did he do the boy on the hill bosch nodded i dont know edgar said have to see what the lab says about the dirt and the sister says about the skateboard if it is the sister and we get an id bosch didnt say anything but he always felt uncomfortable about relying on lab reports in determining which way to go with an investigation what about you har bosch thought of the photos of all the children trent thought he was caring for his act of contrition his chance at redemption im thinking were spinning our wheels he said he isnt the guy chapter deputy chief irvin irving sat behind his desk in his spacious office on the sixth floor of parker center also seated in the room were lt grace billets bosch and edgar and an officer from the media relations unit named sergio medina irvings adjutant a female lieutenant named simonton stood in the open doorway of the office in case she was needed irving had a glasstopped desk there was nothing on it except for two pieces of paper with printing on them that bosch could not read from his spot in front of irvings desk and to the left now then irving began what do we know as fact about mr trent we know he was a pedophile with a criminal record of abusing a child we know that he lived a stones throw from the burial site of a murdered child and we know that he committed suicide on the evening he was questioned by investigators in regard to the first two points just stated irving picked up one of the pages on his desk and studied it without sharing its contents with the room finally he spoke i have here a press release that states those same three facts and goes on to say mr trent is the subject of an ongoing investigation determination of whether he was responsible for the death of the victim found buried near his home is pending lab work and followup investigation he looked at the page silently again and then finally put it down nice and succinct but it will do little to quell the thirst of the media for this story or to help us avert another troubling situation for this department bosch cleared his throat irving seemed to ignore it at first but then spoke without looking at the detective yes detective bosch well it sort of seems as though youre not satisfied with that the problem is what is on that press release is exactly where we stand id love to tell you i think the guy did the kid on the hill id love to tell you i know he did it but we are a long way from that and if anything i think were going to end up concluding the opposite based on what irving snapped it was becoming clear to bosch what the purpose of the meeting was he guessed that the second page on irvings desk was the press release the deputy chief wanted to put out it probably pinned everything on trent and called his suicide the result of his knowing he would be found out this would allow the department to handle thornton the leaker quietly outside of the magnifying glass of the press it would spare the department the humiliation of acknowledging that a leak of confidential information from one of its officers caused a possibly innocent man to kill himself it would also allow them to close the case of the boy on the hill bosch understood that everyone sitting in the room knew that closing a case of this nature was the longest of long shots the case had drawn growing media attention and trent with his suicide had now presented them with a way out suspicions could be cast on the dead pedophile and the department could call it a day and move on to the next casehopefully one with a better chance of being solved bosch could understand this but not accept it he had seen the bones he had heard golliher run down the litany of injuries in that autopsy suite bosch had resolved to find the killer and close the case the expediency of department politics and image management would be second to that he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out his notebook he opened it to a page with a folded corner and looked at it as if he was studying a page full of notes but there was only one notation on the page written on saturday in the autopsy suite separate indications of trauma his eyes held on the number he had written until irving spoke again detective bosch i asked based on what bosch looked up and closed the notebook based on the timingwe dont think trent moved into that neighborhood until after that boy was in the groundand on the analysis of the bones this kid was physically abused over a long period of timefrom when he was a small child it doesnt add up to trent analysis of both the timing and the bones will not be conclusive irving said no matter what they tell us there is still a possibilityno matter how slimthat nicholas trent was the perpetrator of this crime a very slim possibility what about the search of trents home today we took some old work boots with dried mud in the treads it will be compared to soil samples taken where the bones were found but theyll be just as inconclusive even if they match up trent could have picked up the dirt hiking behind his house its all part of the same sediment geologically speaking what else not much weve got a skateboard a skateboard bosch explained about the callin tip he had not had time to follow up on because of the suicide as he told it he could see irving warming to the possibility that a skateboard in trents possession could be linked to the bones on the hill i want that to be your priority he said i want that nailed down and i want to know it the moment you do bosch only nodded yes sir billets threw in irving went silent and studied the two pages on his desk finally he picked up the one he had not read fromthe page bosch guessed was the loaded press releaseand turned at his desk he slid it into a shredder which whined loudly as it destroyed the document he then turned back to his desk and picked up the remaining document officer medina you may put this out to the press he handed the document to medina who stood up to receive it irving checked his watch just in time for the six oclock news he said sir medina said yes uh there have been many inquiries about the erroneous reports on channel four should we say it is against policy to comment on any internal investigation you may also add that the department will not condone or accept the leaking of confidential information to the media that is all officer medina medina looked like he had another question to ask but knew better he nodded and left the office irving nodded to his adjutant and she closed the office door remaining in the anteroom outside the deputy chief then turned his head looking from billets to edgar to bosch we have a delicate situation here he said are we clear on how we are proceeding yes billets and edgar said in unison bosch said nothing irving looked at him detective do you have something to say bosch thought a moment before answering i just want to say that i am going to find out who killed that boy and put him up in that hole if its trent fine good but if its not him im going to keep going irving saw something on his desk something small like a hair or other nearmicroscopic particle something bosch couldnt see irving picked it up with two fingers and dropped it into the trash can behind him as he brushed his fingers together over the shredder bosch looked on and wondered if the demonstration was some sort of threat directed at him not every case is solved detective not every case is solvable he said at some point our duties may require us to move on to more pressing matters are you giving me a deadline no detective i am saying i understand you and i just hope you understand me whats going to happen with thornton its under internal review i cant discuss it with you at this time bosch shook his head in frustration watch yourself detective bosch irving said curtly ive shown a lot of patience with you on this case and others before it what thornton did jammed up this case he should if he is responsible he will be dealt with accordingly but keep in mind he was not operating in a vacuum he needed to get the information in order to leak it the investigation is ongoing bosch stared at irving the message was clear kiz rider could go down with thornton if bosch didnt fall into step with irvings march you read me detective i read you loud and clear chapter before taking edgar back to hollywood division and then heading out to venice bosch got the evidence box containing the skateboard out of the trunk and took it back inside parker center to the sid lab at the counter he asked for antoine jesper while he waited he studied the skateboard it appeared to be made out of laminated plywood it had a lacquered finish to which several decals had been applied most notably a skull and crossbones located in the middle of the top surface of the board when jesper came to the counter bosch presented him with the evidence box i want to know who made this when it was made and where it was sold he said its priority one i got the sixth floor riding my back on this case no problem i can tell you the make right now its a boney board they dont make em anymore he sold out and moved i think to hawaii how do you know all of that cause when i was a kid i was a boarder and this was what i wanted but never had the dough for pretty ironic huh what is a boney board and the case you know bones bosch nodded whatever i want whatever you can get me by tomorrow um i can try i cant prom tomorrow antoine the sixth floor remember ill be talking to you tomorrow jesper nodded give me the morning at least you got it anything happening with documents jesper shook his head nothing yet she tried the dyes and nothing came up i dont think you should count on anything there harry all right antoine bosch left him there holding the box on the way back to hollywood he let edgar drive while he pulled the tip sheet out of his briefcase and called sheila delacroix on his cell phone she answered promptly and bosch introduced himself and said her call had been referred to him was it arthur she asked urgently we dont know maam thats why im calling oh will it be possible for me and my partner to come see you tomorrow morning to talk about arthur and get some information it will help us to be better able to determine if the remains are those of your brother i understand um yes you can come here if that is convenient where is there maam oh my home off wilshire in the miracle mile bosch looked at the address on the callin sheet on orange grove yes thats correct is eightthirty too early for you that would be fine officer if i can help i would like to it just bothers me to think that that man lived there all those years after doing something like this even if the victim wasnt my brother bosch decided it wasnt worth telling her that trent was probably completely innocent in terms of the bone case there were too many people in the world who believed everything they saw on television instead bosch gave her his cell phone number and told her to call it if something came up and eightthirty the next morning turned out to be a bad time for her it wont be a bad time she said i want to help if its arthur i want to know part of me wants it to be him so i know it is over but the other part wants it to be somebody else that way i can keep thinking he is out there someplace maybe with a family of his own now i understand bosch said well see you in the morning chapter it was a brutal drive to venice and bosch arrived more than a half hour late his lateness was then compounded by his fruitless search for a parking space before he went back to the library lot in defeat his delay was no bother to julia brasher who was in the critical stage of putting things together in the kitchen she instructed him to go to the stereo and put on some music then pour himself a glass of wine from the bottle that was already open on the coffee table she did not make a move to touch him or kiss him but her manner was completely warm he thought things seemed good that maybe he had gotten past the gaffe of the night before he chose a cd of live recordings of the bill evans trio at the village vanguard in new york he had the cd at home and knew it would make for quiet dinner music he poured himself a glass of red wine and casually walked around the living room looking at the things she had on display the mantel of the white brick fireplace was crowded with small framed photos he hadnt gotten a chance to look at the night before some were propped on stands and displayed more prominently than others not all were of people some photos were of places he assumed she had visited in her travels there was a ground shot of a live volcano billowing smoke and spewing molten debris in the air there was an underwater shot of the gaping mouth and jagged teeth of a shark the killer fish appeared to be launching itself right at the cameraand whoever was behind it at the edge of the photo bosch could see one of the iron bars of the cage the photographerwho he assumed was brasherhad been protected by there was a photo of brasher with two aboriginal men on either side of her standing somewhere bosch assumed in the australian outback and there were several other photos of her with what appeared to be fellow backpackers in other locations of exotic or rugged terrain that bosch could not readily identify in none of the photos in which julia was a subject was she looking at the camera her eyes were always staring off in the distance or at one of the other individuals posed with her in the last position on the mantel as if hidden behind the other photos was a small goldframed shot of a much younger julia brasher with a slightly older man bosch reached behind the photos and lifted it out so he could see it better the couple was sitting at a restaurant or perhaps a wedding reception julia wore a beige gown with a lowcut neckline the man wore a tuxedo you know this man is a god in japan julia called from the kitchen bosch put the framed photo back in its place and walked to the kitchen her hair was down and he couldnt decide which way he liked it best bill evans yeah it seems like they have whole channels of the radio dedicated to playing his music dont tell me you spent some time in japan too about two months its a fascinating place it looked to bosch like she was making a risotto with chicken and asparagus in it smells good thank you i hope it is so what do you think you were running from she looked up at him from her work at the stove a hand held a stirring spoon steady what you know all the travel leaving daddys law firm to go swim with sharks and dive into volcanoes was it the old man or the law firm the old man ran some people would look at it as maybe i was running toward something the guy in the tuxedo harry take your gun off leave your badge at the door i always do sorry she went back to work at the stove and bosch came up behind her he put his hands on her shoulders and pushed his thumbs into the indentations of her upper spine she offered no resistance soon he felt her muscles begin to relax he noticed her empty wine glass on the counter ill go get the wine he came back with his glass and the bottle he refilled her glass and she picked it up and clicked it off the side of his whether to something or away from something heres to running she said just running what happened to hold fast theres that too heres to forgiveness and reconciliation they clicked glasses again he came around behind her and started working her neck again you know i thought about your story all last night after you left she said my story about the bullet and the tunnel and she shrugged her shoulders nothing its just amazing thats all you know after that day i wasnt afraid anymore when i was down in the darkness i just knew that i was going to make it through i cant explain why i just knew which of course was stupid because there are no guarantees of thatback then and there or anywhere else it made me sort of reckless he held his hands steady for a moment its not good to be too reckless he said you cross the tube too often youll eventually get burned hmm are you lecturing me harry you want to be my training officer now no i checked my gun and my badge at the door remember okay then she turned around his hands still on her neck and kissed him then she pulled back away you know the great thing about this risotto is that it can keep in the oven as long as we need it to bosch smiled later on after they had made love bosch got up from her bed and went out to the living room where are you going she called after him when he didnt answer she called out to him to turn the oven up he came back into the room carrying the goldframed photo he got into the bed and turned on the light on the bed table it was a lowwattage bulb beneath a heavy lamp shade the room still was cast in shadow harry what are you doing julia said in a tone that warned he was treading close to her heart did you turn the oven up yeah threefifty tell me about this guy why i just want to know its a private story i know but you can tell me she tried to take the photo away but he held it out of her reach is he the one did he break your heart and send you running harry i thought you took your badge off i did and my clothes everything she smiled well im not telling you anything she was on her back head propped on a pillow bosch put the picture on the bed table and then turned back and moved in next to her under the sheet he put his arm across her body and pulled her tightly to him look you want to trade scars again i got my heart broken twice by the same woman and you know what i kept her picture on a shelf in my living room for a long time then on new years day i decided it had been a long enough time i put her picture away then i got called out to work and i met you she looked at him her eyes moving slightly back and forth as she seemed to be searching his face for something maybe the slightest hint of insincerity yes she finally said he broke my heart okay no not okay who is the creep she started laughing harry youre my knight in tarnished armor arent you she pulled herself up into a sitting position the sheet falling away from her breasts she folded her arms across them he was in the firm i really fell for himright down the old elevator shaft and then then he decided it was over and he decided to betray me and to tell secret things to my father what things she shook her head things i will never tell a man again where was that picture taken oh at a firm functionprobably the new years banquet i dont remember they have a lot of them bosch had become angled behind her he leaned down and kissed her back just above the tattoo i couldnt be there anymore while he was there so i quit i said i wanted to travel my father thought it was a midlife crisis because i had turned thirty i just let him think it but then i had to do what i said i wanted to dotravel i went to australia first it was the farthest place i could think of bosch pulled himself up and stacked two pillows behind his back he then pulled her back against his chest he kissed the top of her head and kept his nose in her hair i had a lot of money from the firm she said i didnt have to worry i just kept traveling going wherever i wanted working odd jobs when i felt like it i didnt come home for almost four years and when i did thats when i joined the academy i was walking along the boardwalk and saw the little venice community service office i went in and picked up a pamphlet it all happened pretty fast after that your history shows impulsive and possibly reckless decisionmaking processes how did that get by the screeners she gently elbowed him in the side setting off a flare of pain from his ribs he tensed oh harry sorry i forgot yeah sure she laughed i guess all you old guys know that the departments been pushing big time for what they term mature women cadets the last few years to smooth off all the hard testosterone edges of the department she rocked her hips back against boschs genitals to underline the point and speaking of testosterone she said you never told me how it went with old bullet head himself today bosch groaned but didnt answer you know she said irving came to address our class one day on the moral responsibilities that come with carrying the badge and everybody sitting there knew the guy probably makes more backroom deals up there on the sixth floor than there are days in the year the guys the classic fixer you could practically cut the irony in the auditorium with a knife her use of the word irony made bosch flash on what antoine jesper had said about coupling the bones found on the hill with the bones on the skateboard he felt his body tensing as thoughts of the case started encroaching on what had been an oasis of respite from the investigation she sensed his tightness what is it nothing you got all tense all of a sudden the case i guess she was quiet a moment i think its kind of amazing she then said those bones being up there all of these years and then coming up out of the ground like a ghost or something its a city of bones and all of them are waiting to come up he paused i dont want to talk about irving or the bones or the case or anything else right now then what do you want he didnt answer she turned to face him and started pushing him down off the pillows until he was flat on his back how about a mature woman to smooth off all the hard edges again it was impossible for bosch not to smile chapter before dawn bosch was on the road he left julia brasher sleeping in her bed and started on his way to his home after first stopping at abbots habit for a coffee to go venice was like a ghost town with the tendrils of the morning fog moving across the streets but as he got closer to hollywood the lights of cars on the streets multiplied and bosch was reminded that the city of bones was a twentyfourhour city at home he showered and put on fresh clothes he then climbed back into his car and went down the hill to hollywood division it was when he got there surprisingly a number of detectives were already in place chasing paperwork and cases edgar wasnt among them bosch put his briefcase down and walked to the watch office to get coffee and to see if any citizen had brought in doughnuts almost every day a john q who still kept the faith brought in doughnuts for the division a little way of saying there were still those out there who knew or at least understood the difficulties of the job every day in every division cops put on the badge and tried to do their best in a place where the populace didnt understand them didnt particularly like them and in many instances outright despised them bosch always thought it was amazing how far a box of doughnuts could go in undoing that he poured a cup and dropped a dollar in the basket he took a sugar doughnut out of a box on the counter that had already been decimated by the patrol guys no wonder they were from bobs donuts in the farmers market he noticed mankiewicz sitting at his desk his dark eyebrows forming a deep v as he studied what looked like a deployment chart hey mank i think we pulled a grade a lead off the callin sheets thought youd want to know mankiewicz answered without looking up good let me know when my guys can give it a rest were going to be short on the desk the next few days bosch knew this meant he was juggling personnel when there werent enough uniforms to put in carsdue to vacations court appearances or sickoutsthe watch sergeant always pulled people off the desk and put them on wheels you got it edgar still wasnt at the table when bosch got back to the detective squad room bosch put his coffee and doughnut down next to one of the selectrics and went to get a search warrant application out of a community file drawer for the next fifteen minutes he typed out an addendum to the search warrant he had already delivered to the records custodian at queen of angels it asked for all records from the care of arthur delacroix circa to when he was finished he took it to the fax machine and sent it to the office of judge john a houghton who had signed all the hospital search warrants the day before he added a note requesting that the judge review the addendum application as soon as possible because it might lead to the positive identification of the bones and therefore swing the investigation into focus bosch returned to the table and from a drawer pulled out the stack of missing person reports he had gathered while ficheing in the archives he started looking through them quickly glancing only at the box reserved for the name of the missing individual in ten minutes he was finished there had been no report in the stack about arthur delacroix he didnt know what this meant but he planned to ask the boys sister about it it was now eight oclock and bosch was ready to leave to visit the sister but still no edgar bosch ate the remainder of his doughnut and decided to give his partner ten minutes to show before he would leave on his own he had worked with edgar for more than ten years and still was bothered by his partners lack of punctuality it was one thing to be late for dinner it was another to be late for a case he had always taken edgars tardiness as a lack of commitment to their mission as homicide investigators his direct line rang and bosch answered it with an annoyed rasp expecting it to be edgar announcing he was running late but it wasnt edgar it was julia brasher so you just leave a woman high and dry in bed huh bosch smiled and his frustration with edgar quickly drained away i got a busy day here he said i had to get going i know but you couldve said goodbye bosch saw edgar making his way through the squad room he wanted to get going before edgar started his coffee doughnut and sportspage ritual well im saying goodbye now okay im in the middle of something here and i gotta run harry what i thought you were going to hang up on me or something im not but i gotta go look come by before you go up for roll call okay ill probably be back by then all right ill see you bosch hung up and stood up just as edgar got to the homicide table and dropped the folded sports page at his spot you ready yeah i was just going to get lets go i dont want to keep the lady waiting and shell probably have coffee there on the way out bosch checked the incoming tray on the fax machine his search warrant addendum had been signed and returned by judge houghton were in business bosch said to edgar showing him the warrant as they walked to the car see you come in early you get stuff done whats that supposed to mean is that a crack on me it means what it means i guess i just want some coffee chapter sheila delacroix lived in a part of the city called the miracle mile it was a neighborhood south of wilshire that wasnt quite up to the standards of nearby hancock park but was lined with nicely kept homes and duplexes with modest stylistic adjustments to promote individuality delacroixs home was the second floor of a duplex with pseudobeaux arts styling she invited the detectives into her home in a friendly manner but when the first question edgar asked was about coffee she said it was against her religion she offered tea and edgar reluctantly accepted bosch passed he wondered which religion outlawed coffee they took seats in the living room while the woman made edgar his tea in the kitchen she called out to them saying she only had an hour and then had to leave for work what is it you do bosch asked as she came out with a mug of hot tea the tag from the tea bag looped over the side she put it down on a coaster on a side table next to edgar she was a tall woman she was slightly overweight with blonde hair cut short bosch thought she wore too much makeup im a casting agent she said as she took a seat on the couch mostly independent films some episodic television im actually casting a cop show this week bosch watched edgar sip some tea and make a face he then held the mug so he could read the tea bag tag its a blend delacroix said strawberry and darjeeling do you like it edgar put the mug down on its coaster its fine ms delacroix if youre in the entertainment business did you by any chance know nicholas trent please just call me sheila now that name nicholas trent it sounds familiar but i cant quite place it is he an actor or is he in casting neither hes the man who lived up on wonderland he was a set designeri mean decorator oh the one on tv the man who killed himself oh no wonder it was familiar so you didnt know him from the business then no not at all okay well i shouldnt have asked that were out of order here lets just start with your brother tell us about arthur do you have a picture we can look at yes she said as she stood up and walked behind his chair here he is she went to a waisthigh cabinet bosch hadnt noticed behind him there were framed photos on it displayed in much the same way he had seen the photos on julia brashers mantel delacroix chose one and turned around and handed it to bosch the frame contained a photo of a boy and a girl sitting on a set of stairs bosch recognized as the stairs they had climbed before knocking on her door the boy was much smaller than the girl both were smiling at the camera and had the smiles of children who have been told to smilea lot of teeth but not a legitimately turnedup mouth bosch handed the photo to edgar and looked at delacroix who had returned to the couch those stairs was that taken here yes this is the home we grew up in when he disappeared it was from here yes are any of his belongings still here in the house delacroix smiled sadly and shook her head no its all gone i gave his things to the charity rummage sale at church that was a long time ago what church is that the wilshire church of nature bosch just nodded theyre the ones who dont let you have coffee edgar asked nothing with caffeine edgar put the framed photo down next to his tea do you have any other photos of him he asked of course i have a box of old photos can we look at those you know while we talk delacroixs eyebrows came together in confusion sheila bosch said we found some clothing with the remains we would like to look at the photos to see if any of it matches it will help the investigation she nodded i see well then ill be right back i just need to go to the closet in the hallway do you need help no i can manage after she was gone edgar leaned over to bosch and whispered this church of nature tea tastes like piss water bosch whispered back how would you know what piss water tastes like the skin around edgars eyes drew tight with embarrassment as he realized he had walked into that one before he could muster a response sheila delacroix came back into the room carrying an old shoe box she put it down on the coffee table and removed the lid the box was filled with loose photographs these arent in any order or anything but he should be in a lot of them bosch nodded to edgar who reached into the box for the first stack of photos while my partner looks through these why dont you tell me about your brother and when he disappeared sheila nodded and composed her thoughts before beginning may fourth nineteen eighty he didnt come home from school thats it thats all we thought he had run away you said you found clothes with the remains well my father looked in his drawers and said that arthur had taken clothes that was what made us think he had run away bosch wrote a few notes down in a notebook he had pulled from his coat pocket you mentioned that he had been injured a few months before on a skateboard yes he hit his head and they had to operate when he disappeared did he take his skateboard she thought about this for a long moment it was so long ago all i know is that he loved that board so i think he probably took it but i just remember the clothes my father found some of his clothes missing did you report him missing i was sixteen years old at the time so i didnt do anything my father talked to the police though im sure of it i couldnt find any record of arthur being reported missing are you sure he reported him missing i drove with him to the police station was it wilshire division i would assume but i dont really remember sheila where is your father is he still alive hes alive he lives in the valley but hes not well these days where in the valley van nuys in the manchester trailer park there was silence while bosch wrote the information down he had been to the manchester trailer park before on investigations it wasnt a pleasant place to live he drinks bosch looked at her ever since arthur bosch nodded that he understood edgar leaned forward and handed him a photograph it was a yellowed it showed a young boy his arms raised in an effort to maintain balance gliding on the sidewalk on a skateboard the angle of the photograph showed little of the skateboard other than its profile bosch could not tell if it carried a bone design on it or not cant see much there he said as he started to hand the photo back no the clothesthe shirt bosch looked at the photo again edgar was right the boy in the photo wore a gray tshirt with solid surf printed across the chest bosch showed the photo to sheila this is your brother right she leaned forward to look at the photo yes definitely that shirt he is wearing do you remember if it is one of the pieces of clothing your father found missing delacroix shook her head i cant remember its beeni just remember that he liked that shirt a lot bosch nodded and gave the photo back to edgar it wasnt the kind of solid confirmation they could get from xrays and bone comparison but it was one more notch bosch was feeling more and more sure that they were about to identify the bones he watched edgar put the photo in a short stack of pictures he intended to borrow from sheilas collection bosch checked his watch and looked back at sheila what about your mother sheila immediately shook her head nope she was long gone by the time all of this happened you mean she died i mean she took a bus the minute the going got tough you see arthur was a difficult child right from the beginning he needed a lot of attention and it fell to my mother after a while she couldnt take it any longer one night she went out to get some medicine at the drugstore and she never came back we found little notes from her under our pillows bosch dropped his eyes to his notebook it was hard to hear this story and keep looking at sheila delacroix how old were you how old was your brother i was six so that would make artie two bosch nodded did you keep the note from her no there was no need i didnt need a reminder of how she supposedly loved us but not enough to stay with us what about arthur did he keep his well he was only two so my father kept it for him he gave it to him when he was older he may have kept it i dont know because he never really knew her he was always very interested in what she was like he asked me a lot of questions about her there were no photos of her my father had gotten rid of them all so he wouldnt have any reminders do you know what happened to her or if shes still alive i havent the faintest idea and to tell you the truth i dont care if she is alive or not what is her name christine dorsett delacroix dorsett was her maiden name do you know her birth date or social security number sheila shook her head do you have your own birth certificate handy here its somewhere in my records i could go look for it she started to get up no wait we can look for that at the end id like to keep talking here okay um after your mother was gone did your father remarry no he never did he lives alone now did he ever have a girlfriend someone who might have stayed in the house she looked at bosch with eyes that seemed almost lifeless no she said never bosch decided to move on to an area of discussion that would be less difficult for her what school did your brother go to at the end he was going to the brethren bosch didnt say anything he wrote the name of the school down on his pad and then a large letter b beneath it he circled the letter thinking about the backpack sheila continued unbidden it was a private school for troubled boys my dad paid to send him there its off of crescent heights near pico its still there why did he go there i mean why was he considered troubled because he got kicked out of his other schools for fighting mostly fighting edgar said thats right edgar picked the top photograph off of his keeper file and studied it for a moment this boy looks like he was as light as smoke was he the one starting these fights most times he had trouble getting along all he wanted to do was be on his skateboard i think that by todays standards he would be diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder or something similar he just wanted to be by himself all the time did he get hurt in these fights bosch asked sometimes black and blue mostly broken bones not that i remember just schoolyard fights bosch felt agitated the information they were getting could point them in many different directions he had hoped a clearcut path might emerge from the interview you said your father searched the drawers in your brothers room and found clothes missing thats right not a lot just a few things any idea what was missing specifically she shook her head i cant remember what did he take the clothes in like a suitcase or something i think he took his schoolbag took out the books and put in some clothes do you remember what that looked like no just a backpack everybody had to use the same thing at the brethren i still see kids walking on pico with them the backpacks with the b on the back bosch glanced at edgar and then back at delacroix lets go back to the skateboard are you sure he took it with him she paused to think about this then slowly nodded yes im pretty sure he took it with him bosch decided to cut off the interview and concentrate on completing the identification once they confirmed the bones came from arthur delacroix then they could come back to his sister he thought about gollihers take on the injuries to the bones chronic abuse could it all have been injuries from schoolyard fights and skateboarding he knew he needed to approach the issue of child abuse but did not feel the time was appropriate he also didnt want to tip his hand to the daughter so that she could turn around and possibly tell the father what bosch wanted was to back out and come back in later when he felt he had a tighter grasp on the case and a solid investigative plan to go with okay were going to wrap things up here pretty quickly sheila just a few more questions did arthur have some friends maybe a best friend someone he might confide in she shook her head not really he mostly was by himself bosch nodded and was about to close his notebook when she continued there was one boy hed go boarding with his name was johnny stokes he was from somewhere down near pico he was bigger and a little bit older than arthur but they were in the same class at the brethren my father was pretty sure he smoked pot so we didnt like arthur being friends with him by we you mean your dad and you yes my father he was upset about it did either of you talk to johnny stokes after arthur went missing yes that night when he didnt come home my father called johnny stokes but he said he hadnt seen artie the next day when dad went to the school to ask about him he told me he talked to johnny again about artie and what did he say that he hadnt seen him bosch wrote down the friends name in his notebook and underlined it any other friends you can think of no not really whats your fathers name samuel are you going to talk to him most likely her eyes dropped to the hands clasped in her lap is that a problem if we talk to him not really hes just not well if those bones turn out to be arthur i was thinking it would be better if he didnt ever know well keep that in mind when we talk to him but we wont do it until we have a positive identification but if you talk to him then hell know it may be unavoidable sheila edgar handed bosch another photo it showed arthur standing next to a tall blond man who looked faintly familiar to bosch he showed the photo to sheila is this your father yes its him he looks familiar was he ever hes an actor was actually he was on some television shows in the sixties and a few things after that some movie parts not enough to make a living no he always had to work other jobs so we could live bosch nodded and handed the photo back to edgar but sheila reached across the coffee table and intercepted it i dont want that one to leave please i dont have many photos of my father fine bosch said could we go look for the birth certificate now ill go look you can stay here she got up and left the room again and edgar took the opportunity to show bosch some of the other photos he had taken to keep during the investigation its him harry he whispered i got no doubt he showed him a photo of arthur delacroix that had apparently been taken for school his hair was combed neatly and he wore a blue blazer and tie bosch studied the boys eyes they reminded him of the photo of the boy from kosovo he had found in nicholas trents house the boy with the thousandyard stare i found it sheila delacroix came into the room carrying an envelope and unfolding a yellowed document bosch looked at it for a moment and then copied down the names birth dates and social security numbers of her parents thanks he said you and arthur had the same parents right of course okay sheila thank you were going to go well call you as soon as we know something for sure he stood up and so did edgar all right if we borrow these photos edgar asked i will personally see that you get them back okay if you need them they headed to the door and she opened it while still on the threshold bosch asked her one last question sheila have you always lived here she nodded all my life ive stayed here in case he comes back you know in case he doesnt know where to start and comes here she smiled but not in any way that imparted humor bosch nodded and stepped outside behind edgar chapter bosch walked up to the museum ticket window and told the woman sitting behind it his name and that he had an appointment with dr william golliher in the anthropology lab she picked up a phone and made a call a few minutes later she rapped on the glass with her wedding band until it drew the attention of a nearby security guard he came over and the woman instructed him to escort bosch to the lab he did not have to pay the admission the guard said nothing as they walked through the dimly lit museum past the mammoth display and the wall of wolf skulls bosch had never been inside the museum though he had gone to the la brea tar pits often on field trips when he was a child the museum was built after that to house and display all of the finds that bubbled up out of the earth in the tar pits when bosch had called gollihers cell phone after receiving the medical records on arthur delacroix the anthropologist said he was already working on another case and couldnt get downtown to the medical examiners office until the next day bosch had said he couldnt wait golliher said he did have copies of the xrays and photographs from the wonderland case with him if bosch could come to him he could make the comparisons and give an unofficial response bosch took the compromise and headed to the tar pits while edgar remained at hollywood division working the computer to see if he could locate arthur and sheila delacroixs mother as well as run down arthurs friend johnny stokes now bosch was curious as to what the new case was that golliher was working the tar pits were an ancient black hole where animals had gone to their death for centuries in a grim chain reaction animals caught in the miasma became prey for other animals who in turn were mired and slowly pulled down in some form of natural equilibrium the bones now came back up out of the blackness and were collected for study by modern man all of this took place right next to one of the busiest streets in los angeles a constant reminder of the crushing passage of time bosch was led through two doors and into the crowded lab where the bones were identified classified dated and cleaned there appeared to be boxes of bones everywhere on every flat surface a half dozen people in white lab coats worked at stations cleaning and examining the bones golliher was the only one not in a lab coat he had on another hawaiian shirt this one with parrots on it and was working at a table in the far corner as bosch approached he saw there were two wooden bone boxes on the worktable in front of him in one of the boxes was a skull detective bosch how are you doing okay whats this this as im sure you can tell is a human skull it and some other human bones were collected two days ago from asphalt that was actually excavated thirty years ago to make room for this museum theyve asked me to take a look before they make the announcement i dont understand is it old or from thirty years ago oh its quite old it was carbondated to nine thousand years ago actually bosch nodded the skull and the bones in the other box looked like mahogany take a look golliher said and he lifted the skull out of the box he turned it so that the rear of the skull faced bosch he moved his finger in a circle around a star fracture near the top of the skull look familiar bluntforce fracture exactly much like your case just goes to show you he gently replaced the skull in the wooden box show me what things dont change that much this womanat least we think it was a womanwas murdered nine thousand years ago her body probably thrown into the tar pit as a means of covering the crime human nature it doesnt change bosch stared at the skull shes not the first bosch looked up at golliher in nineteen fourteen the bonesa more complete skeleton actuallyof another woman were found in the tar she had the same star fracture in the same spot on her skull her bones were carbondated as nine thousand years old same time frame as her he nodded to the skull in the box so what are you saying doc that there was a serial killer here nine thousand years ago its impossible to know that detective bosch all we have are the bones bosch looked down at the skull again he thought about what julia brasher had said about his job about his taking evil out of the world what she didnt know was a truth he had known for too long that true evil could never be taken out of the world at best he was wading into the dark waters of the abyss with two leaking buckets in his hands but you have other things on your mind dont you golliher said interrupting boschs thoughts do you have the hospital records bosch brought his briefcase up onto the worktable and opened it he handed golliher a file then from his pocket he pulled the stack of photos he and edgar had borrowed from sheila delacroix i dont know if these help he said but this is the kid golliher picked up the photos he went through them quickly stopping at the posed closeup of arthur delacroix in a jacket and tie he went over to a chair where a backpack was slung over the armrest he pulled out his own file and came back to the worktable he opened the file and took out an photo of the skull from wonderland avenue for a long moment he held the photos of arthur delacroix and the skull side by side and studied them finally he said the malar and superciliary ridge formation look similar im not an anthropologist doc golliher put the photos down on the table he then explained by running his finger across the left eyebrow of the boy and then down around the outside of his eye the brow ridge and the exterior orbit he said its wider than usual on the recovered specimen looking at this photo of the boy we see his facial structure is in line with what we see here bosch nodded lets look at the xrays golliher said theres a box back here golliher gathered the files and led bosch to another worktable where there was a light box built into the surface he opened the hospital file picked up the xrays and began reading the patient history report bosch had already read the document the hospital reported that the boy was brought into the emergency room at pm on february by his father who said he was found in a dazed and unresponsive state following a fall from a skateboard in which he struck his head neurosurgery was performed in order to relieve pressure inside the skull caused by swelling of the brain the boy remained in the hospital under observation for ten days and was then released to his father two weeks later he was readmitted for followup surgery to remove the clips that had been used to hold his skull together following the neurosurgery there was no report anywhere in the file of the boy complaining about being mistreated by his father or anyone else while recovering from the initial surgery he was routinely interviewed by an onsite social worker her report was less than half a page it reported that the boy said he had hurt himself while skateboarding there was no followup questioning or referral to juvenile authorities or the police golliher shook his head while he finished his scan of the document what is it bosch asked its nothing and thats the problem no investigation they took the boy at his word his father was probably sitting right there in the room with him when he was interviewed you know how hard it would have been for him to tell the truth so they just patched him up and sent him right back to the person who was hurting him hey doc youre getting a little bit ahead of us lets get the id if its there and then well figure out who was hurting the kid fine its your case its just that ive seen this a hundred times golliher dropped the reports and picked up the xrays bosch watched him with a bemused smile on his face it seemed that golliher was annoyed because bosch had not jumped to the same conclusions he had with the same speed he had golliher put two xrays down on the light box he then went to his own file and brought out xrays he had taken of the wonderland skull he flipped the boxs light on and three xrays glowed before them golliher pointed to the xray he had taken from his own file this is a radiological xray i took to look inside the bone of the skull but we can use it here for comparison purposes tomorrow when i get back to the medical examiners office i will use the skull itself golliher leaned over the light box and reached for a small glass eyepiece that was stored on a nearby shelf he held one end to his eye and pressed the other against one of the xrays after a few moments he moved to one of the hospital xrays and pressed the eyepiece to the same location on the skull he went back and forth numerous times making comparison after comparison when he was finished golliher straightened up leaned back against the next worktable and folded his arms queen of angels was a governmentsubsidized hospital money was always tight they should have taken more than two pictures of this kids head if they had they might have seen some of his other injuries okay but they didnt yeah they didnt but based on what they did do and what weve got here i was able to make several comparison points on the roundel the fracture pattern and along the squamous suture there is no doubt in my mind he gestured toward the xrays still glowing on the light box meet arthur delacroix bosch nodded okay golliher stepped over to the light box and started collecting the xrays how sure are you like i said theres no doubt ill look at the skull tomorrow when im downtown but i can tell you now its him its a match so if we get somebody and go into court with it there arent going to be any surprises right golliher looked at bosch no surprises these findings cant be challenged as you know the challenge lies in the interpretation of the injuries i look at this boy and see something horribly horribly wrong and i will testify to that gladly but then you have these official records he gestured dismissively to the open file of hospital records they say skateboard thats where the fight will be bosch nodded golliher put the two xrays back into the file and closed it bosch put it back in his briefcase well doctor thanks for taking the time to see me here i think detective bosch yes the other day you seemed very uncomfortable when i mentioned the necessity of faith in what we do basically you changed the subject not really a subject i feel comfortable talking about i would think that in your line of work it would be paramount to have a healthy spirituality i dont know my partner likes blaming aliens from outer space for everything thats wrong i guess thats healthy too youre avoiding the question bosch grew annoyed and the feeling quickly slipped toward anger what is the question doc why do you care so much about me and what i believe or dont believe because it is important to me i study bones the framework of life and i have come to believe that there is something more than blood and tissue and bone there is something else that holds us together i have something inside that youll never see on any xray that holds me together and keeps me going and so when i meet someone who carries a void in the place where i carry my faith i get scared for him bosch looked at him for a long moment youre wrong about me i have faith and i have a mission call it blue religion call it whatever you like its the belief that this wont just go by that those bones came out of the ground for a reason that they came out of the ground for me to find and for me to do something about and thats what holds me together and keeps me going and it wont show up on any xray either okay he stared at golliher waiting for a reply but the anthropologist said nothing i gotta go doctor bosch finally said thanks for your help youve made things very clear for me he left him there surrounded by the dark bones the city had been built on chapter edgar was not at his spot at the homicide table when bosch got back to the squad room harry bosch looked up and saw lt billets standing in the doorway to her office through the glass window bosch could see edgar in there sitting in front of her desk bosch put his briefcase down and headed over whats up he said as he entered the office no thats my question billets said as she closed the door do we have an id she went around behind her desk and sat down as bosch took the seat next to edgar yes we have an id arthur delacroix disappeared may fourth nineteen eighty the me is sure of this their bone guy says there is no doubt how close are we on time of death pretty close the bone guy said before we knew anything that the fatal impact to the skull came about three months after the kid had the earlier skull fracture and surgery we got the records on that surgery today february eleven nineteen eighty at queen of angels you add three months and were almost right on the buttonarthur delacroix disappeared may fourth according to his sister the point is arthur delacroix was dead four years before nicholas trent moved into that neighborhood i think that puts him in the clear billets reluctantly nodded ive had irvings office and media relations on my ass all day about this she said theyre not going to like it when i call them back with this thats too bad bosch said thats the way the case shakes out okay so trent wasnt in the neighborhood in nineteen eighty do we have anything yet on where he was bosch blew out his breath and shook his head youre not going to let this go are you we need to concentrate on the kid im not letting go because theyre not irving called me himself this morning he was very clear without having to say the words if it turns out an innocent man killed himself because a cop leaked information to the media that held him up to public ridicule then its one more black eye for the department havent we had enough humiliation in the last ten years bosch smiled without a hint of humor you sound just like him lieutenant thats really good it was the wrong thing to say he could see that it hurt her yeah well maybe i sound like him because i agree with him for once this department has had nothing but scandal after scandal like most of the decent cops around here i for one am sick of it good so am i but the solution is not to bend things to fit our needs this is a homicide case i know that harry im not saying bend anything im saying we have to be sure were sure im sure they were silent for a long moment everyones eyes avoiding the others what about kiz edgar finally asked bosch sneered irving wont do a thing to kiz he said he knows it will make him look even worse if he touches her besides shes probably the best cop they got down there on the third floor youre always so sure harry billets said it must be nice well im sure about this he stood up and id like to get back to it weve got stuff happening i know all about it jerry was just telling me but sit down and lets get back to this for one minute okay bosch sat back down i cant just talk to irving the way i let you talk to me billets said this is what i am going to do i am going to update him on the id and everything else i am going to say you are pursuing the case as is i will then invite him to assign iad to the background investigation of trent in other words if he remains unconvinced by the circumstances of the id then he can have iad or whoever he can find run the background on trent to see where he was in nineteen eighty bosch just looked at her giving no indication of approval or disapproval of her plan can we go now yes you can go when they got back to the homicide table and sat down edgar asked bosch why he hadnt mentioned the theory that maybe trent moved into the neighborhood because he knew the bones were up on the hillside because your sick fuck theory is too farfetched to go beyond this table for the time being if that gets to irving next thing you know its in a press release and is the official line now did you get anything on the box or not yeah i got stuff what first of all i confirmed samuel delacroixs address at the manchester trailer park so hes there when we want to go see him in the last ten years hes had two duis he drives on a restricted license at the moment i also ran his social and came up with a hithe works for the city boschs face showed his surprise doing what he works parttime at a driving range at the municipal golf course right next to the trailer park i made a call to parks and recsdiscreetly delacroix drives the cart that collects all the balls you know out on the range the guy everybody tries to hit when hes out there i guess he comes over from the trailer park and does it a couple times a day okay next christine dorsett delacroix the name of the mother on sheilas birth certificate i ran her social and got her now listed as a christine dorsett waters address is in palm springs mustve gone there to reinvent herself new name new life whatever bosch nodded you pull the divorce got it she filed on samuel delacroix in seventythree the boy wouldve been about five at the time cited mental and physical abuse details of what that abuse consisted of were not included it never went to trial so the details never came out he didnt contest it it looks like a deal was made he got custody of the two kids and didnt contest nice and clean the files about twelve pages thick ive seen some that are twelve inches my own for example if arthur was five some of those injuries predate that according to the anthropologist edgar shook his head the extract says the marriage had ended three years prior and they were living separately so it looks like she split when the boy was about twolike sheila said harry you usually dont refer to the vic by name yeah so just pointing it out thank you anything else in the file thats about it i got copies if you want it okay what about the skateboard friend got him too still alive still local but theres a problem i ran all the usual data banks and came up with three john stokes in la that fall into the right age range two are in the valley both clean the thirds a player multiple arrests for petty theft auto theft burglary and possession going back to a full juvy jacket five years ago he finally ran out of second chances and got sent to corcoran to iron out a nickel did two and a half to parole you talk to his agent is stokes still on the line talked to his agent yes no stokes isnt on the hook he cleared parole two months ago the agent doesnt know where he is damn yeah but i got him to pull a look at the client bio it has stokes growing up mostly in midwilshire in and out of foster homes in and out of trouble hes gotta be our guy the agent think hes still in la yeah he thinks so we just gotta find him i already had patrol go by his last knownhe moved out of there as soon as he cleared parole so hes in the wind beautiful edgar nodded we have to put him on the box bosch said start with did it edgar said i also typed up a rollcall notice and gave it to mankiewicz a while ago he promised to get it read at all calls im having a batch of visor photos made too good bosch was impressed getting photos of stokes to clip to the sun visors of every patrol car was the sort of extra step edgar usually didnt bother to make well get him harry im not sure what good hell do us but well get him he could be a key witness if arthuri mean the vicever told him his father was beating him then weve got something bosch looked at his watch it was almost two he wanted to keep things moving keep the investigation focused and urgent for him the most difficult time was waiting whether it was for lab results or other cops to make moves it was always when he became most agitated what do you have going tonight he asked edgar tonight nothing much you got your kid tonight no thursdays why im thinking about going out to the springs now yeah talk to the exwife he saw edgar check his watch he knew that even if they left that moment they still wouldnt get back until late its all right i can go by myself just give me the address nah im going with you you sure you dont have to i just dont like waitin around for something to happen you know yeah harry i know edgar stood up and took his jacket off the back of his chair then ill go tell bullets bosch said chapter they were more than halfway across the desert to palm springs before either one of them spoke harry edgar said youre not talking i know bosch said the one thing they had always had as partners was the ability to share long silences whenever edgar felt the need to break the silence bosch knew there was something on his mind he wanted to talk about what is it j edgar nothing the case no man nothing im cool all right then they were passing a windmill farm the air was dead none of the blades were turning did your parents stay together bosch asked yeah all the way edgar said then he laughed i think they wished sometimes they didnt but yeah they stuck it out thats how it goes i guess the strong survive bosch nodded they were both divorced but rarely talked about their failed marriages harry i heard about you and the boot its getting around bosch nodded this is what edgar had wanted to bring up rookies in the department were often called boots the origin of the term was obscure one school of thought was that it referred to boot camp another that it was a sarcastic reference to rookies being the new boots of the fascist empire all im saying man is be careful with that you got rank on her okay yeah i know ill figure something out from what i hear and have seen shes worth the risk but you still gotta be careful bosch didnt say anything after a few minutes they passed a road sign that said palm springs was coming up in nine miles it was nearing dusk bosch was hoping to knock on the door where christine waters lived before it got dark harry you going to take the lead on this when we get there yeah ill take it you can be the indignant one that will be easy once they crossed the city boundary into palm springs they picked up a map at a gas station and made their way through the town until they found frank sinatra boulevard and took it up toward the mountains bosch pulled the car up to the gate house of a place called mountaingate estates their map showed the street christine waters lived on was within mountaingate a uniformed rentacop stepped out of the gate house eying the slickback they were in and smiling you guys are a little ways off the beat he said bosch nodded and tried to give a pleasant smile but it only made him look like he had something sour in his mouth something like that he said whats up were going to talk to christine waters threetwelve deep waters drive mrs waters know youre coming not unless shes a psychic or you tell her thats my job hold on a second he returned to the gate house and bosch saw him pick up a phone looks like christine delacroix seriously traded up edgar said he was looking through the windshield at some of the homes that were visible from their position they were all huge with manicured lawns big enough to play touch football on the guard came out put both hands on the window sill of the car and leaned down to look in at bosch she wants to know what its about tell her well discuss it with her at her house privately tell her we have a court order the guard shrugged his shoulders in a haveityourway gesture and went back inside bosch watched him speaking on the phone for a few more moments after he hung up the gate started to open slowly the guard stood in the open doorway and waved them in but not without the last word you know that toughguy stuff probably works real well for you in la out here in the desert its just bosch didnt hear the rest he drove through the gate while putting the window up they found deep waters drive at the far extreme of the development the homes here looked to be a couple million dollars more opulent than those built near the entrance to mountaingate who would name a street in the desert deep waters drive edgar mused maybe somebody named waters it dawned on edgar then damn you think then she really has traded up the address edgar came up with for christine waters corresponded with a mansion of contemporary spanish design that sat at the end of a culdesac at the terminus of mountaingate estates it was most definitely the developments premier lot the house was positioned on a promontory that afforded it a view of all the other homes in the development as well as a sweeping view of the golf course that surrounded it the property had its own gated drive but the gate was open bosch wondered if it always stood open or had been opened for them this is going to be interesting edgar said as they pulled into a parking circle made of interlocking paving stones just remember bosch said people can change their addresses but they cant change who they are right homicide oneohone they got out and walked under the portico that led to the doublewide front door it was opened before they got to it by a woman in a blackandwhite maids uniform in a thick spanish accent the woman told them that mrs waters was waiting in the living room the living room was the size and had the feel of a small cathedral with a twentyfivefoot ceiling with exposed roof beams high on the wall facing the east were three large stainedglass windows a triptych depicting a sunrise a garden and a moonrise the opposite wall had six sidebyside sliding doors with a view of a golf course putting green the room had two distinct groupings of furniture as if to accommodate two separate gatherings at the same time sitting in the middle of a creamcolored couch in the first grouping was a woman with blonde hair and a tight face her pale blue eyes followed the men as they entered and took in the size of the room mrs waters bosch said i am detective bosch and this is detective edgar were from the los angeles police department he held out his hand and she took it but didnt shake it she just held it for a moment and then moved on to edgars outstretched hand bosch knew from the birth certificate that she was fiftysix years old but she looked close to a decade younger her smooth tan face a testament to the wonders of modern medical science please have a seat she said i cant tell you how embarrassed i am to have that car sitting in front of my house i guess discretion is not the better part of valor when it comes to the lapd bosch smiled well mrs waters were kind of embarrassed about it too but thats what the bosses tell us to drive so thats what we drive what is this about the guard at the gate said you have a court order may i see it bosch sat down on a couch directly opposite her and across a black coffee table with gold designs inlaid on it uh he must have misunderstood me he said i told him we could get a court order if you refused to see us im sure he did she replied the tone of her voice letting them know she didnt believe bosch at all what do you want to see me about we need to ask you about your husband my husband has been dead for five years besides that he rarely went to los angeles what could he possibly your first husband mrs waters samuel delacroix we need to talk to you about your children as well bosch saw a wariness immediately enter her eyes i i havent seen or spoken to them in years almost thirty years you mean since you went out for medicine for the boy and forgot to come back home edgar asked the woman looked at him as though he had slapped her bosch had hoped edgar was going to use a little more finesse when he acted indignant with her who told you that mrs waters bosch said i want to ask questions first and then we can get to yours i dont understand this how did you find me what are you doing why are you here her voice rose with emotion from question to question a life she had put aside thirty years before was suddenly intruding into the carefully ordered life she now had we are homicide investigators maam we are working on a case that may involve your husband we hes not my husband i divorced him twentyfive years ago at least this is crazy you coming here to ask about a man i dont even know anymore that i didnt even know was still alive i think you should leave i want you to leave she stood up and extended her hand in the direction they had come in bosch glanced at edgar and then back at the woman her anger had turned the tan on her sculptured face uneven there were blotches beginning to form the tell of plastic surgery mrs waters sit down bosch said sternly please try to relax relax do you know who i am my husband built this place the houses the golf course everything you cant just come in here like this i could pick up the phone and have the chief of police on the line in two your son is dead lady edgar snapped the one you left behind thirty years ago so sit down and let us ask you our questions she dropped back onto the couch as if her feet had been kicked out from beneath her her mouth opened and then closed her eyes were no longer on them they were on some distant memory arthur thats right edgar said arthur glad you at least remember it they watched her in silence for a few moments all the years and all the distance wasnt enough she was hurt by the news hurt bad bosch had seen it before the past had a way of coming back up out of the ground always right below your feet bosch took his notebook out of his pocket and opened it to a blank page he wrote cool it on it and handed the notebook to edgar jerry why dont you take some notes i think mrs waters wants to cooperate with us his speaking drew christine waters out of her blue reverie she looked at bosch what happened was it sam we dont know thats why were here arthur has been dead a long time his remains were found just last week she slowly brought one of her hands to her mouth in a fist she lightly started bumping it against her lips how long he had been buried for twenty years it was a call from your daughter that helped us identify him sheila it was as if she had not spoken the name in so long she had to try it out to see if it still worked mrs waters arthur disappeared in nineteen eighty did you know about that she shook her head i was gone i left almost ten years before that and you had no contact with your family at all i thought she didnt finish bosch waited mrs waters i couldnt take them with me i was young and couldnt handle the responsibility i ran away i admit that i ran away i thought that it would be best for them to not hear from me to not even know about me bosch nodded in a way he hoped conveyed that he understood and agreed with her thinking at the time it didnt matter that he did not it didnt matter that his own mother had faced the same hardship of having a child too soon and under difficult circumstances but had clung to and protected him with a fierceness that inspired his life you wrote them letters before you left your children i mean how did you know that sheila told us what did you say in the letter to arthur i just i just told him i loved him and id always think about him but i couldnt be with him i cant really remember everything i said is it important bosch shrugged his shoulders i dont know your son had a letter with him it might have been the one from you its deteriorated we probably wont ever know in the divorce petition you filed a few years after leaving home you cited physical abuse as a cause of action i need you to tell us about that what was the physical abuse she shook her head again this time in a dismissive way as if the question was annoying or stupid what do you think sam liked to bat me around hed get drunk and it was like walking on eggshells anything could set him off the baby crying sheila talking too loud and i was always the target he would hit you yes he would hit me hed become a monster it was one of the reasons i had to leave but you left the kids with the monster edgar said this time she didnt react as if struck she fixed her pale eyes on edgar with a deathly look that made edgar turn his indignant eyes away she spoke very calmly to him who are you to judge anyone i had to survive and i could not take them with me if i had tried none of us would have survived im sure they understood that edgar said the woman stood up again i dont think i am going to talk to you anymore im sure you can find your way out she headed toward the arched doorway at the far end of the room mrs waters bosch said if you dont talk to us now we will go get that court order fine she said without looking back do it ill have one of my attorneys handle it and it will become public record at the courthouse in town it was a gamble but bosch thought it might stop her he guessed that her life in palm springs was built squarely atop her secrets and that she wouldnt want anybody going down into the basement the social gossips might like edgar have a hard time viewing her actions and motives the way she did deep inside she had a hard time herself even after so many years she stopped under the archway composed herself and came back to the couch looking at bosch she said i will only talk to you i want him to leave bosch shook his head hes my partner its our case he stays mrs waters i will still answer questions from you only fine please sit down she did so this time sitting on the side of the couch farthest from edgar and closest to bosch i know you want to help us find your sons killer well try to be as fast as we can here she nodded once just tell us about your exhusband the whole sordid story she asked rhetorically ill give you the short version i met him in an acting class i was eighteen he was seven years older had already done some film work and to top it off was very very handsome you could say i quickly fell under his spell and i was pregnant before i was nineteen bosch checked edgar to see if he was writing any of this down edgar caught the look and started writing we got married and sheila was born i didnt pursue a career i have to admit i wasnt that dedicated acting just seemed like something to do at the time i had the looks but soon i found out every girl in hollywood had the looks i was happy to stay at home how did your husband do at it at first very well he got a recurring role on first infantry did you ever watch it bosch nodded it was a world war ii television drama that ran in the mid to late sixties until public sentiment over the vietnam war and war in general led to declining ratings and it was cancelled the show followed an army platoon as it moved behind german lines each week bosch had liked the show as a kid and always tried to watch it whether he was in a foster home or the youth hall sam was one of the germans his blond hair and aryan looks he was on it the last two years right up until i got pregnant with arthur she let some silence punctuate that then the show got cancelled because of that stupid war in vietnam it got cancelled and sam had trouble finding work he was typecast as this german he really started drinking then and hitting me hed spend his days going to casting calls and getting nothing hed then spend his nights drinking and being angry at me why you because i was the one who had gotten pregnant first with sheila and then with arthur neither was planned and it all added up to too much pressure on him he took it out on whoever was close he assaulted you assaulted it sounds so clinical but yes he assaulted me many times did you ever see him strike the children it was the key question they had come to ask everything else was window dressing not specifically she said when i was carrying arthur he hit me once in the stomach it broke my water i went into labor about six weeks before my due date arthur didnt even weigh five pounds when he was born bosch waited she was talking in a way that hinted she would say more as long as he gave her the space he looked out through the sliding door behind her at the golf course there was a deep sand trap guarding a putting green a man in a red shirt and plaid pants was in the trap flailing with a club at an unseen ball sprays of sand were flying up out of the trap onto the green but no ball in the distance three other golfers were getting out of two carts parked on the other side of the green the lip of the sand trap shielded them from view of the man in the red shirt as bosch watched the man checked up and down the fairway for witnesses then reached down and grabbed his ball he threw it up onto the green giving it the nice arc of a perfectly hit shot he then climbed out of the trap holding his club with both hands still locked in their grip a posture that suggested he had just hit the ball finally christine waters began to talk again and bosch looked back at her arthur only weighed five pounds when he was born he was small right up through that first year and very sickly we never talked about it but i think we both knew that what sam had done had hurt that boy he just wasnt right aside from that incident when he struck you you never saw him strike arthur or sheila he might have spanked sheila i dont really remember he never hit the children i mean he had me there to hit bosch nodded the unspoken conclusion being that once she was gone who knows who became the target bosch thought of the bones laid out on the autopsy table and all the injuries dr golliher had catalogued is my husis sam under arrest bosch looked at her no were in the factfinding stage here the indication from your sons remains is that there is a history of chronic physical abuse were just trying to figure things out and sheila was she we havent specifically asked her we will mrs waters when you were struck by your husband was it always with his hand sometimes he would hit me with things a shoe once i remember he held me on the floor and hit me with it and once he threw his briefcase at me it hit me in the side she shook her head what nothing just that briefcase he carried it with him to all his auditions like he was so important and had so much going on and all he ever had in it were a few head shots and a flask bitterness burned in her voice even after so many years did you ever go to a hospital or an emergency room is there any physical record of the abuse she shook her head he never hurt me enough that i had to go except when i had arthur and then i lied i said i fell and my water broke you see detective it wasnt something i wanted the world to know about bosch nodded when you left was that planned or did you just go she didnt answer for a long moment as she watched the memory first on her inside screen i wrote the letters to my children long before i left i carried them in my purse and waited for the right time on the night i left i put them under their pillows and left with my purse and only the clothes i was wearing and my car that my father had given us when we got married that was it id had enough i told him we needed medicine for arthur he had been drinking he told me to go out and get it and you never went back never about a year later before i came out to the springs i drove by the house at night saw the lights on i didnt stop bosch nodded he couldnt think of anything else to ask while the womans memory of that early time in her life was good what she was remembering wasnt going to help make a case against her exhusband for a murder committed ten years after she had last seen him maybe bosch had known that all alongthat she wouldnt be a vital part of the case maybe he had just wanted to take the measure of a woman who had abandoned her children leaving them with a man she believed was a monster what does she look like bosch was momentarily taken aback by her question my daughter um shes blonde like you a little taller heavier no children not married when will arthur be buried i dont know you would have to call the medical examiners office or you could probably check with sheila to see if he stopped he couldnt get involved in mending the thirtyyear gaps in peoples lives i think were finished here mrs waters we appreciate your cooperation definitely edgar said the sarcasm in his tone making its mark you came all this way to ask so few questions i think thats because you have so few answers edgar said they walked to the door and she followed a few paces behind outside under the portico bosch looked back at the woman standing in the open doorway they held each others eyes for a moment he tried to think of something to say but he had nothing for her she closed the door chapter they pulled into the station lot shortly before eleven it had been a sixteenhour day that had netted very little in terms of evidence that could carry a case toward prosecution still bosch was satisfied they had the identification and that was the center of the wheel all things would come from that edgar said good night and went straight to his car without going inside the station bosch wanted to check with the watch sergeant to see if anything had come up with johnny stokes he also wanted to check for messages and knew that if he hung around until eleven he might see julia brasher when she got off shift he wanted to talk to her the station was quiet the midnight shift cops were up in roll call the incoming and outgoing watch sergeants would be up there as well bosch went down the hallway to the detective bureau the lights were out which was in violation of an order from the office of the chief of police the chief had mandated that the lights in parker center and every division station should never be off his goal was to let the public know that the fight against crime never slept the result was that the lights glowed brightly every night in empty police offices across the city bosch flicked on the row of lights over the homicide table and went to his spot there were a number of pink phone message slips and he looked through these but all were from reporters or related to other cases he had pending he tossed the reporters messages in the trash can and put the others in his top drawer to follow up on the next day there were two department dispatch envelopes waiting on the desk for him the first contained gollihers report and bosch put it aside for reading later he picked up the second envelope and saw it was from sid he realized he had forgotten to call antoine jesper about the skateboard he was about to open the envelope when he noticed it had been dropped on top of a folded piece of paper on his calendar blotter he unfolded it and read the short message he knew it was from julia though she had not signed it where are you tough guy he had forgotten that he had told her to come by the squad room before she started her shift he smiled at the note but felt bad about forgetting he also thought once more about edgars admonishment to be careful with the relationship he refolded the page and put it in his drawer he wondered how julia would react to what he wanted to talk about he was dead tired from the long hours but didnt want to wait until the next day the dispatch envelope from sid contained a onepage evidence analysis report from jesper bosch read the report quickly jesper had confirmed that the board was made by boneyard boards inc a huntington beach manufacturer the model was called a boney board the particular model at hand was made from february until june when design variations created a slight change in the boards nose before bosch could get excited by the implications of a match between the board and the time frame of the case he read the last paragraph of the report which put any match in doubt the trucks wheel assemblies are of a design first implemented by boneyard in may the graphite wheels also indicate a later manufacture graphite wheels did not become commonplace in the industry until the mids however because trucks and wheels are interchangeable and often are traded out or replaced by boarders it is impossible to determine the exact date of manufacture of the skateboard in evidence best estimate pending additional evidence is manufacture between february and june bosch slid the report back into the dispatch envelope and dropped it on the desk the report was inconclusive but to bosch the factors jesper had outlined leaned toward the skateboard not having been arthur delacroixs in his mind the report tilted toward clearing rather than implicating nicholas trent in the boys death in the morning he would type up a report with his conclusions and give it to lt billets to send up the chain to deputy chief irvings office as if to punctuate the end of this line of investigation the sound of the back door to the station banging open echoed down the hallway several loud male voices followed all heading out into the night roll call was over and fresh troops were taking the field their voices full of usversusthem bravado the police chiefs wishes notwithstanding bosch flicked off the light and headed back down the hallway to the watch office there were two sergeants in the small office lenkov was going off duty while renshaw was just starting her shift they both registered surprise at boschs appearance so late at night but then didnt ask him what he was doing in the station so bosch said anything on my guy johnny stokes nothing yet lenkov said but were looking were putting it out at all roll calls and weve got the pictures in the cars now so youll let me know well let you know renshaw nodded her agreement bosch thought about asking if julia brasher had come in to end her shift yet but thought better of it he thanked them and stepped back into the hallway the conversation had felt odd like they couldnt wait for him to get out of there he sensed it was because of the word getting around about him and julia maybe they knew she was coming off of shift and wanted to avoid seeing them together as supervisors they would then be witnesses to what was an infraction of department policy as minor and rarely enforced as the rule was things would be better all the way around if they didnt see the infraction and then have to look the other way bosch walked out the back door and into the parking lot he had no idea whether julia was in the station locker room still out on patrol or had come and gone already midshifts were fluid you didnt come in until the watch sergeant sent your replacement out he found her car in the parking lot and knew he hadnt missed her he walked back toward the station to sit down on the code bench but when he got to it julia was already sitting there her hair was slightly wet from the locker room shower she wore faded blue jeans and a longsleeved pullover with a high neck i heard you were in the house she said i checked and saw the light out and thought maybe id missed you just dont tell the chief about the lights she smiled and bosch sat down next to her he wanted to touch her but didnt or us he said she nodded yeah a lot of people know dont they yeah i wanted to talk to you about that can you get a drink sure lets walk over to the cat and fiddle im tired of driving today rather than walk through the station together and out the front door they took the long way through the parking lot and around the station they walked two blocks up to sunset and then another two down to the pub along the way bosch apologized for missing her in the squad room before her shift and explained he had driven to palm springs she was very quiet as they walked mostly just nodding her head at his explanations they didnt talk about the issue at hand until they reached the pub and slid into one of the booths by the fireplace they both ordered pints of guinness and then julia folded her arms on the table and fixed bosch with a hard stare okay harry ive got my drink coming you can give it to me but i have to warn you if you are going to say you want to just be friends well i already have enough friends bosch couldnt help but break into a broad smile he loved her boldness her directness he started shaking his head nah i dont want to be your friend julia not at all he reached across the table and squeezed her forearm instinctively he glanced around the pub to make sure no one from the cop shop had wandered over for an aftershift drink he didnt recognize anyone and looked back at julia what i want is to be with you just like weve been good so do i but we have to be careful you havent been around the department long enough i have and i know how things get around and so its my fault we shouldve never left your car in the station lot that first night oh fuck em if they cant take a joke no its he waited while the barmaid put their beers down on little paper coasters with the guinness seal on them its not like that julia he said when they were alone again if were going to keep going we need to be more careful we have to go underground no more meeting at the bench no more notes no more anything like that we cant even go here anymore because cops come here we have to be totally underground we meet outside the division we talk outside the division you make it sound like were a couple of spies or something bosch picked up his glass clicked it off hers and drank deeply from it it tasted so good after such a long day he immediately had to stifle a yawn which julia caught and repeated spies thats not too far off you forget ive been in this department more than twentyfive years youre just a boot a baby ive got more enemies inside the wire than youve got arrests under your belt some of these people would take any opportunity to put me down if they could it sounds like im just worrying about myself here but the thing is if they need to go after a rookie to get to me theyll do it in a heartbeat i mean that a heartbeat she turtled her head down and looked both ways okay harryi mean secret agent doubleohfortyfive bosch smiled and shook his head yeah yeah you think its all a joke wait until you get your first iad jacket then youll see the light come on i dont think its a joke im just having fun they both drank from their beers and bosch leaned back and tried to relax the heat from the fireplace felt good the walk over had been brisk he looked at julia and she was smiling like she knew a secret about him what nothing you just get so worked up im trying to protect you thats all im plustwentyfive so it doesnt matter as much to me what does that mean ive heard people say thatplustwentyfivelike theyre untouchable or something bosch shook his head nobodys untouchable but after you hit twentyfive years in you top out on the pension scale so it doesnt matter if you quit at twentyfive years or thirtyfive years you get the same pension so plustwentyfive means you have some fuckyou room you dont like what theyre doing to you you can always pull the pin and say have a nice day because youre not in it for the check and the bennies anymore the waitress came back to the table and put down a basket of popcorn julia let some time go by and then leaned across the table her chin almost over the mouth of her pint then what are you in it for bosch shrugged his shoulders and looked down at his glass the job i guess nothing big nothing heroic just the chance to maybe make things right every now and then in a fuckedup world he used his thumb to draw patterns on the frosted glass he continued speaking without taking his eyes off the glass this case for example what about it if we can just figure it out and put it together we can maybe make up a little bit for what happened to that kid i dont know i think it might mean something something really small to the world he thought about the skull golliher had held up to him that morning a murder victim buried in tar for years a city of bones and all of them waiting to come up out of the ground for what maybe nobody cares anymore i dont know he said maybe it doesnt mean anything in the long run suicide terrorists hit new york and three thousand people are dead before theyve finished their first cup of coffee what does one little set of bones buried in the past matter she smiled sweetly and shook her head dont go existential on me harry the important thing is that it means something to you and if it means something to you then it is important to do what you can no matter what happens in the world there will always be the need for heroes i hope someday i get a chance to be one maybe he nodded and kept his eyes from hers he played some more with his glass do you remember that commercial that used to be on tv where theres this old lady whos on the ground or something and she says ive fallen and i cant get up and everybody used to make fun of it i remember they sell tshirts that say that on venice beach yeah well sometimes i feel like that i mean plus twentyfive you cant go the distance without screwing up from time to time you fall down julia and sometimes you feel like you cant get up he nodded to himself but then you get lucky and a case comes along and you say to yourself this is the one you just feel it this is the one i can get back up with its called redemption harry whats that song say everybody wants a shot at it something like that yeah and maybe this case is your shot yeah i think it is i hope so then heres to redemption she picked up her glass for a toast hold fast he said she banged it off of his some of her beer sloshed into his almost empty glass sorry i need to practice that its okay i needed a refill he raised his glass and drained it he put it back down and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand so are you coming home with me tonight he asked she shook her head no not with you he frowned and started to wonder if his directness had offended her im following you home tonight she said remember cant leave the car at the division everythings got to be top secret hushhush eyes only from now on he smiled the beer and her smile were like magic on him you got me there i hope in more ways than one chapter bosch came in late to the meeting in lt billetss office edgar was already there a rarity as well as medina from media relations billets pointed him to a seat with a pencil she was holding then picked up her phone and punched in a number this is lieutenant billets she said when her call was answered you can tell chief irving that we are all here now and ready to begin bosch looked at edgar and raised his eyebrows the deputy chief was still keeping his hand directly in the case billets hung up and said hes going to call back and ill put him on the speaker to listen or to tell bosch asked who knows while were waiting medina said ive started getting a few calls about a bolo you guys put out a man named john stokes how do you want me to handle that is he a new suspect bosch was annoyed he knew the be on the lookout flier distributed at roll calls would eventually leak to the media he didnt anticipate it happening so quickly no hes not a suspect at all he said to medina and if the reporters screw that up like they did trent well never find him hes just somebody we want to talk to he was an acquaintance of the victim many years ago then you have the victims id before bosch could answer the phone buzzed billets answered and put deputy chief irving on the speaker chief we have detectives bosch and edgar here along with officer medina from media relations very good irvings voice boomed from the phones speaker where are we at billets started tapping a button on the phone to turn down the volume uh harry why dont you take that she said bosch reached into his inside coat pocket and took out his notebook he took his time about it he liked the idea of irving sitting behind his spotless glass desk in his office at parker center waiting for voices over the phone he opened the notebook to a page full of jottings he had made that morning while eating breakfast with julia detective are you there irving said uh yes sir im right here i was just going through some notes here um the main thing is we have made a positive identification of the victim his name is arthur delacroix he disappeared from his home in the miracle mile area on may fourth nineteen eighty he was twelve years old he stopped there anticipating questions he noticed that medina was writing the name down im not sure we want to put that out yet bosch said why is that irving asked are you saying the identification is not positive no were positive on it chief its just that if we put the name out we might be telegraphing which way were moving here which is well we are very confident that nicholas trent was clear on this so we are looking elsewhere the autopsythe injuries to the bonesindicate chronic child abuse dating to early childhood the mother was out of the picture so we are looking at the father now we havent approached him yet were gathering string if we were to announce that we have an id and the father saw it we would be putting him on notice before we need to if he buried the kid there then he already is on notice to a degree but he knows if we cant come up with a legit id well never link it to him the lack of an id is what keeps him safe and it gives us time to look at him understood irving said they sat in silence for a few moments bosch expecting irving to say something else but he didnt bosch looked at billets and spread his hands in a whatgives gesture she shrugged her shoulders so then bosch began were not putting it out right silence then i think that is the prudent course to follow irving said medina tore the page he had written on out of his notebook crumpled it and tossed it into a trash can in the corner is there anything we can put out he asked yes bosch said quickly we can clear trent negative irving said just as quickly we do that at the end when and if you make a case then we will clean up the rest bosch looked at edgar and then at billets chief he said if we do it that way we could be hurting our case how so its an old case the older the case the longer the shot we cant take chances if we dont go out there and tell them trent is clear well be giving the guy we eventually take down a defense hell be able to point at trent and say he was a child molester he did it but he will be able to do that whether we clear trent now or later bosch nodded true but i am looking at it from the standpoint of testifying at trial i want to be able to say we checked trent out and quickly dismissed him i dont want some lawyer asking me why if we so quickly dismissed him we waited a week or two weeks to announce it chief it will look like we were hiding something its going to be subtle but it will have an impact people on juries look for any reason not to trust cops in general and the lapd in par okay detective you have made your point my decision still stands there will be no announcement on trent not at this time not until we have a solid suspect we can come forward with bosch shook his head and slumped a bit in his seat what else irving said i have a briefing with the chief in two minutes bosch looked at billets and shook his head again he had nothing else he wanted to share billets spoke up chief at this time i think thats pretty much where we stand when do you plan to approach the father detectives bosch poked his chin at edgar uh chief detective edgar here we are still looking for a witness that could be important to talk to before approaching the father that would be a boyhood friend of the victim were thinking he might have knowledge of the abuse the boy suffered were planning to give it the day we believe hes here in hollywood and we have a lot of eyes out there on the yes that is fine detective we will reconvene this conversation tomorrow morning yes chief billets said at ninethirty again there was no answer irving was already gone chapter bosch and edgar spent the rest of the morning updating reports and the murder book and calling hospitals all over the city to cancel the records searches they had requested by warrant on monday morning but by noon bosch had had enough of the office work and said he had to get out of the station where you want to go edgar asked im tired of waiting around bosch said lets go take a look at him they used edgars personal car because it was unmarked and there were no undercover units left in the motor pool they took the up into the valley and then the north before exiting in van nuys the manchester trailer park was on sepulveda near victory they drove by it once before coming back and driving in there was no gate house just a yellowstriped speed bump the park road circled the property and sam delacroixs trailer was at the rear of the tract where it bumped up against a twentyfoothigh soundretention wall next to the freeway the wall was designed to knock down the nonstop roar of the freeway all it did was redirect and change its tone but it was still there the trailer was a singlewide with rust stains dripping down the aluminum skin from most of the steel rivet seams there was an awning with a picnic table and a charcoal grill beneath it a clothesline ran from one of the awnings support poles to a corner of the next trailer in line near the back of the narrow yard an aluminum storage shed about the size of an outhouse was pushed up against the sound wall the windows and door of the trailer were closed there was no vehicle in the lone parking spot edgar kept the car going by at an even five miles an hour looks like nobodys home lets try the driving range bosch said if hes over there maybe you can hit a bucket of balls or something always like to practice the range had few customers when they got there but it looked like it had been a busy morning golf balls littered the entire range which was three hundred yards deep extending to the same sound wall that backed the trailer park at the far end of the property netting was erected on high utility poles to protect the freeway drivers from long balls a small tractor with ball harvesters attached at the rear was slowly traversing the far end of the range its driver secured in a safety cage bosch watched for a few moments alone until edgar came up with a half bucket of balls and his golf bag which had been in the trunk of his car i guess thats him edgar said yeah bosch went over to a bench and sat down to watch his partner hit some balls from a little square of rubber grass edgar had taken off his tie and jacket he didnt look that much out of place hitting balls a few green squares down from him were two men wearing suit pants and buttondown shirts obviously using their lunch break from the office to finetune their game edgar propped his bag on a wooden stand and chose one of the irons he put on a glove which he had taken from the bag took a few warmup swings and then started striking balls the first few were grounders that made him curse then he started getting some air underneath them and he seemed pleased with himself bosch was amused he had never played golf a single time in his life and couldnt understand the draw it had for many menin fact most of the detectives in the squad room played religiously and there was a whole network of police tournaments around the state he enjoyed watching edgar get worked up even though hitting range balls didnt count take a shot at him he instructed after he thought edgar was fully warmed up and ready harry edgar said i know you dont play but i got news for you in golf you hit the ball at the pinthe flag no moving targets in golf then how come the expresidents are always hitting people because theyre allowed to come on you said everybody tries to hit the guy in the tractor take a shot everybody but the serious golfers but he angled his body so that bosch could tell he was going to take a shot at the tractor as it came to the end of a crossing and was making the uturn to go back the other way judging by the yardage markers the tractor was a hundred forty yards out edgar swung but the ball was another grounder dammit see harry this could hurt my game bosch started laughing what are you laughing at its just a game man take another shot forget it its childish take the shot edgar didnt say anything he angled his body again taking aim at the tractor which was now in the middle of the range he swung and hit the ball sending it screaming down the middle but a good twenty feet over the tractor nice shot bosch said unless you were aiming for the tractor edgar gave him a look but didnt say anything for the next five minutes he hit ball after ball at the range tractor but never came closer to it than ten yards bosch never said anything but edgars frustrations increased until he turned and angrily said you want to try bosch feigned confusion oh youre still trying to hit him i didnt realize come on lets go you still have half your balls there i dont care this will set my game back a month thats all edgar angrily shoved the club he had been using into his bag and gave bosch his deadeye look it was all bosch could do not to burst into laughter come on jerry i want to get a look at the guy cant you hit a few more it looks like hes gotta be done soon edgar looked out at the range the tractor was now near the fiftyyard markers assuming he had started back at the sound wall he would be finished soon there werent enough new balls out therejust edgars and the two business guysto warrant going back over the entire range edgar silently relented he took out one of his woods and went back to the green square of fake grass he hit a beautiful shot that almost carried to the sound wall tiger woods kiss my ass he said the next shot he put into the real grass ten feet from the tee shit when you play for real do you hit off that fake grass no harry you dont this is practice oh so in practice you dont recreate the actual playing situation something like that the tractor pulled off the range and up to a shed behind the concession stand where edgar had paid for his bucket of balls the cage door opened and a man in his early sixties got out he started pulling wiremesh baskets full of balls out of the harvester and carrying them into the shed bosch told edgar to keep hitting balls so that they wouldnt be obvious bosch nonchalantly walked toward the concession stand and bought another half bucket of balls this put him no more than twenty feet from the man who had been driving the tractor it was samuel delacroix bosch recognized him from a drivers license photo edgar had pulled and shown him the man who once played a blond blueeyed aryan soldier and had put a spell on an eighteenyearold girl was now about as distinguished as a ham sandwich he was still blond but it obviously came from a bottle and he was bald to the crown of his head he had dayold whiskers that shone white in the sun his nose was swollen by time and alcohol and pinched by a pair of illfitting glasses he carried a beer paunch that wouldve been a ticket to a discharge in anybodys army twofifty bosch looked at the woman behind the cash register for the balls right he paid her and picked up the bucket by the handle he took a last glance at delacroix who suddenly looked over at bosch at the same time their eyes locked for a moment and bosch casually looked away he headed back toward edgar that was when his cell phone started to chirp he quickly handed the bucket to edgar and pulled the phone out of his back pocket it was mankiewicz the dayshift watch sergeant hey bosch what are you doing just hitting some balls figures you guys fuck off while we do all the work you found my guy we think so where hes working at the washateria you know picking up some tips loose change the washateria was a car wash on la brea it employed day laborers to vacuum and wipe down cars they worked mostly for tips and what they could steal out of the cars without getting caught who spotted him couple guys from vice theyre eighty percent sure they want to know if you want them to make the move or do you want to be on scene tell them to sit tight and that were on the way and you know what mank we think this guys a rabbit you got a unit we can use as an extra backup in case he runs um there was silence and bosch guessed that mankiewicz was checking his deployment chart well youre in luck i got a couple threeelevens starting early they should be out of roll call in fifteen that work for you perfect tell them to meet us in the parking lot of the checkers at la brea and sunset have the vice guys meet us there too bosch signaled to edgar that they were going to roll uh one thing mankiewicz said whats that on the backup one of thems brasher is that going to be a problem bosch was silent a moment he wanted to tell mankiewicz to put somebody else on it but knew it was not his place to if he tried to influence deployment or anything else based on his relationship with brasher then he could leave himself open to criticism and the possibility of an iad investigation no no problem look i wouldnt do it but shes green shes made a few mistakes and needs this kind of experience i said no problem chapter they planned the takedown of johnny stokes on the hood of edgars car the vice guys eyman and leiby drew the layout of the washateria on a legal pad and circled the spot where they had spotted stokes working under the waxing canopy the car wash was surrounded on three sides by concrete walls and other structures the area fronting la brea was almost fifty yards with a fivefoot retention wall running the border except for entry and exit lanes at each corner of the property if stokes decided to run he could go to the retention wall and climb it but it was more likely that he would go for one of the open lanes the plan was simple eyman and leiby would cover the car wash entrance and brasher and her partner edgewood would cover the exit bosch and edgar would drive edgars car in as customers and make the move on stokes they switched their radios to a tactical unit and worked out a code red meant stokes had rabbitted and green meant he had been taken peaceably remember something bosch said almost every wiper rubber soaper and vacuum guy on that lot is probably running from somethingeven if its just la migra so even if we take stokes without a problem the others may rumble cops showing up at a car wash is like yelling fire in a theater everybody scatters till they see whos the one whos it everybody nodded and bosch looked pointedly at brasher the rookie in keeping with the plan agreed to the night before they made no showing of knowing each other as anything other than fellow cops but now he wanted to make sure she understood just how fluid a takedown like this could become you got that boot he said she smiled yeah i got it all right then lets concentrate lets go he thought he saw the smile stay on brashers face as she and edgewood walked to their patrol car he and edgar walked to edgars lexus bosch stopped when he got to it and realized that it looked like it had just been washed and waxed shit what can i say harry i take care of my car bosch looked around behind the fastfood restaurant was an open dumpster in a concrete alcove that had recently been washed down there was a puddle of black water pooling on the pavement drive through that puddle a couple times he said get it on your car harry im not going to get that shit on my car come on your car has to look like it needs to be washed or it might be a tell you said yourself the guys a rabbit lets not give him a reason but were not actually going to get the car washed i splash that shit on there it stays there tell you what jerry if we get this guy ill have eyman and leiby drive him in while you get your car washed ill even pay for it shit come on just drive through the puddle were wasting time after messing up edgars car they made the drive to the car wash in silence as they came up on it bosch could see the vice car parked at the curb a few car lengths from the car wash entrance further down the block past the car wash the patrol unit was stopped in a lane of parked cars bosch went to his rover okay everybody set he got two return clicks on the mike from the vice guys brasher responded by voice all ready okay were going in edgar pulled into the car wash and drove into the service lane where customers delivered their cars to the vacuum station and ordered the kind of wash or wax they wanted boschs eyes immediately started moving among the workers all of whom were dressed in identical orange jumpsuits and baseball caps it slowed the identification process but bosch soon saw the blue wax canopy and picked out johnny stokes hes there he said to edgar on the black beemer bosch knew that once they stepped out of the car most of the cons on the lot would be able to identify them as cops in the same way bosch could spot a con ninetyeight percent of the time they in turn could spot a cop he would have to move swiftly in on stokes he looked over at edgar ready lets do it they cracked the doors at the same time bosch got out and turned toward stokes who was twentyfive yards away with his back turned he was crouched down and spraying something on the wheels of a black bmw bosch heard edgar tell someone to skip the vacuum and that hed be right back bosch and edgar had covered half the distance to their target when they were made by other workers on the lot from somewhere behind him bosch heard a voice call out fiveoh fiveoh fiveoh immediately alerted stokes stood up and started turning bosch started running he was fifteen feet from stokes when the excon realized he was the target his obvious escape was to his left and then out through the car wash entrance but the bmw was blocking him he made a move to his right but then seemed to stop when he realized it was a dead end no no bosch called out we just want to talk we just want to talk stokes visibly slumped bosch moved directly toward him while edgar moved out to the right in case the excon decided to make a break bosch slowed and opened his hands wide as he got close one hand held his rover lapd we just want to ask you a few questions nothing else man about what about stokes suddenly raised his arm and sprayed bosch in the face with the tire cleaner he then bolted to his right seemingly toward the dead end where the high rear wall of the car wash joined the side wall of a threestory apartment building bosch instinctively brought his hands up to his eyes he heard edgar yell at stokes and then the scuffling sound of his shoes on concrete as he gave chase bosch couldnt open his eyes he put his mouth to the radio and yelled red red red hes heading toward the back corner he then dropped the radio to the concrete using his shoe to break its fall he used the sleeves of his jacket to wipe at his burning eyes he finally could open them for brief moments at a time he spotted a hose coiled on a faucet near the rear of the bmw he made his way to it turned it on and doused his face and eyes not caring how wet his clothes got his eyes felt like they had been dropped in boiling water after a few moments the water eased the burning sensation and he dropped the hose without turning it off and went back to get the radio his vision was blurred at the edges but he could see well enough to get moving as he bent down for the radio he heard laughter from some of the other men in orange jumpsuits bosch ignored it he switched the rover to the hollywood patrol channel and spoke into it hollywood units officers in pursuit of assault suspect la brea and santa monica suspect white male thirtyfive yoa dark hair orange jumpsuit suspect in the vicinity of hollywood washateria he couldnt remember the exact address of the car wash but wasnt worried every cop on patrol would know it he switched the rover to the departments main communication channel and requested that a paramedic unit respond as well to treat an injured officer he had no idea what had been sprayed into his eyes they were beginning to feel better but he didnt want to take a chance on longterm injury lastly he switched back to the tactical channel and asked for the others locations only edgar came back up on the radio there was a hole in the back corner he went through to the alley hes in one of these apartment complexes on the north side of the car wash where are the others edgars return was broken up he was moving into a radio void theyre back spread out i think garage you ight harry ill make it backups on the way he didnt know if edgar had heard that he put the rover in his pocket and hustled to the back corner of the car wash lot where he found the hole stokes had slipped through behind a twohigh pallet of fiftyfivegallon drums of liquid soap the concrete wall was broken in it appeared that at one time a car in the alley on the other side had struck the wall creating the hole intentionally done or not it was probably a wellknown escape hatch for every wanted man who worked at the car wash bosch crouched down and slipped through momentarily catching his jacket on a rusty piece of rebar protruding from the broken wall on the other side he got up in an alley that ran behind rows of apartment buildings on either side for the length of the block the patrol car was stopped at an angle forty yards down the alley it was empty both doors open bosch could hear the sound of the main communications channel playing over the dash radio further down at the end of the block the vice car was parked across the alley he quickly moved down the alley toward the patrol car looking and listening for anything when he got to the car he pulled the rover out again and tried to raise someone on tactical he got no response he saw the patrol car was parked in front of a ramp that dipped down into an underground garage beneath the largest of the apartment complexes on the alley remembering auto theft was in edgars recitation of stokess criminal record bosch suddenly knew that stokes would go for the garage his only way out was to get a car he trotted down the garage ramp into the dark the garage was huge and appeared to follow the imprint of the building above there were three parking lanes and a ramp leading to an even lower level bosch saw no one the only sound he heard was a dripping from the overhead pipes he moved swiftly down the middle lane drawing his weapon for the first time stokes had already fashioned a weapon out of a spray bottle there was no telling what he might find in the garage to also use as a weapon as he moved bosch checked the few vehicles in the garageeveryone was at work he guessedfor signs of breakin he saw nothing he was raising the rover to his mouth when he heard the sound of running footsteps echo up the ramp from the lower level of the garage he quickly moved to the ramp and descended careful to keep the rubber soles of his shoes as quiet as he could the lower garage was even darker with less natural light finding its way down as the incline leveled his eyes adjusted he saw no one but the ramp structure blocked his view of half of the space as he began his way around the ramp he suddenly heard a high and taut voice coming from the far end it was brashers right there right there dont move bosch followed the sound moving in tight to the side of the ramp and holding his weapon up his training told him to call out to alert the other officer to his presence but he knew that if brasher was alone with stokes his calling might distract her and give stokes another chance to break or make a move on her as he cut beneath the underside of the ramp bosch saw them at the far wall no more than fifty feet away brasher had stokes up against the wall legs and arms spread she held him there with one hand pressed against his back her flashlight was on the ground next to her right foot its beam lighting the wall on which stokes leaned it was perfect bosch felt relief flood his body and almost immediately he understood it was relief that she had not been hurt he came out of the semicrouch he was in and started toward them lowering his weapon he was directly behind them after he had taken only a few steps he saw brasher take her hand off stokes and step back from him glancing to either side as she did it this immediately registered with bosch as the wrong thing to do it was completely out of training it would allow stokes to make another run if he wanted to things seemed to slow down then bosch started to yell to her but the garage suddenly filled with the flash and shattering blast of a gunshot brasher went down stokes remained up the blast echo reverberated through the concrete structure obscuring its origin all bosch could think was where is the gun he raised his weapon while lowering his body into a combat crouch he started to turn his head to look for the gun but he saw stokes start turning from the wall he then saw brashers arm rising up from the ground her gun pointed at stokess turning body bosch aimed his glock at stokes freeze he yelled freeze freeze freeze in a second he was on them dont shoot man stokes yelled dont shoot bosch kept his eyes unwavering on stokes they still burned and needed relief but he knew even one blink now could be a fatal mistake down get on the ground now stokes dropped onto his stomach and spread his arms at ninetydegree angles to his body bosch stepped over him and with a move performed a thousand times before quickly cuffed his wrists behind his back he then holstered his weapon and turned to brasher her eyes were wide and moving in a backandforth pattern blood had spattered onto her neck and had already soaked the front of her uniform shirt he knelt over her and ripped open her shirt still there was so much blood it took him a moment to find the wound the bullet had entered her left shoulder just an inch or so from the velcro shoulder strap of her kevlar vest the blood was flowing freely from the wound and bosch could see brashers face was losing color quickly her lips were moving but not making any sound he looked around for something and saw a car wash rag poking out of stokess back pocket he yanked it out and pressed it down on the wound brasher moaned in pain julia this is going to hurt but i have to stop the bleeding with one hand he stripped off his tie and pushed it under her shoulder and then over the top he tied a knot that was just tight enough to keep the rag compress in place okay hang on julia he grabbed his rover off the ground and quickly switched the frequency knob to the main channel cdc officer down lowerlevel garage at the la brea park apartments la brea and santa monica we need paramedics right now suspect in custody confirm cdc he waited for what seemed to be an interminable time before a cdc dispatcher came on the air to say he was breaking up and needed to repeat his call bosch clicked the call button and yelled wheres my paramedics officer down he switched to tactical edgar edgewood were in the lower level of the garage brasher is down ive got stokes controlled repeat brasher is down he dropped the radio and yelled edgars name as loud as he could he took off his jacket and balled it together man i didnt do it stokes yelled i dont know what shut up shut the fuck up bosch put his jacket under brashers head her teeth were clenched in pain her chin jutting upward her lips were almost white paramedics are coming julia i called em before this even went down i must be psychic or something you just gotta hold on julia hold on she opened her mouth though it looked like a terrible struggle but before she could say anything stokes yelled out again in a voice now tinged with fear bordering on hysteria i did not do that man dont let them kill me man i didnt do it bosch leaned over putting his weight on stokess back he bent down and spoke in a loud voice directly into his ear shut the fuck up or ill kill you myself he turned his attention back to brasher her eyes were still open tears were going down her cheeks julia just a few more minutes youve got to hang on he pulled the gun out of her right hand and put it on the ground far away from stokes he then held her hand in both of his what happened what the hell happened she opened and then closed her mouth again bosch could hear running feet on the ramp he heard edgar call his name over here in a moment both edgar and edgewood were there julia edgewood cried out oh shit without a moments hesitation edgewood stepped forward and delivered a vicious kick to stokess side you motherfucker he readied himself to do it again when bosch yelled no get back get away from him edgar grabbed edgewood and pulled him away from stokes who had let out a hurt animal cry at the impact of the kick and was now murmuring and moaning in fear take edgewood up and get the paramedics down here bosch said to edgar the rovers arent for shit down here both of them seemed frozen go now as if on cue the sound of sirens could be heard in the distance you want to help her go get them edgar turned edgewood around and they both ran back toward the ramp bosch turned back to brasher her face was now the color of death she was going into shock bosch didnt understand it was a shoulder wound he suddenly wondered if he had heard two shots had the blast and echo obscured a second shot he checked her body again but found nothing he didnt want to turn her to check her back for fear of causing more damage but there was no blood coming from beneath her come on hang in there julia you can do it you hear that the paramedics are just about here just hang in there she opened her mouth again jutted her chin and started to speak he he grabbed he went for she clenched her teeth and rocked her head back and forth on his coat she tried to talk again it wasnt im not bosch leaned his face close to hers and lowered his voice to an urgent whisper shhhh shhhh dont talk just stay alive concentrate julia hold fast stay alive please stay alive he could feel the garage rumble with noise and vibration in a moment red lights were bouncing off the walls and then a paramedic truck was pulling up next to them a patrol cruiser was behind it and other uniformed officers as well as eyman and leiby were running down the ramp and flooding the garage oh god oh please stokes mumbled dont let it happen the first paramedic reached them and the first thing he did was put a hand on boschs shoulder and gently push him back bosch went willingly realizing he was only complicating things now as he moved backward away from brasher her right hand suddenly grasped his forearm and pulled him back toward her her voice was now as thin as paper harry dont let them the paramedic put a breathing mask over her face and her words were lost officer please get back the paramedic said firmly as bosch crawled backward on hands and knees he reached over and gripped brashers ankle for a moment and squeezed it julia youll be all right julia said the second paramedic as he crouched next to her with a large equipment case julia okay julia the paramedic said im eddie and that theres charlie were going to fix you up here like your buddy just said youre going to be all right but you gotta be tough for us you gotta want it julia you gotta fight she said something that was garbled through the mask just one word but bosch thought he recognized it numb the paramedics started stabilizing procedures the one called eddie talking to her all the while bosch got up and moved over to stokes he pulled him up into a standing position and pushed him away from the rescue scene my ribs are broken stokes complained i need the paramedics trust me stokes theres nothing they can do about it so just shut the fuck up two uniforms came up to them bosch recognized them from the other night when they had told julia they would meet her at boardners her friends well take him to the station for you bosch pushed stokes past them without hesitation no i got him you need to stay here for ois detective bosch they were right the officer involved shooting team would soon descend on the scene and bosch would be questioned as a primary witness but he wasnt putting stokes into any hands he did not explicitly trust he walked stokes up the ramp toward the light listen stokes you want to live the younger man didnt answer he was walking with his upper body hunched forward because of the injury to his ribs bosch tapped him lightly in the spot edgewood had kicked him stokes groaned loudly are you listening bosch asked do you want to stay alive yes i want to stay alive then you listen to me im going to put you in a room and you dont talk to anybody but me you understand that i understand just dont let them hurt me i didnt do anything i dont know what happened man she said get against the wall and i did what i was told i swear to god all i did was shut up bosch ordered more cops were coming down the ramp and he just wanted to get stokes out of there when they got to daylight bosch saw edgar standing on the sidewalk talking on his cell phone and using his other hand to signal a transport ambulance into the parking garage bosch pushed stokes toward him as they approached edgar closed the phone i just talked to the lieutenant shes on the way great wheres your car still at the car wash go get it were taking stokes to the division harry we cant just leave the scene of a you saw what edgewood did we need to get this shitbag to a place of safety go get your car if we get any shit for it ill take it you got it edgar started running in the direction of the car wash bosch saw a utility pole near the corner of the apartment building he walked stokes to it and recuffed him with his arms around it wait here he said he then stepped away and ran a hand through his hair what the hell happened back there he didnt realize he had spoken out loud until stokes started answering the question stammering about him not doing anything wrong shut up bosch said i wasnt talking to you chapter bosch and edgar walked stokes through the squad room and down the short hallway leading to the interview rooms they took him into room and cuffed him to the steel ring bolted to the middle of the table well be back bosch said hey man dont leave me in here stokes began theyll come in here man nobodys coming in but me bosch said just sit tight they left the room and locked it bosch went to the homicide table the squad room was completely empty when a cop went down in the division everybody responded it was part of keeping the faith in the blue religion if it was you who went down youd want everybody coming so you responded in kind bosch needed a smoke he needed time to think and he needed some answers his mind was crowded with thoughts about julia and her condition but he knew it was out of his hands and the best way to control his thoughts was to concentrate on something still in his hands he knew he had little time before the ois detail would pick up the trail and come for him and stokes he picked up the phone and called the watch office mankiewicz answered he was probably the last cop in the station whats the latest bosch asked how is she i dont know i hear its bad where are you in the squad ive got the guy here harry what are you doing ois is all over this you should be at the scene both of you lets just say i was fearful of a deteriorating situation listen let me know the minute you hear something about julia okay you got it bosch was about to hang up when he remembered something and mank listen your guy edgewood tried to kick the shit out of the suspect he was cuffed and on the ground at the time hes probably got four or five broken ribs bosch waited mankiewicz didnt say anything your choice i can go formal with it or i can let you take care of it your way ill take care of it all right remember let me know what you know he hung up and looked at edgar who nodded his approval on the way bosch was handling the edgewood matter what about stokes edgar said harry what the fuck happened in that garage im not sure listen im going to go in there and talk to him about arthur delacroix see what i can get before ois storms the place and takes him away when they get here see if you can stall them yeah and this saturday im planning to kick tiger woodss ass on riviera yeah i know bosch went into the rear hallway and was about to enter room when he realized he had not gotten his recorder back from detective bradley of iad he wanted to record his interview with stokes he walked past the door to room and stepped into the adjoining video room he turned on the room camera and auxiliary recorder and then went back to room bosch sat across from stokes the life appeared drained from the younger mans eyes less than an hour before he had been waxing a bmw picking up a few bucks now he was looking at a return to prisonif he was lucky he knew cop blood in the water brought out the blue sharks many were the suspects who were shot trying to escape or inexplicably hung themselves in rooms just like this or so it was explained to the reporters do yourself a big favor bosch said calm the fuck down and dont do anything stupid dont do anything with these people that gets you killed you understand me stokes nodded bosch saw the package of marlboros in the breast pocket of stokess jumpsuit he reached across the table causing stokes to flinch relax he took the pack of cigarettes and fired one up with a match from a book slipped behind the cellophane from the corner of the room he pulled a small trash can next to his chair and dropped in the match if i wanted to hurt you i wouldve done it in the garage thanks for the smoke bosch savored the smoke it had been at least two months since hed had a cigarette can i have one stokes asked no you dont deserve one you dont deserve shit but im going to make a little deal with you here stokes raised his eyes to boschs you know that little kick in the ribs you got back there ill trade you you forget about it and take it like a man and ill forget about you spraying me in the face with that shit my ribs are broke man my eyes still burn man that was a commercial cleaning chemical the da will be able to get assault on a police officer out of that faster than you can say five to ten in corcoran you remember being in the cork dont you bosch let that sink in for a long moment so do we have a deal stokes nodded but said what difference is it going to make theyre going to say i shot her i but i know you didnt bosch saw a glimmer of hope returning to stokess eyes and i will tell them exactly what i saw okay stokess voice was barely a whisper so lets start at the start whyd you run stokes shook his head because its what i do man i run im a convict and youre the man i run bosch realized that in all of the confusion and haste nobody had searched stokes he told him to stand up which could only be accomplished by stokes leaning over the table because of his shackled wrists bosch moved around behind him and started checking his pockets you got any needles no man no needles good i dont want to get stuck i get stuck and all deals are off as he searched he held the cigarette in his lips the smoke stung his already burning eyes bosch took out a wallet a set of keys and roll of cash totaling in ones stokess tips for the day there was nothing else if stokes had been carrying drugs for sale or personal use he had tossed them while trying to make his escape theyll be out there with dogs bosch said if you tossed a stash theyll find it and there wont be anything i can do about it i didnt toss anything if they find something they planted it yeah just like oj bosch sat back down what was the first thing i said to you i said i just want to talk it was the truth all of this bosch made a sweeping gesture with his hands it could have all been avoided if you had just listened cops never want to talk they always want something more bosch nodded he had never been surprised by how accurate the street knowledge of exconvicts was tell me about arthur delacroix confusion tightened stokess eyes what who arthur delacroix your skateboard buddy from the miracle mile days remember jesus man that was a long time ago i know thats why im asking what about him hes long gone man tell me about him tell me about when he disappeared stokes looked down at his cuffed hands and slowly shook his head that was a long time ago i cant remember that try why did he disappear i dont know he just couldnt take no more of the shit and ran away did he tell you he was running away no man he just left one day he was just gone and i never saw him again what shit what do you mean you said he couldnt take any more of the shit and ran away that shit what are you talking about oh you know like all the shit in his life did he have trouble at home stokes laughed he mocked bosch in an imitation did he have trouble at home like who didnt man was he abusedphysically abusedat home is what i mean again laughter who wasnt my old man hed rather take a shot at me than talk to me about anything when i was twelve he hit me from across the room with a full can of beer just because i ate a taco he wanted they took me away from him for that you know thats a real shame but were talking about arthur delacroix here did he ever tell you his father hit him he didnt have to man i saw the bruises the guy always had a black eye is what i remember that was from skateboarding he fell a lot stokes shook his head fuck that man artie was the best thats all he did he was too good to get hurt boschs feet were flat on the floor he could tell by the sudden vibrations through his soles that there were people in the squad room now he reached over and pushed the button lock on the doorknob you remember when he was in the hospital hed hurt his head did he tell you that it was from a skateboarding accident stokes knitted his brow and looked down bosch had jogged loose a direct memory he could tell i remember he had a shaved head and stitches like a fucking zipper i cant remember what he someone tried the door from the outside and then there was a harsh banging on the door a muffled voice came through detective bosch this is lieutenant gilmore ois open the door stokes suddenly reared back panic filling his eyes no dont let them shut up bosch leaned across the table grabbed stokes by the collar and pulled him forward listen to me this is important there was another knock on the door are you saying that arthur never told you his father hurt him look man take care of me here and ill say whatever the fuck you want me to say okay his father was an asshole you want me to say artie told me his father beat him with the goddamn broomstick ill say it you want it to be a baseball bat fine ill say i dont want you to say anything but the truth goddammit did he ever tell you that or not the door came open they had gotten a key from the drawer at the front desk two men in suits came in gilmore whom bosch recognized and another ois detective bosch didnt recognize all right this is over gilmore announced bosch what the fuck are you doing did he bosch said to stokes the other ois detective took keys from his pocket and started taking the cuffs off of stokess wrists i didnt do anything stokes started to protest i didnt did he ever tell you bosch yelled get him out of here gilmore barked to the other detective put him in another room the detective physically lifted stokes from his seat and half carried half pushed him out of the room boschs cuffs remained on the table bosch stared blankly at them thinking of the answers stokes had given him and feeling a terrible weight on his chest from the knowledge that the whole thing had been a dead end stokes added nothing to the case julia had been shot and it was for nothing he finally looked up at gilmore who closed the door and then turned to face bosch now like i said what the fuck were you doing bosch chapter gilmore twiddled a pencil in his fingers drumming the eraser on the table bosch never trusted an investigator who took notes in pencil but thats what the officer involved shooting team was all about making stories and facts fit the picture the department wanted to present to the public it was a pencil squad to get it right often meant using the pencil and eraser never ink never a tape recorder so were going to go over this again he said tell me once more what did officer brasher do bosch looked past him he had been moved to the suspects chair in the interview room he was facing the mirrorthe oneway glass behind which he was sure there were at least a half dozen people probably including deputy chief irving he wondered if anybody had noticed that the video had been running if they had it would have immediately been shut off somehow she shot herself and you saw this not exactly i saw it from the rear her back was to me then how do you know she shot herself because there was no one else there but her me and stokes i didnt shoot her and stokes didnt shoot her she shot herself during the struggle with stokes bosch shook his head no there was no struggle at the moment of the shooting i dont know what happened before i got there but at the moment of the shooting stokes had both hands flat on the wall and his back to her when the gun went off officer brasher had her hand on his back holding him in place i saw her step back from him and drop her hand i didnt see the gun but i then heard the shot and saw the flash originate in front of her and she went down gilmore drummed his pencil loudly on the table thats probably messing up the recording bosch said oh thats right you guys never put anything on tape never mind that then what happened i started moving toward them at the wall stokes started to turn to see what had happened from the ground officer brasher raised her right arm and took aim with her weapon at stokes but she didnt fire did she no i yelled freeze to stokes and she did not fire and he did not move i then moved to the scene and put stokes on the ground i handcuffed him i then used the radio to call for help and tried to tend to officer brashers wound as best i could gilmore was also chewing gum in a loud way that annoyed bosch he worked it for several chews before speaking see what im not getting here is why would she shoot herself youll have to ask her that im only telling you what i saw yeah but im asking you you were there what do you think bosch waited a long moment things had happened so fast he had put off thinking about the garage by concentrating on stokes now the images of what he had seen kept replaying in his mind he finally shrugged i dont know ill tell you what lets go your way with it for a minute lets assume she was reholstering her weaponwhich would have been against procedures but lets assume it for the sake of argument shes reholstering so she can cuff the guy her holster is on her right hip and the entry wound is on the left shoulder how does that happen bosch thought about brashers questioning him a few nights earlier about the scar on his left shoulder about being shot and what it had felt like he felt the room closing in getting tight on him he started sweating i dont know he said you dont know very much do you bosch i only know what i saw i told you what i saw bosch wished they hadnt taken away stokess pack of cigarettes what was your relationship with officer brasher bosch looked down at the table what do you mean from what i hear you were fucking her thats what i mean whats it have to do with anything i dont know maybe you tell me bosch didnt answer he worked hard not to show the fury building inside well first off this relationship of yours was a violation of department policy gilmore said you know that dont you shes in patrol im in detective services you think that matters that doesnt matter youre a dthree thats supervisor level shes a grunt and a rookie no less if this was the military youd get a dishonorable just for starters maybe even some custody time but this is the lapd so whats it get me a promotion that was the first offensive move bosch had made it was a warning to gilmore to go another way it was a veiled reference to several wellknown and not so wellknown dalliances between highranking officers and members of the rank and file it was known that the police union which represented the rank and file to the level of sergeant was waiting with the goods ready to challenge any disciplinary action taken under the departments socalled sexual harassment policy i dont need any smart remarks from you gilmore said im trying to conduct an investigation here he followed this with an extended drum roll while he looked at the few notes he had written on his pad what he was doing bosch knew was conducting a reverse investigation start with a conclusion and then gather only the facts that support it how are your eyes gilmore finally asked without looking up one of them still stings like a son of a bitch they feel like poached eggs now you say that stokes hit you in the face with a shot from his bottle of cleaner correct and it momentarily blinded you correct now gilmore stood up and started pacing in the small space behind his chair how long between the moment you were blinded and when you were down in that dark garage and supposedly saw her shoot herself bosch thought for a moment well i used a hose to wash my eyes then i followed the pursuit i would say not more than five minutes but not too much less so you went from blind man to eagle scoutable to see everythinginside of five minutes i wouldnt characterize it like that but you have the time right well at least i got something right thank you no problem lieutenant so youre saying you didnt see the struggle for control of officer brashers gun before the shot occurred is that correct he had his hands clasped behind his back the pencil between two fingers like a cigarette bosch leaned across the table he understood the game of semantics gilmore was playing dont play with the words lieutenant there was no struggle i saw no struggle because there was no struggle if there had been a struggle i would have seen it is that clear enough for you gilmore didnt respond he kept pacing look bosch said why dont you just go do a gsr test on stokes his hands his jumpsuit you wont find anything that should end this pretty quick gilmore came back to his chair and leaned down on it he looked at bosch and shook his head you know detective i would love to do that normally in a situation like this first thing wed do is look for gunshot residue the problem is you broke the box you took it upon yourself to take stokes out of the crime scene and bring him back here the chain of evidence was broken you understand that he couldve washed himself changed his clothes i dont know what else because you took it upon yourself to take him from the crime scene bosch was ready for that i felt there was a safety issue there my partner will back me on that so will stokes and he was never out of my custody and control until you came busting in here that doesnt change the fact that you thought your case was more important than us getting the facts about a shooting of an officer of this department does it bosch had no answer for that but he was now coming to a full understanding of what gilmore was doing it was important for him and the department to conclude and be able to announce that brasher was shot during a struggle for control of her gun it was heroic that way and it was something the department public relations machine could take advantage of and run with there was nothing like the shooting of a good copa female rookie no lessin the line of duty to help remind the public of all that was good and noble about their police department and all that was dangerous about the police officers duty the alternative to announce that brasher had shot herself accidentallyor even something worsewould be an embarrassment for the department one more in a long line of public relations fiascos standing in the way of the conclusion gilmoreand therefore irving and the department brasswanted was stokes of course and then bosch stokes was no problem a convicted felon facing prison time for shooting a cop whatever he said would be selfserving and unimportant but bosch was an eyewitness with a badge gilmore had to change his account or failing that taint it the first soft spot to attack was boschs physical conditionconsidering what had been thrown in his eyes could he actually have seen what he claimed to have seen the second move was to go after bosch the detective in order to preserve stokes as a witness in his murder case would bosch go so far as to lie about seeing stokes shoot a cop to bosch it was so outlandish as to be bizarre but over the years he had seen even worse things happen to cops who had stepped in front of the machinery that produced the image of the department that was delivered to the public wait a minute you bosch said able to hold himself from calling a superior officer an expletive if youre trying to say i would lie about stokes shooting juliauh officer brasherso he would stay in the clear for my case then youwith all due respectare out of your fucking mind detective bosch i am exploring all possibilities here it is my job to do so well you can explore them without me bosch stood up and went to the door where are you going im done with this he glanced at the mirror and opened the door then looked back at gilmore i got news for you lieutenant your theory is for shit stokes is nothing to my case a zero julia getting shot it was for nothing but you didnt know that until you got him in here did you bosch looked at him and then slowly shook his head have a good day lieutenant he turned to go through the door and almost stepped into irving the deputy chief stood ramrod straight in the hallway outside the room step back inside for a moment detective he said calmly please bosch backed into the room irving followed him in lieutenant give us some space here the deputy chief said and i want everyone out of the viewing room as well he pointed at the mirror as he said this yes sir gilmore said and he left the room closing the door behind him take your seat again irving said bosch moved back to the seat facing the mirror irving remained standing after a moment he also started pacing moving back and forth in front of the mirror a double image for bosch to track we are going to call the shooting accidental irving said not looking at bosch officer brasher apprehended the suspect and while reholstering her weapon inadvertently fired the shot is that what she said bosch asked irving looked momentarily confused then shook his head as far as i know she only spoke to you and you said she didnt say anything specifically in regard to the shooting bosch nodded so thats the end of it i dont see why it should go any further bosch thought of the photo of the shark on julias mantel about what he knew about her in such a short time with her again the images of what he saw in the garage played back in slow motion and things didnt add up if we cant be honest with ourselves how can we ever tell the truth to the people out there irving cleared his throat i am not going to debate things with you detective the decision has been made by you yes by me what about stokes that will be up to the district attorneys office he could be charged under the felonymurder law his action of fleeing ultimately led to the shooting it will get technical if it is determined he was already in custody when the fatal shot occurred then he might be able to wait a minute wait a minute bosch said coming out of his chair felonymurder law did you say fatal shot irving turned to face him lieutenant gilmore did not tell you bosch dropped back into the chair and put his elbows on the table he covered his face with his hands the bullet hit a bone in her shoulder and apparently ricocheted inside her body it cut through her chest pierced her heart and she was dead on arrival bosch lowered his face so that his hands were now on top of his head he felt himself get dizzy and he thought he might fall out of the chair he tried to breathe deeply until it passed after a few moments irving spoke into the darkness of his mind detective there are some officers in this department they call shit magnets i am sure you have heard the term personally i find the phrase distasteful but its meaning is that things always seem to happen to these particular officers bad things repeatedly always bosch waited in the dark for what he knew was coming unfortunately detective bosch you are one of those officers bosch unconsciously nodded he was thinking about the moment that the paramedic put the breathing mask over julias mouth as she was speaking dont let them what did she mean dont let them what he was beginning to put things together and to know what she was going to say detective irving said his strong voice cutting through boschs thoughts i have shown tremendous patience with you over the cases and over the years but i have grown tired of it so has this department i want you to start thinking about retirement soon detective soon bosch kept his head down and didnt respond after a moment he heard the door open and close chapter in keeping with the wishes of julia brashers family that she be buried in accordance with her faith her funeral was late the next morning at hollywood memorial park because she had been killed accidentally while in the line of duty she was accorded the full police burial ceremony complete with motorcycle procession honor guard twentyonegun salute and a generous showing of the departments brass at graveside the departments aero squadron also flew over the cemetery five helicopters flying in missing man formation but because the funeral was not even twentyfour hours after her death it was not well attended lineofduty deaths routinely bring at least token representations of officers from departments all over the state and the southwest it was not to be with julia brasher the quickness of the ceremony and the circumstances of her death added up to it being a relatively small affairby police burial standards a death in a gun battle would have crowded the small cemetery from stone to stone with the trappings of the blue religion a cop killing herself while holstering her weapon did not engender much of the mythology and danger of police work the funeral simply wasnt a draw bosch watched from the outer edges of the funeral group his head was throbbing from a night of drinking and trying to dull the guilt and pain he felt bones had come out of the ground and now two people were dead for reasons that made little sense to him his eyes were badly bloodshot and swollen but he knew he could pass that off if he had to to being sprayed with the tire cleaner by stokes the day before he saw teresa corazon for once without her videographer seated in the front row line of brass and dignitaries what few of them there were in attendance she wore sunglasses but bosch could tell when she had noticed him her mouth seemed to settle into a hard thin line a perfect funeral smile bosch was the first to look away it was a beautiful day for a funeral brisk overnight winds from the pacific had temporarily cleared the smog out of the sky even the view of the valley from boschs home had been clear that morning cirrus clouds scudded across the upper reaches of the sky along with contrails left by highflying jets the air in the cemetery smelled sweet from all the flowers arranged near the grave from his standpoint bosch could see the crooked letters of the hollywood sign high up on mount lee presiding over the service the chief of police did not deliver the eulogy as was his custom in lineofduty deaths instead the academy commander spoke using the moment to talk about how danger in police work always comes from the unexpected corner and how officer brashers death might save other cops by being a reminder never to let down the guard of caution he never called her anything but officer brasher during his tenminute speech giving it an embarrassingly impersonal touch during the whole thing bosch kept thinking about photos of sharks with open mouths and volcanoes disgorging their molten flows he wondered if julia had finally proven herself to the person she believed she needed to amidst the blue uniforms surrounding the silver casket was a swath of gray the lawyers her father and a large contingent from the firm in the second row behind brashers father bosch could see the man from the photo on the mantel of the venice bungalow for a while bosch fantasized about going up to him and slapping him or bringing a knee up into his genitals doing it right in the middle of the service for all to see then pointing to the casket and telling the man that he sent her on the path to this but he let it go he knew that explanation and assignment of blame was too simple and wrong ultimately he knew people chose their own path they can be pointed and pushed but they always get the final choice everybodys got a cage that keeps out the sharks those who open the door and venture out do so at their own risk seven members of brashers rookie class were chosen for the salute they pointed rifles toward the blue sky and fired three rounds of blanks each the ejected brass jackets arcing through the light and falling to the grass like tears while the shots were still echoing off the stones the helicopters made their pass overhead and then the funeral was over bosch slowly made his way toward the grave passing people heading away a hand tugged his elbow from behind and he turned around it was brashers partner edgewood i uh just wanted to apologize about yesterday about what i did he said it wont happen again bosch waited for him to make eye contact and then just nodded he had nothing to say to edgewood i guess you didnt mention it to ois and i uh just want to say i appreciate it bosch just looked at him edgewood became uncomfortable nodded once and walked away when he was gone bosch found himself looking at a woman who had been standing right behind the cop a latina with silver hair it took bosch a moment to recognize her dr hinojos detective bosch how are you it was the hair almost seven years earlier when bosch had been a regular visitor to hinojoss office her hair had been a deep brown without a hint of gray she was still an attractive woman gray or brown but the change was startling im doing okay howre things in the psych shop she smiled theyre fine i hear you run the whole show now she nodded bosch felt himself getting nervous when he had known her before he had been on an involuntary stress leave in twiceaweek sessions he had told her things he had never told anyone before or since and once he was returned to duty he had never spoken to her again until now did you know julia brasher he asked it wasnt unusual for a department shrink to attend a lineofduty funeral to offer onthespot counseling to those close to the deceased no not really not personally as head of the department i reviewed her academy application and screening interview i signed off on it she waited a moment studying bosch for a reaction i understand you were close to her and that you were there you were the witness bosch nodded people leaving the funeral were passing on both sides of them hinojos took a step closer to him so that she would not be overheard this is not the time or place but harry i want to talk to you about her whats there to talk about i want to know what happened and why it was an accident talk to chief irving i have and im not satisfied i doubt you are either listen doctor shes dead okay im not going to i signed off on her my signature put that badge on her if we missed somethingif i missed somethingi want to know if there were signs we should have seen them bosch nodded and looked down at the grass between them dont worry there were signs i shouldve seen but i didnt put it together either she took another step closer now bosch could look nowhere but directly at her then i am right there is something more to this he nodded nothing overt its just that she lived close to the edge she took risksshe crossed the tube she was trying to prove something i dont think she was even sure she wanted to be a cop prove something to who i dont know maybe herself maybe somebody else harry i knew you as a man of great instincts what else bosch shrugged its just things she did or said i have a scar on my shoulder from a bullet wound she asked me about it the other night she asked how i got shot and i told her how i had been lucky that it hit me where it did because it was all bone then where she shot herself its the same spot only with her it ricocheted she didnt expect that hinojos nodded and waited what ive been thinking i cant stand thinking know what i mean tell me harry i keep replaying it in my head what i saw and what i know she pointed her gun at him and i think if i hadnt been there and yelled that maybe she would have shot him once he was down she would have wrapped his hands around the gun and fired a shot into the ceiling or maybe a car or maybe into him it wouldnt matter as long as he ended up dead with paraffin on his hands and she could claim he went for her gun what are you suggesting that she shot herself in order to kill him and make herself look like a hero i dont know she talked about the world needing heroes especially now she said she hoped to get a chance to be a hero one day but i think there was something else in all of this it was like she wanted the scar the experience of it and she was willing to kill for it i dont know i dont know if im even right about any of this all i know is that she might have been a rookie but she had already reached the point where there was a line between us and them where everybody without a badge is a scumbag she saw it happening to herself she might have been just looking for a way out bosch shook his head and looked off to the side the cemetery was almost deserted now i dont know saying it out loud makes it sound i dont know its a crazy world he took a step back from hinojos i guess you never really know anybody do you he asked you might think you do you might be close enough to sleep with somebody but youll never know whats really going on inside no you wont everybodys got secrets bosch nodded and was about to step away wait harry she lifted her purse and opened it she started digging through it i still want to talk about this she said as she came out with a business card and handed it to him i want you to call me completely unofficial confidential for the good of the department bosch almost laughed the department doesnt care about it the department cares about the image not the truth and when the truth endangers the image then fuck the truth well i care harry and so do you bosch looked down at the card and nodded and put it in his pocket okay ill call you my cell phones on there i carry it with me all the time bosch nodded she stepped forward and reached out she grasped his arm and squeezed it what about you harry are you okay well other than losing her and being told by irving to start thinking about retiring im doing okay hinojos frowned hang in there harry bosch nodded thinking about how he had used the same words with julia at the end hinojos went off and bosch continued his trek to the grave he thought he was alone now he grabbed a handful of dirt from the fill mound and walked over and looked down a whole bouquet and several single flowers had been dropped on top of the casket bosch thought about holding julia in his bed just two nights before he wished he had seen what was coming he wished he had been able to take the hints and put them into a clear picture of what she was doing and where she was going slowly he raised his hand out and let the dirt slide through his fingers city of bones he whispered he watched the dirt fall into the grave like dreams disappearing i assume you knew her bosch quickly turned it was her father smiling sadly they were the only two left in the cemetery bosch nodded just recently i got to know her im sorry for your loss frederick brasher he put out his hand bosch started to take it but then held up my hands dirty dont worry so is mine they shook hands harry bosch brashers hand stopped its shaking movement for a moment as the name registered the detective he said you were there yesterday yes i tried i did what i could to help her i he stopped he didnt know what to say im sure you did it mustve been an awful thing to be there bosch nodded a wave of guilt passed through him like an xray lighting his bones he had left her there thinking she would be all right somehow it hurt almost as bad as the fact she had died what i dont understand is how it happened brasher said a mistake like that how could it kill her and then the district attorneys office today saying this man stokes would not face any charge in the shooting im a lawyer but i just dont understand they are letting him go bosch studied the older man saw the misery in his eyes im sorry sir i wish i could tell you i have the same questions as you brasher nodded and looked into the grave im going now he said after a long moment thank you for coming detective bosch bosch nodded they shook hands again and brasher started to walk away sir bosch asked brasher turned back do you know when someone from the family will be going to her house actually i was given her keys today i was going to go now take a look at things try to get a sense of her i guess in recent years we hadnt he didnt finish bosch stepped closer to him theres something that she had a picture in a frame if its not if its okay with you id like to keep it brasher nodded why dont you come now meet me there show me this picture bosch looked at his watch lt billets had scheduled a onethirty meeting to discuss the status of the case he probably had just enough time to make it to venice and back to the station there would be no time for lunch but he couldnt see himself eating anything anyway okay i will they parted and headed toward their cars on the way bosch stopped on the grass where the salute had been fired combing the grass with his foot he looked until he saw the glint of brass and bent down to pick up one of the ejected rifle shells he held it on his palm and looked at it for a few moments then closed his hand and dropped it into his coat pocket he had picked up a shell from every cop funeral he had ever attended he had a jar full of them he turned and walked out of the cemetery chapter jerry edgar had a warrant knock that sounded like no other bosch had ever heard like a gifted athlete who can focus the forces of his whole body into the swinging of a bat or the dunking of a basketball edgar could put his whole weight and sixfootfour frame into his knock it was as though he could call down and concentrate all the power and fury of the righteous into the fist of his large left hand hed plant his feet firmly and stand sideways to the door hed raise his left arm bend the elbow to less than thirty degrees and hit the door with the fleshy side of his fist it was a backhand knock but he was able to fire the pistons of this muscle assembly so quickly that it sounded like the staccato bark of a machine gun what it sounded like was judgment day samuel delacroixs aluminumskinned trailer seemed to shudder from end to end when edgar hit its door with his fist at on thursday afternoon edgar waited a few seconds and then hit it again this time announcing police and then stepping back off the stoop which was a stack of unconnected concrete blocks they waited neither had a weapon out but bosch had his hand under his jacket and was gripping his gun in its holster it was his standard procedure when delivering a warrant on a person not believed to be dangerous bosch listened for movements from inside but the hiss from the nearby freeway was too loud he checked the windows none of the closed curtains were moving you know bosch whispered im starting to think it comes as a relief when you yell its just the cops after that knock at least then they know its not an earthquake edgar didnt respond he probably knew it was just nervous banter from bosch it wasnt anxiety about the door knockbosch fully expected delacroix to be easy he was anxious because he knew the case was all coming down to the next few hours with delacroix they would search the trailer and then have to make a decision largely communicated in partners code on whether to arrest delacroix for his sons murder somewhere in that process they would need to find the evidence or elicit the confession that would change a case largely built on theory into one built on lawyerresistant fact so in boschs mind they were quickly approaching the moment of truth and that always made him nervous earlier in the case status meeting with lt billets it had been decided that it was time to talk to sam delacroix he was the victims father he was the chief suspect what little evidence they had still pointed to him they spent the next hour typing up a search warrant for delacroixs trailer and taking it to the downtown criminal courts building to a judge who was normally a soft touch but even this judge took some convincing the problem was the case was old the evidence directly linking the suspect was thin and the place bosch and edgar wanted to search was not where the homicide could have occurred and was not even occupied by the suspect at the time of the death what the detectives had in their favor was the emotional impact that came from the list in the warrant of all the injuries that the boys bones indicated he had sustained over his short life in the end it was all those fractures that won the judge over and he signed the warrant they had gone to the driving range first but were informed that delacroix was finished driving the tractor for the day give him another shot bosch told edgar outside the trailer i think i can hear him coming i dont care i want him rattled edgar stepped back up onto the stoop and hit the door again the concrete blocks wobbled and he didnt plant his feet firmly the resulting knock didnt carry the power and terror of the first two assaults on the door edgar stepped back down that wasnt the police bosch whispered that was a neighbor complaining about the dog or something sorry i the door came open and edgar shut up bosch went into high alert trailers were tricky unlike most structures their doors opened outward so that the interior space didnt have to accommodate the swing bosch was positioned on the blind side so that whoever answered was looking at edgar but couldnt see bosch the problem was bosch couldnt see whoever had opened the door either if there was trouble edgars job was to yell a warning to bosch and get himself clear without hesitation bosch would empty his gun into the door of the trailer the bullets tearing through the aluminum and whoever was on the other side like they were paper what a mans voice said edgar held up his badge bosch studied his partner for any warning sign of trouble mr delacroix police seeing no sign of alarm bosch stepped forward and grabbed the knob and pulled the door all the way open he kept his jacket flipped back and his hand on the grip of his gun the man he had seen on the golf range the day before was standing there he wore an old pair of plaid shorts and a washedout maroon tshirt with permanent stains under the arms we have a warrant allowing us to search these premises bosch said can we come in you guys delacroix said you guys were at the range yesterday sir bosch said forcefully i said that we have a search warrant for this trailer can we come in and conduct the search bosch took the folded warrant out of his pocket and held it up but not within delacroixs reach that was the trick to get the warrant they had to show all their cards to a judge but they didnt want to show the same cards to delacroix not just yet so while delacroix was entitled to read and study the warrant before granting the detectives entrance bosch was hoping to get inside the trailer without that happening delacroix would soon know the facts of the case but bosch wanted to control the delivery of information to him so that he could take readings and make judgments based on the suspects reactions bosch started putting the warrant back into his inside coat pocket whats this about delacroix asked in muted protest can i at least see that thing are you samuel delacroix bosch replied quickly yes this is your trailer correct sir its my trailer i lease the spot i want to read the mr delacroix edgar said wed rather not stand out here in the view of your neighbors discussing this im sure you dont want that either are you going to allow us to lawfully execute the search warrant or not delacroix looked from bosch to edgar and then back to bosch he nodded his head i guess so bosch was first onto the stoop he entered squeezing by delacroix on the threshold and picking up the odor of bourbon and bad breath and cat urine starting early mr delacroix yeah ive had a drink delacroix said with a mixture of sowhat and selfloathing in his voice im done my work im entitled edgar came in then a much tighter squeeze past delacroix and he and bosch scanned what they could see of the dimly lit trailer to the right from the doorway was the living room it was wood paneled and had a green naugahyde couch and a coffee table with pieces of the wood veneer scraped off exposing the particleboard beneath there was a matching lamp table with no lamp on it and a television stand with a tv awkwardly stacked on top of a videocassette recorder there were several videotapes stacked on top of the television across from the coffee table was an old recliner with its shoulders torn openprobably by a catand stuffing leaking out under the coffee table was a stack of newspapers most of them gossip tabloids with blaring headlines to the left was a galleystyle kitchen with sink cabinets stove oven and refrigerator on one side and a fourperson dining booth on the right there was a bottle of ancient age bourbon on the table on the floor under the table were a few crumbs of cat food on a plate and an old plastic margarine tub half full of water there was no sign of the cat other than the smell of its urine beyond the kitchen was a narrow hallway leading back to one or two bedrooms and a bathroom lets leave the door open and open up a few windows bosch said mr delacroix why dont you sit down on the couch there delacroix moved toward the couch and said look you dont have to search the place i know why youre here bosch glanced at edgar and then at delacroix yeah edgar said why are we here delacroix dropped himself heavily into the middle of the couch the springs were shot he sank into the midsection and the ends of the cushion on either side of him rose into the air like the bows of twin titanics going down the gas delacroix said and i hardly used any of it i dont go anywhere but back and forth from the range i have a restricted license because of my dui the gas edgar asked what are mr delacroix were not here about you stealing gas bosch said he picked up one of the videotapes off the stack on the television there was tape on the spine with writing on it first infantry episode he put it back down and glanced at the writing on some of the other tapes they were all episodes of the television show delacroix had worked on as an actor more than thirty years before thats not really our gig he added without looking at delacroix then what what do you want now bosch looked at him were here about your son delacroix stared at him for a long moment his mouth slowly coming open and exposing his yellowed teeth arthur he finally said yeah we found him delacroixs eyes dropped from boschs and seemed to leave the trailer as he studied a faroff memory in his look was knowledge bosch saw it his instincts told him that what they would tell delacroix next he would already know he glanced over at edgar to see if he had seen it edgar gave a single short nod bosch looked back at the man on the couch you dont seem very excited for a father who hasnt seen his son in more than twenty years he said delacroix looked at him i guess thats because i know hes dead bosch studied him for a long moment his breath holding in his lungs why would you say that what would make you think that because i know ive known all along what have you known that he wasnt coming back this wasnt going the way of any of the scenarios bosch had imagined it seemed to him that delacroix had been waiting for them expecting them maybe for years he decided that they might have to change the strategy and arrest delacroix and advise him of his rights am i under arrest delacroix asked as if he had joined bosch in his thoughts bosch glanced at edgar again wondering if his partner had sensed how their plan was now slipping away from them we thought we might want to talk first you know informally you might as well arrest me delacroix said quietly you think so does that mean you dont want to talk to us delacroix shook his head slowly and went into the longdistance stare again no ill talk to you he said ill tell you all about it tell us about what how it happened how what happened my son you know how it happened sure i know i did it bosch almost cursed out loud their suspect had literally just confessed before they had advised him of his rights including the right to avoid giving selfincriminating statements mr delacroix were going to cut this off right here i am going to advise you of your rights now i just want to no please sir dont say anything else not yet lets get this rights thing taken care of and then well be more than happy to listen to anything you want to tell us delacroix waved a hand like it didnt matter to him like nothing mattered jerry wheres your recorder i never got mine back from iad uh in the car i dont know about the batteries though go check edgar left the trailer and bosch waited in silence delacroix put his elbows on his knees and his face in his hands bosch studied his posture it didnt happen often but it wouldnt be the first time he had scored a confession during his first meeting with a suspect edgar came back in with a tape recorder but shook his head batteries are dead i thought you had yours shit then take notes bosch took out his badge case and took out one of his business cards hed had them made with the miranda rights advisory printed on the back along with a signature line he read the advisory statement and asked delacroix if he understood his rights delacroix nodded his head is that a yes yes its a yes then sign on the line beneath what i just read to you he gave delacroix the card and a pen once it was signed bosch returned the card to his badge wallet he stepped over and sat on the edge of the recliner chair now mr delacroix do you want to repeat what you just said to us a few minutes ago delacroix shrugged like it was no big deal i killed my son arthur i killed him i knew you people would show up someday it took a long time bosch looked over at edgar he was writing in a notebook they would have some record of delacroixs admission he looked back at the suspect and waited hoping the silence would be an invitation for delacroix to say more but he didnt instead the suspect buried his face in his hands again his shoulders soon began shaking as he started to cry god help me i did it bosch looked back at edgar and raised his eyebrows his partner gave a quick thumbsup sign they had more than enough to move to the next stage the controlled and recorded setting of an interview room at the police station mr delacroix do you have a cat bosch asked wheres your cat delacroix peeked his wet eyes through his fingers hes around probably sleepin in the bed why well were going to call animal control and theyll come get him to take care of him youre going to have to come with us were going to place you under arrest now and well talk more at the police station delacroix dropped his hands and seemed upset no animal control wont take care of him theyll gas him the minute they find out i wont be coming back well we cant just leave him here mrs kresky will take care of him shes next door she can come in and feed him bosch shook his head the whole thing was foundering because of a cat we cant do that we have to seal this place until we can search it what do you have to search it for delacroix said real anger in his voice now im telling you what you need to know i killed my son it was an accident i hit him too hard i guess i delacroix put his face back into his hands and tearfully mumbled god what did i do bosch checked edgar he was writing bosch stood up he wanted to get delacroix to the station and into one of the interview rooms his anxiety was gone now replaced by a sense of urgency attacks of conscience and guilt were ephemeral he wanted to get delacroix locked down on tapevideo and audiobefore he decided to talk to a lawyer and before he realized that he was talking himself into a room for the rest of his life okay well figure out the cat thing later he said well leave enough food for now stand up mr delacroix were going to go delacroix stood up can i change into something nicer this is just old stuff i was wearing around here no dont worry about that bosch said well bring you clothes to wear later on he didnt bother telling him that those clothes wouldnt be his what would happen was that hed be given a county jailissued jumpsuit with a number across the back his jumpsuit would be yellow the color given to custodies on the highpower floorthe murderers are you going to handcuff me delacroix asked its department policy bosch said we have to he came around the coffee table and turned delacroix so he could cuff his hands behind his back i was an actor you know i once played a prisoner in an episode of the fugitive the first series with david janssen it was just a small role i sat on a bench next to janssen thats all i did i was supposed to be on drugs i think bosch didnt say anything he gently pushed delacroix toward the trailers narrow door i dont know why i just remembered that delacroix said its all right edgar said people remember the strangest things at a time like this just be careful on these steps bosch said they led him out edgar in front and bosch behind him is there a key bosch asked on the kitchen counter there delacroix said bosch went back inside and found the keys he then started opening cabinets in the kitchenette until he found the box of cat food he opened it and dumped it out onto the paper plate under the table there was not very much food bosch knew he would have to do something about the animal later when bosch came out of the trailer edgar had already put delacroix into the rear of the slickback he saw a neighbor watching from the open front door of a nearby trailer he turned and closed and locked delacroixs door chapter bosch stuck his head into lt billetss office she was turned sideways at her desk and working on a computer at a side table her desk had been cleared she was about to go home for the day yes she said without looking to see who it was looks like we got lucky bosch said she turned from the computer and saw it was bosch let me guess delacroix invites you in and just sits down and confesses bosch nodded just about her eyes grew wide in surprise you are fucking kidding me he says he did it we had to shut him up so we could get him back here on tape it was like he had been waiting for us to show up billets asked a few more questions and bosch ended up recapping the entire visit to the trailer including the problem they had in not having a working tape recorder with which to take delacroixs confession billets grew concerned and annoyed equally with bosch and edgar for not being prepared and bradley of iad for not returning boschs tape recorder all i can say is that this better not put hair on the cake harry she said referring to the possibility of a legal challenge to any confession because delacroixs initial words were not on tape if we lose this one because of a screwup on our part she didnt finish but didnt need to look i think well be all right edgar got everything he said down verbatim we stopped as soon as we got enough to hook him up and now well lock it all down with sound and video billets seemed barely placated and what about miranda youre confident we will not have a miranda situation she said the last part not a question but an order i dont see it he started spouting off before we had a chance to advise him then he kept talking afterward sometimes it goes like that youre ready to go with the battering ram and they just open the door for you whoever he gets as a lawyer might have a heart attack and start screaming about it but nothings going to come of it were clean lieutenant billets nodded a sign that bosch was convincing her i wish they were all this easy she said what about the das office im calling them next okay which room if i want to take a look three okay harry go wrap him up she turned back to her computer bosch threw a salute at her and was about to duck out of the doorway when he stopped she sensed he had not left and turned back to him what is it bosch shrugged his shoulders i dont know the whole way in i was thinking about what could have been avoided if we just went to him instead of dancing around him gathering string harry i know what youre thinking and theres no way in the world you could have known that this guyafter twentysome yearswas just waiting for you to knock on his door you handled it the right way and if you had it to do again you would still do it the same way you circle the prey what happened with officer brasher had nothing to do with how you ran this case bosch looked at her for a moment and then nodded what she said would help ease his conscience billets turned back to her computer like i said go wrap him up bosch went back to the homicide table to call the district attorneys office to advise that an arrest had been made in a murder case and that a confession was being taken he talked to a supervisor named obrien and told her that either he or his partner would be coming in to file charges by the end of the day obrien who was familiar with the case only through media reports said she wanted to send a prosecutor to the station to oversee the handling of the confession and the forward movement of the case at this stage bosch knew that with rush hour traffic out of downtown it would still be a minimum of fortyfive minutes before the prosecutor got to the station he told obrien the prosecutor was welcome but that he wasnt going to wait for anyone before taking the suspects confession obrien suggested he should look this guy wants to talk bosch said in fortyfive minutes or an hour it could be a different story we cant wait tell your guy to knock on the door at room three when he gets here well bring him into it as soon as we can in a perfect world the prosecutor would be there for an interview but bosch knew from years working cases that a guilty conscience doesnt always stay guilty when someone tells you they want to confess to a killing you dont wait you turn on the tape recorder and say tell me all about it obrien reluctantly agreed citing her own experiences and they hung up bosch immediately picked the phone back up and called internal affairs and asked for carol bradley he was transferred this is bosch hollywood division wheres my damn tape recorder there was silence in response bradley hello are you im here i have your recorder here why did you take it i told you to listen to the tape i didnt say take my machine i dont need it anymore i wanted to review it and have the tape checked to make sure it was continuous then open it up and take the tape dont take the machine detective sometimes they need the original recorder to authenticate the tape bosch shook his head in frustration jesus why are you doing this you know who the leak is why are you wasting time again there was a pause before she answered i needed to cover all bases detective i need to run my investigation the way i see fit now bosch paused for a moment wondering if he was missing something if there was something else going on he finally decided he couldnt worry about it he had to keep his eyes on the prize his case cover the bases thats great he said well i almost lost a confession today because i didnt have my machine i would appreciate it if you would get it back to me im finished with it and am putting it in interoffice dispatch right now thank you goodbye he hung up just as edgar showed up at the table with three cups of coffee it made bosch think of something they should do whos got the watch down there he asked mankiewicz was in there edgar said so was young bosch poured the coffee from the styrofoam container into the mug he got out of his drawer he then picked up the phone and dialed the watch office mankiewicz answered you got anybody in the bat cave bosch i thought you might take some time off you thought wrong what about the cave no nobody till about eight today what do you need im about to take a confession and dont want any lawyer to be able to open the box once i wrap it my guy smells like ancient age but i think hes straight id like to make a record of it just the same this the bones case yeah bring him down and ill do it im certified thanks mank he hung up and looked at edgar lets take him down to the cave and see what he blows just to be safe good idea they took their coffees into interview room where they had earlier shackled delacroix to the tables center ring they released him from the cuffs and let him take a few gulps of his coffee before walking him down the back hallway to the stations small jail facility the jail essentially consisted of two large holding cells for drunks and prostitutes arrestees of a higher order were usually transported to the main city or county jail there was a small third cell that was known as the bat cave as in blood alcohol testing they met mankiewicz in the hallway and followed him to the cave where he turned on the breathalyzer and instructed delacroix to blow into a clear plastic tube attached to the machine bosch noticed that mankiewicz had a black mourning ribbon across his badge for brasher in a few minutes they had the result delacroix blew a not even close to the legal limit for driving there was no standard set for giving a confession to murder as they took delacroix out of the tank bosch felt mankiewicz tap his arm from behind he turned to face him while edgar headed back up the hallway with delacroix mankiewicz nodded harry i just wanted to say im sorry you know about what happened out there bosch knew he was talking about brasher he nodded back yeah thanks its a tough one i had to put her out there you know i knew she was green but hey mank you did the right thing dont secondguess anything mankiewicz nodded i gotta go bosch said while edgar returned delacroix to his spot in the interview room bosch went into the viewing room focused the video camera through the oneway glass and put in a new cassette he took from the supply cabinet he then turned on the camera as well as the backup sound recorder everything was set he went back into the interview room to finish wrapping the package chapter bosch identified the three occupants of the interview room and announced the date and time even though both of these would be printed on the lower frame of the video being recorded of the session he put a rights waiver form on the table and told delacroix he wanted to advise him one more time of his rights when he was finished he asked delacroix to sign the form and then moved it to the side of the table he took a gulp of coffee and started mr delacroix earlier today you expressed to me a desire to talk about what happened to your son arthur in nineteen eighty do you still wish to speak to us about that yes lets start with the basic questions and then we can go back and cover everything else did you cause the death of your son arthur delacroix yes i did he said it without hesitation or emotion did you kill him yes i did i didnt mean to but i did yes when did this occur it was in may i think of nineteen eighty i think thats when it was you people probably know more about it than me please dont assume that please answer each question to the best of your ability and recollection ill try where was your son killed in the house where we lived at the time in his room how was he killed did you strike him uh yes i delacroixs businesslike approach to the interview suddenly eroded and his face seemed to close in on itself he used the heels of his palms to wipe tears from the corners of his eyes you struck him yes where all over i guess including the head yes this was in his room you said yes his room what did you hit him with what do you mean did you use your fists or an object of some kind yes both my hands and an object what was the object you struck your son with i really cant remember ill have to it was just something he had there in his room i have to think we can come back to it mr delacroix why on that day did youfirst of all when did it happen what time of day it was in the morning after sheilashes my daughterhad gone to school thats really all i remember sheila was gone what about your wife the boys mother oh she was long gone shes the reason i started he stopped bosch assumed he was going to lay blame for his drinking on his wife which would conveniently blame her for everything that came out of the drinking including murder when was the last time you talked to your wife exwife i havent talked to her since the day she left that was he didnt finish he couldnt remember how long what about your daughter when did you talk to her last delacroix looked away from bosch and down at his hands on the table long time he said how long i dont remember we dont talk she helped me buy the trailer that was five or six years ago you didnt talk to her this week delacroix looked up at him a curious look on his face this week no why would let me ask the questions what about the news did you read any newspapers in the last couple weeks or watch the news on tv delacroix shook his head i dont like whats on television now i like to watch tapes bosch realized he had gotten off track he decided to get back to the basic story what was important for him to achieve here was a clear and simple confession to arthur delacroixs death it needed to be solid and detailed enough to stand up without a doubt bosch knew that at some point after delacroix got a lawyer the confession would be withdrawn they always were it would be challenged on all frontsfrom the procedures followed to the suspects state of mindand boschs duty was not only to take the confession but to make sure it survived and could eventually be delivered to twelve jurors lets get back to your son arthur do you remember what the object was you struck him with on the day of his death im thinking it was this little bat he had a miniature baseball bat that was like a souvenir from a dodgers game bosch nodded he knew what he was talking about they sold bats at the souvenir stands that were like the old billy clubs cops carried until they went to metal batons they could be lethal why did you hit him delacroix looked down at his hands bosch noticed his fingernails were gone it looked painful um i dont remember i was probably drunk i again the tears came in a burst and he hid his face in his tortured hands bosch waited until he dropped his hands and continued he he should have been in school and he wasnt i came in the room and there he was i got mad i paid good moneymoney i didnt havefor that school i started to yell i started to hit and then then i just picked up the little bat and i hit him i hit him too hard i guess i didnt mean to bosch waited again but delacroix didnt go on he was dead then delacroix nodded that means yes yes yes there was a soft knock on the door bosch nodded to edgar who got up and went out bosch assumed it was the prosecutor but he wasnt going to interrupt things now to make introductions he pressed on what did you do next after arthur was dead i took him out the back and down the steps to the garage nobody saw me i put him in the trunk of my car i then went back to his room i cleaned up and put some of his clothes in a bag what kind of bag it was his school bag his backpack what clothes did you put into it i dont remember whatever i grabbed out of the drawer you know all right can you describe this backpack delacroix shrugged his shoulders i dont remember it was just a normal backpack okay after you put clothes in it what did you do i put it in the trunk and i closed it what car was that that was my seventytwo impala you still have it i wish itd be a classic but i wrecked it that was my first dui what do you mean wrecked i totaled it i wrapped it around a palm tree in beverly hills it was taken to a junkyard somewhere bosch knew that tracing a thirtyyearold car would be difficult but news that the vehicle had been totaled ended all hope of finding it and checking the trunk for physical evidence then lets go back to your story you had the body in the trunk when did you dispose of it that night late when he didnt come home from school that day we started looking for him we sheila and me we drove around and we looked we went to all the skateboard spots and all the time arthurs body was in the trunk of the car you were in thats right you see i didnt want her to know what i had done i was protecting her i understand did you make a missing person report with the police delacroix shook his head no i went to the wilshire station and talked to a cop he was right there where you walk in at the desk he told me arthur probably ran away and hed be back to give it a few days so i didnt make out the report bosch was trying to cover as many markers as he could going over story facts that could be verified and therefore used to buttress the confession when delacroix and his lawyer withdrew it and denied it the best way to do this was with hard evidence or scientific fact but crossmatching stories was also important sheila delacroix had already told bosch and edgar that she and her father had driven to the police station on the night arthur didnt come home her father went in while she waited in the car but bosch found no record of a missing person report it now seemed to fit he had a marker that would help validate the confession mr delacroix are you comfortable talking to me yeah sure you are not feeling coerced or threatened in any way no im fine you are talking freely to me right thats right okay when did you take your sons body from the trunk i did that later after sheila went to sleep i went back out to the car and i took it to where i could hide the body and where was that up in the hills laurel canyon can you remember more specifically where not too much i went up lookout mountain past the school up in around there it was dark and i you know i was drinking because i felt so bad about the accident you know accident hitting arthur too hard like i did oh so up past the school do you remember what road you were on wonderland wonderland are you sure no but thats what i think it was ive spent all these years i tried to forget as much about this as i could so youre saying you were intoxicated when you hid the body i was drunk dont you think id have to be it doesnt matter what i think bosch felt the first tremor of danger go through him while delacroix was offering a complete confession bosch had elicited information that might be damaging to the case as well delacroix being drunk could explain why the body had apparently been hurriedly dropped in the hillside woods and quickly covered with loose soil and pine needles but bosch recalled his own difficult climb up the hill and couldnt imagine an intoxicated man doing it while carrying or dragging the body of his own son along with him not to mention the backpack would it have been carried along with the body or did delacroix climb back up the hill a second time with the bag somehow finding the same spot in the dark where he had left the body bosch studied delacroix trying to figure out which way to go he had to be very careful it would be case suicide to bring out a response that a defense attorney could later exploit for days in court all i remember delacroix suddenly said unbidden is that it took me a long time i was gone almost all night and i remember that i hugged him as tight as i could before i put him down in the hole it was like i had a funeral for him delacroix nodded and searched boschs eyes as if looking for an acknowledgment that he had done the right thing bosch returned nothing with his look lets start with that he said the hole you put him into how deep was it it wasnt that deep maybe a couple feet at the most how did you dig it did you have tools with you no i didnt think about that so i had to dig with my hands i didnt get very far either what about the backpack um i put it there too in the hole but im not sure bosch nodded okay do you remember anything else about this place was it steep or flat or muddy delacroix shook his head i cant remember were there houses there there was some right nearby yeah but nobody saw me if thats what you mean bosch finally concluded that he was going too far down a path of legal peril he had to stop and go back and clean up a few details what about your sons skateboard what about it what did you do with it delacroix leaned forward to consider this you know i dont really remember did you bury it with him i cant i dont remember bosch waited a long moment to see if something would come out delacroix said nothing okay mr delacroix were going to take a break here while i go talk to my partner i want you to think about what we were just talking about about the place where you took your son i need you to remember more about it and about the skateboard too okay ill try ill bring you back some more coffee that would be good bosch got up and took the empties from the room he immediately went to the viewing room and opened the door edgar and another man were in there the man whom bosch didnt know was looking at delacroix through the oneway glass edgar was reaching to the video to turn it off dont turn it off bosch said quickly edgar held back let it run if he starts remembering more stuff i dont want anybody to try to say we gave it to him edgar nodded the other man turned from the window and put out his hand he looked like he was no more than thirty he had dark hair that was slicked back and very white skin he had a broad smile on his face hi george portugal deputy district attorney bosch put the empty cups down on a table and shook his hand looks like youve got an interesting case here portugal said and getting more so all the time bosch said well from what ive seen in the last ten minutes you dont have a worry in the world this is a slam dunk bosch nodded but didnt return the smile what he wanted to do was laugh at the inanity of portugals statement he knew better than to trust the instincts of young prosecutors he thought of all that had happened before they had gotten delacroix into the room on the other side of the glass and he knew there was no such thing as a slam dunk chapter at pm bosch and edgar drove samuel delacroix downtown to be booked at parker center on charges of murdering his son with portugal in the interview room taking part in the questioning they had interrogated delacroix for almost another hour gleaning only a few new details about the killing the fathers memory of his sons death and his part in it had been eroded by twenty years of guilt and whiskey portugal left the room still believing the case was a slam dunk bosch on the other hand was not so sure he was never as welcoming of voluntary confessions as other detectives and prosecutors were he believed true remorse was rare in the world he treated the unanticipated confession with extreme caution always looking for the play behind the words to him every case was like a house under construction when a confession came into play it became the concrete slab the house was built upon if it was mixed wrong or poured wrong the house might not withstand the jolt of the first earthquake as he drove delacroix toward parker center bosch couldnt help but think there were unseen cracks in this houses foundation and that the earthquake was coming boschs thoughts were interrupted by his cell phone chirping it was lt billets you guys slipped out of here before we had a chance to talk were taking him down to booking you sound happy about it well i cant really talk youre in the car with him yeah is it serious or are you just playing mother hen i dont know yet ive got irving and media relations calling me i guess word is already out through the das press office that charges are coming how do you want me to handle it bosch looked at his watch he figured that after booking delacroix they could get to sheila delacroixs house by eight the trouble was that an announcement to the media might mean that reporters would get to her before that tell you what we want to get to the daughter first can you get to the das office and see if they can hold it till nine same with media relations no problem and look after you dump the guy call me when you can talk at home if theres a problem i want to know about it you got it he closed the phone and looked over at edgar first thing portugal mustve done was call his press office figures probably his first big case hes going to milk it for all he can yeah they drove in silence for a few minutes bosch thought about what he had insinuated to billets he couldnt quite place his reason for discomfort the case was now moving from the realm of the police investigation to the realm of the court system there was still a lot of investigative work to be done but all cases changed once a suspect was charged and in custody and the prosecution began most times bosch felt a sense of relief and fulfillment at the moment he was taking a killer to be booked he felt as though he was a prince of the city that he had made a difference in some way but not this time and he wasnt sure why he finally tied off his feelings on his own missteps and the uncontrollable movements of the case he decided he could not celebrate or feel much like a prince of the city when the case had cost so much yes they had the admitted killer of a child in the car with them and they were taking him to jail but nicholas trent and julia brasher were dead the house he had built of the case would always have rooms containing their ghosts they would always haunt him was that my daughter you were talking about youre going to talk to her bosch looked up into the rearview mirror delacroix was hunched forward because his hands were cuffed behind his back bosch had to adjust the mirror and turn on the dome light to see his eyes yeah were going to give her the news do you have to do you have to bring her into this bosch watched him in the mirror for a moment delacroixs eyes were shifting back and forth weve got no choice bosch said its her brother her father bosch put the car onto the los angeles street exit they would be at the booking entrance at the back of parker center in five minutes what are you going to tell her what you told us that you killed arthur we want to tell her before the reporters get to her or she sees it on the news he checked the mirror he saw delacroix nod his approval then the mans eyes came up and looked at boschs in the mirror will you tell her something for me tell her what bosch reached inside his coat pocket for his recorder but then realized he didnt have it with him he silently cursed bradley and his own decision to cooperate with iad delacroix was quiet for a moment he moved his head as he looked from side to side as if searching for the thing he wanted to say to his daughter then he looked back up at the mirror and spoke just tell her that im sorry for everything just like that sorry for everything tell her that youre sorry for everything i got it anything else no just that edgar shifted in his seat so he could look back at delacroix youre sorry huh he said seems kind of late after twenty years dont you think bosch turned right onto los angeles street he couldnt check the mirror for delacroixs reaction you dont know anything delacroix angrily retorted ive been crying for twenty years yeah edgar threw back crying in your whiskey but not enough to do anything about it until we showed up not enough to crawl out of your bottle and turn yourself in and get your boy out of the dirt while there was still enough of him for a proper burial all we have is bones you know bones bosch now checked the mirror delacroix shook his head and leaned even further forward until his head was against the back of the front seat i couldnt he said i didnt even he stopped himself and bosch watched the mirror as delacroixs shoulders started to shake he was crying didnt even what bosch asked delacroix didnt respond didnt even what bosch asked louder then he heard delacroix vomit onto the floor of the back compartment ah shit edgar yelled i knew this was going to happen the car filled with the acrid smell of a drunk tank alcoholbased vomit bosch lowered his window all the way despite the brisk january air edgar did the same bosch turned the car into parker center its your turn i think bosch said i got the last one that wit we pulled out of bar marmount i know i know edgar said just what i wanna be doing before dinner bosch pulled into one of the spaces near the intake doors that were reserved for vehicles carrying prisoners a booking officer standing by the door started heading toward the car bosch recalled julia brashers complaint about having to clean vomit out of the back of patrol cars it was almost like she was jabbing him in the sore ribs again making him smile despite the pain chapter sheila delacroix answered the door of the home where she and her brother had lived but only one of them had grown up she was wearing black leggings and a long tshirt that went almost to her knees her face was scrubbed of makeup and bosch noticed for the first time that she had a pretty face when it was not hidden by paint and powder her eyes grew wide when she recognized bosch and edgar detectives i wasnt expecting you she made no move to invite them in bosch spoke sheila we have been able to identify the remains from laurel canyon as those of your brother arthur we are sorry to have to tell you this can we come in for a few minutes she nodded as she received the information and leaned for just a moment on the door frame bosch wondered if she would leave the place now that there was no chance of arthur ever coming back she stepped aside and waved them in please she said signaling them to sit down as they moved to the living room everybody took the same seats as they had before bosch noticed the box of photos she had retrieved the other day was still on the coffee table the photos were neatly stacked in rows in the box now sheila noticed his glance i kind of put them in order i had been meaning to get around to it for a long time bosch nodded he waited until she took her seat before sitting down last and continuing he and edgar had worked out how the visit should go on the way over sheila delacroix was going to be an important component of the case they had her fathers confession and the evidence of the bones but what would pull it all together would be her story they needed her to tell what it was like growing up in the delacroix house uh theres more sheila we wanted to talk to you before you saw it on the news late today your father was charged with arthurs murder oh my god she leaned forward and brought her elbows down to her knees she clasped her hands into fists and held them tight against her mouth she closed her eyes and her hair fell forward helping to hide her face hes being held down at parker center pending his arraignment tomorrow and a bail hearing i would say that from the looks of thingshis lifestyle i meani dont think hell be able to make the kind of bail theyre going to be talking about she opened her eyes there must be some kind of mistake what about the man the man across the street he killed himself he must be the one we dont think so sheila my father couldnt have done this actually edgar said softly he confessed to it she straightened herself and bosch saw the true surprise on her face and this surprised him he thought she would have always harbored the idea the suspicion about her father he told us that he hit him with a baseball bat because he skipped school bosch said your father said he was drinking at the time and that he just lost it and he hit him too hard an accident according to him sheila stared back at him as she tried to process this information he then put your brothers body in the trunk of the car he told us that when you two drove around looking for him that night he was in the trunk all along she closed her eyes again then later that night edgar continued while you were sleeping he snuck out and drove up into the hills and dumped the body sheila started shaking her head like she was trying to fend off the words no no he did you ever see your father strike arthur bosch asked sheila looked at him seemingly coming out of her daze no never are you sure about that she shook her head nothing more than a swat on the behind when he was small and being a brat thats all bosch looked over at edgar and then back at the woman who was leaning forward again looking down at the floor by her feet sheila i know were talking about your father here but were also talking about your brother he didnt get much of a chance at life did he he waited and after a long moment she shook her head without looking up we have your fathers confession and we have evidence arthurs bones tell us a story sheila there are injuries a lot of them from his whole life she nodded what we need is another voice someone who can tell us what it was like for arthur to grow up in this house to try to grow up edgar added sheila straightened herself and used her palms to smear tears across her cheeks all i can tell you is that i never saw him hit my brother never once she wiped more tears away her face was becoming shiny and distorted this is unbelievable she said all i did all i wanted was to see if that was arthur up there and now i should have never called you people i shouldve she didnt finish she pinched the bridge of her nose in an effort to stop the tears sheila edgar said if your father didnt do it why would he tell us he did she sharply shook her head and seemed to grow agitated why would he tell us to tell you he said he was sorry i dont know hes sick he drinks maybe he wants the attention i dont know he was an actor you know bosch pulled the box of photos across the coffee table and used his finger to go through one of the rows he saw a photo of arthur as maybe a fiveyearold he pulled it out and studied it there was no hint in the picture that the boy was doomed that the bones beneath the flesh were already damaged he slid the photo back into its place and looked up at the woman their eyes held sheila will you help us she looked away from him i cant chapter bosch pulled the car to a stop in front of the drainage culvert and quickly cut the engine he didnt want to draw any attention from the residents on wonderland avenue being in a slickback exposed him but he hoped it was late enough that all the curtains would be drawn across all the windows bosch was alone in the car his partner having gone home for the night he reached down and pushed the trunk release button he leaned to the side window and looked up into the darkness of the hillside he could tell that the special services unit had already been out and removed the network of ramps and staircases that led to the crime scene this was the way bosch wanted it he wanted it to be as close as possible to the way it was when samuel delacroix had dragged his sons body up the hillside in the dead of night the flashlight came on and momentarily startled bosch he hadnt realized he had his thumb on the button he turned it off and looked out at the quiet houses on the circle bosch was following his instincts returning to the place where it had all begun he had a guy in lockup for a murder more than twenty years old but it didnt feel good to him something wasnt right and he was going to start here he reached up and switched the dome light off he quietly opened the door and got out with the flashlight at the back of the car he looked around once more and raised the lid lying in the trunk was a test dummy he had borrowed from jesper at the sid lab dummies were used on occasion in the restaging of crimes particularly suspicious suicide jumps and hitandruns the sid had an assortment ranging in size from infant to adult the weight of each dummy could be manipulated by adding or removing onepound sandbags from zippered pockets on the torso and limbs the dummy in boschs trunk had sid stenciled across the chest it had no face in the lab bosch and jesper had used sandbags to make it weigh seventy pounds the estimated weight golliher had given to arthur delacroix based on bone size and the photos of the boy the dummy wore a storebought backpack similar to the one recovered during the excavation it was stuffed with old rags from the trunk of the slickback in an approximation of the clothing found buried with the bones bosch put the flashlight down and grabbed the dummy by its upper arms and pulled it out of the trunk he hefted it up and over his left shoulder he stepped back to get his balance and then reached back into the trunk for the flashlight it was a cheap drugstore light the kind samuel delacroix told them he had used the night he buried his son bosch turned it on stepped over the curb and headed for the hillside bosch started to climb but immediately realized he needed both his hands to grab tree limbs to help pull him up the incline he shoved the flashlight into one of his front pockets and its beam largely illuminated the upper reaches of the trees and was useless to him he fell twice in the first five minutes and quickly exhausted himself before getting thirty feet up the steep slope without the flashlight illuminating his path he didnt see a small leafless branch he was passing and it raked across his cheek cutting it open bosch cursed but kept going at fifty feet up bosch took his first break dropping the dummy next to the trunk of a monterey pine and then sitting down on its chest he pulled his tshirt up out of his pants and used the cloth to help stanch the flow of blood on his cheek the wound stung from the sweat that was dripping down his face okay sid lets go he said when he had caught his breath for the next twenty feet he pulled the dummy up the slope the progress was slower but it was easier than carrying the full weight and it was also the way delacroix told them he remembered doing it after one more break bosch made it the last thirty feet to the level spot and dragged the dummy into the clearing beneath the acacia trees he dropped to his knees and sat back on his heels bullshit he said while gulping breath this is bullshit he couldnt see delacroix doing it he was maybe ten years older than delacroix had been when he had supposedly accomplished the same feat but bosch was in good shape for a man his age he was also sober something delacroix claimed he had not been even though bosch had been able to get the body to the burial spot his gut instinct told him delacroix had lied to them he had not done it the way he claimed he either didnt take the body up the hill or hed had help and there was a third possibility that arthur delacroix had been alive and climbed up the hill by himself his breathing finally returned to normal bosch leaned his head back and looked up through the opening in the canopy of the trees he could see the night sky and a partial piece of the moon behind a cloud he realized he could smell burning wood from a fireplace in one of the houses on the circle below he pulled the flashlight from his pocket and reached down to a strap sewn onto the back of the dummy since taking the dummy down the hill was not part of the test he intended to pull it by the carrying strap he was about to get up when he heard movement in the ground cover about thirty feet to his left bosch immediately extended the flashlight in the direction of the noise and caught a fleeting glimpse of a coyote moving in the brush the animal quickly moved out of the light beam and disappeared bosch swept the light back and forth but couldnt find it he got up and started dragging the dummy toward the slope the law of gravity made going down easier but just as treacherous as he carefully and slowly chose his steps bosch wondered about the coyote he wondered how long coyotes lived and if the one he had seen tonight could have watched another man twenty years before as he buried a body in the same spot bosch made it down the hill without falling when he carried the dummy out to the curb he saw dr guyot and his dog standing next to the slickback the dog was on a leash bosch quickly went to the trunk dumped in the dummy and then slammed it closed guyot came around to the back of his car detective bosch he seemed to know better than to ask what bosch was doing dr guyot how are you better than you im afraid youve hurt yourself again that looks like a nasty laceration bosch touched his cheek it still stung its all right just a scratch you better keep calamity on the leash i just saw a coyote up there yes i never take her off the leash at night the hills are full of roaming coyotes we hear them at night you better come with me to the house i can butterfly that if you dont do it right it will scar a memory of julia brasher asking about his scars suddenly came into boschs mind he looked at guyot okay they left the car on the circle and walked down to guyots house in the back office bosch sat on the desk while the doctor cleaned the cut on his cheek and then used two butterfly bandages to close it i think youll recover guyot said as he closed his firstaid kit i dont know if your shirt will though bosch looked down at his tshirt it was stained with his blood at the bottom thanks for fixing me up doc how long do i have to leave these things on few days if you can stand it bosch gently touched his cheek it was swelling slightly but the wound was no longer stinging guyot turned from his firstaid kit and looked at him and bosch knew he wanted to say something he guessed he was going to ask about the dummy what is it doctor the officer that was here that first night the woman she was the one who got killed bosch nodded yes that was her guyot shook his head in genuine sadness he slowly stepped around the desk and sank into the chair its funny sometimes how things go he said chain reaction mr trent across the street that officer all because a dog fetched a bone a most natural thing to do all bosch could do was nod he started tucking in his shirt to see if it would hide the part with blood stains guyot looked down at his dog who was lying in the spot next to the desk chair i wish that id never taken her off that leash he said i really do bosch slid off the desk and stood up he looked down at his midsection the blood stain could not be seen but it didnt matter because the shirt was stained with his sweat i dont know about that dr guyot he said i think if you start thinking that way then youll never be able to come out your door again they looked at each other and exchanged nods bosch pointed to his cheek thanks for this he said i can find my way out he turned toward the door guyot stopped him on television there was a commercial for the news they said the police announced an arrest in the case i was going to watch it at eleven bosch looked back at him from the doorway dont believe everything you see on tv chapter the phone rang just as bosch had finished watching the first session of samuel delacroixs confession he picked up the remote and muted the sound on his television and then answered the call it was lieutenant billets i thought you were going to call me bosch took a pull from the bottle of beer he was holding and put it down on the table next to his television chair sorry i forgot still feeling the same way about things more so well what is it harry i dont think ive ever seen a detective more upset about a confession before its a lot of things somethings going on what do you mean i mean im beginning to think that maybe he didnt do it that maybe hes setting something up and i dont know what billets was quiet a long moment probably not sure how to respond what does jerry think she finally asked i dont know what he thinks hes happy to clear the case we all are harry but not if hes not the guy do you have anything concrete anything to back up these doubts you are having bosch gently touched his cheek the swelling had gone down but the wound itself was sore to the touch he couldnt stop himself from touching it i went up to the crime scene tonight with a dummy from sid seventy pounds i got it up there but it was a hell of a fight okay so you proved it could be done wheres the problem i hauled a dummy up there this guy was dragging his dead sons body i was straight delacroix says he was looped i had been up there before he hadnt i dont think he couldve done it at least not alone you think he had help the daughter maybe maybe he had help and maybe he was never there i dont know we talked to the daughter tonight and she wont come across on the father wont say a word so you start to think maybe it was the two of them but then no if she was involved why would she call us and give us the id on the bones doesnt make sense billets didnt respond bosch looked at his watch and saw it was eleven oclock he wanted to watch the news he used the remote to turn off the vcr and put the tv on channel you got the news on he asked billets yes four it was the lead storyfather kills son and then buries the body arrested twentysome years later because of a dog a perfect la story bosch watched silently and so did billets on her end the report by judy surtain had no inaccuracies that bosch picked up on he was surprised not bad he said when it was over they finally get it right he muted the television again just as the anchor segued to the next story he was silent for a moment as he watched the television the story was about the human bones found at the la brea tar pits golliher was shown at a press conference standing in front of a cluster of microphones harry come on billets said what else is bugging you theres got to be more than just your feeling that he couldnt have done it and as far as the daughter goes it doesnt bug me that she made the call with the id she saw it on the news right the story about trent maybe she thought she could just pin it on trent after twenty years of worrying she had a way to put it on somebody else bosch shook his head though he knew she could not see this he just didnt think sheila would call the tip line if she had been involved in her brothers death i dont know he said it doesnt really work for me then what are you going to do im going through everything now ill start over whens the arraignment tomorrow yup you dont have enough time harry i know but im doing it i already picked up a contradiction i didnt see before what delacroix said he killed arthur in the morning after he discovered the boy hadnt gone to school when we interviewed the daughter the first time she said arthur didnt come home from school theres a difference there billets made a chortling sound in the phone harry thats minor its been more than twenty years and hes a drunk i assume you are going to check the schools records tomorrow then you get it ironed out then but how would the sister know for sure whether he went to school or not all she knows is that he wasnt home afterward youre not convincing me of anything i know im not trying to im just telling you about the things im looking at did you guys find anything when you searched his trailer we didnt search it yet he started talking almost as soon as we got in there were going tomorrow after the arraignment whats the window on the warrant fortyeight hours were all right talking about the trailer made bosch suddenly remember delacroixs cat they had gotten so involved in the suspects confession that bosch had forgotten to make arrangements for the animal shit what nothing i forgot about the guys cat delacroix has a cat i said id get a neighbor to take care of it shouldve called animal control he was on to us about that hey you have cats right yeah but im not taking in this guys no i dont mean that i just want to know like how long do they last without food and some water you mean you didnt leave any food for the cat no we did but its probably gone by now well if you fed it today it can probably last until tomorrow but it wont be too happy about it maybe tear the place up a little bit looked like it already had listen i gotta go i want to watch the rest of the tape and see how we sit all right ill let you go but harry dont kick a gift horse in the mouth you know what i mean i think so they hung up then and bosch started the videotape of the confession again but almost immediately he turned it back off the cat was bugging him he should have made arrangements for it to be taken care of he decided to go back out chapter as bosch approached delacroixs trailer he saw light behind every curtain of every window there had been no lights on when they left with delacroix twelve hours earlier he drove on by and pulled into the open parking space of a lot several trailers away he left the box of cat food in the car walked back to delacroixs trailer and watched it from the same position where he had stood when edgar had hit the door with his warrant knock despite the late hour the freeways hiss was ever present and hindered his ability to hear sounds or movement from within the trailer he slipped his gun out of its holster and went to the door he carefully and quietly stepped up onto the cinder blocks and tried the doorknob it turned he leaned to the door and listened but still could hear nothing from within he waited another moment slowly and silently turned the knob and then pulled the door open while raising his weapon the living room was empty bosch stepped in and swept the trailer with his eyes no one he pulled the door closed without a sound he looked through the kitchen and down the hallway to the bedroom the door was partially closed and he could not see anyone but he heard banging sounds like somebody closing drawers he started moving through the kitchen the smell of cat urine was horrible he noticed the plate on the floor under the table was clean the water bowl almost empty he moved into the hallway and was six feet from the bedroom door when it opened and a headdown figure came toward him sheila delacroix screamed when she looked up and saw bosch bosch raised his gun and then immediately lowered it when he recognized who it was sheila raised her hand to her chest her eyes growing wide what are you doing here she said bosch holstered his weapon i was going to ask you the same thing its my fathers place i have a key and she shook her head and shrugged i was i was worried about the cat i was looking for the cat what happened to your face bosch moved past her in the tight space and stepped into the bedroom had an accident he looked around the room and saw no cat or anything else that drew his attention i think hes under the bed bosch looked back at her the cat i couldnt get him out bosch came back to the door and touched her shoulder directing her to the living room lets go sit down in the living room she sat down in the recliner while bosch remained standing what were you looking for i told you the cat i heard you opening and closing drawers the cat like to hide in drawers sheila shook her head as if to say he was bothering over nothing i was just curious about my father while i was here i looked around thats all and wheres your car i parked it by the front office i didnt know if thered be any parking here so i parked there and walked in and you were going to walk the cat back on a leash or something no i was going to carry him why are you asking me all these questions bosch studied her he could tell she was lying but he wasnt sure what he should or could do about it he decided to throw her a fastball sheila listen to me if you were in any way involved with what happened to your brother nows the time to tell me and to try to make a deal what are you talking about did you help your father that night did you help him carry your brother up the hill and bury him she brought her hands up to her face so quickly it was as if bosch had thrown acid in her eyes through her hands she yelled oh my god oh my god i cant believe this is happening what are you she just as abruptly dropped her hands and stared at him with bewildered eyes you think i had something to do with it how could you think that bosch waited a moment for her to calm down before answering i think youre not telling me the truth about whats going on here so it makes me suspicious and it means i have to consider all possibilities she abruptly stood up am i under arrest bosch shook his head no sheila youre not but i would appreciate it if youd tell me the then im leaving she stepped around the coffee table and headed for the door with a purposeful stride what about the cat bosch asked she didnt stop she was through the door and into the night bosch heard her answer from outside you take care of it bosch stepped to the door and watched her walking down the trailer parks access road out toward the management building where her car was parked yeah he said to himself he leaned against the door frame and breathed some of the untainted air from the outside he thought about sheila and what she might have been doing after a while he checked his watch and looked back over his shoulder at the interior of the trailer it was after midnight and he was tired but he decided he was going to stay and look for whatever it was she had been looking for he felt something brush up against his leg and looked down to see a black cat rubbing up against him he gently pushed it away with his leg he didnt care much for cats the animal came back and insisted on rubbing its head against boschs leg again bosch stepped back into the trailer causing the cat to make a cautionary retreat of a few feet wait here bosch said ive got some food in the car chapter downtown arraignment court was always a zoo when bosch entered the courtroom at ten minutes before nine on friday morning he saw no judge yet on the bench but a flurry of lawyers conferring and moving about the front of the courtroom like ants on a kickedover hill it took a seasoned veteran to know and understand what was going on at any given time in arraignment court bosch first scanned the rows of public seating for sheila delacroix but didnt see her he next looked for his partner and portugal the prosecutor but they werent in the courtroom either he did notice that two cameramen were setting up equipment next to the bailiffs desk their position would give them a clear view of the glass prisoner docket once court was in session bosch moved forward and pushed through the gate he took out his badge palmed it and showed it to the bailiff who had been studying a computer printout of the days arraignment schedule you got a samuel delacroix on there he asked arrested wednesday or thursday thursday yesterday the bailiff flipped the top sheet over and ran his finger down a list he stopped at delacroixs name got it when will he come up weve still got some wednesdays to finish when we get to thursdays it will depend on who his lawyer is private or public itll be a pd i think they go in order youre looking at an hour at least thats if the judge starts at nine last i heard he wasnt here yet thanks bosch moved toward the prosecution table having to weave around two groupings of defense lawyers telling war stories while waiting for the judge to take the bench in the first position at the table was a woman bosch didnt recognize she would be the arraignments deputy assigned to the courtroom she would routinely handle eighty percent of the arraignments as most of the cases were minor in nature and had not yet been assigned to prosecutors in front of her on the table was a stack of filesthe mornings caseshalf a foot high bosch showed her his badge too do you know if george portugal is coming down for the delacroix arraignment its a thursday yes he is she said without looking up i just talked to him she now looked up and bosch saw her eyes go to the cut on his cheek hed taken the butterfly bandages off before his shower that morning but the wound was still quite noticeable its not going to happen for an hour or so delacroix has a public defender that looks like it hurts only when i smile can i use your phone until the judge comes out bosch picked up the phone and called the das office which was three floors above he asked for portugal and was transferred yeah its bosch all right if i come up weve gotta talk im here until im called down to arraignments see you in five on the way out bosch told the bailiff that if a detective named edgar checked in he should be sent up to the das office the bailiff said no problem the hallway outside the courtroom was teeming with lawyers and citizens all with some business with the courts everybody seemed to be on a cell phone the marble floor and high ceiling took all of the voices and multiplied them into a fierce cacophony of white noise bosch ducked into the little snack bar and had to wait more than five minutes in line just to buy a coffee after he was out he legged it up the fire exit stairs because he didnt want to lose another five minutes waiting for one of the horribly slow elevators when he stepped into portugals small office edgar was already there we were beginning to wonder where you were portugal said what the hell happened to you edgar added after seeing boschs cheek its a long story and im about to tell it he took the other chair in front of portugals desk and put his coffee down on the floor next to him he realized he should have brought cups for portugal and edgar so he decided not to drink in front of them he opened his briefcase on his lap and took out a folded section of the los angeles times he closed the briefcase and put it on the floor so whats going on portugal said clearly anxious about the reason bosch had called the meeting bosch started unfolding the newspaper whats going on is we charged the wrong guy and we better fix it before he gets arraigned whoa shit i knew you were going to say something like that portugal said i dont know if i want to hear this you are messing up a good thing bosch i dont care what im doing if the guy didnt do it he didnt do it but he told us he did it several times look edgar said to portugal let harry say what he wants to say we dont want to fuck this up it may be too late with mr cantleaveagoodthingalone here harry just go on whats wrong bosch told them about taking the dummy up to wonderland avenue and recreating delacroixs supposed trek up the steep hillside i made itjust barely he said gently touching his cheek but the point is del yeah you made it portugal said you made it so delacroix could have made it whats the problem with that the problem is that i was sober when i did it and he says he wasnt i also knew where i was going i knew it leveled off up there he didnt this is all minor bullshit no whats bullshit is delacroixs story nobody dragged that kids body up there he was alive when he was up there somebody killed him up there portugal shook his head in frustration this is all wild conjecture detective bosch im not going to stop this whole process because its conjecture not wild conjecture bosch looked over at edgar but his partner didnt look back at him he had a glum look on his face bosch looked back at portugal look im not done theres more after i got home last night i remembered delacroixs cat we left it in his trailer and told him wed take care of it but we forgot so i went back bosch could hear edgar breathing heavily and he knew what the problem was edgar had been left out of the loop by his own partner it was embarrassing for him to be getting this information at the same time as portugal in a perfect world bosch would have told him what he had before going to the prosecutor but there hadnt been time for that all i was going to do was feed the cat but when i got there somebody was already in the trailer it was his daughter sheila edgar said what was she doing there the news was apparently surprising enough for edgar to no longer care if portugal knew he was out of the latest investigative moves she was searching the place she claimed she was there for the cat too but she was searching the place when i got there for what edgar said she wouldnt tell me she claimed she wasnt looking for anything but after she left i stayed i found some things bosch held up the newspaper this is sundays metro section it has a pretty big story on the case mostly a generic feature about forensics on cases like this but theres a lot of detail about our case from an unnamed source mostly about the crime scene bosch thought after reading the article the first time in delacroixs trailer the night before that the source was probably teresa corazon since she was quoted by name in the article in regard to generic information about bone cases he was aware of the trading that went on between reporters and sources direct attribution for some information no attribution for other information but the identity of the source wasnt important to the present discussion and he didnt bring it up so there was an article portugal asked what does it mean well it reveals that the bones were in a shallow grave and that it appeared that the body was not buried with the use of any tools it also says that a knapsack had been buried along with the body a lot of other details also details left out like no mention of the kids skateboard your point being portugal asked with a bored tone in his voice that if you were going to put together a false confession a lot of what youd need is right here oh come on detective delacroix gave us much more than the crime scene details he gave us the killing itself the driving around with the body all of that all of that was easy it cant be proved or disproved there were no witnesses well never find the car because its been squashed to the size of a mailbox in some junkyard in the valley all we have is his story and the only place where his story meets the physical evidence is the crime scene and every marker he gave us he could have gotten from this he tossed the newspaper onto portugals desk but the prosecutor didnt even look at it he leaned his elbows on the desk and brought his hands flat against each other and spread his fingers wide bosch could see his muscles flexing under his shirtsleeves and realized he was doing some kind of an atyourdesk exercise portugal spoke while his hands pushed against each other i work out the tension this way he finally stopped releasing his breath loudly and leaning back in his seat okay he had the ability to concoct a confession if he wanted to do it why would he want to do it were talking about his own son why would he say he killed his own son if he didnt because of these bosch said he reached into his inside jacket pocket and took out an envelope that was folded in half he leaned forward and gently put it down on top of the newspaper on portugals desk as portugal picked up the envelope and started to open it bosch said i think that was what sheila was looking for in the trailer last night i found it in the night table next to her fathers bed it was underneath the bottom drawer a hiding place there you had to take the drawer out to find it she didnt do that from the envelope portugal took a stack of polaroid photos he started looking through them oh god he said almost immediately is this her the daughter i dont want to look at these he shuffled through the remaining photos quickly and put them down on the desk edgar got up and leaned over the desk with one finger he spread the photos out on the desk so he could view them his jaw drew tight but he didnt say anything the photos were old the white borders were yellowed the colors of the images almost washed out by time bosch used polaroids on the job all the time he knew by the degradation of the colors that the photos on the desk were far more than a decade old and some of them were older than others there were fourteen photos in all the constant in each was a naked girl based on physical changes to the girls body and hair length he had guessed that the photos spanned at least a fiveyearperiod the girl innocently smiled in some of the photos in others there was sadness and maybe even anger evident in her eyes it had been clear to bosch from the moment he first looked at them that the girl in the photos was sheila delacroix edgar sat back down heavily bosch could no longer tell if he was upset by being so far behind on the case or by the content of the photos yesterday this was a slam dunk portugal said today its a can of worms i assume you are going to give me your theory on these detective bosch bosch nodded you start with a family he said as he spoke he leaned forward and collected the photos squared the edges and put them back in the envelope he didnt like them being on display he held the envelope in his hand for one reason or another the mothers weak he said too young to marry too young to have kids the boy she has is too hard to handle she sees where her life is going and she decides she doesnt want to go there she ups and splits and that leaves sheila to pick up with the boy and to fend for herself with the father bosch glanced from portugal to edgar to see how he was playing so far both men seemed hooked by the story bosch held the envelope with the photos up obviously a hellish life and what could she do about it she could blame her mother her father her brother but who could she lash out against her mother was gone her father was big and overpowering in control that only left arthur he noticed a subtle shake of edgars head what are you saying that she killed him that doesnt make sense shes the one who called us and gave us the id i know but her father doesnt know she called us edgar frowned portugal leaned forward and started doing his hand exercise again i dont think i am following you detective he said how does this have anything to do with whether or not he killed the son bosch also leaned forward and became more animated he held the envelope up again as if it was the answer to everything dont you see the bones all the injuries we had it wrong it wasnt the father who hurt him it was her sheila she was abused and she turned right around and became the abuser to arthur portugal dropped his hands to the desk and shook his head so you are saying that she killed the boy and then twenty years later called up and gave you a key clue in the investigation dont tell me youre going to say she has amnesia about killing him right bosch let the sarcasm go no im saying she didnt kill him but her record of abuse led her father to suspect she did all these years arthurs been gone the father thought she did it and he knew why once more bosch proffered the envelope of photos and so he carried the guilt of knowing his actions with sheila caused it all then the bones come up he reads it in the paper and puts two and two together we show up and he starts confessing before were three feet in the door portugal raised his hands wide why bosch had been turning it over in his mind ever since he had found the photos redemption oh please im serious the guys getting old broken down when you have more to look back at than forward to you start thinking about the things youve done you try making up for things he thinks his daughter killed his son because of his own actions so now hes willing to take the fall for her after all whats he got to lose he lives in a trailer next to the freeway and works at a driving range this is a guy who once had a shot at fame and fortune now look at him he could be looking at this as his last shot at making up for everything and hes wrong about her but doesnt know it thats right portugal kicked his chair back from his desk it was on wheels and he let it bang into the wall behind his desk i got a guy waiting down there i could put in q with one hand tied to my balls and you come in here and want me to kick him loose bosch nodded if im wrong you could always charge him again but if im right hes going to try to plead guilty down there no trial no lawyer nothing he wants to plead and if the judge lets him then were done whoever really killed arthur is safe bosch looked over at edgar what do you think i think you got your mojo working portugal smiled but not because he found any humor in the situation two against one thats not fair theres two things we can do bosch said to help be sure hes probably down there in the holding tank by now we can go down there tell him it was sheila who gave us the id and flat out ask him if hes covering for her and ask him to take a polygraph theyre worthless we cant admit them in im not talking about court im talking about bluffing him if hes lying he wont take it portugal pulled his chair back to his desk he picked up the paper and glanced at the story for a moment his eyes then appeared to take a roving inventory of the desktop while he thought and came to a decision okay he finally said go do it im dropping the charge for now chapter bosch and edgar walked out to the elevator alcove and stood silently after edgar pushed the down button bosch looked at his blurred image reflected in the stainless steel doors of the elevator he looked over at edgars reflection and then directly at his partner so he said how pissed off are you somewhere between very and not too bosch nodded you really left me with my dick in my hand in there harry i know im sorry you want to just take the stairs have patience harry what happened to your cell phone last night you break it or something bosch shook his head no i just wanted toi wasnt sure of what i was thinking and so i wanted to check things out on my own first besides i knew you had the kid on thursday nights then running into sheila at the trailer that was out of left field what about when you started searching the place you coulda called my kid was back home asleep by then yeah i know i should have jed edgar nodded and that was the end of it you know this theory of yours puts us at ground zero now he said yeah ground zero were gonna have to start over look at everything again you going to work it this weekend yeah probably then call me i will finally boschs impatience got the better of him fuck it im taking the stairs ill see you down there he left the alcove and went to the emergency stairwell chapter through an assistant in sheila delacroixs office bosch and edgar learned that she was working out of a temporary production office on the westside where she was casting a television pilot called the closers bosch and edgar parked in a reserved lot full of jaguars and bmws and went into a brick warehouse that had been divided into two levels of offices there were paper signs taped on the wall that said casting and showed arrows pointing the way they went down a long hallway and then up a rear staircase when they reached the second floor they came into another long hallway that was lined with men in dark suits that were rumpled and out of style some of the men wore raincoats and fedoras some were pacing and gesturing and talking quietly to themselves bosch and edgar followed the arrows and turned into a large room lined with chairs holding more men in bad suits they all stared as the partners walked to a desk at the far end of the room where a young woman sat studying the names on a clipboard there were stacks of photos on the desk and script pages from beyond a closed door behind the woman bosch could hear the muffled sounds of tense voices they waited until the woman looked up from her clipboard we need to see sheila delacroix bosch said and your names detectives bosch and edgar she started to smile and bosch took out his badge and let her see it you guys are good she said did you get the sides already excuse me the sides and where are your head shots bosch put it together were not actors were real cops would you please tell her we need to see her right away the woman continued to smile is that real that cut on your cheek she said it looks real bosch looked at edgar and nodded toward the door simultaneously they went around both sides of her desk and approached the door hey shes taking a reading you cant bosch opened the door and stepped into a small room where sheila delacroix was sitting behind a desk watching a man seated on a folding chair in the middle of the room he was reading from a page of script a young woman was in the corner behind a video camera on a tripod in another corner two men sat on folding chairs watching the reading the man reading the script didnt stop when bosch and edgar entered the proofs in your pudding you mutt he said you left your dna all over the scene now get up and get against okay okay delacroix said stop there frank she looked up at bosch and edgar what is this the woman from the desk roughly pushed past bosch into the room im sorry sheila these guys just bullied their way in like theyre real cops or something we need to talk to you sheila bosch said right now im in the middle of a reading cant you see that i were in the middle of a murder investigation remember she threw a pen down on the desk and pushed her hands up through her hair she turned to the woman on the video camera which was now focused on bosch and edgar okay jennifer turn that off she said everybody i need a few minutes frank i am very sorry you were doing great can you stay and wait a few minutes i promise to take you first as soon as i am done frank stood up and smiled brilliantly no problem sheila ill be right outside everybody shuffled out of the room leaving bosch and edgar alone with sheila well she said after the door closed with an entrance like that you really should be actors she tried smiling but it didnt work bosch came over to the desk he remained standing edgar leaned his back against the door they had decided on the way over that bosch would handle her she said the show im casting is about two detectives called the closers because they have a perfect record of closing cases nobody else seems able to i guess theres no such thing in real life is there nobodys perfect bosch said not even close what is so important that you had to come bursting in here embarrassing me like that couple things i thought you might want to know that i found what you were looking for last night and i told you i wasnt your father was released from custody about an hour ago what do you mean released you said last night he wouldnt be able to make bail he wouldnt have been able to but hes not charged with the crime anymore but he confessed you said he well he deconfessed this morning that was after we told him we were going to put him on a polygraph machine and mentioned that it was you who called us up and gave us the tip that led to the id of your brother she shook her head slightly i dont understand i think you do sheila your father thought you killed arthur you were the one who hit him all the time who hurt him who put him in the hospital that time after hitting him with the bat when he disappeared your father thought maybe youd finally gone all the way and killed him then hidden the body he even went into arthurs room and got rid of that little bat in case you had used that again sheila put her elbows on the desk and hid her face in her hands so when we showed up he started confessing he was willing to take the fall for you to make up for what he did to you for this bosch reached into his pocket and took out the envelope containing the photos he dropped it onto the desk between her elbows she slowly lowered her hands and picked it up she didnt open the envelope she didnt have to hows that for a reading sheila you people is this what you do invade peoples lives like this i mean their secrets everything were the closers sheila sometimes we have to bosch saw a case of water bottles on the floor next to her desk he reached down and opened a bottle for her he looked at edgar who shook his head bosch got another bottle for himself pulled the chair frank had used close to her desk and sat down listen to me sheila you were a victim you were a kid he was your father he was strong and in control there is no shame for you in being a victim she didnt respond whatever baggage you carry with you now is the time to lose it to tell us what happened everything i think there is more than what you told us before were back at square one and we need your help this is your brother were talking about he opened the bottle and took a long draw of water for the first time he noticed how warm it was in the room sheila spoke while he took his second drink from the bottle i understand something now what is that she was staring down at her hands when she spoke it was like she was speaking to herself or to nobody after arthur was gone my father never touched me again i never i thought it was because i had become undesirable in some way i was overweight ugly i think now maybe it was because he was afraid of what he thought i had done or what i might be able to do she put the envelope back down on the desk bosch leaned forward again sheila is there anything else about that time about that last day that you didnt tell us before anything that can help us she nodded very slightly and then bowed her head hiding her face behind her raised fists i knew he was running away she said slowly and i didnt do anything to stop him bosch moved forward on the edge of the seat he spoke gently to her how so sheila there was a long pause before she answered when i came home from school that day he was there in his room so he did come home yes for a little bit his door was open a crack and i looked in he didnt see me he was putting things into his book bag clothes things like that i knew what he was doing he was packing and was going to run i just i went into my room and closed the door i wanted him to go i guess i hated him i dont know but i wanted him gone to me he was the cause of everything i just wanted him to be gone i stayed in my room until i heard the front door close she raised her face and looked at bosch her eyes were wet but bosch had often before seen that in a purging of guilt and truth came a strength he saw it in her eyes now i could have stopped him but i didnt and thats what ive had to live with now that i know what happened to him her eyes went off past bosch somewhere over his shoulder where she could see the wave of guilt coming toward her thank you sheila bosch said softly is there anything else you know that could help us she shook her head well leave you alone now he got up and moved the chair back to the spot in the middle of the room he then came back to the desk and picked up the envelope containing the polaroids he headed toward the office door and edgar opened it what will happen to him she asked they turned around and looked back edgar closed the door bosch knew she was talking about her father nothing he said what he did to you is long past any statute of limitation he goes back to his trailer she nodded without looking up at bosch sheila he may have been a destroyer at one time but time has a way of changing things its a circle it takes power away and gives it to those who once had none right now your father is the one who is destroyed believe me he cant hurt you anymore hes nothing what will you do with the photographs bosch looked down at the envelope in his hand and then back up at her they have to go into the file nobody will see them i want to burn them burn the memories she nodded bosch was turning to go when he heard her laugh and he looked back at her she was shaking her head what nothing its just that ive got to sit here and listen to people trying to talk and sound like you all day and i know right now nobody will come close nobody will get it right thats show business bosch said as they headed back down the hallway to the stairs bosch and edgar passed by all the actors again in the stairwell the one named frank was saying his lines out loud he smiled at the true detectives as they passed hey guys you guys are for real right how do you think i was doing in there bosch didnt answer you were great frank edgar said youre a closer man the proof is in the pudding chapter at two oclock friday afternoon bosch and edgar made their way through the squad room to the homicide table they had driven from the westside to hollywood in virtual silence it was the tenth day of the case they were no closer to the killer of arthur delacroix than they had been during all the years that arthur delacroixs bones had lain silently on the hillside above wonderland avenue all they had to show for their ten days was a dead cop and the suicide of an apparently reformed pedophile as usual there was a stack of pink phone messages left for bosch at his place there was also an interoffice dispatch envelope he picked up the envelope first guessing he knew what was in it about time he said he opened the envelope and slid his minicassette recorder out of it he pushed the play button to check the battery he immediately heard his own voice he lowered the volume and turned off the device he slipped it into his jacket pocket and dropped the envelope into the trash can by his feet he shuffled through the phone messages almost all were from reporters live by the media die by the media he thought he would leave it to the media relations office to explain to the world how a man who confessed to and was charged with a murder one day was exonerated and released the next you know bosch said to edgar in canada the cops dont have to tell the media jack about a case until its over its like a media blackout on every case plus theyve got that round bacon up there edgar replied whatre we doing here harry there was a message from the family counselor at the medical examiners office telling bosch that the remains of arthur delacroix had been released to his family for burial on sunday bosch put it aside so he could call back to find out about the funeral arrangements and which member of the family had claimed the remains he went back to the messages and came upon a pink slip that immediately gave him pause he leaned back in his chair and studied it a tightness coming over his scalp and going down the back of his neck the message came in at tenthirtyfive and was from a lieutenant bollenbach in the office of operationsthe o as it was more popularly known by the rank and file the o was where all personnel assignments and transfers were issued a decade before when bosch was moved to the hollywood division he had gotten the word after a forthwith from the o same thing with kiz rider going to rhd the year before bosch thought about what irving had said to him in the interview room three days earlier he guessed that the o was now about to begin an effort to achieve the deputy chiefs wish for boschs retirement he took the message as a sign he was being transferred out of hollywood his new assignment would likely involve some freeway therapya posting far from his home and requiring long drives each day to and from work it was a frequently used management tool for convincing cops they might be better off turning in the badge and doing something else bosch looked at edgar his partner was going through his own collection of phone messages none of which appeared to have stopped him the way the one in boschs hand had he decided not to return the call yet or to tell edgar about it he folded the message and put it in his pocket he took a look around the squad room at all the bustling activity of the detectives he would miss it if the new assignment wasnt a posting with the same kind of ebb and flow of adrenaline he didnt care about freeway therapy he could take the best punch they could give and not care what he did care about was the job the mission he knew that without it he was lost he went back to the messages the last one in the stack meaning it was the first one received was from antoine jesper in sid he had called at ten that morning shit bosch said what edgar said im going to have to go downtown i still have the dummy i borrowed last night in my trunk i think jesper needs it back he picked up the phone and was about to call sid when he heard his and edgars names called from the far end of the squad room it was lieutenant billets she signaled them to her office here we go edgar said as he got up harry you can have the honors you tell her where were at on this thing more like where we arent at bosch did in five minutes he brought billets completely up to date on the case and its latest reversal and lack of progress so where do we go from here she asked when he was finished we start over look at everything weve got see what we missed we go to the kids school see what records they have look at yearbooks try to contact classmates things like that billets nodded if she knew anything about the call from the o she wasnt letting on i think the most important thing is that spot up there on the hill bosch added how so i think the kid was alive when he got up there thats where he was killed we have to figure out what or who brought him up there were going to have to go back in time on that whole street profile the whole neighborhood its going to take time she shook her head well we dont have time to work it fulltime she said you guys just sat out of the rotation for ten days this isnt rhd thats the longest ive been able to hold a team out since i got here so were back in she nodded and right now its your upthe next case is yours bosch nodded he had assumed that was coming in the ten days theyd been working the case the two other hollywood homicide teams had both caught cases it was now their turn it was rare to get such a long ride on a divisional case anyway it had been a luxury too bad they hadnt turned the case he thought bosch also knew that by putting them back on the rotation billets was making a tacit acknowledgment that she wasnt expecting the case to clear with each day that a case stayed open the chances of clearing it dropped markedly it was a given in homicide and it happened to everybody there were no closers okay billets said anything else anybody wants to talk about she looked at bosch with a raised eyebrow he suddenly thought maybe she did know something about the call from the o he hesitated then shook his head along with edgar okay guys thanks they went back to the table and bosch called jesper the dummys safe he said when the criminalist picked up the phone ill bring it down later today cool man but that wasnt why i called i just wanted to tell you i can make a little refinement on that report i sent you on the skateboard that is if it still matters bosch hesitated for a moment not really but what do you want to refine antoine bosch opened the murder book in front of him and leafed through it until he found the sid report he looked at it as jesper spoke well in there i said we could put manufacture of the board between february of seventyeight and june of eightysix right right im looking at it okay well i can now cut more than half of that time period this particular board was made between seventyeight and eighty two years i dont know if that means anything to the case or not bosch scanned the report jespers amendment to the report didnt really matter since they had dropped trent as a suspect and the skateboard had never been linked to arthur delacroix but bosch was curious about it anyway howd you cut it down says here the same design was manufactured until eightysix it was but this particular board has a date on it nineteen eighty bosch was puzzled wait a minute where i didnt see any i took the trucks offyou know the wheels i had some time here between things and i wanted to see if there were any manufacture markings on the hardware you know patent or trademark coding there werent but then i saw that somebody had scratched the date in the wood like carved it in on the underside of the board and then it was covered up by the truck assembly you mean like when the board was made no i dont think so its not a professional job in fact it was hard to read i had to put it under glass and angled light i just think it was the original owners way of marking his board in a secret way in case there was ever a dispute or something over ownership like if somebody stole it from him like i said in the report boney boards were the choice board for a while there they were hard to getmightve been easier to steal one than find one in a store so the kid who had this one took off the back truckthis would have been the original truck not the current wheelsand carved in the date nineteen eighty ad bosch looked over at edgar he was on the phone speaking with his hand cupped over the mouthpiece a personal call you said ad yeah you know as in anno domini or however you say it its latin means the year of our lord i looked it up no it means arthur delacroix what whos that thats the vic antoine arthur delacroix as in ad damn i didnt have the vics name here bosch you filed all of this evidence while he was still a john doe and never amended it man i didnt even know you had an id bosch wasnt listening to him a surge of adrenaline was moving through his body he knew his pulse was quickening antoine dont move im coming down there ill be here chapter the freeway was crowded with people getting an early start on the weekend bosch couldnt keep his speed as he headed downtown he had a feeling of pulsing urgency he knew it was because of jespers discovery and the message from the o he turned his wrist on the wheel so he could see his watch and check the date he knew that transfers usually took place at the end of a pay period there were two pay periods a monthbeginning the first and the fifteenth if the transfer they were going to put on him was immediate he knew that gave him only three or four days to wrap up the case he didnt want to be taken off it to leave it in edgars or anybody elses hands he wanted to finish it bosch reached into his pocket and brought out the phone slip he unfolded it driving with the heels of his palms on the wheel he studied it for a moment and then got out his phone he punched in the number from the message and waited office of operations lieutenant bollenbach speaking bosch clicked the phone off he felt his face grow hot he wondered if bollenbach had caller id on his phone he knew that delaying the call was ridiculous because what was done was done whether he called in to get the news or not he put the phone and the message aside and tried to concentrate on the case particularly the latest information antoine jesper had provided about the skateboard found in nicholas trents house bosch realized that after ten days the case was wholly out of his grasp a man he had fought with others in the department to clear was now the only suspectwith apparent physical evidence tying him to the victim the thought that immediately poked through all of this was that maybe irving was right it was time for bosch to go his phone chirped and he immediately thought it was bollenbach he was not going to answer but then decided his fate was unavoidable he flipped open the phone it was edgar harry what are you doing i told you i had to go to sid he didnt want to tell him about jespers latest discovery until he had seen it for himself i couldve gone with you wouldve been a waste of your time yeah well listen harry bullets is looking for you and uh theres a rumor floatin around up here that you caught a transfer dont know anything about it well youre going to let me know if somethings happening arent you weve been together a long time youll be the first jerry when bosch got to parker center he had one of the patrolmen stationed in the lobby help him lug the dummy up to sid where he returned it to jesper who took it and carried it easily to its storage closet jesper led bosch into a lab where the skateboard was on an examination table he turned on a light that was mounted on a stand next to the board then turned off the overhead light he swung a mounted magnifying glass over the skateboard and invited bosch to look the angled light created small shadows in the etchings of the wood allowing the letters to be clearly seen ad bosch could definitely see why jesper had jumped to the conclusion he did about the letters especially since he did not have the case victims name it looks like somebody sanded it down jesper said while bosch continued to look i bet what happened was that the whole board was rehabbed at one point new trucks and new lacquer bosch nodded all right he said after straightening up from the magnifying glass im going to need to take this with me maybe show it to some people im done with it jesper said its all yours he turned the overhead light back on did you check under these other wheels course nothing there though so i put the truck back on you got a box or something oh i thought you were going to ride it out of here harry bosch didnt smile thats a joke yeah i know jesper left the room and came back with an empty cardboard file box that was long enough to contain the skateboard he put the skateboard in it along with the detached set of wheels and the screws which were in a small plastic bag bosch thanked him did i do good harry bosch hesitated and then said yeah i think so antoine jesper pointed to boschs cheek shaving something like that the drive back to hollywood was even slower on the freeway bosch finally bailed at the alvarado exit and worked his way over to sunset he took it the rest of the way in not making any better time and knowing it as he drove he kept thinking about the skateboard and nicholas trent trying to fit explanations into the framework of time and evidence that they had he couldnt do it there was a piece missing from the equation he knew that at some level and at some place it all made sense he was confident he would get there if he had enough time at fourthirty bosch banged through the back door into the station house carrying the file box containing the skateboard he was heading quickly down the hallway to the squad room when mankiewicz ducked his head into the hallway from the watch office hey harry bosch looked back at him but kept walking whats up i heard the news were gonna miss you around here the word traveled fast bosch held the box with his right arm and raised his left hand palm down and made a sweeping gesture across the flat surface of an imaginary ocean it was a gesture usually reserved for drivers of patrol cars passing on the street it said smooth sailing to you brother bosch kept going edgar had a large white board lying flat across his desk and covering most of boschs as well he had drawn what looked like a thermometer on it it was wonderland avenue the turnaround circle at the end being the bulb at the bottom of the thermometer from the street there were lines drawn signifying the various homes extending from these lines were names printed in green blue and black marker there was a red x that marked the spot where the bones had been found bosch stood and stared at the street diagram without asking a question we shouldve done this from the start edgar said hows it work the green names are residents in nineteen eighty who moved sometime after the blue names are anybody who came after eighty but has already left the black names are current residents anywhere you see just a black namelike guyot right herethat means theyve been there the whole time bosch nodded there were only two names in black dr guyot and someone named al hutter who was at the end of the street farthest from the crime scene good bosch said though he didnt know what use the chart would be now whats in the box edgar asked the skateboard jesper found something bosch put the box down on his desk and took off the top he told and showed edgar the scratched date and initials weve got to start looking at trent again maybe look at that theory you had about him moving into the neighborhood because he had buried the kid up there jesus harry i was almost joking about that yeah well its no joke now we have to go back put together a whole profile on trent going all the way back to nineteen eighty at least and meantime we catch the next case here thats real sweet i heard on the radio its supposed to rain this weekend if were lucky it will keep everybody inside and quiet harry inside is where most of the killing is done bosch looked across the squad room and saw lt billets standing in her office she was waving him in he had forgotten that edgar said she was looking for him he pointed a finger at edgar and then back at himself asking if she wanted to see them both billets shook her head and pointed back only at bosch he knew what it was about i gotta go see bullets edgar looked up at him he knew what it was about too good luck partner yeah partner if thats still the case he crossed the squad room to the lieutenants office she was now seated behind her desk she didnt look at him when she spoke harry youve got a forthwith from the ohthree call lieutenant bollenbach before you do anything else thats an order bosch nodded did you ask him where im going no harry im too pissed off about it i was afraid if i asked id get into it with him and its got nothing to do with him bollenbachs just the messenger bosch smiled youre pissed off thats right i dont want to lose you especially because of some bullshit grudge somebody up top has against you he nodded and shrugged thanks lieutenant why dont you call him on speakerphone well get this over with now she looked up at him you sure i could go get a coffee so you can have the office to yourself if you want its all right go ahead and make the call she put the phone on speaker and called bollenbachs office he answered right away lieutenant this is lieutenant billets i have detective bosch in my office very good lieutenant just let me find the order here there was the sound of papers rustling then bollenbach cleared his throat detective high heronyim is that hieronymus bosch said rhymes with anonymous hieronymus then detective hieronymus bosch you are ordered to report for duty at robberyhomicide division at oheighthundred january fifteen that is all are these orders clear to you bosch was stunned rhd was a promotion he had been demoted from rhd to hollywood more than ten years earlier he looked at billets who also had a look of suspicious surprise on her face did you say rhd yes detective robberyhomicide division are these orders clear whats my assignment i just told you you report at no i mean what do i do at rhd whats my assignment there youll have to get that from your new commanding officer on the morning of the fifteenth thats all i have for you detective bosch you have your orders have a nice weekend he clicked off and a dial tone came from the speaker bosch looked at billets what do you think is this some kind of a joke if it is its a good one congratulations but three days ago irving told me to quit then he turns around and sends me downtown well maybe its because he wants to watch you more closely they dont call parker center the glass house for nothing harry you better be careful bosch nodded on the other hand she said we both know you should be down there you shouldve never been taken out of there in the first place maybe its just the circle closing whatever it is were going to miss you ill miss you harry you do good work bosch nodded his thanks he made a move toward leaving but then looked back up at her and smiled youre not going to believe this especially in light of what just happened but were looking at trent again the skateboard sid found a link to the boy on it billets threw her head back and laughed loudly loud enough to draw the attention of everyone in the squad room well she said when irving hears that hes definitely going to change rhd to southeast division for sure her reference was to the ganginfested district at the far end of the city a posting that would be the pureform example of freeway therapy i wouldnt doubt it bosch said billets dropped the smile and got serious she asked bosch about the latest turn in the case and listened intently while he outlined the plan to put together what would basically be a fulllife profile on the dead set decorator ill tell you what she said when he was finished ill take you guys off rotation no sense in you pulling a new case if youre splitting for rhd im also authorizing weekend ot so work on trent and hit it hard and let me know youve got four days harry dont leave this one on the table when you go bosch nodded and left the office on his way back to his space he knew all eyes in the squad room were on him he gave nothing away he sat down at his space and kept his eyes down so edgar eventually whispered what did you get rhd rhd he had practically yelled it it would now be known to all in the squad room bosch felt his face getting red he knew everybody else would be looking at him jesus christ edgar said first kiz and now you what am i fucking chopped liver chapter kind of blue played on the stereo bosch held a bottle of beer and leaned back in the recliner with his eyes closed it had been a confusing day at the end of a confusing week he now just wanted to let the music move through him and clear out his insides he felt sure that what he was looking for he already had in his possession it was a matter of ordering things and getting rid of the unimportant things that cluttered the view he and edgar had worked until seven before deciding on an early night edgar couldnt concentrate the news of boschs transfer had affected him more deeply than it did bosch edgar perceived it as a slight against him because he wasnt chosen to go to rhd bosch tried to calm him by assuring him that it was a pit of snakes that bosch would be entering but it was no use bosch pulled the plug and told his partner to go home have a drink and get a good nights sleep they would work through the weekend gathering information on trent now it was bosch who was having the drink and falling asleep in his chair he sensed he was at a threshold of some sort he was about to begin a new and clearly defined time in his life a time of higher danger higher stakes and higher rewards it made him smile now that he knew no one was watching him the phone rang and bosch bolted upright he clicked off the stereo and went into the kitchen when he answered a womans voice told him to hold for deputy chief irving after a long moment irvings voice came on the line detective bosch yes you received your transfer orders today yes i did good i wanted to let you know that i made the decision to bring you back to robberyhomicide division why is that chief because i decided after our last conversation to hold out one last chance to you this assignment is that chance you will be in a position where i can watch your moves very closely what position is that you were not told i was just told to report to rhd next pay period that was it there was silence on the phone and bosch thought now he would find the sand in the engine oil he was going back to rhd but as what he tried to think what was the worst assignment within the best assignment irving finally spoke you are getting your old job back homicide special an opening came up today when detective thornton turned in his badge thornton that is correct ill be working with kiz rider that will be up to lieutenant henriques but detective rider is currently without a partner and you have an established working relationship with her bosch nodded the kitchen was dark he was elated but did not want to transmit his feelings over the phone to irving as if knowing these thoughts irving said detective you may feel as though you fell into the sewer but came out smelling like a rose do not think that do not make any assumptions do not make any mistakes if you do i will be there am i clear crystal clear irving hung up without another word bosch stood there in the dark holding the phone to his ear until it started making a loud annoying tone he hung up and went back into the living room he thought about calling kiz and seeing what she knew but decided he would wait when he sat back down on the recliner he felt something hard jab into his hip he knew it wasnt his gun because he had already unclipped it he reached into his pocket and came up with his minicassette recorder he turned it on and listened to his verbal exchange with surtain the tv reporter outside trents house on the night he killed himself filtering it through the history of what would happen bosch felt guilty and thought that maybe he should have done or said more in an effort to stop the reporter after he heard the car door slam on the tape he stopped it and hit the rewind button he realized that he had not yet heard the whole interview with trent because he had been out of earshot while searching some parts of the house he decided he would listen to the interview now it would be a starting point for the weekends investigation as he listened bosch tried to analyze the words and sentences for new meanings things that would reveal a killer all the while he was warring with his own instincts as he listened to trent speak in almost desperate tones he still felt convinced the man was not the killer that his protests of innocence had been true and this of course contradicted what he now knew the skateboardfound in trents househad the dead boys initials on it and the year he both got the skateboard and was killed the skateboard now served as a tombstone of sorts a marker for bosch he finished the trent interview but nothing in it including the parts he had not previously heard sparked any ideas in him he rewound the tape and decided to play it again and it was early in the second gothrough that he picked up on something that made his face suddenly grow hot almost with a feeling of being feverish he quickly reversed the tape and replayed the exchange between edgar and trent that had drawn his attention he remembered standing in the hallway in trents house and listening to this part of the interview but he had missed its significance until this moment did you like watching the kids play up there in the woods mr trent no i couldnt see them if they were up in the woods on occasion i would be driving up or walking my dogwhen he was aliveand i would see the kids climbing up there the girl across the street the fosters next door all the kids around here its a cityowned rightofwaythe only undeveloped land in the neighborhood so they went up there to play some of the neighbors thought the older ones went up there to smoke cigarettes and the concern was they would set the whole hillside on fire he turned off the tape and went back to the kitchen and the phone edgar answered after one ring bosch could tell he had not been asleep it was only nine oclock you didnt bring anything home with you did you like what the reverse directory lists no harry theyre at the office whats up i dont know do you remember when you were making that chart on the board today was there anybody named foster on wonderland foster you mean last name of foster yeah last name he waited edgar said nothing jerry you remember harry take it easy im thinking more silence um edgar finally said no foster none that i can remember how sure are you well harry come on i dont have the board or the lists here but i think i wouldve remembered that name why is it so important whats going on ill call you back bosch took the phone with him out to the dining room table where he had left his briefcase he opened it and took out the murder book he quickly turned to the page that listed the current residents of wonderland avenue with their addresses and phone numbers there were no fosters on the list he picked up the phone and punched in a number after four rings it was answered by a voice he recognized dr guyot this is detective bosch am i calling too late hello detective no its not too late for me i spent forty years getting phone calls at all hours of the night nine oclock nine oclock is for amateurs how are your various injuries theyre fine doctor im in a bit of a hurry and i need to ask you a couple questions about the neighborhood well go right ahead going way back nineteen eighty or so was there ever a family or a couple on the street named foster there was silence as guyot thought over the question no i dont think so he finally said i dont remember anybody named foster okay then can you tell me if there was anybody on the street that took in foster kids this time guyot answered without hesitation uh yes there was that was the blaylocks very nice people they helped many children over the years taking them in i admired them greatly bosch wrote the name down on a blank piece of paper at the front of the murder book he then flipped to the report on the neighborhood canvas and saw there was no one named blaylock currently living on the block do you remember their first names don and audrey what about when they moved from the neighborhood do you remember when that was oh that would have been at least ten years ago after the last child was grown they didnt need that big house anymore they sold it and moved any idea where they moved to are they still local guyot said nothing bosch waited im trying to remember guyot said i know i know this take your time doctor bosch said even though it was the last thing he wanted guyot to do oh you know what detective guyot said christmas i saved all the cards i received in a box so i know who to send cards to next year my wife always did that let me put the phone down and get the box audrey still sends me a card every year go get the box doctor ill wait bosch heard the phone being put down he nodded to himself he was going to get it he tried to think about what this new information could mean but then decided to wait he would gather the information and then sift through it after it took guyot several minutes to come back to the phone the whole time bosch waited with his pen poised to write the address on the note page okay detective bosch ive got it here guyot gave him the address and bosch almost sighed out loud don and audrey blaylock had not moved to alaska or some other far reach of the world they were still within a car drive he thanked guyot and hung up chapter at am saturday morning bosch was sitting in his slickback watching a small woodframe house a block off the main drag in the town of lone pine three hours north of los angeles in the foothills of the sierra nevadas he was sipping cold coffee from a plastic cup and had another one just like it ready to take over when he was finished his bones ached from the cold and a night spent driving and then trying to sleep in the car he had made it to the little mountain town too late to find a motel open he also knew from experience that coming to lone pine without a reservation on a weekend was not advisable anyway as dawns light came up he saw the bluegray mountain rising in the mist behind the town and reducing it to what it was insignificant in the face of time and the natural pace of things bosch looked up at mt whitney the highest point in california and knew it had been there long before any human eyes had ever seen it and would be there long after the last set was gone somehow it made it easier to know all that he knew bosch was hungry and wanted to go over to one of the diners in town for steak and eggs but he wouldnt leave his post if you moved from la to lone pine it wasnt just because you hated the crowds the smog and the pace of the big city it was because you also loved the mountain and bosch wasnt going to risk missing don and audrey blaylock to a morning mountain hike while he was eating breakfast he settled for turning the car on and running the heater for five minutes he had been parceling out the heat and the gas that way all night bosch watched the house and waited for a light to come on or someone to pick up the newspaper that had been dropped on the driveway from a passing pickup two hours earlier it was a thin roll of newspaper bosch knew it wasnt the la times people in lone pine didnt care about los angeles or its murders or its detectives at nine bosch saw smoke start to curl out of the houses chimney a few minutes later a man of about sixty wearing a down vest came out and got the paper after picking it up he looked a half block down the street to boschs car he then went back inside bosch knew his car stood out on the street he hadnt been trying to hide himself he was just waiting he started the car and drove down to the blaylocks house and pulled into the driveway when bosch got to the door the man he had seen earlier opened it before he had to knock mr blaylock yeah thats me bosch showed his badge and id i was wondering if i could talk to you and your wife for a few minutes its about a case im working you alone yeah how longve you been out there bosch smiled since about four got here too late to get a room come in we have coffee on if its hot ill take it he led bosch in and pointed him toward a seating arrangement of chairs and a couch near the fireplace ill get my wife and the coffee bosch stepped over to the chair nearest the fireplace he was about to sit down when he noticed all the framed photographs on the wall behind the couch he stepped over to study them they were all of children and young adults they were of all races two had obvious physical or mental handicaps the foster children he turned and took the seat closest to the fire and waited soon blaylock returned with a large mug of steaming coffee a woman came into the room behind him she looked a little bit older than her husband she had eyes still creased by sleep but a kind face this is my wife audrey blaylock said do you take your coffee black every cop i ever knew took it black the husband and wife sat next to each other on the couch blacks fine did you know a lot of cops when i was in la i did i worked thirty years for the city fire department quit as a station commander after the ninetytwo riots that was enough for me came in right before watts and left after ninetytwo what is it you want to talk to us about audrey asked seemingly impatient with her husbands small talk bosch nodded he had his coffee and the introductions were over i work homicide out of hollywood division im on a i worked six years out of fiftyeights blaylock said referring to the fire station that was behind the hollywood division station house bosch nodded again don let the man tell us why he came all the way up here audrey said sorry go ahead im on a case a homicide up in laurel canyon your old neighborhood actually and were contacting people who lived on the street back in nineteen eighty why then because that is when the homicide took place they looked at him with puzzled faces is this one of those cold cases blaylock said because i dont remember anything like that happening in our neighborhood back then in a way its a cold case only the body wasnt discovered until a couple weeks ago it had been buried up in the woods in the hills bosch studied their faces no tells just shock oh my god audrey said you mean all that time we were living there somebody was dead up there our kids used to play up there who was it who was killed it was a child a boy twelve years old his name was arthur delacroix does that name mean anything to either of you the husband and wife first searched their own memory banks and then looked at each other and confirmed the results each shaking their head no not that name don blaylock said where did he live audrey blaylock asked not in the neighborhood i dont think no he lived down in the miracle mile area it sounds awful audrey said how was he killed he was beaten to death if you dont mindi mean i know youre curious about it but i need to ask the questions starting out oh im sorry audrey said please go on what else can we tell you well we are trying to put together a profile of the streetwonderland avenueat that time you know so we know who was who and who was where its really routine bosch smiled and knew right away it didnt come off as sincere and its been pretty tough so far the neighborhood has sort of turned over a lot since then in fact dr guyot and a man down the street named hutter are the only residents still there since nineteen eighty audrey smiled warmly oh paul he is such a nice man we still get christmas cards from him even since his wife passed away bosch nodded of course he was too expensive for us we mostly took our kids to the clinics but if there was ever an emergency on a weekend or when paul was home he never hesitated some doctors these days are afraid to do anything because they might getim sorry im going off like my husband and thats not what you came here to hear its all right mrs blaylock um you mentioned your kids i heard from some of the neighbors that you two had a foster home is that right oh yes she said don and i took in children for twentyfive years thats a tremendous uh thing you did i admire that how many children was it it was hard to keep track of them we had some for years some for only weeks a lot of it was at the whim of the juvenile courts it used to break my heart when we were just getting started with a child you know making them feel comfortable and at home and then the child would be ordered home or to the other parent or what have you i always said that to do foster work you had to have a big heart with a big callus on it she looked at her husband and nodded he nodded back and reached over and took her hand he looked back at bosch we counted it up once he said we had a total of thirtyeight kids at one time or another but realistically we say we raised seventeen of them these were kids that were with us long enough for it to have an impact you know anywhere from two years toone child was with us fourteen years he turned so he could see the wall over the couch and reached up and pointed to a picture of a boy in a wheelchair he was slightly built and had thick glasses his wrists were bent at sharp angles his smile was crooked thats benny he said amazing bosch said he took a notebook out of his pocket and flipped it open to a blank page he took out a pen just then his cell phone started chirping thats me he said dont worry about it dont you want to answer it blaylock asked they can leave a message i didnt even think thered be clear service this close to the mountain yeah we even get tv bosch looked at him and realized he had somehow been insulting sorry i didnt mean anything i was wondering if you could tell me what children you had living in your home in nineteen eighty there was a moment when everyone looked at one another and said nothing is one of our kids involved in this audrey asked i dont know maam i dont know who was living with you like i said were trying to put together a profile of that neighborhood we need to know exactly who was living there and then well go from there well i am sure the division of youth services can help you bosch nodded actually they changed the name its now called the department of childrens services and theyre not going to be able to help us until monday at the earliest mrs blaylock this is a homicide we need this information now again there was a pause as they all looked at one another well don blaylock finally said its going to be kind of hard to remember exactly who was with us at any given time there are some obvious ones like benny and jodi and frances but every year wed have a few kids that like audrey said would be dropped in and then taken out theyre the tough ones lets see nineteen eighty he stood up and turned so he could see the breadth of the wall of photos he pointed to one a young black boy of about eight william there he was nineteen eighty he no he wasnt audrey said he came to us in eightyfour dont you remember the olympics you made him that torch out of foil oh yeah eightyfour bosch leaned forward in his seat the location near the fire was now getting too warm for him lets start with the three you mentioned benny and the two others what were their full names he was given their names and when he asked how they could be contacted he was given phone numbers for two of them but not benny benny passed away six years ago audrey said multiple sclerosis im sorry he was very dear to us bosch nodded and waited for an appropriate silence to go by um who else didnt you keep records of who came and for how long we did but we dont have them here blaylock said theyre in storage in la he suddenly snapped his fingers you know we have a list of the names of every child we tried to help or did help its just not by year we could probably cut it down a little bit but would that help you bosch noticed audrey give her husband a momentary look of anger her husband didnt see it but bosch did he knew her instincts would be to protect her children from the threat real or not that bosch represented yes that would help a lot blaylock left the room and bosch looked at audrey you dont want him to give me that list why is that mrs blaylock because i dont think you are being honest with us you are looking for something something that will fit your needs you dont drive three hours in the middle of the night from los angeles for a routine questioning as you call it you know these children come from tough backgrounds they werent all angels when they came to us and i dont want any of them blamed for something just because of who they were or where they came from bosch waited to make sure she was done mrs blaylock have you ever been to the mcclaren youth hall of course several of our children came from there i came from there too and an assortment of foster homes where i never lasted very long so i know what these children were like because i was one myself all right and i know that some foster homes can be full of love and some can be just as bad as or worse than the place you were taken from i know that some foster parents are committed to the children and some are committed to the subsistence checks from childrens services she was quiet a long moment before answering it doesnt matter she said you still are looking to finish your puzzle with any piece that fits youre wrong mrs blaylock wrong about that wrong about me blaylock came back into the room with what looked like a green school folder he placed it down on the square coffee table and opened it its pockets were stuffed with photos and letters audrey continued despite his return my husband worked for the city like you do so he wont want to hear me say this but detective i dont trust you or the reasons you say you are here you are not being honest with us audrey blaylock yelped the man is just trying to do his job and hell say anything to do it and hell hurt any of our children to do it audrey please he turned his attention back to bosch and offered a sheet of paper there was a list of handwritten names on it before bosch could read them blaylock took the page back and put it down on the table he went to work on it with a pencil putting check marks next to some of the names he spoke as he worked we made this list just so we could sort of keep track of everybody youd be surprised you can love somebody to death but when it comes time to remember twenty thirty birthdays you always forget somebody the ones im checking off here are the kids that came in more recent than nineteen eighty audrey will doublecheck when im done no i wont the men ignored her boschs eyes moved ahead of blaylocks pencil and down the list before he was twothirds to the bottom he reached down and put his finger on a name tell me about him blaylock looked up at bosch and then over at his wife who is it she asked johnny stokes bosch said you had him in your home in nineteen eighty didnt you audrey stared at him for a moment there you see she said to her husband while looking only at bosch he already knew about johnny when he came in here i was right hes not an honest man chapter by the time don blaylock went to the kitchen to brew a second pot of coffee bosch had two pages of notes on johnny stokes he had come to the blaylock house through a dys referral in january and was gone the following july when he was arrested for stealing a car and going on a joyride through hollywood it was his second arrest for car theft he was incarcerated at the sylmar juvenile hall for six months by the time his period of rehabilitation was completed he was returned by a judge to his parents though the blaylocks heard from him on occasion and even saw him during his infrequent visits to the neighborhood they had other children still in their care and soon drifted from contact with the boy when blaylock went to make the coffee bosch settled into what he thought would be an uncomfortable silence with audrey but then she spoke to him twelve of our children graduated from college she said two have military careers one followed don into the fire service he works in the valley she nodded at bosch and he nodded back weve never considered ourselves to be one hundred percent successful with our children she continued we did our best with each one sometimes the circumstances or the courts or the youth authorities prevented us from helping a child john was one of those cases he made a mistake and it was as if we were to blame he was taken from us before we could help him all bosch could do was nod you seemed to know of him already she said have you already spoken to him yes briefly is he in jail now no hes not what has his life been since we knew him bosch spread his hands apart he hasnt done well drugs a lot of arrests prison she nodded sadly do you think he killed that boy in our neighborhood while he was living with us bosch could tell by her face that if he were to answer truthfully he would knock down everything she had built out of what was good in what they had done the whole wall of pictures the graduation gowns and the good jobs would mean nothing next to this i dont really know but we do know he was a friend of the boy who was killed she closed her eyes not tightly just as if she were resting them she said nothing else until blaylock came back into the room he went past bosch and put another log on the fire coffee will be up in a minute thank you bosch said after blaylock walked back to the couch bosch stood up i have some things i would like you to look at if you dont mind theyre in my car he excused himself and went out to the slickback he grabbed his briefcase from the front seat and then went to the trunk to get the file box containing the skateboard he thought it might be worth a try showing it to the blaylocks his phone chirped just as he closed the trunk and this time he answered it it was edgar harry where are you up in lone pine lone pine what the fuck are you doing up there i dont have time to talk where are you at the table like we agreed i thought you listen ill call you back in an hour meantime put out a new bolo on stokes what bosch checked the house to make sure the blaylocks werent listening or in sight i said put out another bolo on stokes we need him picked up why because he did it he killed the kid what the fuck harry ill call you in an hour put out the bolo he hung up and this time turned the phone off inside the house bosch put the file box down on the floor and then opened his briefcase on his lap he found the envelope containing the family photos borrowed from sheila delacroix he opened it and slid them out he split the stack in two and gave onehalf to each of the blaylocks look at the boy in these pictures and tell me if you recognize him if he ever came to your house with johnny or anybody else he watched as the couple looked at the photos and then exchanged stacks when they were finished they both shook their heads and handed the photos back dont recognize him don blaylock said okay bosch said as he put the photos back into the envelope he closed his briefcase and put it on the floor he then opened the file box and lifted out the skateboard has either of you that was johns audrey said are you sure yes i recognize it when he was taken from us he left it behind i told him we had it i called his house but he never came for it how do you know that this is the one that was his i just remember i didnt like the skull and crossbones i remember those bosch put the skateboard back in the box what happened to it if he never came for it we sold it audrey said when don retired after thirty years and we decided to move up here we sold all of our junk we had a gigantic garage sale more like a house sale her husband added we got rid of everything not everything you wouldnt sell that stupid fire bell we have in the backyard anyway that was when we sold the skateboard do you remember who you sold it to yes the man who lived next door mr trent when was this summer of ninetytwo right after we sold the house we were still in escrow i remember why do you remember selling the skateboard to mr trent ninetytwo was a long time ago i remember because he bought half of what we were selling the junky half he gathered it all up and offered us one price for everything he needed it all for his work he was a set designer set decorator her husband corrected there is a difference anyway he used everything he bought from us on movie sets i always hoped i would see something in a movie that id know came from our house but i never did bosch scribbled some notes in his pad he had just about everything he needed from the blaylocks it was almost time to head south back to the city to put the case together how did you get the skateboard audrey asked him bosch looked up from his notepad uh it was in mr trents possessions hes still on the street don blaylock asked he was a great neighbor never a problem at all with him he was until recently bosch said he passed away though oh my gosh audrey proclaimed what a shame and he wasnt that old a man i just have a couple more questions bosch said did john stokes ever tell either of you how he came to have the skateboard he told me that he had won it during a contest with some other boys at school audrey said the brethren school yes thats where he went he was going when he first came to us and so we continued it bosch nodded and looked down at his notes he had everything he closed the notebook put it in his coat pocket and stood up to go chapter bosch pulled the car into a space in front of the lone pine diner the booths by all the windows were filled and almost all of the people in them looked out at the lapd car two hundred miles from home he was starved but knew he needed to talk to edgar before delaying any further he took out the cell phone and made the call edgar answered after half a ring its me did you put the bolo out yeah its out but its a little hard to do when you dont know what the fuck is going on partner he said the last word as if it was a synonym for asshole it was their last case together and bosch felt bad that they were going to end their time this way he knew it was his fault he had cut edgar out of the case for reasons bosch wasnt even sure about jerry youre right he said i fucked up i just wanted to keep things moving and that meant driving through the night i wouldve gone with you i know bosch lied i just didnt think i just drove im coming back now well start at the beginning so i know what the fuck is going on in our own case i feel like a moron here putting out a bolo and not even knowing why i told you stokes is the guy yeah you told me that and you didnt tell me anything else bosch spent the next ten minutes watching diners eat their food while he recounted his moves for edgar and brought him up to date jesus christ and we had him right here edgar said when bosch was finished yeah well its too late to worry about that we have to get him back so youre saying that when the kid packed up and ran away he went to stokes then stokes leads him up there into the woods and just kills him more or less why thats what we have to ask him ive got a theory though what the skateboard yeah he wanted the skateboard hed kill a kid over a skateboard weve both seen it done for less and we dont know if he intended to kill him or not it was a shallow grave dug by hand nothing premeditated about that maybe he just pushed him and knocked him down maybe he hit him with a rock maybe there was something else going on between them we dont even know about edgar didnt say anything for a long moment and bosch thought maybe they were finished and he could get some food what did the foster parents think about your theory bosch sighed i didnt really spin it for them but put it this way they werent too surprised when i started asking questions about stokes you know something harry weve been spinning our wheels is what weve been doing what do you mean this whole case it comes down to whata thirteenyearold killing a twelveyearold over a fucking toy stokes was a juvy when this went down aint nobody going to prosecute him now bosch thought about this for a moment they might depends on what we get out of him after we pick him up you just said yourself there was no sign of premed theyre not going to file it partner im telling you weve been chasing our tail we close the case but nobody goes away for it bosch knew edgar was probably right under the law it was rare that adults were prosecuted for crimes committed while they were juveniles as young as thirteen even if they pulled a full confession out of stokes he would probably walk i should have let her shoot him he whispered whats that harry nothing im going to grab something to eat and get on the road you going to be there yeah im here ill let you know if anything happens all right he hung up and got out of the car thinking about the likelihood of stokes walking away from his crime as he entered the warm diner and was hit with the smells of grease and breakfast he suddenly realized he had lost his appetite chapter bosch was just coming down out of the squiggle of treacherous freeway called the grapevine when his phone chirped it was edgar harry ive been trying to call you where yat i was in the mountains im less than an hour out whats going on theyve got a fix on stokes hes squatting in the usher bosch thought about this the usher was a s hotel a block off hollywood boulevard for decades it was a weekly flophouse and prostitution center until redevelopment on the boulevard pushed up against it and suddenly made it a valuable property again it was sold closed and readied to go through a major renovation and restoration that would allow it to rejoin the new hollywood as an elegant grand dame but the project had been delayed by city planners who held final approval and in that delay was an opportunity for the denizens of the night while the hotel usher awaited rebirth the rooms on its thirteen floors became the homes of squatters who snuck past the fences and plywood barriers to find shelter in the previous two months bosch had been inside the usher twice while searching for suspects there was no electricity there was no water but the squatters used the toilets anyway and the place smelled like an aboveground sewer there were no doors on any of the rooms and no furniture people used rolledup carpets in the rooms as their beds it was a nightmare to try to search safely you moved down the hall and every doorway was open and a possible blind for a gunman you kept your eyes on the openings and you might step on a needle bosch flipped on the cars emergency lights and put his foot hard on the pedal how do we know hes in there he asked from last week when we were looking for him some guys in narcs were working something in there and got a line on him squatting all the way up on the thirteenth floor you gotta be scared of something to go all the way to the top in a place with the elevators shut down okay whats the plan were going to go in big four teams from patrol me and the narcs we start at the bottom and work our way up when do you go were about to go into roll call now and talk it out then we go we cant wait for you harry we have to take this guy before he gets out and about bosch wondered for a moment if edgars hurry was legitimate or simply an effort to get even with bosch for his cutting him out of several of the investigative moves on the case i know he finally said you going to have a rover with you yeah were using channel two okay ill see you there put your vest on he said the last not because he was concerned about stokes being armed but because he knew a heavily armed team of cops in the enclosed confinement of a dark hotel hallway had danger written all over it bosch closed the phone and pushed the pedal down even harder soon he crossed the northern perimeter of the city and was in the san fernando valley saturday traffic was light he switched freeways twice and was cruising through the cahuenga pass into hollywood a half hour after hanging up with edgar as he exited onto highland he could see the hotel usher rising a few blocks to the south its windows were uniformly dark the curtains stripped out in preparation for the work ahead bosch had no rover with him and had forgotten to ask edgar where the command post for the search would be located he didnt want to simply drive up to the hotel in his slickback and risk exposing the operation he took out his phone and called the watch office mankiewicz answered mank you ever take a day off not in january my kids celebrate christmas and chanukah i need the ot whats up can you get me the cp location on the thing at the usher yeah its the parking lot at hollywood presbyterian got it thanks two minutes later bosch pulled into the church parking lot there were five squad cars parked there along with a slickback and a narc car the cars were parked up close to the church so that they were shielded from view of the windows of the usher which rose into the sky on the other side of the church two officers sat in one of the patrol cars bosch parked and walked over to the driver side window the car was running bosch knew it was the pickup car when the others grabbed stokes in the usher a radio call would go out for the pickup they would drive over and pick up the prisoner where are they twelfth floor said the driver nothing yet let me borrow your rover the cop handed his radio out the window to bosch bosch called edgar on channel two harry you here yeah im coming up were almost done im still coming up he gave the radio back to the driver and started walking out of the parking lot when he got to the construction fence that surrounded the usher property he went to the north end where he knew he would find the seam in the fence the squatters used to get in it was partially hidden behind a construction sign announcing the arrival soon of historic luxury apartments he pulled back the loose fence and ducked through there were two main staircases at either end of the building bosch assumed there would be a team of uniform officers posted at the bottom of each in case stokes somehow slipped through the search and tried to escape bosch took out his badge and held it up and out as he opened the exterior stairwell door on the east side of the building as he stepped into the stairwell he was met by two officers who held their weapons out and at their sides bosch nodded and the cops nodded back bosch started up the stairs he tried to pace himself each floor had two runners of stairs and a landing for the turn he had twentyfour to climb the smell from the overflowing toilets was stifling and all he could think about was what edgar had told him about all odors being particulate sometimes knowledge was an awful thing the hallway doors had been removed and with them the floor markings though someone had taken it upon himself to paint numbers on the walls of the lower landings as bosch got higher the markings disappeared and he lost count and became unsure what floor he was on at either the ninth or tenth floor he took a breather he sat down on a reasonably clean step and waited for his breathing to become more regular the air was cleaner this high up fewer squatters used the upper floors of the building because of the climb bosch listened but he heard no human sounds he knew the search teams had to be on the top floor by now he was wondering if the tip on stokes had been wrong or if the suspect had slipped out finally he stood and started up again a minute later he realized he had counted wrongbut in his favor he stepped up onto the last landing and the open door of the penthousethe thirteenth floor he blew out his breath and almost smiled at the prospect of not having to climb another set of stairs when he heard shouts coming from the hallway there right there stokes no police free two quick and brutally loud gunshots sounded and echoed down the hall obliterating the voices bosch drew his gun and quickly moved to the doorway as he began to peek around the jamb he heard two more shots and pulled back the echo prevented him from identifying the origin of the shots he leaned around the jamb again and looked into the hallway it was dark with light slashing through it from the doorways of the rooms on the west side he saw edgar standing in a combat crouch behind two uniformed officers their backs were to bosch and their weapons were pointed at one of the open doorways they were fifty feet down the hall from bosch clear a voice yelled were clear in here the men in the hall raised their weapons up in unison and moved toward the open doorway lapd in the back bosch yelled and then stepped into the hallway edgar glanced back at him as he followed the two uniforms into the room bosch walked quickly down the hallway and was about to enter the room when he had to step back to let a uniform officer out he was talking on his rover central we need paramedics to fortyone highland thirteenth floor suspect down gunshot wounds as bosch entered the room he looked back the cop on the rover was edgewood their eyes locked for just a moment and then edgewood disappeared into the shadows of the hallway bosch turned back to view the room stokes was sitting in a closet that had no door he was leaning back against the rear wall his hands were in his lap one holding a small gun a caliber pocket rocket he wore black jeans and a sleeveless tshirt that was covered with his own blood he had entry wounds on his chest and right below his left eye his eyes were open but he was clearly dead edgar was squatted in front of the body he didnt touch it there was no use trying for a pulse and everybody knew it the smell of burnt cordite invaded boschs nose and it was a welcome relief from the smell outside the room bosch turned around to take in the whole room there were too many people in the small space there were three uniforms edgar and a plainclothes bosch assumed was a narc two of the uniforms were huddled together at the far wall studying two bullet holes in the plaster one raised a finger and was about to probe one of the holes dont touch that bosch barked dont touch anything i want everybody to back out of here and wait for ois who fired a weapon edge did it said the narc the guy was waitin for us in the closet and we excuse me whats your name phillips okay phillips i dont want to hear your story save it for ois go get edgewood and go back downstairs and wait when the paramedics get here tell them never mind save them a trip up the steps the cops reluctantly shuffled out of the room leaving only bosch and edgar edgar got up and walked over to the window bosch went to the corner farthest from the closet and looked back at the body he then approached the body and squatted down in the same spot where edgar had been he studied the gun in stokess hand he assumed that when it was removed from the hand ois investigators would find the serial number had been burned away by acid he thought about the shots he had heard while on the stairway landing two and two it was hard to judge them by memory especially considering his position at the time but he thought the first two rounds had been louder and heavier than the second two if that was so it would mean stokes had fired his little popper after edgewood had fired his service weapon it would mean stokes had gotten off two shots after he had been hit in the face and chestwounds that appeared instantly fatal to bosch what do you think edgar had come up behind him it doesnt matter what i think bosch said hes dead its an ois case now what it is is a closed case partner i guess we didnt have to worry about whether the da would file the case after all bosch nodded he knew there would be wrapup investigation and paperwork but the case was finished it would ultimately be classified as closed by other means meaning no trial and no conviction but carried in the solved column just the same guess not he said edgar swatted him on the shoulder our last case together harry we go out on top yeah tell me something did you mention the da and about it being a juvy case during the briefing in the rollcall room this morning after a long moment edgar said yeah i mightve mentioned something about it did you tell them we were spinning our wheels the way you said it to me that the da probably wouldnt even file a case on stokes yeah i mightve said it like that why bosch didnt answer he stood up and walked over to the rooms window he could see the capitol records building and farther past it the hollywood sign up on the crest of the hill painted on the side of a building a few blocks away was an antismoking sign showing a cowboy with a drooping cigarette in his mouth accompanied by a warning about cigarettes causing impotence he turned back to edgar you going to hold the scene until ois gets here yeah sure theyre going to be pissed off about having to hump the thirteen floors bosch headed toward the door where are you going harry bosch walked out of the room without answering he used the stairwell at the farthest end of the hallway so that he wouldnt catch up to the others as he was going down chapter the living members of what had once been a family stood as points of a hardedged triangle with the grave in the middle they stood on a sloping hillside in forest lawn samuel delacroix on one side of the coffin while his exwife stood across from him sheila delacroixs spot was at the end of the coffin opposite the preacher the mother and daughter had black umbrellas open against the light drizzle that had been falling since dawn the father had none he stood there getting wet and neither woman made a move to share her protection with him the sound of the rain and the freeway hissing nearby drowned out most of what the rented preacher had to say before it got to bosch he had no umbrella either and watched from a distance and the protection of an oak tree he thought that it was somehow appropriate that the boy should be formally buried on a hill and in the rain he had called the medical examiners office to find out which funeral home was handling the service and it had led him to forest lawn he had also learned that it had been the boys mother who had claimed the remains and planned the service bosch came to the funeral for the boy and because he wanted to see the mother again arthur delacroixs coffin looked like it had been made for an adult it was polished gray with brushed chrome handles as coffins went it was beautiful like a newly waxed car the rain beaded on its surface and then slid down into the hole beneath but it was still too big for those bones and somehow that bothered bosch it was like seeing a child in illfitting clothes obvious handmedowns it always seemed to say something about the child that they were wanting that they were second when the rain started coming down harder the preacher raised an umbrella from his side and held his prayer book with one hand a few of his lines managed to drift over to bosch intact he was talking about the greater kingdom that had welcomed arthur it made bosch think of golliher and his unfaltering faith in that kingdom despite the atrocities he studied and documented every day for bosch though the jury was still out on all of that he was still a dweller in the lesser kingdom bosch noticed that none of the three family members looked at one another after the coffin was lowered and the preacher made the final sign of the cross sheila turned and started walking down the slope to the parking road she had never once acknowledged her parents samuel immediately followed and when sheila looked back and saw him coming after her she picked up speed finally she just dropped the umbrella and started running she made it to her car and drove away before her father could catch up samuel watched his daughters car cutting through the vast cemetery until it disappeared through the gate he then went back and picked up the discarded umbrella he took it to his own car and left as well bosch looked back at the burial site the preacher was gone bosch looked about and saw the top of a black umbrella disappearing over the crest of the hill bosch didnt know where the man was going unless he had another funeral to officiate on the other side of the hill that left christine waters at the grave bosch watched her say a silent prayer and then walk toward the two remaining cars on the road below he chose an angle of intersection and headed that way as he got close she calmly looked at him detective bosch i am surprised to see you here why is that arent detectives supposed to be aloof not get emotionally involved showing up at a funeral shows emotional attachment dont you think especially rainyday funerals he fell into stride next to her and she gave him half of the umbrellas protection why did you claim the remains he asked why did you do this he gestured back toward the grave on the hill because i didnt think anybody else would they got to the road boschs car was parked in front of hers goodbye detective she said as she broke from him walked between the cars and went to the drivers door of hers i have something for you she opened the car door and looked back at him what he opened his door and popped the trunk he walked back between the cars she closed her umbrella and threw it into her car and then came over somebody once told me that life was the pursuit of one thing redemption the search for redemption for what for everything anything we all want to be forgiven he raised the trunk lid and took out a cardboard box he held it out to her take care of these kids she didnt take the box instead she lifted the lid and looked inside there were stacks of envelopes held together by rubber bands there were loose photos on top was the photo of the boy from kosovo who had the thousandyard stare she reached into the box where are they from she asked as she lifted an envelope from one of the charities it doesnt matter he said somebody has to take care of them she nodded and carefully put the lid back on she took the box from bosch and walked it back to her car she put it on the backseat and then went to the open front door she looked at bosch before getting in she looked like she was about to say something but then she stopped she got in the car and drove away bosch closed the trunk of his car and watched her go chapter the edict of the chief of police was once again being ignored bosch turned on the squad room lights and went to his spot at the homicide table he put down two empty cardboard boxes it was late sunday near midnight hed decided to come in and clear out his desk and files when no one else would be around to watch he still had one more day in hollywood division but he didnt want to spend it packing boxes and exchanging insincere goodbyes with anyone his plan was to have a clean desk at the start of the day and a threehour lunch at musso amp franks to end it hed say a few goodbyes to those who mattered and then slip out the back door before anyone even knew he was gone it was the only way to do it he started with his file cabinet taking the murder books of the open cases that still kept him awake some nights he wasnt giving up on them just yet his plan was to work the cases during the downtimes in rhd or to work them at home alone with one box full he turned to his desk and started emptying the file drawers when he pulled out the mason jar full of bullet shells he paused he had not yet put the shell collected at julia brashers funeral into the jar instead he had put that one on a shelf in his home next to the picture of the shark he would always keep there as a reminder of the perils of leaving the safety cage her father had allowed him to take it he carefully put the jar into the corner of the second box and made sure it was held secure by the other contents he then opened the middle drawer and started collecting all the pens and pads and other office supplies old phone messages and business cards from people he had met on cases were scattered throughout the drawer bosch checked each one before deciding whether to keep it or drop it into the trash can after he had a stack of keepers he put a rubber band around it and dropped it into the box when the drawer was almost clear he pulled out a folded piece of paper and opened it there was a message on it where are you tough guy bosch studied it for a long time soon it made him think about all that had happened since he had pulled his car to a stop on wonderland avenue just thirteen days before it made him think about what he was doing and where he was going it made him think of trent and stokes and most of all arthur delacroix and julia brasher it made him think about what golliher had said while studying the bones of the murder victims from millenniums ago and it made him know the answer to the question on the piece of paper nowhere he said out loud he folded the paper and put it in the box he looked down at his hands at the scars across the knuckles he ran the fingers of one hand across the markings on the other he thought about the interior scars left from punching all of the brick walls he couldnt see he had always known that he would be lost without his job and his badge and his mission in that moment he came to realize that he could be just as lost with it all in fact he could be lost because of it the very thing he thought he needed the most was the thing that drew the shroud of futility around him he made a decision he reached into his back pocket and took out his badge wallet he slid the id card out from behind the plastic window and then unclipped the badge he ran his thumb along the indentations where it said detective it felt like the scars on his knuckles he put the badge and the id card in the desk drawer he then pulled his gun from its holster looked at it for a long moment and put it in the drawer too he closed the drawer and locked it with a key he stood up and walked through the squad room to billetss office the door was unlocked he put the key to his desk drawer and the key to his slickback down on her blotter when he didnt show up in the morning he was sure she would get curious and check out his desk shed then understand that he wasnt coming back not to hollywood division and not to rhd he was turning in his badge going code he was done on the walk back through the squad room bosch looked about and felt a wave of finality move through him but he didnt hesitate at his desk he put one box on top of the other and carried them out through the front hallway he left the lights on behind him after he passed the front desk he used his back to push open the heavy front door of the station he called to the officer sitting behind the counter hey do me a favor call a cab for me you got it but with the weather it might be a while you might want to wait in the door closed cutting off the cops voice bosch walked out to the curb it was a crisp wet night there was no sign of the moon beyond the cloud cover he held the boxes against his chest and waited in the rain authors note in the bones of a female homicide victim were recovered from the la brea tar pits in los angeles the bones were nine thousand years old making the woman the earliest known murder victim in the place now known as los
